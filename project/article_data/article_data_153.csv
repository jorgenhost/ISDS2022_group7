Heidi Heitkamp didn't high-five Chuck Schumer following abortion vote
","A headline on a North Dakota political blog wrongly said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., high-fived Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., following a controversial abortion vote. ""Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban,"" the headline reads. The vote in question was to proceed to a motion that would make nearly all abortions after 20 weeks illegal and subject anyone who performed the procedure to prison time or fines. The 51-46 yea-to-nay vote fell below the filibuster threshold of 60 votes, and Heitkamp’s vote was one of those nays. But did Heitkamp follow up her vote with a celebratory high-five with the Senate minority leader? The main image, a screen grab from C-SPAN, certainly makes it seem that way. But the video, which is embedded in the story, shows more of an awkward greeting than a crude celebration.  The footage shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber as she converses with Cory Booker, D-N.J.. She responds to the clerk’s roll call in the negative, and resumes chatting. As they speak, Schumer approaches Booker and Heitkamp, and Heitkamp catches his eye. They each wave hello with their hands up, and Heitkamp reaches her hand out to meet Schumer’s as he lands at their side. They clasp hands, exchange a few inaudible words, and let go as Booker pats Schumer’s shoulder. The vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally. Typical high fives involve slapping of two hands in celebration. This was a very gradual meeting of awkwardly waving hands. ""They were greeting each other to say hello, as senators often do during votes,"" said Abigail McDonough, Heitkamp’s communications director. Justin Goodman, Schumer’s press secretary, confirmed the senators did not speak about the vote when they greeted each other. The vote was held on a Monday night, so it was the first time a lot of the senators would have seen each other since the previous week. Rob Port, the editor of the blog, did not provide any evidence that the hand-gesture was about the vote. ""Looked like a high five to me, but the video speaks for itself I think,"" Port said. The clip was generated by a C-SPAN user, who titled it ""Heitkamp & Schumer High-Five Over Abortion Vote."" Tom Campbell, Heitkamp’s Republican challenger, posted the clip to his Facebook page three hours before the SayAnythingBlog post was published. A SayAnythingBlog.com headline said, ""Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban."" The headline suggests the celebration of a pro-abortion victory, but that’s not what the footage shows. The video shows an awkward hand waving-turned-holding between Schumer and Heitkamp on a Monday night. Both senators said they did not mention the vote on the floor, and that they were simply greeting each other. Port provided no evidence that the two were celebrating the vote.

Ohio Democrats lack proof that AG Mike DeWine 'stifled' sexual harassment investigation
","Ohio Democrats have attacked Attorney General Mike DeWine about his role in a sexual harassment investigation in his office in 2013. The unnamed accuser would never identify the alleged harasser. Ultimately, multiple investigations were closed without any action. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a Jan. 4 press release that DeWine failed to provide a safe workplace for employees ""when he interfered with and stifled an investigation of sexual harassment allegedly involving a member of his inner circle, and then he eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims within the AG’s office."" Pepper lost his bid to unseat DeWine as Attorney General in 2014. Democrats attacked DeWine for his role in the investigation that year, too. The Democrats are rehashing the attack this year since DeWine is running in the May 8 Republican primary for governor. We found no evidence that DeWine ""stifled"" the investigation. We also found that while DeWine did eliminate the position of an officer who investigated sexual harassment, he also established a new procedure for investigating such complaints. In August 2014, the Sandusky Register reported that DeWine played a role in an investigation the previous year involving allegations that an employee in the Attorney General’s office had sexually harassed an intern. A spokesman for DeWine sent PolitiFact the 118-page investigative file which included the steps taken through three investigations: first by the Attorney General’s human resources office, then by the Franklin County prosecutor and finally by the Attorney General’s equal employment opportunity compliance officer. The file includes summaries of witness statements and conclusions by investigators. Throughout the process, the accuser declined to name the alleged harasser, even to investigators, and gave conflicting reports about what happened. The accuser’s attorney, Ritchey Hollenbaugh, told PolitiFact that the accuser did not want to be interviewed. Here is a summary of what happened, according to the investigative file: The law student started as an intern in 2011 and accepted a full-time position in November 2012, pending completion of the bar exam. But in April 2013, she withdrew her acceptance citing personal reasons. A supervisor who had spoken to the woman told human resources that it sounded like the woman had been sexually harassed by a ""higher up"" who was close to DeWine. The Attorney General’s office contacted the woman to obtain more information, but she would not name the alleged harasser. She initially said that the relationship with the man was sexual in nature but in a subsequent interview she said she must have made a mistake by stating it was sexual. Shortly after the investigation started, the accuser hired an attorney and declined to provide more information. On April 22, 2013, DeWine’s office turned over the case to the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Ron O’Brien. About a month later, the woman met with O’Brien after he threatened a grand jury subpoena if she didn’t cooperate. The woman described incidents involving an employee that were ""creepy,"" such as sitting very close to her or putting his hand on her shoulder. She denied that he touched her in a sexual way, according to O’Brien’s memo. The woman told O’Brien that after she backed out of the job, she felt compelled to provide an explanation and provided misinformation. O’Brien concluded he had no prosecutable case. Next, the matter was investigated by Kristine Cadek, the Attorney General’s equal employment opportunity compliance officer. Cadek launched her investigation in June in 2013. At this point, the accuser still hadn’t named the person who allegedly harassed her, but a confidential informant had come forward with the harasser's identity. Cadek interviewed about two dozen employees ending with DeWine. He asked her to provide the name of a confidential informant, which she was reluctant to do, but she did. Ultimately, she found informant’s information was unsubstantiated. DeWine’s office spokesman, Dan Tierney, told PolitiFact that DeWine asked for the name to make sure every possible step had been taken. Cadek closed her investigation on Aug 8, 2013. ""I could find no evidence to substantiate (the woman’s) claim and, without her cooperation, and absent any evidence or any identification of the alleged harasser, this case is closed,"" she wrote. This part of Pepper’s attack relates to what happened to Cadek’s position about a year after she closed her investigation. In 2014, the position of compliance officer disappeared when Cadek was transferred to a new job. Cadek was promoted to the position of crime victims claims lead investigator and received a pay raise of $3,640, Tierney said. (Cadek resigned in 2016 when she took another job.) Instead of filling the compliance officer position, DeWine changed the procedure to have an outside law firm investigate employment complaints. At least 10 internal employment investigations -- including two about sexual harassment -- have been assigned to the lawyer since December 2014. The Ohio Democratic Party said that DeWine ""interfered with and stifled an investigation of sexual harassment allegedly involving a member of his inner circle, and then he eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims within the AG’s office."" The evidence cited by the Democrats does not show that DeWine interfered or stifled the investigation. There were three investigations -- one by human resources in his office, one by a prosecutor and then one by DeWine’s compliance officer. All three investigations were closed after the woman declined to identify the accuser, even to investigators. There is a kernel of evidence related to the Democrats’ attack that DeWine eliminated the office that investigated harassment claims. A little more than a year after Cadek closed her investigation, she was promoted into another job. Rather than fill the position, DeWine changed the procedure for investigating such complaints by outsourcing them to a law firm.

"['Housing', 'Illinois', 'Chris Kennedy']","
Did Chris Kennedy need to add affordable housing at his luxury properties?
","Democratic governor candidate Chris Kennedy stoked controversy recently by accusing Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel of pushing policies that priced low-income minority residents out of the city. But Kennedy then found himself attacked for hypocrisy by one of his rivals in the governor’s race. State Sen. Daniel Biss of Evanston claimed Kennedy, a developer, had skirted city affordable housing requirements at Wolf Point West, a downtown luxury high-rise in which Kennedy controls a key stake. In response, Kennedy told Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell, ""there was no requirement to put in affordable housing,"" saying the Wolf Point property was zoned in 1973, decades before the city implemented its affordable housing ordinance. ""It is nearly impossible when a building is 70 stories tall to create affordable housing because the construction cost itself is probably three times more expensive,"" Kennedy also said. ""We created a river walk. We created a public park. We did all the things that would make us good neighbors and good corporate citizens."" Chicago’s affordable housing ordinance wasn’t enacted until 2003, 30 years after the land was initially zoned, so Kennedy’s claim he was under no legal mandate makes sense on its face. But the property remained largely undeveloped for those 30 years and its zoning was amended by the city in 2013 before construction began on the tower. That made us wonder, could the zoning amendment have triggered requirements to set aside some units for affordable housing? And even if not, is creating affordable housing really as cost-prohibitive as Kennedy says? We decided to take a deeper look. The land on which the Wolf Point tower stands, purchased by Kennedy’s wealthy investor grandfather in the 1940s, was originally zoned in 1973 as Kennedy said. In the intervening years, the property at the intersection of the Chicago River’s three branches near the Merchandise Mart long was used as a parking facility before plans for the tower got off the ground in 2013. If Wolf Point was beholden to affordable housing requirements, it would have fallen under the city’s 2007 Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which expanded the original 2003 plan. Under the 2007 guidelines, new developments with ten or more residential units were required to designate 10 percent of those units as affordable housing or else cough up $100,000 per required unit for the city’s affordable housing fund. An existing development could have also triggered those requirements by requesting a zoning change that would have increased its density or permitted residential units on a property where such units were not previously allowed. In 2013, the Chicago City Council amended the zoning plan for the Wolf Point development. Even so, Kennedy’s campaign said the affordable housing rules didn’t apply to Wolf Point because the zoning update did not alter the floor area ratio or character of the development laid out for the property in 1973. ""Since none of those types of changes were being requested, the 2007 ordinance was not required to be adhered to,"" Kennedy spokeswoman Rebecca Evans said in an email. She referred us to public zoning records, which show the use of the land today falls in line with the 1973 zoning. We ran Evans’ assessment by the city’s Department of Planning and Development, which confirmed that the Wolf Point property, by not deviating from its 1973 zoning outline, was grandfathered out of current affordable housing mandates. Even though Kennedy and his Wolf Point partners faced no legal obligation to add affordable housing, it’s also worth noting in light of his complaints about Emanuel that nothing stopped them from doing it voluntarily. Developers of similar upscale projects that are subject to the affordable housing mandate have found ways to make compliance economically feasible. For example, officials at the city Department of Planning and Development pointed to recently approved plans for a 1,011-foot high-rise called One Square Chicago across the street from Holy Name Cathedral. It must adhere to an expanded set of city affordable housing requirements approved in 2015. Under that mandate, One Square Chicago’s developers plan to rehab 22 units at a cost of $277,000 apiece inside the nearby Lawson House YMCA, a longtime single-room-occupancy residence in a historic art deco building. They’ll also be required to pay an additional $11.37 million into the city affordable housing fund. The glaring difference between One Square Chicago and Wolf Point, of course, is that developers of the new building had no choice but to comply with the affordable housing requirement, unlike Kennedy and his partners. Still, Kennedy has cast himself as an affordability advocate, ringing in the new year by alleging, without proof, that the mayor was behind a ""strategic gentrification plan"" to push out of the city African-Americans and other minorities. Later, speaking at a debate in Carbondale on Jan. 30, Kennedy evoked the notion that candidates for office should be held accountable to more than just the letter of the law. ""The truth is, just because you don’t break a law doesn’t mean you’re innocent, and we need to hold our elected officials to a higher standard,"" Kennedy told the audience after lashing out at one of his Democratic rivals. Kennedy said, ""there was no requirement to put in affordable housing"" at his Wolf Point development because the property was grandfathered in under rules that applied before adoption of the city’s affordable housing ordinance. Public records show zoning changes made in 2013, before construction began, did not alter the development in ways that would have triggered the ordinance. And the city department charged with reviewing new projects confirmed that, because of its original zoning date, the development escapes requirements that apply to projects zoned more recently. Kennedy has made both Chicago affordability and holding candidates to higher standards cornerstones of his campaign. So his own actions are relevant to any exploration of the affordability question. Nevertheless, Kennedy is correct in stating no legal mandate required him to include affordable housing at his Wolf Point development.

Why Scott Walker, in real terms, has spent less on transportation than his Democratic predecessor
","In his Jan. 24, 2018, State of the State speech, something of a launching pad for his run for a third term as governor, Republican Scott Walker drew contrasts between himself and his predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. Despite criticism for not spending more on transportation, Walker nevertheless claimed he’s done better than Doyle, stating: ""We invested"" in our transportation system ""$24 billion over eight years. That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time."" Walker has made the same claim for at least 11 months, on Twitter, in a weekly radio address, in media interviews and in public appearances. The numbers The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau told us it’s possible to reach Walker’s figures by considering the total raw dollars put toward transportation programs, including a double-count of the principal in terms of money borrowed. That is, Walker’s method counts the principal at the time money was borrowed, and counts it again when repayments are made on that debt. That method shows Walker’s eight years of DOT funding, in raw dollars, including bonding and subsequent debt service payments, at $25.8 billion -- $3.4 billion more than Doyle. But besides doing the double counting, that measure also fails to take into account inflation. So, it is problematic in two ways. Here are the fiscal bureau numbers without the double counting but including inflation: Governor Period Real DOT funding Difference Jim Doyle 2003-’11 $18.7 billion +$1.3 billion Scott Walker 2011-’19 $17.4 billion Those figures show that Doyle, in real dollars, spent more on transportation than Walker has. We ran into a similar issue when Walker said in February 2017 the state is ""investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."" Our rating was Mostly False, since it didn’t take into account inflation, which is the best way to measure amounts over time. Our rating Walker says ""we invested"" in our transportation system ""$24 billion over eight years. That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time."" Walker’s claim uses raw dollars and counts the total amount of bonding, debt service and all funds put toward transportation. But that double-counts the principal and ignores inflation. Excluding the double counting and taking into account inflation -- that is, real dollars spent on transportation -- Doyle actually spent more in his eight years than Walker has in his. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False.   More on Walker and transportation Road project progress: In December 2017, Walker said: ""Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.""

Nunes memo twists James Comey's words on Steele dossier
","The memo assembled by aides to House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has spawned lots of debate, both before it was released on Feb. 2 and afterward. One small portion of the memo, however, has attracted special scrutiny from experts and pundits: how former FBI Director James Comey characterized the ""Steele Dossier"" under oath to Congress. The memo suggests that Comey had said the Steele dossier was bunk in its entirety. But that’s not what Comey said. The dossier in question was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele on behalf of Fusion GPS, a research firm whose work had been funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. It describes some of Donald Trump’s trips to Russia, before he became president, describing who he interacted with and things he did there. The Nunes memo recounts the history of the dossier leading up to Trump taking office before concluding, ""in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' "" What we’re looking at in this fact-check is whether Comey actually said that the Steele dossier was ""salacious and unverified."" The Nunes memo is effectively leveraging Comey’s credibility -- as someone who was fired by President Donald Trump, thus not a strong supporter of the president -- to undercut the dossier. The House Intelligence Committee did not respond to an inquiry for this article. What we found in the public record suggests a more limited assertion under oath by Comey -- that he’d said portions of the memo were ""salacious and unverified,"" not the whole thing. (We owe a debt in this fact-check to writings by two conservative blogs, RedState and HotAir.) We found a few relevant portions of Comey’s testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, 2017. One came from his prepared testimony: ""I first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment. ""The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing."" In this passage, Comey seems to apply the terms ""salacious and unverified"" to ""this material,"" which in turn refers to the earlier reference to ""some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment."" At the very least, this passage doesn’t suggest it’s a slam dunk that the entire dossier is ""salacious and unverified."" It refers to ""some potentially sensitive aspects"" of the dossier. One instance in which Comey repeated the phrase ""salacious and unverified"" came during an exchange with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine: Collins: ""I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. ... Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any FBI investigation?"" Comey: ""I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true."" Comey’s language here (""material"") is more opaque, but we don’t see any clear indication that he’s talking about the whole dossier as being ""salacious and unverified."" A third excerpt came in a remark to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., when Comey referred to ""unverified and salacious parts"" of the dossier. Note Comey’s use of word ""parts,"" rather than the whole dossier. A final relevant passage came during an exchange with the committee’s chairman, Richard Burr, R-N.C. Burr: ""At the time of your departure from the FBI, was the FBI able to confirm any criminal allegations contained in the Steele document?"" Comey: ""Mr. Chairman, I don't think that's a question I can answer in an open setting because it goes into the details of the investigation."" If the dossier in its entirety were total bunk, there would have been no need for Comey to suggest meeting Burr in a closed session. The fact that Comey suggests meeting in a place where intelligence can be discussed is an indication that the dossier included at least some sensitive information. We asked several experts whether they thought the memo had overplayed its hand about what Comey had said, and they largely agreed. ""I took Comey’s testimony to be saying that there was ‘salacious and unverified material’ in the Steele dossier, but he does not claim that the entire dossier is salacious and unverified,"" said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor and former U.S. Justice Department attorney who practiced before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ""Could there be a world in which the entire dossier is salacious and unverified?  Yes. Is that what Mr. Comey said in his testimony? No. By being inexact in his language, Mr. Nunes has misrepresented Mr. Comey’s testimony.""   Michael C.H. McDaniel, director of homeland security law programs at Western Michigan University’s Thomas M. Cooley Law School, said Comey’s carefully phrased words make the Nunes memo’s interpretation dubious. ""I fully believe that Comey was referring to some of the facts in one of the memos that comprise the Steele dossier as being yet unverified, just as only portions appeared salacious,"" McDaniel said. ""Any other interpretation is convoluted and illogical."" Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s National Security Program at New York University Law School, agreed. ""Comey’s testimony does not clearly indicate that the entire dossier was salacious and unverified,"" she said. ""It seems quite possible he was referring merely to particular parts of the dossier that would have especially raised Trump’s hackles, leading Comey to offer the assurance that Trump wasn’t under investigation."" The Nunes memo said the Steele dossier ""was—according to (Comey's) June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' "" Comey's careful phrasings in four portions of his testimony indicate that he meant only that portions of it were ""salacious and unverified."" The memo twists Comey’s words in an effort to leverage his stature to undercut the dossier.

"['Congress', 'Taxes', 'California', 'Phil Ting']","
False claim GOP tax plan “nothing more than a middle-class tax increase”
","Like many California Democrats, Assemblyman Phil Ting is no fan of the Republican tax plan signed by President Donald Trump. He has likened it to a tax giveaway for big corporations. The San Francisco lawmaker has proposed a surcharge on large companies in California, to claw back some of the billions of tax dollars that would be lost to the state under the plan. Such a bill, Ting said, would ""help blunt the impact of the federal tax plan on everyday Californians."" We wondered, however, whether Ting accurately described the GOP tax plan in the statement he provided to the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 21, 2018. ""Trump’s tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase,"" Ting, who formerly served as San Francisco's Assessor-Recorder, said in the statement. ""It is unconscionable to force working families to pay the price for tax breaks and loopholes benefiting corporations and wealthy individuals."" We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the first part of Ting’s claim that the tax plan ""was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase."" His words could be considered a burst of political rhetoric, but they also make an assertion about how millions of Americans would be impacted by the GOP plan. Our research We spoke with experts at the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative-leaning Tax Foundation to assess Ting’s claim. Both said it was off the mark. ""What we found is most taxpayers would be getting a tax cut,"" Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us. That includes most middle-income taxpayers, at least in the short-run, he said. The Tax Policy Center center estimates 91 percent of those who earn between $50,000 and $85,000 would receive a tax cut averaging about $900 in 2018, Sammartino said. Seven percent in this group would see their taxes go up, he said, while the rest would see their taxes remain the same. Additionally, 93 percent of Americans who earn between $85,000 and $150,000 would experience a tax cut in 2018, an amount averaging $1,800. ""We’re just not seeing that in the data,"" Sammartino said of Ting’s statement that the plan results in ""nothing more"" than middle class tax increase. ""We’re not seeing that it’s a tax increase for most people."" ""A fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class"" Scott Greenberg is a senior analyst at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. He described the GOP tax plan as ""a fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class in the short term. And in the long-term, after many of the provisions in the bill expire (at the end of 2025), the net effect of the tax bill on middle income households will be more or less zero."" The Tax Foundation concluded it will amount to tax cut of about 1.7 percent of one’s after-tax income, on average, for the middle quintile of taxpayers, Greenberg said. Meanwhile, the Tax Policy Center found it will amount to nearly the same amount, a tax cut of about 1.6 percent of one’s after-tax income for middle income earners. Greenberg said the plan accomplishes this by lowering rates for several tax brackets, expanding the standard deduction and the child tax credit.  Assemblyman Phil Ting / Capital Public Radio file photo Response from Ting When asked about the statement, Ting’s spokeswoman Jessica Duong pointed to news articles that show some in the middle class will see higher taxes under the GOP bill. She did not counter the estimate that most would see a tax cut. ""The quote was intended to counter Trump’s claim that ""this is going to be one of the great gifts to the middle income people of this country that they’ve ever gotten for Christmas"" – it is being sold as a middle-class tax cut but the benefits for such families will expire in 2025 while the corporate tax cuts are permanent,"" the spokeswoman told us in an email. ""Assemblymember Ting’s use of ""nothing more"" is intended to counter that misleading billing and highlight the fact that the plan currently and purposefully relies on the middle class paying for future tax cut deficits,"" she added. ""Little if anything"" We also examined the California Budget and Policy Center’s assessment of the tax plan. The group, considered more liberal leaning, painted a dire picture of the plan’s impact on most taxpayers. It warned in a recent post the plan ""would do little if anything for middle- and low-income families across the nation, and especially in California."" By scaling back the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT deduction, the plan would ""harm many middle-income families."" It added that the plan is ""clearly tilted to wealthy households and major corporations, while providing very little if any benefit for most middle- and low-income families."" National tax experts don’t dispute the wealthy would see larger tax cuts. The top one percent of households by income, for example, would see a tax cut of 3.4 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s about twice the rate of savings compared with middle class households. The plan cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. California hardships? In California, which has high state and local taxes, the GOP plan is expected to create more financial hardships compared with lower-tax states because it caps state and local income tax deductions. Here’s how Forbes.com explained the changes: ""Under the old tax law all property taxes paid to state and local governments could be claimed as an itemized deduction. It was also possible to deduct state and local income or sales taxes. The new law bundles all these so-called ""SALT"" taxes together and limits the deduction, in total, to $10,000 for both individuals and married couples."" ""For some homeowners in high-tax areas such as California, $10,000 does not come close to covering their combined property and income tax bills."" There’s also a change that affects mortgage interest deductions for homeowners. Under the previous law, homeowners could write off any interest they pay on mortgages up to $1 million. The new law will limit these deductions to mortgages of $750,000 or less. Given the Golden State’s high housing costs, some Californians will be impacted by the new cap. The change, however, impacts new mortgages, not existing ones. Sammartino of the Tax Policy Center told us those factors will would hurt some Californians. Even so, he said, the vast majority of middle class taxpayers in the state will still see a tax cut. ""The overall tax cuts might be a little bit less,"" Sammartino said. ""But in general, probably upwards of 85 percent of the middle class or so should see a tax cut in California,"" for 2018. What happens when the tax cuts expire?   While the plan’s corporate tax cuts are permanent, the individual reductions are temporary. The national PolitiFact took a closer look at who would be paying more once the individual tax cuts expire. It found all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. Some of those are middle-class households. ""Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027,"" according to the PolitiFact analysis. ""That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average."" Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed. Our ruling Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting recently claimed the GOP tax plan is ""nothing more than a middle class tax increase."" That doesn’t match up with estimates from the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative leaning Tax Foundation. They project the plan will result in a tax cut for about 90 percent of middle-income households nationwide in 2018. Those cuts would range from about $900 to $1,800. The remaining middle-income households would see their taxes stay the same or go up. The California Budget and Policy Center, a liberal leaning group, warns the plan will provide little if any help to middle- and low-income earners in high-tax California, given new limits placed on state and local tax deductions. But even with those new caps, plus a change to the mortgage interest deduction, national tax experts told us the vast majority of middle-class Californians -- up to 85 percent -- will still experience a tax cut in the plan’s first year. That could change by 2027 after the individual tax cuts expire, when households who make $75,000 or less are expected to see a tax hike. Congress could extend those cuts, though nothing is guaranteed.

No, Dolly Parton didn't say Trump is better than Bush and Obama combined
","Singer Dolly Parton praises President Donald Trump as outperforming his predecessors -- or at least that’s what a fake story on Facebook proclaims. ""Singer Dolly Parton: ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 Years’ of Bush, Obama ‘Put Together,’"" stated a Jan. 22 headline on Americanproud.info. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. It is. The story took a quote by a consultant who served in George W. Bush’s administration and and falsely attributed it to Parton. Earlier this month, Brett Decker spoke about consumer confidence and the economy. in a radio interview with Breitbart. ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of those guys put together,"" he said. The Americanproud.info story also used an actual quote by Parton in an interview with CNN in August 2016, but omitted the full context of her comments. ""We’re doing good,"" Parton told CNN. ""We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we’ve certainly come a long way in that respect."" Americanpround.info included that snippet in its report, but went on to say that Parton ""saw the light"" and later called Hillary Clinton ""nuts"" and that her campaign has been ""just crazy."" In reality, all those comments were actually from the same CNN interview, but Americanproud.info distorted what Parton actually said. When asked about Clinton and Trump, here’s Parton’s full remarks: ""I don't know where they're going to land but I think they're both nuts"" she said, joking that ""it's like watching the OJ Simpson trial. You just believe whoever's up next. Whoever testified last is who you believe."" In the CNN interview, Parton doesn’t come across as committed to either candidate. CNN paraphrased her as saying she might not know who she will vote for and that it's time that both Trump and Clinton stopped talking about each other. In June 2016, the New York Times asked Parton how she felt about a female presidential nominee. ""Well, I think that that would be wonderful. Hillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I think no matter if it’s Hillary or Donald Trump, we’re gonna be plagued with PMS either way — presidential mood swings! But I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary’s very qualified. So if she gets it, I’ll certainly be behind her."" After much publicity about that quote, Parton issued a statement. ""My comment about supporting a woman in the White House was taken out of context. I have not endorsed Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. I try not to get political but if I am, I might as well just run myself 'cause I've got the hair for it, it's huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race."" Proclaiming that a celebrity now loves Trump or hates Clinton is a common theme in fake news stories. We debunked an article that said Sandra Bullock said to Clinton ""if you don’t like our president you can leave and never come back again"" and that ""Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet’ "" We rated both statements Pants on Fire. In this case, the story that said Parton said, ""Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush, Obama put together"" is also fake news.

Was Sid Miller slow to reveal a laptop hack that released students' personal data?
","An activist challenging Sid Miller for the 2018 Republican nomination for Texas agriculture commissioner says the first-term incumbent muffed by not alerting child-victims of a personally exploitative computer hack for more than a month. Trey Blocker, a lawyer and former legislative aide who’s worked as a lobbyist, said in a January 2018 commentary for the Odessa American that in October 2017, a Texas Department of Agriculture ""employee’s laptop was attacked by ransomware, releasing critical personal information for over 700 Texas students and their families. ""The hack,"" Blocker wrote, ""resulted in a loss of the most personal of information — names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, and more — for Texas students and their families in almost 40 school districts. For reasons unknown, TDA did not notify the families affected until November 22, 2017 — 32 days after the breach."" Blocker opined: ""Though no organization is immune to cybersecurity attacks, this unnecessary delay in notification shows once again the failed leadership of Sid Miller. This is a matter of trust."" We don’t judge leadership. But did Blocker accurately recap the computer hack and timing of notices? Candidate cites news story To our emailed inquiry, Blocker pointed us to a December 2017 Denton Record-Chronicle news story stating the Agriculture Department had notified districts about Nov. 22, 2017 — or 27 days (or 19 business days) after the Oct. 26, 2017, ""malware attack"" on an employee’s computer resulting in a data breach exposing the personal information of students in 39 school districts. The newspaper said the districts, mostly in North and East Texas, ranged in size from the 138-student Karnack district near Louisiana to the 15,185-student Crowley district near Fort Worth. The Agriculture Department, the story said, ""oversees the federal nutrition program that provides school breakfasts and lunches. Because of that, the agency identified more than 700 students whose personal information might have been stolen by an unauthorized person. Officials said that information could include names, home addresses, birth dates, phone numbers and Social Security numbers of students and their families,"" the story said. A TDA spokesman, Mark Loeffler, told the newspaper: ""We have no indication right now that any of this information has been misused. We wanted to make sure we knew exactly what the scope was and how many pieces of personal information were compromised before we sent anything out. We had to go through a manual process to confirm that."" Our search of the Nexis news database for coverage of the incident led us to learn that the Longview News-Journal was the first news organization to report the incident. Its Nov. 30, 2017, story was accompanied by a two-page statement from Miller summarizing the ""attack incident"" and providing a chart specifying the districts at risk. Agency’s response When we queried TDA, Loeffler noted that state law doesn’t set a hard deadline for notifying individuals affected by a computer breach. Section 521.053 of the Texas business and commerce code states the disclosure of a breach ""to any individual whose sensitive personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person"" shall occur ""as quickly as possible."" And why did it take nearly a month for the agency to notify districts? ""It took a substantial amount of time to identify what happened,"" Loeffler said in January 2018. ""We’re still putting the pieces together."" Loeffler said the notification of districts ""was made out of an abundance of caution. Commissioner Miller made the decision to notify even though we had no information that any data had left the system."" Loeffler said further that it continues to look like no information was illicitly taken from the laptop, which he said was actually probed by malware--not ransomware, which implies an outside party seeking a payment to unfreeze a computer--after the worker clicked on a dangerous link. ""This is a very human error. This is the same mistake millions of people make every day,"" Loeffler said. Also, he said by email that while the forensic analysis continues, ""TDA fully expects that no data ever left the device."" After the fateful afternoon click, Loeffler said, TDA shortly heard from the Texas Department of Information Resources that malware had been introduced. Elliott Sprehe of the DIR separately told us by email that the agency’s Network Security Operating Center ""inspects and potentially blocks malicious internet traffic going to and from state agencies. In this case, Sprehe said, the NSOC’s tools saw what was potentially malware on a TDA computer"" on Oct. 26, 2017, and at about 4:30 p.m. that day alerted TDA staff to investigate and resolve the issue. Sprehe said: ""The traffic pattern DIR reported was indicative of either ransomware or hidden"" click fraud activity, which dictionary.com defines as the ""fraudulent practice of clicking many times on an online advertisement to generate the small fee charged to the advertiser per click, thereby harming the advertiser or benefiting the host website."" Loeffler estimated to us that the laptop was open to malicious probes on the day in question for about an hour before it was shut down with a copy of its hard drive subsequently made in Austin for ""digital forensic review."" Most recently, Loeffler advised, TDA determined through a file by file review that out of some 5,000 items on the laptop, less than 200 ""could have had any combination of personal identifying  information that would matter to anybody who wanted to use it maliciously. Of the 200,"" Loeffler said, probably less than 50 contained the ""perfect storm"" of someone’s date of birth, social security number and name. Notice to districts We also scrolled TDA web pages devoted to the federally funded free- and reduced-price school meal programs. That’s where we spotted an undated statement headlined ""Security Notice"" stating that after the employee’s laptop was compromised by the attack, ""some students in school districts throughout Texas may have been potentially impacted by the breach."" The statement also says: ""The information exposed on the employee's laptop included names, social security numbers, home addresses, birth dates, and personal phone numbers of the affected students and their families.  To date, TDA's Information Security Officer (ISO) has identified more than 700 students whose sensitive personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, exposed to acquisition by an unauthorized person. ""It is important to note that, to date, TDA’s ISO has not discovered any evidence to suggest misuse of the information that was compromised by the ransomware exploit. TDA recognizes the implications of this breach and continually evaluates agency processes and protocols to reduce future occurrences."" Finally, the statement urges potentially affected individuals to contact three major U.S. credit bureaus to activate free fraud alerts on behalf of affected students. Time lag? We asked Sprehe if it typically takes about a month to alert possible victims of malware attacks. Sprehe replied: ""Due to the complexity and uniqueness of each security incident, there is no way to approximate this."" Sprehe and Loeffler each mentioned the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, authorized by the Department of Homeland Security. Loeffler specified that the center was handling the forensic review of the TDA laptop’s hard drive. When we followed up, the center declined to comment on its review of the TDA incident. But generally, a center vice president told us the center annually conducts 150 to 200 post-incident reviews for state and local agencies. Those reviews, Brian Calkin said, typically take two to four weeks to complete--making the TDA’s notification timeline ordinary. ""You’ve got to allow time for them to see what occurred,"" Calkin said. We also heard back about the timing of the notifications to districts from Lance Hayden, a computer security expert who teaches in the University of Texas School of Information. By email, Hayden told us that according to data/analysis from the International Association of Privacy Professionals, ""the average time from an organization discovering a breach to when they report it runs at about 30 days. Using that metric, the TDA’s notification at 27-32 days would be very typical of this sort of incident,"" Hayden wrote. We told Blocker that the agency had yet to find that any personal data was misused in the wake of the attack. Blocker replied by email that possible victims still should have been informed as soon as possible. ""That is the responsible thing to do given the potential harm that could come to these students and their families,""  he wrote. Our ruling Blocker said the department led by Miller didn’t notify more than 700 Texas students about a computer hack releasing critical personal information including Social Security numbers until 32 days after the breach. This claim has an element of truth in that the agency alerted districts to a malware attack exposing personal information nearly a month after the attack--though that time lag wasn't unusual, experts told us. Most significantly, the agency says it hasn't confirmed the capture or misuse of any personal information from the laptop. As a result, we found no support for Blocker's claim that the incident ""resulted in a loss of the most personal of information."" On balance, we rate Blocker’s statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Does Georgia have the lowest minimum wage in the country?
","Stacey Evans, a Democrat running to be Georgia’s next governor, claims workers are at an economic disadvantage in part because of the state’s minimum wage. ""I want Georgia to be the best place to work, live, and raise a family. Right now, it isn’t,"" Evans said on her campaign website. ""Georgia is 40th in income inequality, 40th in high school graduation, and has the lowest minimum wage in the country."" We wondered if Georgia in fact has the lowest minimum wage in the nation. It does, but it’s not alone (tied with Wyoming), and most of hourly wage employees are paid above the state’s minimum wage: at least $7.25, which is also the federal minimum wage. Georgia’s state law sets the minimum wage at $5.15 per hour, but the federal Fair Labor Standards Act still applies, meaning most employees are covered under the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Wyoming, which equally has a $5.15 minimum wage, also says that when the federal minimum wage is higher than the state’s, the federal minimum wage applies to most workers. ""Like Georgia, Wyoming also has a $5.15 minimum wage, the lowest in the country. And while, thankfully, many Georgians are protected by a federal wage floor, many Georgians are not,"" said Adam Ney, research director for the Evans campaign. ""The fact remains that Georgia has the lowest minimum wage in the country and that we must increase it because everybody deserves a fair day’s pay for a hard day’s work."" Who doesn’t get the federal minimum wage? There are exemptions in the law for certain farm workers, seasonal workers, health aides, and workers who receive tips. In 2016, Georgia had about 2.3 million workers paid hourly rates, and 51,000 of them (or 2.2 percent) were paid below the federal minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. An estimated 90,000, or 3.9 percent, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage. Overall, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina had the highest percentages of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at or about 5 percent, BLS said. Georgia is one of seven states that have either a lower state minimum wage than the federal standard, or no state minimum wage at all, said Wesley Tharpe, research director at the left-leaning think tank Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. ""In practice, the vast majority of workers in every state are subject to the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour,"" Tharpe said. Tipped workers, including servers, are also paid a lower hourly rate in most states including Georgia, Tharpe said. ""Some evidence suggests their tips don’t always sum to get them about the required $7.25 federal rate,"" he said. Evans said Georgia ""has the lowest minimum wage in the country."" Georgia’s minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is the lowest in the nation, but Wyoming also has the same minimum wage. Also, most of Georgia’s workers paid hourly rates earn the federal minimum of $7.25.

Would a border wall have prevented the opioid epidemic?
","In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, President Donald Trump proposed a stricter immigration system that he says would keep Americans safer and help address the country’s opioid epidemic. Trump’s plan is built on four ""pillars,"" as he called them, one of which is a wall along America’s southern border. ""Our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country,"" Trump said, adding shortly thereafter: ""These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction."" The speech was roundly praised by conservative politicians and pundits, including Ann Coulter. Coulter is the author of several books and often appears on radio and television shows. While Trump’s speech didn’t linger on the relationship between opioids and Mexico, Coulter attempted to provide some context. ""Good he's talking about opioid crisis -- 100% of heroin/fentanyl epidemic is because we don't have a WALL,"" she tweeted. There are three claims to address here. One: the insinuation that the opioid crisis is limited to or caused by a rise in heroin and fentanyl use. Two: that all heroin and fentanyl used by Americans enters the country through Mexico. And three: the suggestion that building a wall along America’s southern border would drastically reduce opioid abuse. What are opioids? The National Institute on Drug Abuse describes opioids as a class of drugs that includes heroin, fentanyl and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone (including OxyContin), hydrocodone (including Vicodin), codeine, morphine, and many others. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid pain reliever that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses, the majority of which were linked to opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency Oct. 26 at the White House. What caused the epidemic? According to the final report by the U.S. Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, a commission Trump created, the current epidemic is a result of ""excessive prescribing of opioids since 1999"" compounded by the ""widespread availability of inexpensive and purer illicit heroin; the influx of highly potent fentanyl/fentanyl analogs."" The commission included former Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the chairman, Republican Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Democratic North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, former Democratic Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Bertha Madras, an opioid expert and professor of psychobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ""Examining national-level general population heroin data (including those in and not in treatment), nearly 80 percent of heroin users reported using prescription opioids prior to heroin,"" the Institute on Drug Abuse notes on a webpage explaining prescription opioids as a gateway drug. In 2015 alone, the Institute says, an estimated 2 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 591,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder (the stats aren’t mutually exclusive). Where do heroin and fentanyl come from? International gangs based in Mexico ""remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States,"" and their most common method of smuggling drugs is vehicles legally coming into the U.S., according to a 2017 Drug Enforcement Administration report. And, as PolitiFact previously reported, heroin is most smuggled through Mexico. ""Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico, believed to be the primary source of heroin for the U.S. market, have continued to surge, providing traffickers a steady stream of high-purity, low-cost heroin to market throughout the United States,"" the report says. As for fentanyl, it mainly originates in China and comes in through the southwest border, Canada and the U.S. Postal Service. Trump’s opioid commission says many users are ordering the pill-form of fentanyl online and having it shipped discreetly. The commission’s report references a Carnegie Mellon University study which found that revenues from online illicit drug sales increased from between $15-17 million in 2012 to $150-$180 million in 2015. Furthermore, the fentanyl found at the southern border tends to be less potent than the fentanyl shipped through the mail. ""Large volumes of fentanyl are seized at the [southern border], although these seizures are typically low in purity – on average approximately 7 percent,"" the DEA’s 2017 report says.
""Conversely, the smaller volumes seized after arriving in the mail directly from China can have purities over 90 percent and be worth much more than the fentanyl seized at the SWB."" Would a wall work? Probably not. Trump has said that building a wall between the United States and Mexico would curb opioid use in America, and experts told PolitiFact in October they’re skeptical a wall would have a drastic impact. Even though a lot of heroin comes from Mexico, it’s not always walked across the border. As PolitiFact pointed out in this fact check of Trump, traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles crossing the border (through legal checkpoints and illegal crossings), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. ""Traffickers hide their illicit cargo in secret, state–of–the art compartments designed for cars, or under legal goods in trailer trucks. And they have learned many techniques for fooling the border patrol,"" Vanda Felbab-Brown wrote in an August 2017 essay for the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC. As Trump once accurately noted, smugglers also attempt to get drugs into the United States using catapults, drones, boats and tunnels. At least 232 tunnels were discovered on U.S. borders from 1990 to January 2017, according to the 2017 DEA report. The report notes that the most common method employed by Mexican traffickers ""involves transporting illicit drugs through U.S. ports of entry (POEs) in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers."" As for fentanyl, Trump’s opioid commission seemed more concerned with shipments from China than couriers from Mexico. ""We are losing this fight predominately through China,"" the commission wrote in its interim report. ""This must become a top tier diplomatic issue with the Chinese; American lives are at stake and it threatens our national security,"" it says. ""Our inability to reliably detect fentanyl at our land borders and at our international mail handling facilities creates untenable vulnerabilities."" Josh Stein, North Carolina’s Democratic attorney general, summarized the issue in an email. ""Traffickers predominately bring heroin from Mexico but usually through legal points of entry. Drug dealers import illicit fentanyl from China usually by air. To effectively combat the opioid epidemic … there are better investments than a wall."" Our ruling Coulter, alluding to the opioid crisis, said the heroin and fentanyl epidemic was ""100 percent"" caused by America’s lack of a border wall. Heroin is mostly trafficked from Mexico, mostly hidden in cargo – not by crossing the border through the desert. Fentanyl comes from both Mexico and Canada, and can also be transported through the mail. Coulter’s ""100 percent"" claim is far off-base no matter how we parse it. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2018/feb/02/ann-coulter/would-wall-have-prevented-opioid-epidemic/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Richard Corcoran']","
Do Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state?
","A dramatic new ad for tougher immigration policies by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran’s political committee has drawn national attention and criticism from Democrats. Since Corcoran’s Watchdog PAC released the ad in late January, it's been aired hundreds of times on Fox News channels and garnered more than 30,000 views on YouTube. The 30-second video features a white woman walking down the streets of a suburban neighborhood when a supposed illegal immigrant, dressed in jeans and a hooded jacket, turns around to shoot her. Corcoran says the situation mirrors the fatal shooting of Kate Steinle, who was shot in July 2015 while walking with her father on a San Francisco pier. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, an undocumented immigrant, was charged with the crime. Prosecutors argued that Zarate intentionally killed Steinle. But, Garcia Zarate’s lawyers argued that her death was unintentional. They said Garcia Zarate, a homeless man, found and picked up a cloth-wrapped gun and that it accidentally fired, the shot ricocheting and traveling about 78 feet before hitting Steinle in the back. He was acquitted of murder and involuntary manslaughter charges in December 2017, but Republicans, including President Donald Trump, cite the case when criticizing sanctuary city policies throughout the nation. ""This could have happened to any family, anywhere,"" Corcoran says in the voice-over. ""Incredibly, some Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state."" We wanted to sort out Corcoran’s claim that some Tallahassee politicians support statewide sanctuary-city policies. There is no specific legal definition of sanctuary cities, but the term generally describes jurisdictions that to some extent limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. Typically, these cities don't honor federal requests to detain illegal immigrants in their custody who they would otherwise release. These policies are generally set at the local levels and are enacted by police department and sheriff’s offices. Watchdog PAC’s communication director Taylor Budowich gave PolitiFact Florida a factsheet for the ad. It included two news articles. One was about Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and the other was about Democratic lawmakers who introduced legislation in 2017 that would have protected sanctuary cities in Florida. We’ve looked at whether Gillum wants to make Florida a sanctuary state before and we rated it Half True. We found that the claim was extrapolated from Gillum's vows to fight back against Trump's attack on sanctuary cities. Budowich also pointed to a news article which talked about Gillum’s response to President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order to penalize cities that don't comply with federal immigration agents by withholding federal funds. After the executive order was announced, Gillum took to Twitter and posted a lengthy statement to attack Trump’s decision as ""inconsistent with our highest values,"" adding the United States can ""protect national security interests and have a secure border without criminalizing people who are here undocumented."" Gillum’s campaign said as governor he would support an approach like in Tallahassee that emphasizes immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not a local one. But Gillum has not offered a specific statewide policy for not cooperating with detainer requests from immigration enforcement officials, so his position is murkier than what Corcoran’s is describing. ""Mayor Gillum regularly talks about how illegal immigrants should not be ‘criminalized’ based on being in the country illegally,"" Budowich said. ""So, call it sanctuary cities or wholesale amnesty, it's equally as wrong and defies the rule of law."" As for the other Tallahassee politicians, the factsheet cites a 2017 bill (HB 1407) that was sponsored by Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, and Rep. Al Jacquet, D-Lantana. The bill died in the Criminal Justice subcommittee in May, but it would have prohibited local law enforcement officials from ""making an inquiry or recording information concerning the immigration status of certain persons."" In the article, Smith explained that the bill was meant to garner trust between local law enforcement and sanctuary communities. ""This important legislation strengthens those critical local relationships and creates trust to keep all of our communities safe,"" Smith said in the piece. One final note. The ad implies that undocumented immigrants could murder a family member ""any family, anywhere."" There is no national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of the victims, but numerous studies have found that immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens. Corcoran said, ""some Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state."" Corcoran’s ad was referring to Gillum and Democratic politicians, who sponsored legislation in support of sanctuary cities. Gillum was critical of Trump’s executive order threatening to suspend funding, but he has not offered a specific statewide policy for not cooperating with detainer requests from immigration enforcement officials. Last year, Florida Democrats sponsored legislation that emphasized immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not a local one, but that bill died in committees.

Story that NFL lawyer said Super Bowl rigged and was murdered is fake news
","Days before the Super Bowl, fake news articles circulating on Facebook claimed that a National Football League lawyer named Dan Goodes was shot dead in a ""gangland-style execution"" hours after blowing the whistle on the ""rigged Super Bowl."" ""NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged,’ found dead,"" stated the Feb. 1 headline on Eco News, a website that claims it is on the frontline for ""earth liberation."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story copies an earlier fake story by YourNewsWire, a website that publishes fake news. We sent messages to both websites and didn’t get a reply. We found no evidence that an NFL lawyer named Dan Goodes even exists, or that he was found dead in his BMW in Manhattan. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told PolitiFact that the NFL has no attorney named Dan Goodes. He called the story ""ridiculous,"" ""bogus"" and ""fake."" The story said that Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis to promote the 2018 Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when he went off script and claimed that the NFL rigged the game to earn maximum revenue for league. ""According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system,"" the article said. The article included a mock screenshot of a Jan. 28 New York Times article about the alleged shooting of the lawyer founded slumped over the wheel of his BMW. But the article doesn’t appear in Nexis. ""Nothing about this is real, down to the URL,"" New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told PolitiFact. ""It's a false reference to a non-existent NYT story."" The Eco News story included a photo of two police officers at a crime scene. We searched Google images and found it matched an Associated Press photo of a crime scene near the site where a police officer was fatally shot in the Bronx in July. It also contained an alleged photo of NFL headquarters; however, a search of that photo in Google images resulted in a match to a picture on the South Park Studios website. Readers should beware of other conspiracy theories about the Super Bowl. The Facebook page Satire Daily, which clearly identifies itself as satire, published a video seemingly documenting that the NFL had openly admitted to rigging games. Snopes debunked the claim in January. The video focused on a referee who congratulated the team’s quarterback Tom Brady after the Patriots beat the Jaguars. That actually happened. Referee Clete Blakeman did Brady a congratulatory pat on the chest, which fueled some conspiracy theories. NFL spokesman McCarthy told PolitiFact, ""It's not uncommon for an official to congratulate a player after a game."" Another situation that fueled conspiracy theories stemmed from an actual NFL ad on social media in January before the NFC Championship Game. The ad featured photos of the Patriots and Vikings quarterbacks and said, ""When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the Patriots vs. the Vikings battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title!"" The NFL apologized for the ads. ""It was a regrettable mistake,"" an unnamed NFL spokesman told media. ""The ads were mocked up using all the (possible) combinations, but weren’t supposed to go until Monday when the matchup is known. Obviously, someone jumped the gun."" McCarthy also told PolitiFact the ad was a mistake. In the world of real news, PolitiFact has fact-checked many claims related to past Super Bowls related to weather, records and spending as well as human trafficking and domestic violence and economic impact. But in this case, the claim that an ""NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged’, found dead"" is fake news.

The problem with Trump’s claim is that the Office of Management and Budget laid out different criteria for defining regulatory and deregulatory actions in complying with Trump’s directive. Significant regulatory actions are defined as leading ""to an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy (...) ."" ""This is an attempt to not have to offset or otherwise subject to this executive order regulatory actions that are routine, or fairly administrative, or technical in nature,"" said Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at the left-leaning Public Citizen. Examples include time tables for opening up drawbridges, or clearing trees that overhang airplane runways. But their lifts could count as deregulatory, per the definition of deregulatory actions: a finalized action with total savings greater than zero. That’s a much lower bar than the $100 million figure. ""When you put things in a ratio form, you’re saying these are comparable units,"" Cary Coglianese, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Program on Regulation, said. ""These are not."" When Coglianese took a look at the federal regulatory agenda, released Dec. 14, 2017, he found 62 deregulatory actions. (Not all of Trump’s 67 deregulatory actions were included in the review.) Coglianese found the Office of Management and Budget deemed 8 percent of these economically significant (exceeding $100 million in costs); 27 percent significant enough to warrant review, but not due to economic impacts; and two-thirds non-significant, administrative, or routine. When we plugged each of the 67 listed actions into the federal regulatory agenda, we found five that were classified as economically significant. The most common classification was non-significant. Dan Goldbeck, a senior regulatory policy analyst at the right-leaning American Action Forum, used a different methodology. Tracking only rules with some economic estimate of costs or savings, albeit no specified threshold, Goldbeck found the Trump administration had imposed nine deregulatory actions, and five regulatory ones. By these measures, Trump barely made the two for one ratio. The deregulatory action with the greatest estimated savings was the repeal of a Federal Acquisition Regulation on ""Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces"", estimated to have saved $417 million in fiscal year 2017. The repeal was possible thanks to a joint resolution from Congress, which was then ratified by the president. Trump said, ""Instead of two for one, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every one new rule."" The Trump administration counted only regulatory actions that were deemed economically significant. Without the same stipulation for deregulatory actions, the ratio compares apples to oranges. Trump has repealed five economically significant regulatory actions to three economically significant new regulations, according our search of the Office of Management and Budget database. The American Action Forum found he repealed nine regulations for the five he imposed. Using comparable units, Trump’s claim overestimates his deregulatory accomplishments. By two measures, it’s actually a little less than two for one. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/feb/02/donald-trump/trump-hasnt-cut-22-regulations-every-new-one/

The story said Francis told the guests that the religious teachings were equally valid, and that the time is ripe for ""merging our faiths."" Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts with PolitiFact and other fact-checking websites to debunk potentially fake news.

Did word of Trump’s inauguration concert cause a Jackie Evancho sales surge?
","Donald Trump hasn’t had an easy time getting artists to perform at his inauguration. Many, reportedly including Elton John and Bruno Mars, said they wouldn’t perform. So far the only artists slated for the inauguration on Jan. 20 are the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Rockettes and Pittsburgh-area native Jackie Evancho, who rose to fame on ""America’s Got Talent."" And Trump believes Evancho’s decision to perform has been great for her career. On Twitter Wednesday, he claimed Evancho’s ""album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance."" Not long after, the New York Times’ Dave Itzkoff tweeted a screenshot displaying Evancho’s most recent album falling from 93 to 134 on the Billboard top 200 albums list in the last week. That didn’t look so good for the president-elect. So is Trump’s Twitter boast correct? Did Evancho, who is 16, see a steep rise in sales since it was announced she’d be a performer at the Trump inauguration? It was Dec. 14 when Evancho said she’d be performing. She had released a new album in late October, ""Someday at Christmas."" Numbers from BuzzAngle Music, a music data-tracking company, show digital and physical sales of all her albums hovering between 2,500 and about 3,000 in late October to the end of November (Evancho has three older full-length albums, including another Christmas album). Sales rose to about 4,600 the first week after Thanksgiving. For the week beginning Dec. 2, they were 5,800. (BuzzAngle tracks sales from a Friday to Thursday every week.) The inaugural announcement happened in the middle of the next week. For the Dec. 9 to Dec. 15 sales period, her sales jumped to about 7,176. The next week, from Dec. 16 to Dec. 22, they went up to 14,173. That’s an increase of 98 percent. The sales bump ended there. The week of Dec. 23 to Dec. 29, Evancho’s sales fell down to 9,479. As of Wednesday, her sales for this week were at 1,442. During the same timeframe, Evancho’s streaming rates went up at a similar rate. The first full week after the Trump announcement, beginning Dec. 16, Evancho’s songs were streamed about 754,000 times. The previous week they had been streamed about 410,000 times. Our Ruling Donald Trump tweeted that 16-year-old Jackie Evancho’s ""album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance."" He’s right. Evancho’s album sales nearly doubled in the first full week after she was announced as an inauguration performer compared to the previous week. (She was also streamed much more often.) Though sales for the week of Dec. 23 to Dec. 29 went down from about 14,000 to 9,000, that number is still about 50 percent higher than from the week of Dec. 2 to Dec. 9.

News of Trump's death as fake as his WrestleMania 23 appearance
","A fake news website is posting a real image of President-elect Donald Trump and using it to draw a bogus conclusion. ""Donald Trump dead from a fatal heart attack!"" screamed a Dec. 19, 2016, headline from a site called TheNewYorkEvening.com. The post came with a startling and real image of Trump sprawled out on the ground. The post and photo were flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news. Obviously Trump is not dead. Reading a newspaper, turning on a TV or radio or going anywhere else on the Internet will prove that. Bu where is that photo coming from? And is it real? It is. It comes from Trump's 2007 appearance at WrestleMania 23. Trump, who knows World Wrestling Entertainment kingpin Vince McMahon, had agreed to the Battle of the Billionaires. In that storyline, Trump and McMahon both chose a proxy wrestler to compete in the annual pay-per-view event, with the loser having his head shaved in front of the roaring crowd. This screen grab of an image on fake news sites implied that it was taken after Donald Trump's imaginary heart attack, but it's actually Trump suffering from a Stone Cold Stunner during Wrestlemania 23. At the match, Trump clotheslined McMahon prior to Trump’s wrestler winning the match. Trump then shaved McMahon’s head in the ring. Notably absent from many online clips is what happened next: Guest referee Steve Austin delivered a Stone Cold Stunner to Trump, leaving Trump writhing on the mat. That’s the image being used in the fake news still. Trump was involved with the WWE for several years after the match. One storyline in 2009 involved Trump buying the WWE’s Raw from McMahon, then selling it back to him for twice the price. Even though the sale was fake, it still caused WWE stock to drop 7 percent at one point. Trump was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. Three years later, the president-elect tapped McMahon’s wife Linda McMahon, who donated $6 million to a Trump super PAC, to head the Small Business Administration.

Pants On Fire for claim California legalized child prostitution
","Did California really legalize child prostitution? That’s the startling question our audience asked after reading a misleading op-ed by Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen in the Washington Examiner. Allen’s opinion piece has been shared widely on social media and led several readers to ask PolitiFact California to check it out. We decided to fact-check the first line of Allen’s column, which largely reflects the rest of the piece: ""Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right."" The op-ed is headlined: ""California Democrats legalize child prostitution."" UPDATE: Allen repeated his claim on The O'Reilly Factor on Fox News on Jan. 4, 2017, saying at the end of his interview that ""The California Democrats did just legalize child prostitution in California.""  Our research Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 1322. It decriminalizes prostitution for minors by preventing law enforcement from arresting people under 18 for soliciting sex or loitering with intent to commit prostitution. Supporters of the law said it’s designed to treat children involved in prostitution as victims rather than as criminals. It does nothing, however, to legalize commercial sex acts. People caught having sex with minors, soliciting sex with minors or arranging clients for them can still be charged with crimes. ""The key is that the children involved are not liable, not that the conduct has been legalized,"" said Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis School of Law, who analyzed the law upon our request. Chin added that under the new law ""child prostitution is treated just as, say, the production of child pornography is."" Adults involved are subject to criminal prosecution, while the children, who are seen as victims, are not, he said. Representatives for Allen did not respond to our questions. Allen, who represents Orange County, told KQED public radio he rejects the criticism he’s received over the column. ""I don't care about any amount of legalistic spin that someone wants to put on it. When you decriminalize something, you legalize it,"" Allen said in the radio interview. After his initial claim in the op-ed that ""prostitution by minors will be legal,"" Allen adds some factual context in his second line by noting law enforcement can’t ""arrest"" underage workers for soliciting sex. A few paragraphs later, however, he wrongly asserts that the new law means law enforcement can’t ""interfere"" with minors engaging in prostitution. The law, in fact, includes provisions that officers who encounter these minors shall report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. It also authorizes officers to take a minor engaged in a commercial sex act into temporary custody under some circumstances, including in the event of immediate physical danger or when medical care is needed. Bill’s author responds Democratic state Sen. Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, who authored Senate Bill 1322, responded on Twitter to the mischaracterizations of the law. ""I denounce false claims made by Republicans on my bill #SB1322 that decriminalizes sexually exploited minors,"" she wrote. ""I proudly authored SB 1322 to protect minor victims of human sex trafficking from being further charged as criminals for commercial sexual exploitation."" ""This notion, perpetuated by Assemblymember Travis Allen (R-Huntington Beach), that my bill legalizes prostitution and commercial sex for minors is categorically untrue,"" she added. ""It remains unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to consent to sexual intercourse in the State of California and the law remains in effect and is not changed with the implementation of my bill.""  California state Sen. Holly Mitchell responded to Allen's claims on Twitter.  The Sacramento Bee’s fact-checking team PoliGRAPH also examined Allen’s op-ed. It described it as a ""misleading column"" and rated its assertions ""False."" Our ruling California state Assemblyman Travis Allen claimed in a recent column that ""Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California."" His claim profoundly distorts a new state law that treats minors engaged in commercial sex acts as victims, but does nothing to legalize prostitution. Young people under age 18 who solicit sex won’t be arrested and sent to juvenile hall. Instead, officers will have the option of taking them into temporary custody if they are in immediate danger or need medical attention. It also says officers shall report the circumstances of minors engaged in prostitution to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. The law does nothing to change the fact that it is illegal to have sex with minors, solicit prostitutes or arrange clients. Allen’s specific claim, and the column in general, is grossly misleading.

J.K. Rowling's charity wants to end orphanages. Here's why
","The good majority of orphans in institutions are not actually parentless, according to the charity founded by author J.K. Rowling. ""An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in orphanages or residential institutions. Shockingly, 80 percent of these children are not orphans,"" says Lumos, a group dedicated to ending the institualization of children by 2050. ""Children need families, not orphanages."" Is it true? Well, maybe. The data Lumos relies on comes from credible sources, but the reality is the information available is outdated and, to some extent, unreliable. The number of orphans living in some institution -- the 8 million figure -- has been floating around for decades. It seems to originate from a 1985 report by Defence for Children International. A more recent tally by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) pins the number at 2 million, but UNICEF cautions that this is likely to be severely underestimated due to underreporting as ""many institutions are unregistered, and many countries do not regularly collect and report data on children in institutional care."" The claim that 80 percent of children living in an institution are not orphans, meanwhile, comes from a 2009 estimate from Save the Children, an international children’s rights charity. The charity claims that ""four out of five children in institutional care have one or both parents alive."" These children are placed in orphanages despite having at least one living parent because of poverty or social exclusion (i.e. gender or disability discrimination). Neither figure can be verified without more comprehensive statistical studies than currently available, said Jedd Medefind, the president of the Christian Alliance for Orphans. Most studies are conducted on a local level and ""these numbers vary greatly by individual orphanage as well as by region of the world,"" Medefind aid. UNICEF reports, for example, that 77 percent of more than 11,000 children in orphanages in Cambodia in 2009 had at least one living parent. In Sri Lanka, that number was 90 percent in 2007. On the low end, 39 percent of orphans in Zimbabwe had least one parent Here’s a map from Lumos that illustrates the regional differences.  So what exactly is so troubling about having children with parents living in orphanages? Decades of research show that children, especially younger children, placed in institutional care are more likely to experience poor health, developmental delay and emotional attachment disorders. So rather than supporting institutions that have poor track records, UNICEF and virtually all children’s rights groups favor helping destitute families and communities provide care. While not all orphans can be returned to families or relatives, ""we can say with confidence that a portion of the children currently living in orphanages could be returned to live with relatives with certain supports and appropriate oversight,"" Medefind said. In the United States, there were over 415,000 children in foster in 2014, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Our ruling Lumos said, ""An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in orphanages or residential institutions. Shockingly, 80 percent of these children are not orphans."" Both figures are plausible though not verifiable. A UNICEF report estimated 2 million institutionalized orphans but noted that this is likely severely underestimated. Local studies on the number of institutionalized orphans with at least one parent, meanwhile, range from 30 to over 90 percent.

Mostly True: Trump tweet about GM Chevy Cruze manufacturing
","President-elect Donald Trump put General Motors on notice for tariff-free imports of vehicles from Mexico, warning of heavy taxes if vehicles are not instead manufactured in the United States. ""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 3. ""Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! Imposing hefty tariffs on foreign goods was a staple of Trump’s pro-manufacturing agenda. He suggested on day one of his campaign that if Ford chose to open a factory in Mexico and then tried to sell those vehicles in the United States, he would tell Ford’s CEO that ""we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax."" In the same speech, he bemoaned Chevy’s slight presence in foreign countries, particularly in Japan. We wanted to look at Trump’s most recent beef with Chevy. The key to our review is that the president-elect singled out the Mexican-made model of the Chevy Cruze. The Cruze made in Mexico is a hatchback that does not sell widely in the United States. Chevy Cruze sedans are more popular in the United States — and they are produced in Ohio. Trump has a point, however, that the Mexican Cruze has made its way to the United States free of taxes, based on provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement. General Motors: We make Cruzes in Ohio, too General Motors, whose portfolio includes Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC, said in a brief statement that all Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in the company’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In 2016, it sold 185,500 of this body type in the United States. But the company ""builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.,"" the statement said. Production of the hatchback model began in mid 2016, said Patrick Morrissey, a General Motors spokesperson, in an email. Out of 29,000 hatchbacks made in Mexico in 2016 for global markets, 4,500 were sold in the United States, Morrissey said. (Chevy Cruze photos courtesy of General Motors) Free trade provisions under international agreement The North American Free Trade Agreement, effective since January 1994, lifted trade tariffs and restrictions among Canada, the United States and Mexico. NAFTA has been praised for expanding and facilitating trade among the three countries, but Trump and labor unions from the United States have criticized the deal for outsourcing jobs and lowering wages. Trump called it the ""worst trade deal ever,"" blaming it for the loss of manufacturing jobs. But nonpartisan research said NAFTA has had a more subtle effect on the U.S. economy. ""NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,"" a 2015 Congressional Research Service report said. ""The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP."" NAFTA allows the tariffs-free import of autos, light trucks, engines and transmissions from Mexico as long as 62.5 percent of their value is from North America, the 2015 report said. The ""rules of origin"" requirement for other vehicles and automotive parts is 60 percent, according to the report. The Chevy Cruze hatchback would be covered under NAFTA’s duty-free provision, experts told PolitiFact. NAFTA allowed each participating country to specialize in different stages of production, said Caroline Freund, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. Parts can go back and forth in the production of a vehicle, so a car that’s imported from Mexico can actually include components from companies in the United States, Freund said. As for the logistics of Trump’s plan to impose high tariffs, trade experts introduced a number of concerns about it for our June analysis. They cited potential rising production costs and an increased cost burden on consumers, as well as a possible trade war and broken international agreements. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border."" That’s accurate for 4,500 Chevy Cruze hatchbacks made in Mexico and sold in the United States in 2016. That was about 15 percent of all Cruze hatchbacks produced in Mexico last year for global markets.  NAFTA provisions allow the tax-free imports of autos from Mexico. It’s worth pointing out extra context that Chevy Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The sedan is more than 40 times as popular among American buyers as the hatchback. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. After the Fact  After publishing this check, readers reached out telling us some Chevy Cruze sedans have also been imported from Mexico to sell in the United States. We asked General Motors about it, since their statement in response to Trump's tweet said all Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in General Motors' assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In a follow-up email, a General Motors spokesperson said, ""In the fourth quarter of 2016 we built some sedans in Mexico (and shipped to the U.S) to help support the launch of the Lordstown plant with the new Cruze (that was announced and reported on last summer) – about 8,000 total. So some of those are still in inventory in the U.S., but the only Chevrolet Cruze models being built in Mexico now for the U.S. market are the hatchbacks."" The approximate 8,000 sedans were sold to dealers in 2016 ""and most were probably sold to consumers,"" General Motors spokesperson Patrick Morrissey said.",/factchecks/2017/jan/04/donald-trump/mostly-true-trump-tweet-about-gm-chevy-cruze-manuf/

Fake news: Michigan GOP elector didn't choose suicide over voting for Trump
","Readers should not put any faith in a fake news story about a would-be faithless elector who chose death over Donald Trump. ""Electoral College elector commits suicide to avoid voting for Donald Trump,"" read a Dec. 19, 2016, headline on UniversePolitics.com. It appeared the same day members of the Electoral College voted to officially elect Trump the 45th president. The story said a 47-year-old Michigan elector named Jeremy Hashville killed himself in an absurdly complicated fashion, revealing in a note that he could not bear to vote for Trump. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of the company’s efforts to fight fake news online.   Nothing about the story or its extreme premise is accurate. For starters, we found no evidence of an elector named Jeremy Hashville, in Michigan or any other state. While there had been a lot of talk about electors potentially switching their votes to deny Trump the 270 needed to win the Electoral College, little came of it. Only two Republican electors, from Texas, changed their votes to avoid choosing Trump (another Texan elector had resigned and was replaced). No electors nationwide committed suicide. Michigan electors said prior to the vote that they were not going to attempt to flip, but they couldn’t have even if they had wanted to do so. Electors in Michigan are bound by state law to vote for the winner of the state’s presidential election. If they don’t, they will be replaced with someone who will. A photo included with the story said it was of Hashville, but was actually an Associated Press image of Washington state Democratic elector Bret Chiafalo. He was part of an effort called the Hamilton Electors — members of the Electoral College who hoped to flip enough Republican electors to deny Trump the presidency. (Their effort clearly failed.) There’s nothing on the UniversePolitics.com site to indicate the story was fake, but it did include a source link to another site called WorldNewsDailyReport.com.

The Obamas set out for their annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii — Barack Obama’s birthplace — the evening of Dec. 16, four days before the article posted. Here’s video of them departing on Air Force One that night.  Per White House pool reports, Obama played rounds of golf on Dec. 17, 19, 21 and 23. The First Family has also spent time at the beach, walked a nature trail at a botanical garden, played escape the room and dined at a popular Japanese restaurant — all in Hawaii. On Christmas Day, the President and First Lady visited troops at a marine base, again in Hawaii. Several of the other claims made in the article are entirely fabricated. The Obamas never took Air Force One to Chicago for White Castle burgers. There is no Air Force Osprey specifically to transport the First Dog. (Here’s an article describing Bo walking up and down the aisle of Air Force One.) The article’s assertion that Air Force One is not obligated to fly anywhere ""unless it was on official business"" lacks critical context. Vacation trips fall under the official travel category as the president and vice president are assumed to be always on duty, according to the Congressional Research Service. The article also includes a picture of the First Family’s dog, Bo, departing a marine helicopter. As our friends at Snopes point out, the image was taken in 2013 during the Obamas’ vacation on the Martha’s Vineyard.   After the photo, the article then concludes with a wink: ""It’s a fairly well-known fact that after about 150 words and a picture that may or may not be related, most conservative readers will stop reading and go comment that the Muslim should be executed for playing golf.

Do 17 picks for Donald Trump's Cabinet have a higher net worth than one-third of Americans?
","Critics of President-elect Donald Trump say he promised to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington but has instead chosen wealthy and connected insiders for his Cabinet. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan joined that chorus during a Dec. 16, 2016 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio. Trump’s first 17 picks for the Cabinet, the Madison Democrat charged, ""have a net worth of more than a third of America."" They do. But here’s the twist: So might a group of 17 ordinary Americans. Cabinet’s net worth -- $6 billion or more Net worth is the difference between a person’s assets and liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts on one hand, versus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have no net worth, or a negative net worth, even while earning a six-figure income. As for Trump’s Cabinet picks, a number have made news for their wealth. But let’s start with what is the Cabinet. The Cabinet has 16 members who are in the official line of succession to the presidency -- the vice president, plus the heads of 15 executive departments, such as the secretary of state and the secretary of defense. However, seven more positions ""have the status of Cabinet-rank."" They include the White House chief of staff and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. To back Pocan’s claim, his office cited an article posted the day before his radio interview by a website called Quartz, which describes itself as a news outlet founded in 2012 ""for business people in the new global economy."" The article examined the wealth of 17 Trump selections -- 13 Cabinet members, plus four Cabinet-rank positions. The article said those 17 people have more than $9.5 billion in combined wealth -- ""greater than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined -- over one-third of the 126 million households total in the U.S."" That $9.5 billion is roughly in the middle of other estimates on the wealth of the Cabinet. On the high end, the Boston Globe, NBC News and CBS News put their estimates at $13 billion to $14 billion. But that includes $5 billion attributed to Todd Ricketts, Trump’s pick for deputy commerce secretary, which is not a Cabinet or Cabinet-rank position, and $5 billion for Trump’s choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a number that has its own problems. On the low end of the estimates is $6 billion, from Bloomberg. Bloomberg doesn’t count Ricketts. And it estimates DeVos’ net worth as only $130 million, not $5 billion. Both Bloomberg and Forbes point out that the $5 billion is the estimated worth of Richard DeVos, Betsy’s father-in-law and the co-founder of Amway, not Betsy DeVos’ wealth. The other wealthiest Trump Cabinet picks and their estimated net worth, according to Bloomberg: investor Wilbur Ross Jr., the choice for Commerce secretary, $2.9 billion; Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive officer and Trump’s choice for administrator of the Small Business Administration, $1.4 billion; and financier Steve Mnuchin, the choice for Treasury secretary, $655 million. One-third of U.S. households It almost doesn’t matter, however, whether the net worth of Trump’s Cabinet is $6 billion or more. That’s because one-third of American households combined -- which includes households with extreme negative net worth -- have essentially no net worth. Pocan’s claim, said University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, director of the school’s Center for Equitable Growth, ""is a pretty meaningless statement"" because ""the bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing -- some have negative wealth, some have very low wealth."" One reason for gaps in wealth is income inequality. The Urban Institute think tank, using the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances data, found that families near the top had a 70 percent increase in income from 1963 to 2013, while the income of families at the bottom stayed roughly the same. In fact, the bottom one-third of American households have a combined net worth of negative $50 billion, Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, told us -- though that is misleading in that it includes relatively few households with extreme negative net worth. If you exclude those households, the vast majority of households in the bottom third have a net worth of about $3.7 billion. So, if Trump's 17 Cabinet picks have a combined net worth of $6 billion or more, their net worth is greater than the least wealthy one-third of American households. But if the bottom one-third actually has a negative net worth, any 17 ordinary Americans who have a net worth of at least $1 would have a higher net worth than one-third of Americans. Our rating Pocan says Trump's first 17 Cabinet appointments ""have a net worth of more than a third of America."" One-third of American households have a combined net worth of roughly zero. So, the combined net worth of Trump Cabinet members is greater, but so is that of any American who has a net worth of more than zero. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a023f85-18f0-46c6-afaf-51178c79b199 Recent fact checks on wealth → While campaigning in Madison for Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders claimed Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walmart Walton family would ""get a $53 billion tax break.""

Tillerson could keep financial holdings as secretary of state
","Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil CEO who is President-elect Donald Trump's choice for secretary of state, owns more than $200 million worth of his company’s stock, according to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission filing. His shares in the giant oil company pose a potential conflict of interest if he is confirmed to the post. Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, said any conflict would become moot because Tillerson has to divest his shares from ExxonMobil before the Senate confirms him. ""First of all, he will have to divest his holdings, that’s a requirement,"" Collins said. ""So, there’s not going to be any conflicts when he is secretary of state."" Is Collins right? Is Tillerson required to divest his holdings? What the experts say Federal law prohibits cabinet members and other employees in the government’s executive branch from having a financial conflict of interest. Anyone who financially benefits from his or her decisions can face anywhere from one to five years of prison and a fine. ""It’s hard to imagine that anyone could reasonably assert that an interest in $200 million in Exxon stock is not substantial,"" said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a leading expert on legal ethics. That doesn't mean Tillerson necessarily has to sell his ExxonMobil stock. Experts we spoke to said Tillerson could legally hold onto his stock while serving as secretary of state -- as long as he takes one of three steps. First, Tillerson could have someone step in when matters of state present conflicts with his finances. ""He cannot participate in any legal matter that affects Exxon,"" Clark said. ""He would have to recuse and someone else at the State Department would have to participate instead."" Second, Tillerson could also place his assets in a blind trust, an arrangement where he would still own the investment but would not be able to manage or measure its performance. In other words, he would hand over the assets to an independent party and would not be able to know what’s happening with them until he leaves his position in the federal government, said Richard Briffault, the Joseph P. Chamberlain professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. ""As secretary of state, he might have to participate in decisions that would directly affect his financial interests,"" Briffault said. ""If so, he would have to divest or place the holdings in blind trust to avoid criminal liability."" Third, Tillerson could seek a waiver from the president-elect. The Office of Government Ethics says Trump would have to put in writing that he does not believe Tillerson's financial holdings present a substantial enough conflict of interest to violate federal law while he serves as secretary of state. Our ruling Collins said Trump’s pick for secretary of state ""will have to divest his holdings, that’s a requirement."" Legal experts we spoke to said the law forbids a financial conflict of interest for cabinet members. If Tillerson wanted to hold onto his stock in ExxonMobil, he would have to recuse himself of any state business related to the company. Or he could place his holdings in a blind trust during his tenure as secretary of state. Tillerson could also seek a waiver from the president-elect.  We rate this claim as False.",/factchecks/2016/dec/30/chris-collins/tillerson-could-keep-financial-holdings-secretary-/
"['Education', 'Illinois', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Emanuel's claim about college only somewhat accurate
","Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was live on more than 40 radio stations across Chicago with broadcast journalist Bill Kurtis last month talking about housing, crime and the presidential election. The discussion also turned toward education. ""We (Chicago) are the only city where if you get a B average in high school, community college is free,"" Emanuel said. ""I didn’t know that,"" Kurtis responded. Emanuel reiterated his claim, further explaining that Chicago was the only city in the United States to offer this incentive. Emanuel went on to say that if you keep the B average in community college, it was possible to get 30 percent to 40 percent off tuition for your remaining two years. Too good to be true? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Mayor’s Office for further comment, we were directed to a press release from May 2016. The release announced the Star Scholarship program, an initiative created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chancellor Cheryl Hyman of the City Colleges of Chicago in 2014. The Star Scholarship Program Does the Star Scholarship program guarantee high school seniors with a B-average free community college? To an extent, but there are a few more qualifications. In order to qualify for the Star Scholarship program, a high school senior needs to have a GPA of 3.0 or higher, which is equivalent to a B. However, a high school senior also needs to be ""completion ready,"" meaning students need to receive 17 or higher in math and English on the ACT. These qualifications go slightly beyond those outlined by Emanuel. And what about students who wish to continue on after their two years in community college? Will they get a 30 to 40 percent discount off their tuition? Maybe. It depends on which university or college the student applies to, and some institutions may also require ""additional academic merits."" As of the May press release, 15 four-year universities and colleges have become partners of the Star Scholarship program, with packages ranging from $2,500 to $50,000 per year. However, it is difficult to determine whether the 30 to 40 percent off figure quoted by Emanuel would be accurate in each student’s case. But is Chicago the only city to offer this? Another part of Emanuel’s claim was that Chicago was the ""only city"" in the United States to have a program like the Star Scholarship. However, a quick Google search revealed that this was not the case - Tennessee, Oregon, Minnesota, and Kentucky all have similar programs in place, which means students in cities in those states have access to such an incentive. When we emailed the Mayor’s Office enquiring about these other programs, we received a reply saying that Chicago was ""the first city to leverage free community college for high school students."" But when we looked at the programs’ establishments chronologically, Chicago does not appear to have been the first. Tennessee beat Chicago to the punch. In February 2014, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam announced the Tennessee Promise program during his State of the State address. The Tennessee Promise requires students to maintain at least a 2.0 GPA after being accepted into the program, and has some additional stipulations as well (such as community service). Emanuel did not announce Chicago’s Star Scholarship program until October 2014. Additionally, according to an article from the Chicago Tribune, Emanuel himself said ""the city took a page from Tennessee's plan in developing the Star Scholarship."" Our ruling Mayor Emanuel said, Chicago is the ""only city in the United States, you get a B average in high school, community college is free."" Chicago’s Star Scholarship program does allow students with a B average or higher to attend community college in the city for free. However, there are a few other requirements as well. In addition, contrary to what Mayor Emanuel stated, Chicago is not the only city to offer such a program. Other states, including Tennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota, and the cities within them, offer similar programs to high school students. While it is true a B average means you can go to community college for free in Chicago with some added requirements, Emanuel exaggerated his claim that Chicago is the only city in the nation to offer such an incentive. Therefore, we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/28/rahm-emanuel/fact-check-emanuels-claim-about-college-only-somew/
"['Technology', 'Florida', 'Jeff Brandes']","
In Florida, no permit needed for driverless cars, Florida senator says
","Uber hit the road with self-driving cars in San Francisco in December, but California regulators quickly hit the brakes. In Florida, state Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, saw an opening for the Sunshine state. ""Hey @Uber, unlike California we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required. #OpenForBusiness #FlaPol,"" Brandes tweeted Dec. 22. Brandes, who has been advocating for laws to allow driverless cars, is correct that Florida does not require a permit to operate or test a driverless car. But that doesn’t mean people should expect to hitch an automated ride any time soon. Driverless car laws Several car companies are developing fully autonomous or self-driving cars operated by computers and testing them in some states. But it could be several years before they are broadly publicly available due to the cost, questions about liability and the technology and as state government officials grapple with oversight. In September 2016, federal transportation officials issued loose guidelines for driverless cars which gave companies the green light to push ahead. The rules included safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policies. Some states have already done so. Since 2011, eight states -- Nevada, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah -- and the District of Columbia have passed legislation related to autonomous vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Governors in Arizona and Massachusetts issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles. Legislation has failed or is pending in several other states. The law is more strict in California than Florida. California passed a law in 2012 that allowed the testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Companies must apply for state permits and put up a $5 million bond. About 20 companies, including Tesla, Google and Mercedes-Benz, have been granted such permits. California revoked the registration of 16 Uber cars in December 2016 because the state said Uber lacked required permits. Uber complied but argued it didn’t need the permits because the vehicles required monitoring by a person in the car. While California’s law requires a permit, that’s not the case in Florida. ""Florida has the least restrictive active state laws for the operation of autonomous vehicles,"" said John Terwilleger, an attorney at Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart in West Palm Beach. Terwilleger represents a company that is involved in developing and using autonomous vehicles in Florida. In 2012, the Florida Legislature passed a law co-sponsored by Brandes that allowed a person with a valid driver’s license to operate an autonomous vehicle. Before companies could test autonomous cars, they had to submit proof that they had $5 million in insurance. But in 2016, the Florida Legislature passed new rules that eliminated some of the previous requirements, including the $5 million in insurance. The new law also got rid of the requirement that a human operator be present in the vehicle, as long as an operator can be alerted in case of technology failure and stop the vehicle. Since there is no permit for autonomous vehicles, the state has no information regarding how many Floridians own one, said Beth Frady, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Florida law treats an autonomous vehicle in the same manner as any other motor vehicle operating on our roads, said Chris Spencer, a spokesman for Brandes. ""There are no requirements for additional permitting, licensing, or approval from any state or local government body to operate an autonomous vehicle on our roads,"" he said. That’s still the case, even though Florida was the location of the first fatality involving a self-driving car. In May, Joshua Brown, was killed when his Tesla while on autopilot crashed into a tractor-trailer in Williston. Taking a ride without a driver While Brandes is correct that there is no special permit requirement, don’t expect driverless cars to flood Florida roads anytime soon. When Florida required testers to provide proof of insurance until that provision was dropped earlier this year, only one did. Brandes’ tweet was a shout-out to Uber, so we checked on Uber’s autonomous car plans. Currently, Uber only operates self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, but they still have a human in the driver's seat, said Javi Correoso, an Uber spokesman for Florida. Uber moved its San Francisco cars to Arizona but hasn’t started operating them yet. Another hurdle to Uber’s autonomous cars in Florida is that Uber’s human-driven cars aren’t everywhere in Florida. Only a handful of jurisdictions specifically allow Uber: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Hillsborough counties, as well as the cities of Gainesville and Tallahassee. Correoso said that Uber wants a statewide law to allow for Uber before it would move ahead with driverless cars in Florida. ""Until Florida passes statewide regulations, we haven’t even started the process of bringing this technology to Florida,"" he said. Our ruling Brandes tweeted, ""Unlike California, we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required."" Florida does not require a permit to operate driverless cars. California requires companies that are testing such cars to get a permit. Although Florida law welcomes driverless cars, we found no evidence that they are commonly used in Florida. Brandes’ comment is accurate, and we rate it True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/28/jeff-brandes/florida-no-permit-needed-driverless-cars-florida-s/
"['Immigration', 'Education', 'Texas', 'Lloyd  Doggett']","
Lloyd Doggett says by federal law, universities don't check immigration status of students
","A Democrat said Texas universities rightly don’t check on whether students are living in the country with legal authorization--in accord with federal law. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district stretches south into San Antonio, was asked in a December 2016 interview with Austin's CBS Austin to talk about whether certain college students should be worried amid threats to take away federal funding from so-called ""sanctuary campuses,"" presumably a reference to colleges and universities whose leaders indicate no desire to help immigration authorities pursue students who lack legal U.S. residency. Doggett replied by initially calling ""sanctuary campuses"" a misnomer. The former Texas Supreme Court justice went on: ""Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students, just as our public schools don’t. And that’s the right thing to do. There is a Supreme Court decision about the right to public education."" Doggett added that if there’s a dangerous person on campus, law enforcement should honor any arrest warrant from immigration authorities to assure safety. A 1982 Supreme Court ruling held U.S. children to be entitled to kindergarten through grade 12 public schooling regardless of legal residency status. Yet that decision wasn't reflecting on university access. So Doggett’s statement made us wonder how federal law keeps state universities from checking the immigration status of students. There isn’t such a law, it appears. And when we asked which law Doggett was thinking of, Doggett’s House chief of staff, Michael Mucchetti, said by email: ""His point is that current federal law doesn’t even require universities to check."" Mucchetti earlier noted that on Dec. 7, 2016, Denise Trauth, president of Texas State University, told faculty, staff and students in a Twitter post: ""The university, following current law, does not and will not report undocumented immigrants to authorities."" We didn't read Trauth's statement as her saying the university doesn’t check the immigration statuses of students. Beyond that, our requests that a university spokesman, Matt Flores, specify the law Trauth was talking about didn’t immediately draw a reply. Board that oversees Texas colleges, universities Next, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, about whether Texas universities check the citizenship status of students. In reply, Kelly Carper Polden emailed us a November 2016 agency overview of state laws that enable Texas residents lacking legal U.S. residency--either through citizenship or permanent resident/""green card"" status--to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates rather than more costly nonresident rates, provided the students have lived in Texas with a parent, guardian or conservator for 36 months up to high school graduation. ‘Affidavit’ students in Texas The overview gives the impression that Texas universities routinely tally students who lack legal U.S. residency. That is, the publication says that each benefiting student must complete an affidavit stating his or her intent to apply for permanent resident status in the U.S. as soon as he/she meets federal eligibility requirements. Also, the publication states, each ""public institution of higher education is responsible for acquiring and maintaining, indefinitely or until the student becomes a Permanent Resident of the U.S., signed affidavits completed by non-U.S. citizens seeking Texas resident status for in-state tuition purposes. ""In addition, Coordinating Board rules require institutions to remind affidavit students each year of their obligation to apply for Permanent Resident status as soon as they are eligible to do so,"" the overview states. ""The same rules require the institutions to refer students to the appropriate federal agency for instructions on how to achieve Permanent Resident status,"" the overview says. We’ve reported several times before on Texas ""affidavit"" students. Then-Gov. Rick Perry’s approval of the 2001 legislation authorizing such college admissions drew fire when he ran for president in 2012. The 2016 overview states that in fiscal 2015, through August 2015, the state’s 24,982 ""affidavit students"" included 17,384 students in public community, technical and state colleges; 7,580 students in public universities; and 18 students in public health-related institutions, costing an estimated $23.42 million in state appropriations while the affidavit students paid $58.3 million in tuition and fees, the overview states. Subsequently, web searches led us to a sample universal application for students seeking to enroll at Texas A&M University in fall 2017 that asks if the applicant is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or if the applicant fulfills state residency requirements related to fulfilling ""affidavit"" status. Also, to our inquiry, Polder pointed us to the state’s Core Residency Questions form last updated by the coordinating board in 2011; the form asks an applicant to attest to her or his U.S. citizenship or other residency status and includes this provision: ""I authorize the college/university to verify the information I have provided."" National perspective Nationally in November 2016, more than 500 college and university presidents called for preserving and even expanding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a 2012 initiative by President Barack Obama that enabled young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to go to college and seek work despite lacking legal authorization to live in the country. After spotting that call on the Pomona College website, we asked the college’s dean of students, Miriam Feldblum, who’s also an immigration scholar, if Doggett was right about federal law and universities not checking the immigration status of students. By phone, Feldblum said that’s certainly not so for international students, who must have visas to live and study in the U.S., and, she said, no federal law prohibits institutions from checking the immigration status of students. Regardless, she said, public colleges and universities focus for tuition purposes on whether applicants are state residents. Feldblum also stressed that federal privacy laws bar colleges and universities from unilaterally sharing the immigration status of a student absent the student’s consent or a compelling factor such as a subpoena. ""Right now, campuses are not sharing this information with anybody,"" Feldblum said. ""We have no obligation to do so."" Doggett aide: Claim mischaracterized We filled in Mucchetti on our finding no federal law forbidding universities from checking a student’s residency status. We also shared the state-published overview for Texas ""affidavit"" students. By email, Mucchetti suggested we were mischaracterizing the congressman’s statement. Doggett ""did not say that any federal law prohibits or bars universities from checking status. He was saying that educational institutions are not required by federal law to check status—that like our public schools, public universities, in accord with federal law, do not check,"" Mucchetti wrote. Our ruling Doggett said: ""Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students."" We see an element of truth here in that colleges and universities, like public schools, don’t act as immigration enforcement agents. But we didn't spot nor did Doggett identify a federal law that bars or excuses universities from checking the immigration statuses of students. Meantime, a state law leads public Texas institutions to tally ""affidavit"" students, each of whom has declared a lack of legal U.S. residency. Also, each student-applicant to those colleges and universities must answer questions about citizenship and legal residency and agree to have information verified. All told, we rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Did major crimes drop in Philly compared to other cities in 2016?
","Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration recently released a report stuffed with the good news that happened during his first year in office. It notes how the DNC was better for local businesses than the pope and contains plenty about the soda tax and the upcoming education initiatives it will fund. But the report first discusses crime, consistently one of the biggest concerns for Philadelphians who flirt with leaving the city. ""While many urban areas across the country saw a sharp increase in crime over the last year,"" the report reads, ""the Philadelphia Police Department successfully lowered part one crimes and increased drug seizures."" So what’s part one crime, and did Philly’s part one crime rate drop? And did other cities have difficulty keeping their overall crimes rates low? We decided to check. And for fun we’ll look into how this year’s change in the crime rate compares to the years of former Mayor Michael Nutter. First, Philly’s crime rate. Part one crimes are defined by the Uniform Crime Reporting Act as forcible rape, homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. The mayor’s report states that of part one crimes as of Dec. 11, homicide is down 1 percent, burglaries are down 14 percent, reports of rape down 10 percent and robberies down 8 percent. The administration said it obtained its data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Act. If you look at year-to-date statistics directly from the police department on Dec. 11, they’re slightly different. Homicide, for instance, was up 2 percent. But either way, part one crime was down 1 percent on Dec. 11 and violent part one crime was down about 5 percent, according to statistics from the police. The decrease follows a years-long trend for Philadelphia. Under the Nutter administration, violent crime decreased about 20 percent from when he took office in 2008 to the end of 2015. Most of the decrease took place in his last four years, but Philly experienced a slight decrease in violent crime in his first year before slight increases the next three years.     Not every city can tell the same story as Philadelphia about a reduction in crime and violent crime this year. Throughout 2016, national publications have hyped a rise in violent crime, particularly murder rates, for reasons unclear to experts. Among big cities that have experienced a surge in violent crime are Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles. As of last week, Dallas’ part one crime rate had increased .1 percent and Los Angeles’ 5.4 percent. Nearby big cities like New York and Baltimore have seen a decrease in part one crime, like Philadelphia, according to statistics from their police departments. A recent study by the Brennan Center looked at 21 of the 30 largest U.S. cities and compared projections of crime rates from 2016 to 2015, based on numbers it collected in September. It found the projected crime rate up 1.3 percent overall, a projection the Brennan Center described as ""nearly unchanged,"" the violent crime rate up 5.5 percent and the murder rate up 13.1 percent.     The Brennan Center notes most of the fluctuations in the crime rate fall within expected ranges and there has been no national wave of crime. The main reasons for stories about an unclear increase in murder and violent crime nationally are outliers like Chicago and San Antonio, which have seen their murder rates go up about 47 percent and 50 percent, respectively, this year. For overall crime rate, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, Charlotte and Oklahoma City were the only cities with increases in crime above 4 percent. Philadelphia is one of 13 of the 21 cities to experience a reduction in total crime and one of eight to see a reduction in violent crime.",/factchecks/2016/dec/27/jim-kenney/did-major-crimes-drop-philly-compared-other-cities/

Do seven children per day die from guns?
","U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, is one of California’s most prominent advocates for gun control -- and one of the few members of Congress to personally experience and survive gun violence. Speier was shot five times at point blank range in 1978 on a trip accompanying Rep. Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means. Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, she’s spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety. It was no surprise Speier spoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shooter killed 20 students, ages six and seven, along with six adult staff members in what’s considered the deadliest mass shooting at a school in U.S. history. On the anniversary, Speier posted an image on Twitter of herself holding a card reading #EndGunViolence. Above the image she claimed: ""Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."" We wanted to know whether the startling and somber statistic was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research A spokeswoman for Speier cited the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as the source of the statistic. She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign. But we found a similar statistic on the organization’s website: ""Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence."" The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19. The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015. To examine Speier’s claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting. We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19. That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speier’s claim of ""more than seven"" per day. These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides. About 36 percent resulted from suicides. Some might take issue with Speier lumping in 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds as children. Gun deaths for these two ages accounted for nearly half of the 7,838 young people killed in the two-year period. Here’s a look at the breakdown of deaths by age group: 0-4 years: 247 5-9 years: 218 10-14 years: 847 15-19 years: 6,526 The National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has stated that young people aged 15 to 24 are the group most at risk for gun violence. If considering only elementary school aged children, the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days -- still a tragic number, but not close to seven per day. We interpreted Speier’s use of the word children, however, to include a broader group of young people, including teenagers. Our ruling California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: ""Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."" Speier’s claim is backed up by the CDC’s fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. It’s important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speier’s statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speier’s claim might also lead some to think she’s talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children ""and teens"" are included in the seven deaths per day. Speier’s statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications.  We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/423277eb-4cab-4fc1-8ab5-357f808c343d",/factchecks/2016/dec/27/jackie-speier/examining-claim-7-children-day-die-gun-violence/

Pants on Fire: Larry Pratt says Obama hasn't decried killings of police
","Larry Pratt, the longtime leader of Gun Owners of America, says President Barack Obama has been nonchalant about ambush shootings targeting police.   ""There have been officers simply gunned down because they had a uniform on,"" Pratt said during a Dec. 15 radio interview on WINA in Charlottesville. ""It’s not just Dallas, it’s other places as well and the thing that frankly concerns me as I think about this is that the president not only has not condemned this, he actually seems to have a rationale that maybe this is what you would expect in the United States with its history of slavery and racial impression and so forth. ""That doesn’t help in the here and now,"" added Pratt, a Republican who represented Fairfax County in the General Assembly in the early 1980s. ""We don’t have slavery and we don’t have racial oppression, but we do have cops getting killed."" We wondered whether Pratt, whose organization is headquartered in Fairfax County and has criticized the NRA as being soft on gun rights, was correct that Obama never ""condemned"" the murders of police. So we examined the records and found three statements by Obama that decimate Pratt’s claim. Dallas On the night of July 7, 2016, a sniper killed five Dallas policemen and wounded seven in the deadliest attack for police since 9/11. The assassin, before dying at the scene, said he was angered by the fatal police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota that had dominated national news in previous days. Obama denounced the sniper’s acts the next morning as ""a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement."" He added, ""I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas."" The president also said, ""There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement."" Obama was in Europe at the time to attend a NATO Summit and to hold meetings with leaders in Poland and in Spain. He cut short the trip by one day to speak at a memorial service in Dallas for the slain policemen. Baton Rouge    Three Baton Rouge law enforcement officers were ambushed and shot to death on July, 17, 2016. The assassin, who was killed at the scene, had vowed in an email to avenge the recent police killings of blacks. Obama issued a statement that day that said, ""For the second time in two weeks, police officers who put their lives on the line for ours every day were doing their job when they were killed in a cowardly and reprehensible assault. These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop."" New York Two New York City policemen sitting in their patrol car were shot at point blank range on Dec. 20, 2014.  The New York Times reported that the murderer, who committed suicide near the scene, had made statements on social media that he planned to avenge police killings of black men earlier that year in Ferguson, Mo. and New York. Obama issued a written statement that day that actually used the word ""condemn."" He wrote: ""I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day - and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen."" We asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama. ""Nah,"" he replied, saying the president’s statements deploring the attacks on police have been tempered by other comments Obama has made legitimizing the distrust many blacks have of police officers. For example, Obama said on July 7, 2016, that while most police perform admirably, there are racial ""biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out."" Pratt told us that Obama ""has stirred the pot,"" on attacking police. ""He’s looking for division."" We should finally note that Pratt is not the first to accuse Obama of being aloof about the attacks on police. Our colleagues at PunditFact on July 8, 2016, examined a similar comment by William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Officers. They rated it Pants on Fire.   Our ruling Pratt said Obama never ""condemned"" murders targeting police. His outrageous statement ignores the president’s expressions of abhorrence following each of three different ambush murders of multiple police officers in the last two years.  Obama publicly called the killings ""vicious,"" ""reprehensible,"" ""cowardly,"" and ""despicable.""  Following the 2014 slaying of two New York policemen, Obama used the very word Pratt denies him, saying, ""I unconditionally condemn"" the murders. We rate Pratt’s claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2016/dec/27/larry-pratt/pants-fire-larry-pratt-says-obama-hasnt-decried-ki/
