Assemblyman Jack Conners says almost 88,000 U.S. service members are missing since World War II
","
As the United States continues to wage battle overseas, Assemblyman Jack Conners said the nation can’t stop looking for service members still missing from past wars.

""Almost 88,000 United States service members are still missing and unaccounted for, dating back to World War II,"" Conners (D-Camden) wrote in a July 16 opinion column for The Times of Trenton. ""For the families of these soldiers, closure has never come.""

Conners, chairman of the Assembly’s Military and Veterans’ Affairs committee, argued for continued support for the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, which is dedicated to accounting for all Americans missing from past conflicts. Without the work of that group, he said, ""closure may never come.""

PolitiFact New Jersey thought the number of unaccounted-for soldiers seemed high and checked Conners’ statistic. We found that while the assemblyman was mostly correct, the number of missing and unaccounted for from World War II was recently lowered.

A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester Jr., sent us a news release from 2010 and an article from 2009 from the U.S. Department of Defense that said 88,000 service members are missing or unaccounted for since World War II to back up Conners’ claim. Hester also said the number is cited by veterans’ groups, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, which referenced the figure in an opinion column posted July 13 on its website.

And up until a few months ago, that number was accurate.

The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office oversees the U.S. Department of Defense’s efforts to account for Americans missing from past conflicts. The agency keeps statistics on the number of service members still unaccounted for -- and they now put the number at 83,601, including: 73,792 from World War II, 7,997 from the Korean War, 125 from the Cold War and 1,687 from the Vietnam War.  There are also two U.S. service members missing from the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The biggest change in the overall figure is attributable to the number of missing from World War II, which was reduced from about 78,000 to more than 73,000 in May, according to Maj. Carie Parker, spokeswoman for the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office.

After World War II ended, the Army launched an initiative called ""The Return of the World War II Dead Program"" to account for all of the more than 400,000 Americans who died during the war, according to the missing personnel office’s website. When that program ended in 1951, an estimated 78,000 service members were still unaccounted for, according to Parker.  

In 2003, Parker said her agency found a 1956 roster of unaccounted-for service members that put the number at more than 80,000. Since then, more than 6,000 on that roster were found to have been buried at sea and another 780 remains were identified. Parker said the revised total of unaccounted-for service members from World War II was updated in May of this year.

Joe Davis, director of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States’ Washington, D.C. office, said in an email that his organization wasn’t aware ""the total missing and unaccounted-for number was lowered from 88,000 to 83,000 until just recently,"" and pointed out that in a recent opinion column by ""the VFW and seven other veteran and POW/MIA family organizations we, too, cite the 88,000 figure.""

Still, he said, ""whichever number is used, the Assemblyman is correct, because the loss is so monumental — and the circumstances of loss so catastrophic — that we may never ever be able to account for every single MIA, which is why the veterans' community and the families of the missing celebrate every new identification as if it were their own, because it means an American family somewhere finally has their loved one return home from war.""

Let’s review.

Conners said 88,000 service members are still missing since World War II. The number of missing was recently revised to more than 83,000 missing and unaccounted for, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Conners’ statistic may have been slightly dated, but his point -- that tens of thousands of Americans who served overseas remain unaccounted for -- is true.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

Lamar Smith seeks to suspend discretion that he once urged government to apply
","
Two U.S. House members whose districts take in parts of Travis County are on opposite sides of a proposal to suspend the Obama administration’s ability to permit selected illegal immigrants to stay in the country.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, further says the measure offered by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, runs counter to Smith’s 1999 request that authorities apply discretionary authority to prevent the deportation of some immigrants.

Doggett points out that Smith, in a 1999 letter to then-Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, then the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, called on the Clinton administration to let immigration authorities decide whether to enforce immigration laws in particular cases.

Now, Doggett suggests, Smith is sounding a conflicting note. 
A Smith switcheroo? We turned on the Flip-O-Meter.

In a statement, Smith told us he earlier referenced only cases against legal immigrants.

At first, we thought this would be a simple comparison of Smith’s Nov. 4, 1999, letter, posted online by The Huffington Post, to the change in law he seeks.

The 1999 letter expressed concern about how the government was removing ""criminal aliens"" from the country, stating there have been ""cases of apparent extreme hardship."" Its 28 House signers — including Texas Republicans Smith, Kay Granger and Sam Johnson and Texas Democrats Sheila Jackson Lee, Martin Frost, Eddie Berniece Johnson, Gene Green and Ciro Rodriguez — called for guidelines to ensure consistent application of ""prosecutorial discretion.""

The letter didn’t say it was speaking only to legal immigrants, though it had a sentence singling some out: ""Some cases may involve removal proceedings against legal permanent residents"" who, the letter said, came to the country when young and ""many years ago committed a single crime at the lower end of the ‘aggravated felony’ spectrum, but have been law-abiding ever since, obtained and held jobs and remained self-sufficient, and started families."" It added: ""Although they did not become United States citizens, immediate family members are citizens.""

At the time, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Russ Bergeron told the San Antonio Express-News the agency was developing guidelines for such cases. The article said Congress had taken away immigration judges’ discretionary powers, though some powers were later restored.

Some 5,500 of 55,600 immigrants with criminal records deported in fiscal 1999 were legal permanent residents, the newspaper said. The vast majority were illegal immigrants.

Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told us in a telephone interview the government issued guidelines per prosecutorial discretion in 2000, her last year as the INS commissioner in the Bill Clinton administration. Those guidelines have since been refined, she said.

Meissner said she sees a conflict between Smith’s 1999 letter and the legislation he and others unveiled last month that would bar the Obama administration from applying discretion in immigration cases. After rereading the 1999 letter, she said she never saw it as applying only to legal immigrants; its example of a legal immigrant is just a subset of all immigrants to whom prosecutorial discretion has long been applicable, she said.

Smith’s recent characterization of the letter, she said, is ""revisionist.""

Last month, Smith said his proposal, the Hinder the Administration’s Temptation Legalization (HALT) Act, would keep President Barack Obama from taking steps that Smith said amount to a ""backdoor amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.

In a July 12 press release, Smith accused the administration of using executive branch authority to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country. ""While this authority is justifiable when used responsibly, it’s clear this administration plans not to use but to abuse these powers,"" Smith said.

The press release refers to memos issued by John Morton, director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, on how to exercise ""prosecutorial discretion.""

One Morton memo, issued June 17, 2011, states the immigration agency has limited resources and ""must prioritize the use of its enforcement personnel, detention space, and removal assets to ensure that the aliens it removes represent, as much as reasonably possible, the agency's enforcement priorities, namely the promotion of national security, border security, public safety, and the integrity of the immigration system.""

It continues: ""Because the agency is confronted with more administrative violations than its resources can address, the agency must regularly exercise ‘prosecutorial discretion’ if it is to prioritize its efforts. In basic terms, prosecutorial discretion is the authority of an agency charged with enforcing a law to decide to what degree to enforce the law against a particular individual.""

Listed are about 20 factors immigration officers may consider when deciding to detain individuals. Among them: how long the person has been in the country, with particular consideration given to their presence here legally; if the person came here as a young child; if they’ve pursued a college degree; if they’ve served or have immediate relatives who have served in the military; their ties to the community, including family relationships; and their age, with particular consideration for minors and the elderly.

However, the memo says, certain negative factors also should be weighed, including whether individuals pose a clear risk to national security, are serious felons or known gang members, or have egregious records of immigration law violations.

The memo includes a disclaimer stating that nothing in it should be ""construed to prohibit the apprehension, detention, or removal of any alien unlawfully in the United States or to limit the legal authority of ICE or any of its personnel to enforce federal immigration law.""

A June 20 Houston Chronicle news article quotes a pro-immigration lawyer praising the memo, while Chris Crane, president of the union for ICE workers, the national ICE Council, is quoted saying the memo creates a law enforcement nightmare and an ""out"" for ""everyone illegally in the United States.""

""We will never know who we can and can't arrest,"" Crane said.

In the end, do Smith’s objections to the Obama administration’s approach conflict with his 1999 concerns?

Sure. While the 1999 letter gives Smith a little fuel for concluding otherwise, it seems reasonable to us that if the  House members writing that letter had wanted to limit their appeal to legal immigrants, they would have said so — at the very least saying that they opposed discretion for illegal immigrants. That did not happen.

With the HALT proposal, Smith hopes to bar the government from using discretion.

He's done a Full Flop.","[('\nThe Houston Chronicle, news article, ""New rules could spare some immigrants from deportation,"" June 20, 2011\n\nSan Antonio Express-News, news article, ""INS urged to keep children in mind,"" Sept. 9, 1999 (Nexis search)\n\nU.S. Rep.

"['Immigration', 'New Jersey', 'Alison Littell McHose']","
Assemblywoman McHose says illegal immigration costs New Jersey taxpayers more than $3 billion annually
","
New Jersey may be a small state, but it has big costs – especially for illegal immigration, according to Assemblywoman Alison Littell McHose.

""Illegal immigration costs state taxpayers over $3 billion every year,"" McHose claimed in a joint news release she issued on June 30 with fellow Republicans Sen. Steve Oroho and Assemblyman Gary Chiusano. Their districts cover Hunterdon, Morris and Sussex counties. ""We must always be strengthening our laws concerning illegal immigration and finding ways to make New Jersey affordable for legal residents.""

The press release was about the lawmakers’ efforts to bring a program known as E-Verify to New Jersey. E-Verify certifies that people hired by companies can legally work in the United States.  

Oroho is the prime sponsor of New Jersey’s E-Verify legislation (S-2733) in the Senate. Chiusano and McHose are the prime sponsors of the Assembly version (A-189).

Does New Jersey really spend more than $3 billion a year on illegal immigration costs? PolitiFact New Jersey checked the figures – provided by a group opposed to illegal immigration – and found that there is neither consensus on their accuracy, nor the methodology of how the group ascertained the costs.

Louis Crescitelli, McHose’s chief of staff, said in an email that McHose used a figure provided by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The group, known as FAIR, opposes illegal immigration and wants existing immigration laws enforced. The group claims more than 250,000 members nationwide.

McHose’s figure came from a July 2010 report by FAIR, ""The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers,"" which shows that illegal immigration costs (education, healthcare, insurance, social services, law enforcement and other expenses) total $3.47 billion in New Jersey. That’s nearly 10 percent of the state’s approximately $30 billion budget for fiscal year 2011-2012.

We found that very few organizations dig into the costs of illegal immigration because it involves counting a population that often doesn’t want to be counted, and government agencies often don’t break out costs of providing services to legal residents versus undocumented ones. As a result, costs assigned to illegal immigration are often estimates based on assumptions -- and one reason why FAIR has been criticized in the past for its findings.

FAIR’s report based its estimates on 13 million illegal immigrants in the country, broken down by state -- but there is no information in its report on how that breakdown was calculated. In looking at New Jersey, FAIR said it included 490,000 illegal immigrants and 96,000 of their American-born children, who are citizens by birth, in its data because those children would not be in the United States if their parents didn’t enter the country illegally. The report also assumes taxes are collected from 8 million illegal immigrant workers in the nation, half of whom are presumed to work in the ""above-ground"" economy, have two children and earn $31,200 annually.

In New Jersey, FAIR said illegal immigrants cost $2.4 billion for education; $509 million for health care; $335 million for justice-related costs; and $193 million for welfare and other expenses.

Jack Martin, a FAIR spokesman and an author of the report, said the figures are from part of 2008 and a larger part of 2009. Martin said it’s unlikely those figures have changed much in 2011.

""The estimates of the illegal immigrant population are not just dreamt up,"" Martin said. ""They are based on a methodology that looks at the change in size of the foreign-born population as measured by the U.S. census and shares that with data from Homeland Security. … It’s sort of a residual methodology of looking at the difference between those estimates, as well as people coming in from abroad for temporary work. The estimates are based on real numbers rather than plucked out of the air.""

At least one state has taken issue with FAIR’s methodology, challenging FAIR’s April 2005 report, ""The Cost of Illegal Immigration to Texans."" That report claimed Texans spent $4.5 billion on illegal immigration costs. The following year, the Texas State Comptroller’s Office released ""Undocumented Immigrants In Texas: A Financial Analysis of the Impact to the State Budget and Economy,"" which found revenues generated by illegal immigrants -- $1.5 billion -- exceeded the $1.1 billion in costs. For fiscal year 2005, that amounted to $424 million in revenue for the Lone Star State. One significant difference in the methodology: FAIR included the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants in its calculations. The Texas Comptroller’s Office did not because the children are U.S. citizens.

It’s worth noting that the New Jersey state Comptroller’s Office said it doesn’t track costs associated with illegal immigration.

PolitiFact New Jersey contacted several think thanks in Washington, DC, seeking figures to verify FAIR’s numbers, but found none.

""The problem with the undocumented population is they’re somewhat underground … there’s no way to say with any surety how much the undocumented population is costing one state,"" said Wendy Sefsaf, communications director for the pro-immigrant American Immigration Council, the parent organization of the Immigration Policy Council in Washington, DC.

Experts with the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, the Pew Hispanic Center and a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, agree that there’s a net fiscal cost to governments for illegal immigration costs, but note there’s no accepted methodology to determine those expenses.

Let’s review. McHose cites FAIR’s estimate that illegal immigrants cost New Jersey taxpayers more than $3 billion annually, but a number of experts say there’s really no accurate way to assess costs. The FAIR report also looks at estimated costs from parts of two different years -- not year over year, or a trend over several years. Still, experts agree that in most cases -- not including the Texas case we cited -- illegal immigration costs taxpayers more than what those immigrants pay into the economy. We rate this claim False.

"['Bankruptcy', 'Rhode Island', 'City Budget', 'Education', 'Daniel McKee']","
Cumberland Mayor McKee says Rhode Island is giving the Central Falls school system $8 million more than it should
","
The financially-troubled city of Central Falls filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection on Aug. 1, 2011, after receiver Robert Flanders Jr. was unable to get enough concessions from past and current employees.

Flanders took the action because of the city’s dire financial problems, driven in part by a grossly underfunded pension plan for police officers and firefighters. According to the filing, unless major changes are made, the city will have a deficit of $5.6 million by June 30, 2012.

Central Falls is the first municipality in Rhode Island history to file for bankruptcy.

In reacting to the development, Daniel McKee, mayor of bordering Cumberland, suggested in a radio interview that the tiny city's financial problems might be solved by shifting money the state is spending on Central Falls schools into the municipal budget. 

""Just on the state funding formula alone, you know that the schools are overfunded by state money by as much as $8 million,"" he told WPRO talk show host Dan Yorke. ""In terms of the student base and the student count, the new school funding formula details somewhere in the vicinity of about $8 million more than they need to operate the schools.""

McKee went on to say that ""just basic math says if they're four to five million under in the municipal side and eight million over on the school side, I know if that was in Cumberland, if I added the two together, I'd be running a plus $3 million. I think there are dollars on the table that, on a long term, hopefully the people who are going to make the decisions there are going to figure that out.""

So does Central Falls really have $8 million allocated to schools that it could use to cover the shortfall in its municipal budget?

First, a little background on the unique nature of the Central Falls school system.

In 1991, following years of financial difficulties in the city, the state took over operation and financing of the city’s school system. A board of trustees appointed by the Rhode Island Board of Regents now oversees the system.

Rhode Island taxpayers pay almost the entire cost of running the schools -- a total of $42.9 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30. (The city pays only to maintain the school buildings.) All other Rhode Island school systems are financed through a combination of local tax revenue and state and federal aid.

Now, back to McKee. We asked the mayor where he got his $8-million estimate.

He sent us to a web page from the state Department of Education, dated June 10, 2010, outlining year-by-year changes in the amount of money the state was planning to give the various school systems. The web site referred to overfunding for Central Falls schools.

To understand what the numbers mean, some explanation, courtesy of department spokesman Elliot Krieger.

Up until the mid-1990s, Rhode Island had a formula to determine how much state money to send to school districts. But the General Assembly froze the aid formula in the 1994-1995 fiscal year, opting instead to simply increase the amount each year in various ways that didn't necessarily reflect important elements such as student enrollment or poverty levels. It eliminated the formula altogether three years later.

After that, the increases varied year to year.

A year ago, the General Assembly passed a new funding formula that takes into account several factors, including enrollment, student need and local taxing capacity. Under the new formula, some school districts get a lot more money, and some a lot less.

Applying the new funding formula immediately would have been a huge shock to the system, at least for the communities that -- according to the formula -- had been getting far more state money than they deserved. So, under the plan, the overfunded communities would get their allotment cut, in steps, over 10 years. Underfunded communities would see their aid levels rise over 7 years.

According to the latest calculation from the Department of Education, the Central Falls school system is actually overfunded this fiscal year by about $14.3 million. The $42.9 million it received during the last fiscal year will be reduced by $1.4 million per year over the next decade, an amount that the state will adjust as enrollment and the city's demographics change.

That means this year the city is getting nearly $13 million more for its school system than the state says it should need -- $5 million more than McKee’s estimate.

McKee said that when he cited the $8-million figure, he was trying to avoid exaggerating the potential for savings.

But there is another problem with McKee’s statement and his underlying point.

Just because the state says a community SHOULD be able to run its school system on the level of funding calculated by the state doesn't mean that it CAN. Some expenses, such as teacher salaries, can remain locked in by contract for a few years.

McKee argues that things are different now that Central Falls is in bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy judge, at the recommendation of the state-appointed receiver, can make unilateral changes in just about everything, including contracts, and quickly bring expenses into line.

The result, he contends, would be immediate savings in the school budget that can be transferred to the municipal side of the ledger to solve the city's short-term fiscal problems.

""You've already got enough money internally inside of that community right now to operate without pestering the taxpayers of the state of Rhode Island,"" he said. 

Finally, and fundamentally, it's not at all clear that the ""excess"" money can be tapped by the bankruptcy court. According to Krieger, the education spokesman, those funds are in the state general fund and not earmarked for Central Falls itself. 

""Basic math,"" as McKee puts it, may not apply here. We'll have to wait and see.

But that issue goes beyond the scope of the statement that we're checking. 

In the end, while he was right about the overfunding, the dollar amount he cited was off by so much, we rate his statement Half True.

"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Texas has lowest per-capita state debt of big states and fourth-lowest of all states
","
Calling himself an unapologetic fiscal conservative, Gov. Rick Perry told the New Hampshire Union Leader the state’s fiscal efficiency matters most, adding that Texas ""has, I believe, the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states.""

Truth-O-Meter on.

Some background: Last year, we rated True a claim by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White that the state’s debt load had doubled in Perry’s then-nine-plus years as governor.

According to the Texas Bond Review Board, which oversees the issuance of most state bonds, Texas had $34.08 billion in outstanding bonds and notes as of Aug. 31, 2009, the end of fiscal 2009. That figure increased 11 percent to $37.82 billion as of Aug. 31, 2010, primarily due to increased debt commitments by colleges and universities and transportation-related debt, the board’s 2010 annual report says.

And how does the state’s debt boil out per resident?

The report says that in 2007-08, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, Texas was home to the second-most residents among the states, but ranked ninth among the 10 most populous states in state debt per capita, at $1,369 per resident. The report says New York topped the most populous states with state per-capita debt of $5,861.

Next, we asked the Census Bureau if it had more up-to-date figures. Spokeswoman Jenna Arnold pointed us to an online table listing each state’s debt in 2009. Drawing on the bureau’s 2009 population estimates for the states, we then calculated per-capita figures for the 10 most populous states that year. Texas’ per-capita state debt came out to $1,227, less than the per-capita debt of the nine other states. The other states: New York ($6,279 per capita); Illinois ($4,415); California ($3,642); Pennsylvania ($3,324); Michigan ($2,969); Ohio ($2,426); North Carolina ($2,121); Florida ($2,098); and Georgia ($1,374).

Also, we peeked at a post by the Washington-based Tax Foundation listing a slightly different per-capita figure for the state’s fiscal 2009 debt level, $1,240, placing Texas 49th among the 50 states. Massachusetts, ranked No. 1, had per-capita debt of $11,357.

For more perspective, we turned to the bond review board, whose executive director, Robert Kline, passed along a May 25, 2011, report by Moody’s Investors Service, which provides credit ratings and research covering debt instruments and securities.

The report covers state debt levels in 2010, stating: ""Two measures of state debt burden — debt per capita and debt as a percentage of personal income — are commonly used by analysts to compare the debt burden of one state to another. Debt burden is one of many factors that Moody’s uses to determine state credit quality. In considering debt burden, the focus is largely on net tax-supported debt, which Moody’s characterizes as debt secured by state resources.""

And Texas ranked 39th among the states, at $612 per capita, in net tax-supported debt, the report says. The national average for states was $1,404. The states with less debt than Texas were all less populous: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Montana, Arkansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa and Nebraska, which is listed as having the least per-capita net tax-supported debt among the states at $13. 
We noticed the Moody’s per-capita figures were smaller than those reached using the census data. That’s because the census bureau’s state debt totals wrap in more kinds of debt--for example, tuition revenue bonds issued on behalf of institutions of higher education. The bureau defines its debt tally as ""long-term credit obligations of the government and its agencies whether backed by the governments' full faith and credit or non-guaranteed."" 
By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the governor, speaking off the top of his head in the newspaper interview, had based his debt claims on Moody’s information. ""Texas does have the lowest debt per capita of the top 10 most populous states,"" Frazier said.

Frazier said Perry’s other claim, about Texas having the fourth-lowest debt per capita among the states, ties to Moody’s calculation of each state’s ratio of debt to gross state product. By that measure, she said, Texas is sixth lowest among the states. Indeed, the Moody’s report says Texas has a ratio of 1.66 percent, lower than ratios for every state except Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. The national average is nearly 4.5 percent.

The report says the ratio is useful for comparing different states and countries. In an interview, Moody’s analyst Nicole Johnson said that a relatively low ratio generally means a state has more flexibility to increase its debt than states with high ratios.

So, Texas has the least state debt per capita among the most populous states, as Perry says, and by Moody’s accounting the 12th lowest of all states. Perry incorrectly said it was fourth-lowest of all states, but his meaning holds up; Texas is a relatively low-debt state.

We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('\nNew Hampshire Union-Leader, news article, ""Perry gives first NH interview,"" July 24, 2011\n\nMoody’s Investors Service, charts, "" 2011 Net Tax-Supported Debt by State"" and ""Net Tax-Supported Debt as % of Gross State Domestic Product,* May 25, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Andrew Nowicki, associate analyst, Nicole Johnson, senior analyst, Public Finance Group, Moody’s Investors Service, New York, July 29, 2011\n\nTexas Bond Review Board, report, ""Fiscal 2010 Annual Report,"" December 2010\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, charts, ""State Government Finances: 2009,"" last revised January 13, 2011', 'http://www.unionleader.com/article/20110724/NEWS0605/707249985/-1/news')]",/factchecks/2011/aug/06/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-lowest-capita-state-debt/

""Alberta Darling’s Gone Too Far,"" the headline in one mailer reads. ""Allowing Mercury to Harm Our Children.""

Another mailer claims Darling ""voted to allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply.""

With these accusations flooding mailboxes in the weeks before the August 9, 2011, recall election between Darling and state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, we thought we’d take a look.

The ban and recycling program passed 23-10 with little fanfare and some bipartisan support in June 2009 and was signed by Gov. Jim Doyle. Five Republican senators joined the majority. Twenty-five states, including Minnesota, now have such programs.

Darling felt the fees and recycling requirements on manufacturers were excessive, said Andrew Davis, her campaign manager.

In the end, Darling, as the Sierra Club claims, did vote against the bill.

But the main thrust of the claim is that her ""allowing mercury to harm our children"" vote will ""allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply.""

The political director of the Sierra Club, David Blouin, said the claim is justified because the goal of the bill was to keep mercury and other toxins out of the waste supply.

""If it’s going into landfills, which all eventually leak, that threatens our water supplies,"" Blouin said. ""Any increase (in mercury waste) via reduction of regulation allows mercury to harm our kids, or potentially could.""

That’s a strong statement, but with a couple of big ""ifs.""

Let’s examine the evidence.

The nonpartisan U.S. General Accountability Office in 2005 reviewed studies on e-waste and found that, by one account, 100 million computers, monitors, and televisions become obsolete each year and that the level is growing. Research showed two major concerns: the loss of natural resources such as copper, and the potential release of toxic substances in the environment.

""EPA has identified lead, mercury, and cadmium (which are typically found in computers or monitors), as priority toxic chemicals for reduction under an agency program, the GAO reported. ""According to EPA, these toxic substances do not break down when released into the environment and can be dangerous, even in small quantities.""

EPA’s website says that some electronics (such as color CRT computer monitors, color CRT TV tubes, and smaller items such as cell phones and other ""hand-helds"") test ""hazardous"" under federal law.

The GAO report says that the Solid Waste Association of North America found an apparent increase in lead from used electronics showing up in municipal landfills. And ""tests conducted at the University of Florida indicate that lead leachate from color computer monitors and televisions with CRTs""... could be considered hazardous waste under federal rules.

But GAO added that the Florida researcher cautioned that his findings don’t necessarily mean it would leak from a modern landfill. And GAO noted that the Solid Waste Association declares municipal landfills as safe for managing used electronics ""without exceeding toxicity limits.""

The GAO’s bottom line: ""Regarding the issue of toxicity, the research we reviewed is unclear on the extent to which toxic substances may leach from used electronics in landfills.""

We heard the same kind of terminology about possible risks from other experts:

A Congressional Research Service report to lawmakers in 2002 said that ""disposal of these products, when they become ""e-waste""
at the end of their useful lives poses major potential environmental problems.""

""There is a possibility eventually that metals leach out over time,"" said Sarah Murray, a Wisconsin DNR employee who heads Wisconsin’s e-cycle program. That’s what drove states to implement the laws.

The new program ended an exemption for households and electronics disposal. The new program, Murray said, has boosted recycling through drop-off programs: 30 million pounds of various categories of electronics have been recycled since the law kicked in.

""It’s hard to say absolutely that there is less in landfills, but people have used it,"" Murray said.

Barbara Kyle, national coordinator of the San Francisco-based Electronics TakeBack Coalition, called e-waste laws common sense preventive measures. In Wisconsin, Kyle said, there was little resistance by manufacturers to the bill.

""It could cause harm, and it’s a waste of resources,"" she said. ""Can you prove it ever got into the water stream? No, you can’t prove a link because (electronics) are all crunched up with other garbage.""

We’ll give the final word to Brad Wolbert, Wisconsin DNR’s chief of recycling and solid waste.

Wolbert told us it’s true that landfill liners don’t last forever. And it’s true, he said, that mercury can get into landfill gas and escape. And DNR believes it makes sense to divert electronics from landfills.

But it’s a stretch to say that harm has already come, or will come, to anyone from metals in discarded electronics, Wolbert said.

""Nobody knows,"" he said.

Let’s dig out.

There’s little doubt that disposal of electronic products is a serious environmental issue involving hazardous substances.

There is an element of truth in that Darling voted against the bill that aims to prevent harm. The Sierra Club mailers, though, push past what is known and attack Darling for ""allowing mercury to harm our children.""

That day could come -- or not. But nobody claims it has already arrived.

Wisconsin Club for Growth says Rep. Sandy Pasch did nothing to stop fraud in the Wisconsin Shares child-care subsidy program
","
The Wisconsin Shares program was intended to provide child care subsidies so needy mothers could seek work. However, the taxpayer-funded program was rife with abuse and fraud as parents and child care providers alike scammed the system. 
Numerous calls for improvements to the $350 million program came after the Journal Sentinel published a series of stories, ""Cashing in on Kids,"" beginning in January 2009. 
In early 2009, after the initial stories ran, newly elected Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was among those from both parties calling for reforms. Among other things, there was a call for a comprehensive audit of Wisconsin Shares, to examine every element of the program from initial intake to the final payments. 
The legislative fallout from the stories forms the basis of TV and radio ads being run by the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth against Democrats, including Pasch, who faces state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, in an Aug. 9, 2011, recall election 
The radio ad against Pasch states:   
""Wisconsin taxpayers lost millions to people scamming the state welfare system and Representative Sandy Pasch did nothing to stop it. One provider stole enough money to buy an mansion with an indoor pool and basketball court. But Pasch voted against funding for fraud investigations even after it was reported that child care centers were used to transport drugs, launder dirty cash and provide fake employment for criminals."" 
(Similar versions  of the ad have aired against Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo, and Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Eagle River. Clark is challenging Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, while Holperin is being challenged by Republican Kim Simac. The ads are not available online. There also appear to be multiple versions of the ads airing in individual races.) 
So, did Pasch ""do nothing to stop"" people from scamming the system and vote against funding for fraud investigations? 
When we asked Club for Growth spokesman R.J. Johnson for backup, he cited the following as evidence: 
-- On June 16, 2009, Pasch voted against an amendment to the 2009-2011 budget to provide funding for welfare fraud investigations. 
-- Pasch voted against the 2011-’13 state budget, which included funding for welfare fraud investigations. 
The second claim is a bit of a reach. The 2011-’13 state budget contained some $605,500 to a year to investigate fraud in the Wisconsin Shares program. However, that was one tiny part of the overall budget, which Democrats opposed for much larger reasons. Indeed, the 2009-’10 state budget included funding for five new state workers to investigate fraud in Wisconsin Shares; Sen. Darling (and other Republicans) voted against that budget. 
Before we dig into the first vote, let’s look closer at the program and Pasch’s overall record on it. 
Wisconsin Shares was started in 1997 as part of the state’s welfare reform initiatives. The program was designed to give low-wage working parents assistance with child care, encouraging them to get and keep jobs, rather than stay on welfare. It serves about 34,000 families. 
Pasch took office in January of 2009, the same month the newspaper began publishing stories about problems with the program that allowed child care providers and parents to game the system. 
An early step taken to address problems with Wisconsin Shares came in February 2009 when lawmakers, including Pasch, voted unanimously to conduct a state audit of the program. 
That audit, released later that year, found that state regulators had misspent an estimated $20 million in 2008 alone. The audit also determined that about 11 percent of the cases studied had eligibility and other problems and said that the program has significant holes that allow the system to be defrauded and abused. 
Later in 2009,  lawmakers were considering the 2009-’11 state budget and several amendments dealt with the issue. 
One of them is the basis of the item cited in the Club For Growth ad against Pasch. 
Amendment #80, offered by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, called for spending $500,000 for additional welfare fraud investigations. The amendment was tabled on a 50-48 vote, with Pasch joining the majority. 
So Pasch  voted to table the amendment. 
But that amendment would have affected a different program called Food Shares, and not the Wisconsin Shares program that covers the child care payments. 
Beyond that, Pasch did support other measures to address problems with Wisconsin Shares. 
Other measures Pasch supported included the creation of Act 2, which included a fraud detection unit that led to the suspension of payments to 130 providers and identified millions in overpayments in 2010. She also supported Act 76, which stops providers with criminal backgrounds or a history of abusing public assistance programs from receiving program payments and being licensed to care for kids and suspends state payments if a provider is under investigation and increases state review of child care providers, employees, and non-client residents of in-home providers. Another bill she supported, Act 77, strengthens the state's ability to go after fraudulent child care center operators, even if their businesses have dissolved. 
And there’s the 2009-’10 budget -- which Pasch voted in favor of --  that included funding for the five additional state Wisconsin Shares fraud investigators. 
So let’s put this one to bed. 
The Club for Growth says Pasch ""did nothing to stop"" people from scamming the Wisconsin Shares program and voted against funding for fraud investigations. She did vote against a 2009 budget amendment that increased funding for fraud investigations (of a different program) and voted against the 2011-’13 state budget that included fraud investigation funds. 
So there is an element of truth to the statement made by Club for Growth. But Pasch and supported numerous other measures to address problems with the child care program, including ones that cracked down on fraud. That means the statement ""ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" 
And that’s the yardstick used by the Truth-O-Meter to describe one thing: a statement that is Mostly False.","[('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Lawmakers want review of system,""Jan. 27, 2009', 'http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/38508394.html'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Full audit ordered for state’s child care program,"" Feb. 19, 2009', 'No link'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Child-care audit finds 600 overdue inspections, other problems,"" Dec. 17, 2009', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/39852087.html'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel achives, ""Cashing in on Kids.""', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview, R.J.

Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce says Brown County increased spending 50 percent while Nancy Nusbaum was county executive
","
As she campaigns to upend GOP state Sen. Robert Cowles in one of the closely watched Wisconsin recall campaigns, Democrat Nancy Nusbaum is talking up her long record of public service.

Now an ally of Cowles, the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, is trying to use that record against Nusbaum.

In a television ad paid for by its issues fund, the heavyweight business group is ripping Nusbaum’s fiscal record during her eight years as Brown County executive, which ended in 2003.

""Spending went up, taxes went up,"" the ad says in part. ""Everything Nancy Nusbaum touches goes up. When Nusbaum was Brown County executive, spending went up nearly 50 percent. Tell Nancy Nusbaum we expect fiscal responsibility to be real, not a lot of hot air.""

In the ad, hot air balloons and rockets rise to underline the point.

When we sought backup from WMC, the group did not return calls. So we checked the record.

Brown County officials looked up the budget numbers for us, focusing on the seven budgets Nusbaum signed from late 1995 to early 2003.

Operating spending went up 53 percent over those seven years. That works out to an average increase of 6.3 percent per year. State, local and federal funds contribute to the budget.

So the ad is on target numerically.

Indeed, Nusbaum does not dispute the numbers in it and did not criticize the ad as unfair but noted the County Board had a role in the budgets.

By contrast, the spending increase over the seven years following Nusbaum’s tenure was 34 percent, which is 4.2 percent per year on average.

The ad pulls the statistic out without any context for what was behind it.

Why the dramatic difference in spending?

Nusbaum pointed to replacement of an overcrowded jail, the cost of state-mandated services, increasing urbanization and associated social service costs, and the costs of caring for an aging population, among other reasons.

Property values and state aid to counties were rising, welfare and jail spending grew rapidly, and counties saw big increases in administrative costs for things such as information technology, said John Reinemann, legislative director for the Wisconsin Counties Association.

Levy limits on counties were minimal compared with today, Reinemann noted.

Reinemann told us that 7 percent to 8 percent annual spending increases such as those in Brown County were not uncommon in the late 1990s among Wisconsin counties.

His view is backed up by a ranking of counties that shows Brown in the middle of the pack in growth of spending per capita from 1993-2001. That is from the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization.

Spending in six key categories went up 6.3 percent annually during that time, the group found.

Nusbaum, a retired teacher and former mayor of De Pere, said she prefers to point to the property tax rate instead of the total tax levy and kept it stable as executive. Brown County records show she did that.

But the rate does not reflect the true cost of government, especially when it comes to property taxes. The rate can stay steady or decline, but tax bills can rise if the property tax levy (an indicator of spending) goes up.

In Brown County, as elsewhere, increasing property values in the 1990s helped hold down the tax rate even as total tax levy collections rose. Statewide values jumped up 7.7 percent a year from 1993-2002, WTA found. In fact, statewide, net property tax rates actually dropped during the decade as property values soared.

Let’s conclude.

A business group spotlighted the budget increases during Nusbaum’s term, suggesting through words and graphics that they were sky high.

They certainly were large compared with the years that followed, for reasons related to decisions by Nusbaum, county supervisors, the state, and local residents -- as well as demographics and sociological trends.

The number -- 50 percent -- is on target.

But the ad leaves out information about the other factors that went into the spending. Indeed, Brown County’s spending was not atypical for the time and by at least one group’s measure was in the middle of the pack.

We rate the WMC claim Mostly True.","[('\nInterview with Nancy Nusbaum, candidate for state Senate, August 4, 2011\n\nInterview with Ellen C.

Miami-Dade superintendent says school district is the highest performing in the country
","
Addressing South Florida lawmakers Aug. 1, 2011, Miami-Dade school superintendent Alberto Carvalho had great news to share.

""Today,"" he said, ""we stand as the highest-performing urban school district in America.""

The declaration came based on two pieces of evidence, Carvalho told the Miami-Dade legislative delegation. The first, he said, were results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test. The second was the inclusion of Miami-Dade as a finalist for the respected Broad Prize -- which awards student achievement in urban districts.

""So today, very quickly, today we stand as the highest-performing urban district in America,"" he said. ""On the basis of two measures: No. 1 NAEP ... the only nationally administered exam as far as math, reading and science to fourth- and eighth-graders. ... And the results that we got over the past few months are impressive, to say the least.

""Our kids live in a community that grew in poverty 10 full percentage points from last year to this year, (yet) outperformed their peers nationally. New York, Chicago, L.A., Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., don't hold a candle to our kids' performance here in Miami-Dade. .... Second: We are one of four districts out of 15,000 districts nationally up for the Nobel Prize for urban education, the Broad Prize for Urban Education, a conservative think tank that looks at student achievement, narrowing the achievement gap and overall graduation rates for students across the nation. And out of 15,000 school districts, Miami-Dade is one of four finalists for this revered prize, which will be announced at the Library of Congress on Sept. 20th.""

PolitiFact Florida set out to see if Carvalho was right.

First some basics about the Miami-Dade school district, which is the fourth-largest in the country with nearly 350,000 students. About 70 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch and most are minorities -- 66 percent Hispanic, 24 percent black, 9 percent white and 2 percent other. The state of Florida, which gives individual schools and districts grades based on the FCAT, gave the district an overall score of a ""B"" for the 2010-11 school year.

The Broad Prize

The Broad Prize, established in 2002, is given to urban school districts based on academic performance and improvement and reducing achievement gaps among poor and minority students.

School districts can't apply for the Broad (rhymes with road) -- each year 75 are identified by the Broad Foundation as eligible. Broad generally defines eligibility as districts that serve at least 37,500 students, where 40 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch and at least 40 percent are minorities.

A group of education experts analyzes data -- including performance and improvement in reading and math, graduation rates, participation in advanced placement course and college entrance exam scores among other factors -- to select four finalists.

Experts then make site visits and a jury of business, government and public service leaders review the data and select one winner. The top winner earns $550,000 in college scholarships while the other finalists get $150,000 in scholarships.

Miami-Dade has never won but was one of four finalists in 2006, 2007 and 2008 while neighboring Broward County was a finalist in 2008 and 2009. Both Broward and Miami-Dade are finalists again this year, and the 2011 winner will be announced Sept. 20 in Washington.

The focus isn't just on academic performance -- the key here is looking at improvement and shrinking disparities between different groups.

A press release from Broad summarizes some of the reasons Miami-Dade was chosen as a finalist in 2011:

• In 2010, the district outperformed other Florida districts that serve students with similar family incomes in reading and math. The district's Hispanic students performing at the highest levels performed in the top-third compared with Hispanics in other districts in Florida at all school levels in reading and math. For blacks at the highest levels, they performed in the top-third compared to blacks in other districts in Florida in math and in reading at the elementary and high school levels.

• Between 2007 and 2010, Miami-Dade was more successful than the vast majority of Florida districts at improving the percent of poor students who performed at top levels in reading and math at the elementary and high school levels and increased participation for all students in ACT and AP.

National Assessment of Educational Progress

The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a test in reading, math and other subjects given to a sample of students nationwide every other year. The federal government compiles the data to create the ""Nation's Report Card"" and data on urban districts -- 18 in 2009 -- are compiled separately. Those urban districts, known as the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) are defined as districts located in cities with a population of at least 250,000 where the majority of the students are black or Hispanic or eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.

Miami-Dade was the only Florida district included in the urban assessment in 2009 -- Broward takes the NAEP and is factored into the national scores but doesn't meet the urban criteria.

The Miami Herald wrote about the results from 2009 and noted that overall on the reading exam, the county's fourth- and eighth-graders outperformed their peers in New York, Boston, Atlanta and Los Angeles.

""In particular, Miami-Dade's Hispanic students shone. They scored higher than their counterparts in any other large city where the test results are studied and well above the national average for Hispanic students,"" the Herald wrote May 21, 2010. ""Black eighth-grade students also bested the average among their counterparts in other big cities.""

We asked Arnold Goldstein, a program director in the assessment division at the National Center for Education Statistics, to compare Miami-Dade's test performance to other TUDA districts.

""In summary, in mathematics there were a few districts where the average NAEP score was higher than Miami-Dade at both grades 4 and 8,"" Goldstein said in an e-mail. ""In reading, no districts scored (significantly) higher than Miami-Dade at either grade, although some districts’ scores were not significantly different from Miami-Dade. ... We only say there is a difference between two scores if the difference is greater than the margin of error.""

Goldstein sent us a chart based on NAEP test scores comparing Miami-Dade to the 17 other TUDA districts. It generally showed that Miami-Dade scored better than most of the urban districts but often fell into a group of a few districts with similar scores.

• Fourth-grade math: Two districts performed better than Miami-Dade while five received similar scores and 10 had lower scores.

• Eighth-grade math: Five districts performed better than Miami-Dade while two received similar scores and 10 had lower scores.

• Fourth-grade reading: No other district performed significantly higher -- three had similar scores and 14 were lower.

• Eighth-grade reading: Five received similar scores to Miami-Dade while 12 were lower.

The report cards also show how Miami-Dade's gaps in achievement between different ethnic and income groups compared to other large cities. The large cities aren't limited to the 18 TUDA districts -- they are defined as cities with at least 250,000 people.

For example, the eighth-grade reading report card shows that poor Miami-Dade students scored 17 points lower than those who weren't poor -- but that gap was 24 points lower for the average of large cities. On eighth-grade math, Miami-Dade black and Hispanic students scored lower than whites -- but again there was less of a disparity than the national large city average.

Our ruling 
Carvalho told PolitiFact Florida that his comments come with an additional caveat -- that he was only comparing Miami-Dade to the largest urban school districts in the nation, those with more than 250,000 students. That distinction  excludes many of the districts in the NAEP test, including those that have scores comparable to Miami-Dade -- like the public schools systems in Austin, Texas, Charlotte, N.C., and the metro area around Louisville, Ky. 
Those districts are smaller and their students are less diverse. 
The NAEP results, when combined with Miami-Dade's inclusion as a finalist for Broad, speak for themselves, Carvalho said. 
""So when I say that, I'm pretty confident,"" he said. 
We're not quite there. 
The fact is that while Miami-Dade has been a finalist for the coveted Broad Prize four times, it has not yet won. And Miami-Dade's standing on the NAEP tests depends on if you count districts with a student population under 250,000. 
In the end, we don't want to undersell Miami-Dade's successes. But we don't want to oversell them either. We rate Carvalho's claim Half True.","[('\nThe Broad Foundation,\xa0""About the Broad prize,""\xa0Accessed Aug. 4, 2011\n\nThe Broad Foundation,\xa0Press release ""Broward County, Miami-Dade County schools named two of the four top urban school districts in America as finalists for Broad Prize for Urban Education"", April 5, 2011\n\nNational Assessment of Educational Progress,\xa0""The Nation\'s Report Card,""\xa0Accessed on Aug. 4, 2011\n\nMiami Dade School District,\xa0""Importance of Subgroup membership and its contribution to equitable school district comparisons,""\xa0June 2011\n\nSt. Petersburg Times The Buzz,\xa0""Miami-Dade students leave Oregon in the dust,""\xa0June 3, 2011\n\nMiami Herald\'s Naked Politics blog,\xa0""A divided Miami-Dade delegation agrees to push charter reform next year,""\xa0Aug. 1, 2011\xa0\n\nMiami Herald,\xa0""Miami-Dade, Broward schools vie for education prize,""\xa0April 5, 2011\n\nMiami Herald,\xa0""More Dade schools earn top grades,""\xa0June 30, 2011\n\nMiami Herald, ""Miami-Dade students excel on reading,"" May 21, 2010\n\nAventura Business Monthly,""South Florida\'s best and the brightest: Alberto Carvalho,""\xa0Aug. 1, 2011\n\nEducation Update Online,\xa0""Miami-Dade Superintendent Alberto Carvalho,""\xa0March/April 2011\n\nInterview, Miami Dade school spokesman John Schuster, Aug. 3-4, 2011\n\nInterview, Arnold A.

Roemer faults Obama and Congress on budgets
","
Former Louisiana Congressman and Governor Buddy Roemer has been out of politics for a long time but he still knows how to throw a jab.

Perhaps best known for switching parties from Democratic to Republican as governor in 1991, Roemer left politics some 16 years ago to work as a banker. Now, he’s back as a populist GOP presidential candidate who says he's fed up with special interest money. A couple of days before announcing his bid, Roemer squared off on President Barack Obama.

""Someday, somehow, somewhere, sometime, the president of the United States and his party have to be responsible for running the country,"" said Roemer, 67, at a press conference in Bedford, N.H.

He continued: ""I am embarrassed that two and a half years into his [President Obama's] term in office he's never submitted a budget. You know Congress has worked two years without passing a budget.""

His pronouncement was startling. No budget? What has the president been doing up there in Oval Office?

Asked to back this statement up with facts, the Roemer campaign declined to comment.

So we turned to the experts, checking the public record and reaching out to five economists across the political spectrum.

Not true, they all say.

As per law, Obama has submitted a budget for each fiscal year he’s been president -- fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to a quick check on the Government Printing Office’s website, where the documents are posted. It’s as simple as that.

But regarding Roemer’s second claim-- that Congress has worked for two years without adopting a budget -- budget experts say Roemer has a point.

Congress last adopted a budget resolution in fiscal year 2010. It neglected to do so in fiscal year 2011 and appears unlikely to agree on a budget framework for the next fiscal year, 2012, which begins Oct. 1, said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending.


The budget resolution sets spending limits for broad categories of funding and is usually the first step for Congress in adopting a budget. The budget resolutions are important ""organization and enforcement documents"" to guide Congress through achieving most of what’s in the president’s budget, Ellis said.

Without a budget resolution, ""it makes it harder to enact spending bills because you don’t know exactly what the bottom line is,"" Ellis said. ""It’s not a good way to govern. It makes it a lot harder to hammer out a deal.""

After the president’s budget is submitted, House and Senate budget committees are supposed to draft budget resolutions, frameworks intended to guide the spending process, which then go to the floor for approval.

Once adopted, the two resolutions go to a House and Senate conference committee, where they are reconciled and sent back to the respective chambers for final approval.

But that process hasn't been working. In 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill ""because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders,"" Ellis said.

In April, 2011, without a budget resolution, Congress, with the House controlled by Republicans, agreed to a spending bill for fiscal 2011 in order to avoid a government shutdown. That bill provides funding through the end of September, 2011. The budget resolution provides the blueprint  for such legislative activity but it’s not necessary to the process, said Jim Horney, an economist with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  

""While (Congress) did not agree on a budget resolution … it did of course, pass those appropriations and other budget legislation for fiscal year 2011 and is working on legislation for 2012,"" Horney wrote in an e-mail.

And this year, it appears again unlikely that Congress will adopt a budget resolution. The now GOP-controlled House approved its budget resolution -- commonly referred to as the Paul Ryan Plan after its principal author, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House budget committee -- which Democrats consider ""draconian,"" Ellis said.

The Senate Budget Committee unveiled a framework in early July, 2011, but the Senate has not yet approved any resolution.

And it appears the adoption of a budget resolution has been overtaken by events, Ellis said. The debt ceiling plan approved by Congress will establish a discretionary spending cap, which is much of what would be accomplished by a budget resolution.

Sen. Kent Conrad, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, acknowledged as much in the conclusion of his budget framework address on the Senate floor on July 11, 2011.

Conrad said: ""That is the blueprint the Senate Budget Committee Democrats are laying before our colleagues. We are under no illusions. We know this is a year in which the normal process is not being followed. We understand there are leadership negotiations at the highest level, so we understand this is not going to be dealt with in the normal course of doing business.""

Our Ruling

Roemer erred in saying Obama had not submitted a budget. In fact, he’s submitted three.

But there is some truth on the second part of his statement. Congress didn't pass either a budget resolution or a spending bill in 2009 and 2010. A last minute spending bill finally passed in April 2011 under the threat of a government shutdown. And, since then, the passage of the debt ceiling increase has made the passage of a budget resolution for the current fiscal year less pressing.

Taken in the context of his remarks, Roemer’s assertion implies that Obama and the Democrats have been irresponsible -- and as a result, there has been no budget for the last two years. Obama submitted budgets, but it is true that during 2009 and 2010, when Democrats controlled the Congress, no budget was passed. As a result, we rate this statement Half True.

Wisconsin state Sen. Alberta Darling says Rep. Sandy Pasch voted to allow using tax money to pay for Viagra for public school employees
","
One of the eye-catching direct mail pieces of the Senate recall campaigns is Republican Sen. Alberta Darling’s depiction of her opponent, Democrat Sandy Pasch, on the screen of an electronic tablet.

""iBad, The Sandy Pasch Edition,"" the mailer shouts.

It invents applications such as ""iSpend,"" ""iTax,"" ""iOink,"" and ""iBilk"" to paint Pasch as a tax and spend liberal.

The ""iBilk,"" the mailer says, ""runs union applications that send taxpayer dollars to the bedroom -- for Viagra -- instead of the classroom.""

That’s right, Viagra is a topic in the Milwaukee-area Senate recall to be decided Aug. 9, 2011.

Darling also focuses on the issue in a campaign TV ad that says: ""Sandy Pasch even voted to allow public school employees to use taxpayer dollars to pick up the tab for…Viagra.""

Did Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, vote to give teachers health insurance coverage that paid for Viagra and other pills for erectile dysfunction?

The Viagra issue won wide publicity in 2010 when the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association sued the Milwaukee Public Schools over the issue, claiming men were unfairly discriminated against by an MPS decision to stop covering the pills.

MPS first agreed to cover the drugs in 2002, leading to 1,002 claims for such drugs from MPS employees by 2004. During negotiations with the union for its 2003-2005 contract, MPS tried to stop coverage of the drugs, citing rising costs.

An arbitrator sided with the district in 2005, leading to further appeals that ultimately did not go the union’s way. The 2010 union lawsuit was dropped in March 2011, in effect settling the issue in favor of the district.

We asked Darling’s camp to explain the connection between the nearly decade-old MPS dispute and Pasch, who was elected in 2008.

Andrew Davis, Darling’s campaign manager, did not cite a specific vote on the MPS issue or on coverage of Viagra.

He offered a more general response, saying that Pasch has stood with unions and backed union rights in the controversy over Gov. Scott Walker’s move -- supported by Darling -- to curtail collective bargaining for public employees.

Said Davis: ""The extent of collective bargaining gave unions the power to bargain for Viagra, and that bill was put on the backs of the taxpayers.""

But that’s not what the TV ad said.

Pasch is pro-union, and has supported a reversal of the collective bargaining limits that Walker and GOP lawmakers put through. But she has at times disagreed with the Milwaukee teachers union.

That union recently declined to reopen bargaining to talk about contributing more toward teachers benefits in order to possibly save some jobs. Pasch said she wished they had come back to the table.

But there was no legislative vote related to Viagra.

And Pasch came into public life three years after an arbitrator ruled MPS could deny Viagra to employees.

Darling tries to make the case that collective bargaining enabled the union to get Viagra coverage. But MPS management was the party that signed off on it.  Even if MPS didn’t have to negotiate with employees in the early 2000s, it could have added the drugs. And it didn’t need an end to collective bargaining in 2011 to make the call to drop the drugs -- it did that years earlier.

The bottom line?

In seeking to tap into anger in some quarters over the Viagra issue, Darling claims Pasch voted to allow it for school district employees.

Darling cites Pasch’s support for collective bargaining. But there was no vote in Madison on the matter. The issue was resolved in Milwaukee when an arbitrator ruled in favor of the school district -- years before Pasch came to office.

Sen. Tom Coburn says government is twice the size it was a decade ago
","
EDITOR’S NOTE: Upon further consideration, we have changed the rating on this item from Mostly True to Half True. The new analysis is below. Our previous posting is archived here.

On the July 24, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to give some perspective on the size of federal spending -- a central factor in the current debate over raising the debt ceiling.
   
Addressing host David Gregory, Coburn said, ""David, everybody's talking about the symptoms of our problem instead of the real disease. The government's twice the size it was 10 years ago. It's 30 percent bigger than it was when (Barack) Obama became president. The problem is that we're spending way too much money, and it's not hard to cut it without hurting entitlement benefits. But we don't have anybody that wants to do that without getting a tax increase.""
   
We wondered whether Coburn was right that the size of government has doubled over the past 10 years.
   
We began by looking at the size of outlays by the federal government, even though Coburn didn’t specify which level of government he was talking about. (Coburn communications director John Hart later confirmed that he had meant to refer to just the federal government.)

We also decided to use outlays as our yardstick -- rather than, say, government employees or regulatory burden, as some readers later suggested -- since Coburn went on to say, ""we're spending way too much money, and it's not hard to cut it without hurting entitlement benefits.""
   
Here are annual figures from the Office of Management and Budget for total federal outlays:
   
Fiscal year 2001: $1.86 trillion
Fiscal year 2002: $2.01 trillion
Fiscal year 2003: $2.16 trillion
Fiscal year 2004: $2.29 trillion
Fiscal year 2005: $2.47 trillion
Fiscal year 2006: $2.66 trillion
Fiscal year 2007: $2.73 trillion
Fiscal year 2008: $2.98 trillion
Fiscal year 2009: $3.52 trillion
Fiscal year 2010: $3.46 trillion
Fiscal year 2011 (estimate): $3.82 trillion
   
So, doubling the 2001 outlays over 10 years would have meant a 2011 figure of $3.72 trillion. Since the actual figure is higher than that, Coburn is right that the cost of government has doubled over the past decade.
   
In our initial analysis, we stopped there and did not adjust these figures for inflation. After readers pointed this out to us, we ran the inflation-adjustment calculations and determined that the fiscal 2011 federal outlay of $3.82 trillion was equivalent to $3 trillion in 2001 dollars. That produced an increase in federal outlays of 60 percent over 10 years. That’s still a significant increase, but short of double. We also calculated that government outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product, rose from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.3 percent in 2011 -- an increase of 39 percent, which is also not double.

Despite our initial focus on non-inflation-adjusted numbers, we have since decided that our readers had a point, and that Coburn would have been better off using inflation-adjusted numbers. So we have decided to change our ruling.

Meanwhile, we also looked at Coburn’s second claim, that government expenditures are 30 percent bigger than they were when Obama became president.
   
For this one, it depends when you start the clock. We’ll start with non-inflation-adjusted numbers.

If you use fiscal 2008 as the baseline -- which we confirmed with Coburn’s staff was his intention -- then the comparison is just about right. Federal outlays increased by 28 percent between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2011, which is just below the 30 percent Coburn cited.
   
However, fiscal 2008 ran from Oct. 1, 2007, to Sept. 30, 2008, ending almost four months before Obama took office. The OMB only offers figures by fiscal year, so we can’t pinpoint a number that’s pegged precisely to when Obama took office.
   
If instead you use as a baseline fiscal 2009 -- which started on Oct. 1, 2008 -- then federal outlays increased by about 9 percent, or well below what Coburn said.
   
The inflation-adjusted numbers are a 22 percent increase if you start with 2008, and 3 percent if you start with 2009.

Clearly, the shift of the calculation by just one year makes a big difference in the result.
   
We also considered whether Coburn intended to blame Obama for this spending increase. This was a tough call. Re-reading his claim, we don’t feel that his use of the inauguration of a new president as the cutoff point necessarily invokes blame. The entirety of Coburn’s comment encompasses government growth over a 10-year period, most of which was clearly under a Republican president, George W. Bush, and not Obama. And the inauguration of a new president is a pretty natural dividing line for making mathematical comparisons.
   
""No one has a more consistent record of being a nonpartisan critic of spending than Coburn,"" said Coburn’s communications director Hart. ""He has been criticizing Republican and Democratic spending for many years.""
   
We agreed with this assessment, so we gave Coburn the benefit of the doubt on whether he intended to place the blame for government growth on Obama. And we stand by that decision.
   
So what's the bottom line? We don’t think that Coburn was entirely wrong to use non-inflation-adjusted dollars, but it would have been better if he -- and we -- had adjusted for inflation. Doing it this way still means there was a significant increase in government over the period he studied, but not as high as he had indicated. On balance, we have decided to lower our ruling from Mostly True to Half True.","[('\nTom Coburn, comments on Meet the Press, July 24, 2011\n\nOffice of Management and Budget, ""Table 1.1—Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789–2016,"" accessed July 26, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with John Hart, communications director for Tom Coburn, July 24, 2011', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43858388/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/')]",/factchecks/2011/aug/05/tom-coburn/sen-tom-coburn-says-government-twice-size-it-was-d/

Forbes says U.S. defense spending, measured against GDP, is near historic low
","
U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes recently argued it was time to ""go on the offense"" against proposed cuts to defense spending.

""As a percentage of our gross domestic product, the defense budget remains just 3.6 percent,"" Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a July 25 column in Politico. ""This figure is low by all historical standards.""

Forbes’ district is anchored in South Hampton Roads where military installations dominate the economy. He has been warning that the nation’s security would be hurt by defense cuts that have been proposed during the fight to rein in the federal budget deficit.

Is defense spending really lagging when viewed through the lens of history? We decided to check.

First, a definition: Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is the measure of all goods and services produced in a country during a given time and is used as measure of a nation’s standard of living.

Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, said the congressman’s assertion that the defense budget comprises 3.6 percent of the GDP comes from the president’s 2011 budget proposal.  It showed the ""base budget"" authority allocated to the Department of Defense was expected to come in at $550 billion -- or 3.6 percent of the roughly $15 trillion GDP estimated for 2011.

Though analysts often refer to the Pentagon’s base budget when discussing military spending, it doesn’t include all defense spending. It omits billions of dollars set aside each year to pay for operations overseas, including in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Figures from the Department of Defense and the president’s 2012 fiscal year budget show that when those other costs are included, the national defense budget for the agency comes to about $700 billion for fiscal 2011, which ends Sept. 30. That’s just under 5 percent of GDP.

These numbers refer to ""budget authority"" -- the amount congressional appropriators set aside each year for current and future defense spending. Another way to look at defense spending is by examining outlays, the actual money paid out for defense each year.

Those two sets of numbers will differ in a particular year, but analysts told us that over time, they almost completely equal out as the government spends the money that’s been authorized by Congress.

Forbes’ spokesman also pointed to a November 2010 report from the Center for Strategic & International Studies. It says that, with the exception of President Bill Clinton’s term and a couple years preceding the start of the Korean War in 1950, U.S. defense spending measured as a percentage GDP is the lowest since World War II.

We found tables from the Office of Management and Budget showing national defense spending was below 5 percent only in the late 1940s, late 1970s and since the start of the early 1990s.

Forbes said that defense spending is low ""by all historical standards."" We found data that rebuts that contention. During the 1930s, for example, defense spending amounted to 1 percent or lower of GDP, according to a 2002 Congressional Research report.

Two analysts told us that for comparison purposes, it’s best to measure the U.S. defense spending after the World War II. ""The (pre-World War II) spending was a reflection of the fact that we were not a global superpower,"" said Daniel Goure, vice president of the Lexington Institute.

So, when measured as a percentage of the GDP since World War II, defense spending is low.

Two defense analysts told us that Forbes’ use of GDP to measure the defense budget is a legitimate gauge.

But Winslow Wheeler, director of the Strauss Military Project at the Center for Defense Information, argued GDP is an unreliable measure of the amount that the U.S. spends on defense.

After all, GDP is constantly changing, he said. Even if the defense budget is on the rise, it could become a smaller percent of the nation’s overall economic output if GDP increases at a faster pace.

Forbes ""is engaging in that sliding slippery scale,"" said Wheeler, whose group was founded by retired military officers to analyze defense issues. ""He’s trying to make the defense budget look small. It’s not.""

Wheeler also noted that the base budget that Forbes cites only accounts for Department of Defense spending and doesn’t include other military-related costs, such as money spent every year by the Department of Energy to maintain the country’s nuclear stockpile.

Even when adjusted for inflation, the total dollars dedicated to national defense is now at its highest level since World War II, Wheeler said.

Figures from the Department of Defense comptroller’s office show that, when measured in 2005 dollars, the total spending on national defense peaked at just more than $900 billion in 1945 before falling off. It didn’t approach the $700 billion mark until the 2011 fiscal year.

The Center for Strategic & International Studies report also notes that the U.S., by far, spends more money on defense than any other country in the world.

The U.S. accounted for 46.5 percent of global military spending in 2009, according to the CSIS report. China only accounted for 6.6 percent with France in third at 4.2 percent.

To summarize:

Forbes said the U.S. defense budget stands at 3.6 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, a figure that’s ""low by all historical standards.""

Forbes’ statement stems from a base budget for defense that omits spending for the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. When those costs are factored in, defense spending comes to about 5 percent of GDP. Even at that higher level, spending is low compared to the post World War II era.

So Forbes is right that the U.S. defense budget is at a relatively low mark when it’s measured by the country’s economic outlook. But by other measures -- such as using inflation-adjusted dollars and comparing U.S. expenditures to the rest of the world -- America’s defense spending is high.

Marcia Fudge says 25% of mortgage borrowers are under water and 11% of all homes are vacant
","
Mortgage foreclosure problems have been a top concern the past several years for many politicians including, Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge.

Fudge, of Warrensville Heights in suburban Cleveland, took to the House of Representatives floor on Dec. 15  to call for legislation to revitalize neighborhoods plagued by vacant and abandoned homes.

""Remnants of the foreclosure crisis linger everywhere,"" said Fudge, citing home values pummeled by the plague of blighted and abandoned houses. ""More than a quarter of mortgage borrowers are underwater and 11 percent of all homes are vacant.""

Fudge’s statistics on underwater mortgages and home vacancies certainly sounded alarming so we asked Fudge’s office where she got them.

According to spokeswoman Laura Allen, Fudge got her data on underwater mortgages from the Zillow real estate information and sales service. The group’s number crunchers found that in the third quarter of 2011, 28.6 of the nation’s mortgage borrowers owed more money on their houses than their property was worth.

Borrowers can end up underwater on their mortgages if their homes decline in value or if their mortgage debt increases. Sometimes the two factors combine. Negative equity makes borrowers more vulnerable to foreclosure because it makes it harder to sell or refinance their houses if they can’t keep current on their mortgage payments.

Underwater borrowers who can still afford their mortgage payments sometimes walk away from the loss and allow their homes to enter foreclosure. Such ""strategic defaults"" add to the glut of vacancies and further drag down home prices.

Statistics that Zillow provided to Fudge’s office indicated 41.5 percent of single-family homes with mortgages in the Cleveland metropolitan area were underwater during the third quarter of 2011. To compute its statistics, Zillow looks at the total amount of loans taken out by a homeowner at the time of purchase and compares it to the current value of the home. It obtains its raw data from county recorders’ offices around the nation.

But those statistics only look at the borrowed amounts and the property valuations. A Zillow spokeswoman acknowledged the statistics don’t reflect equity that a longer-term homeowner could build up over years of making payments.

We also checked with another organization, CoreLogic, which incorporates the extra home equity accrued by longer-term homeowners into the negative equity statistics it compiles. CoreLogic’s latest study found that 22.1 percent of all mortgaged residential properties were underwater during the last quarter of 2011.

Fudge obtained her home vacancy numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Its data on the nation’s housing showed an 11.4 percent vacancy rate in 2010: 14,988,438 empty residences out of a total of 131,704,730. But further examination of that national data reveals that  31 percent of those empty homes were ""for seasonal, recreational or occasional use,"" 27.6 percent were for vacant rental properties, and 12.7 percent were unoccupied  homes for sale.

In hard-hit Cuyahoga County, Fudge’s home county and Ohio’s most populous, 2010 Census figures showed a vacancy rate of 12.3 percent, with 42 percent of those vacancies for rent and 12.6 percent for sale. A mere 3.2 percent of Cuyahoga County’s vacancies consisted of seasonal or recreational property.

So while the 11 percent figure for vacancies is on point, it appears there are many reasons homes can be unoccupied. So has the foreclosure crises has had a lasting impact? In her floor speech, she mentions it as she discussed ""remnants of the foreclosure crisis.""

To examine whether the foreclosure crisis actually boosted the vacancy rate, we looked at national data from the 2000 Census, which was taken long before the foreclosure tsunami hit. It showed a 9 percent vacancy rate that year - or 10,424,540 vacancies out of a total 115,904,641 units.

A comparison of data from the two Censuses shows a the proportions of vacant units for sale and for rent both increased slightly since 2000. Over that 10-year period, the ratio of vacant homes that were for sale rose from 11.6 percent to 12.7 percent. The ratio of rental vacancies rose from 25.1 to 27.6 percent. A higher proportion of the vacant homes in 2000 were categorized as being for ""seasonal, recreational or occasional use"" - 34.3 percent.

U.S. Census Bureau statistician Melisa Kresin said the Census Bureau does not measure foreclosures, and its survey of vacant homes would not accurately measure them. She noted that homes can be vacant for numerous reasons, and that many people continue to occupy their homes while the foreclosure process is underway. She attributed some of the increased vacancies to the rise in multigenerational households.

""Once a child graduates, there is a greater chance now that it will move in with parents instead of getting an apartment,"" said Kresin. ""There are lots of factors that go into these rates.""

Fudge’s claim is partially accurate. The Zillow number she used for mortgage borrowers who are underwater does exceed 25 percent, although that data doesn’t consider payment history that could affect the results. CoreLogic’s negative equity analysis produced a smaller number by using a different methodology. That number was less than 25 percent, but in the ballpark.

Her statement that 11 percent of the nation’s homes are vacant is technically accurate. But there are many reasons that those homes are unoccupied and a researcher for the source of her figure, the U.S. Census Bureau, cautioned that its survey of vacant homes would not accurately measure foreclosures.

And, the fact that 9 percent of homes were unoccupied in the 2000 survey, long before the foreclosure crisis took hold, indicates a large proportion of the vacancies Fudge cites are not foreclosure-related.

That’s important information that puts her claim into context.

Mayor Reed fires back at watchdog group
","
Under the bright lights inside the Atlanta City Council chamber, a fascinating bit of political theater took place on the first business day of the new year.

Mayor Kasim Reed accused a government watchdog group of besmirching his and the city’s reputation and went on a verbal attack against the organization, Common Cause Georgia, during the Jan. 3, 2012, City Council meeting.

""Common Cause has so much stain on it that it stinks,"" Reed said.

The mayor said at one point: ""Five members of [the Common Cause Georgia] board accepted maximum campaign contributions. The level of hypocrisy is stunning.""

Reed added, ""I’ve got a file of exhibits where I can back up every word.""

That’s an offer PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t refuse.

Common Cause Georgia has criticized Atlanta’s process of awarding businesses the lucrative contracts to open restaurants and shops at the city-run Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The organization has complained the process lacked transparency for the public. Common Cause Georgia wants the city to enact a ""pay-to-play"" provision that would limit the amount of money people who want to do business with the city can contribute to candidates for public office or elected officials. The group has suggested a limit of $250, but its director told us the limit could be higher, like $500.

The following evening, the mayor and Common Cause Georgia Executive Director William Perry had a one-on-one debate about the matter during WXIA-TV’s 7 p.m. broadcast. Reed made similar claims.

""He didn’t say that anything I said wasn’t true,"" Reed said.

The Atlanta airport, often touted as the world’s busiest, has been a landing strip for allegations and investigations into corruption there since the 1970s, when then-Mayor Maynard Jackson began an affirmative action contract program for women and minority-owned businesses throughout city government. Several city officials who served under former Mayor Bill Campbell in the 1990s and contractors were sent to prison for bribery convictions involving the airport.

Common Cause Georgia pressed Reed to support its proposal on pay-to-play during the 2009 mayor’s race. The group has raised concerns about the recent airport concessions procurement process, approved by the council on Jan. 3, noting that some vendors donated money to Reed and some council members. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the issue on Christmas Day, reporting that some vendors in line to win contracts and their relatives gave about $50,000 to Reed’s campaign. The mayor and his staff counter that the contributions are legal, ethical and have been fully disclosed.

Reed’s spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs said the five board members the mayor was referring to at the Jan. 3 council meeting were Sam Bacote, Chuck Clay, Bob Irvin, Lee Morris and David Poythress. Clay and Irvin both served in the Georgia Legislature and ran for Congress. Morris served on the Atlanta City Council from 1993 to 2001 and lost a race for Fulton County chairman in 2006. Bacote lost his campaign in 2002 for a spot in the Georgia Senate. Poythress unsuccessfully campaigned for governor as a Democrat in 2010.

""It’s a classic, dirty politics trick,"" Perry told us about the mayor’s statement. ""[Reed is] trying to distract from the issue [of pay-to-play].""

Perry said Common Cause Georgia board members are prohibited from running for or serving in elected office; thus, they did not raise money for their campaigns while on the board. Most of the board members who ran for office joined the board the year after their campaigns.One board member, Irvin, joined the board in 2007, five years after his last run for political office. Bacote joined the board in 2005, three years after losing his race for the Senate, according to Perry.

Jacobs said some of the men may have had an epiphany about accepting maximum contributions once they joined the board, but it is still fair to point out that they did.

PolitiFact Georgia looked at as many campaign disclosure forms we could find for each of those board members. We initially thought Reed was talking about the maximum campaign contributions allowed by state or federal law. Those totals are $1,000 and upward. However, the mayor was referring to $250, which Common Cause Georgia has suggested should be the maximum contribution for people who want to do business with the city. We looked at both amounts.

All five board members who previously ran for office received plenty of contributions in excess of $250.

Did they receive maximum contributions under state or federal law? Each man did, but the number of donors was far smaller. In the case of Irvin, PolitiFact Georgia found just one maximum donation among his disclosure reports for six years, a $2,000 contribution in 1998 from the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Perry, Common Cause Georgia’s executive director, says Reed’s argument against their board is disingenuous because the mayor’s criticism doesn’t highlight the organization’s point about contributions from donors who want to do business with the city.

Jacobs, the mayor’s spokeswoman, disagreed. She argued that donors should not be excluded because of their business ties with the city.

""You are ruling out a large share of people who care about the community,"" she said. ""Are you saying all of these [donors] have an ulterior motive?""

Our conclusion

Reed is correct to claim that five Common Cause Georgia board members have received campaign contributions that are the maximum limit suggested by the organization.

But the group was talking about something slightly different: a financial limit for contributions from interests doing business with the city. In the case of Irvin, we couldn’t find any maximum donations from contributors doing business with the state or the federal government. We also think it is worth noting that two of the five board members ran for office several years before joining the board.

The mayor’s claim leaves out some of those key details. Under our rating system, his statement rates as Half True.","[('\nAtlanta City Council meeting video, Jan. 3, 2012, Part 5\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Airport concession winners linked to city officials,"" Dec. 25, 2011\n\nCity of Atlanta airport concessions fact sheet\n\nCommon Cause Georgia letter to Mayor Kasim Reed, June 6, 2011\n\nE-mails from Sonji Jacobs, spokeswoman for Mayor Kasim Reed, and a Jan. 10, 2012, telephone interview \n\nGeorgia Government Transparency & Campaign Finance Commission reports database\n\nGeorgia secretary of state campaign contribution disclosure forms\n\nInterview with Common Cause Georgia Executive Director William Perry, Jan. 6, 2012', 'http://citycouncil.atlantaga.gov/media/fc010312e.wmv')]",/factchecks/2012/jan/12/kasim-reed/mayor-reed-fires-back-watchdog-group/

Barack Obama campaign says Romney, Perry, Gingrich would cut aid to Israel to zero
","
On an outreach page on its website, the Barack Obama-Joe Biden re-election campaign takes aim at three Republican presidential candidates for their stances on aid to Israel -- a hot-button topic for members of both parties.

""Stand against ‘zeroing out’ aid to Israel,"" the web page says. ""Republican candidates for president Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Newt Gingrich all say they would cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero. Stand up to this extreme isolationism and join the call to reject the Romney-Perry-Gingrich plan.""

A reader asked us to check out the claim, so we did. We began by asking for backup materials from the Obama campaign.

The campaign sent us a series of links to debate transcripts and news articles. All flow from a series of statements made at a Nov. 12, 2011, foreign-policy themed debate among the Republican presidential candidates.

Let’s first review what the candidates said during the debate, which was moderated by CBS News’ Scott Pelley and National Journal’s Major Garrett. The issue came up at four different points.

First, Perry answered a question from Pelley about Pakistan.

Perry: ""Listen, I think we're having an interesting conversation here, but the deeper one (is about) foreign aid. And we need a president of the United States working with a Congress that sends a clear message to every country. It doesn't make any difference whether it's Pakistan or whether it's Afghanistan or whether it's India.

""The foreign aid budget in my administration for every country is going to start at zero dollars. Zero dollars. And then we'll have a conversation. Then we'll have a conversation in this country about whether or not a penny of our taxpayer dollar needs to go into those countries. And Pakistan is clearly sending us messages, Mitt. It's clearly sending us messages that they -- they don't deserve our foreign aid that we're getting, because they're not being honest with us. American soldiers' lives are being put at jeopardy because of that country. … It's time for us as a country to say no to foreign aid to countries that don't support the United States of America.""

Later, Garrett posed a question to Gingrich:

Garrett: ""Speaker Gingrich, you presided as speaker over several foreign aid budgets for the United States. … You have seen, at times, the proper role of the United States through foreign aid and other interventions. I want to know if you agree with -- Governor Perry about starting at zero?""

Gingrich: ""What he said made absolutely perfect sense. … Consider the alternative. You're giving some country $7 billion a year .... or in the case of Egypt, $3 billion a year. So you start off every year and say, ‘Here's your $3 billion, now I'll start thinking’? You ought to start off at zero and say, ‘Explain to me why I should give you a penny.’...

""The Pakistanis hid Bin Laden for at least six years in a military city within a mile of their national defense university. And then they got mad at the people who turned him over to us? And we think those are the acts of allies? I think that's a pretty good idea to start at zero and sometimes stay there.""

Then, later on, Pelley read a question from a viewer submitted by Twitter: ""Does Gov. Perry's foreign aid starts-at-zero (policy) include Israel?""

Perry: ""Absolutely. Every country would start at zero. Obviously, Israel is a special ally. And my bet is that we would be funding them at some substantial level. But it makes sense for everyone to come in at zero and make your case. As a matter of fact, we ought to try that … with some of those agencies that I was trying to think the name of the other night. Starting at zero, zero-based budgeting … we've got to go there. And everyone has to come in and make (their) case.""

Finally, Romney expressed agreement with this approach during a subsequent exchange about Pakistan.

Romney: ""One of the things we have to do with our foreign aid commitments, the ongoing foreign aid commitments -- I agree with Gov. Perry. You start everything at zero.""

So each of the three Republican candidates cited on the Obama campaign website did express agreement with this approach to handing out foreign aid. And the candidates’ comments immediately set off a bipartisan tempest within Israel policy circles.

The Republican Jewish Coalition tweeted its displeasure with Romney’s proposal, while the Democratic National Committee had former Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida hold a conference call to blast the idea, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

Still, we find several problems with the way the Obama campaign translated this policy proposal into the claim we’re checking.

It ignores nuances the candidates expressed during the debate

The Obama campaign’s claim said the proposal outlined by Perry, and seconded by Gingrich and Romney, would ""cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero."" It’s true that the proposal would reduce aid to zero, but only temporarily (and theoretically) as a starting point for discussions about what the final level should be. As Perry put it, ""And then we'll have a conversation.""

It’s worth noting that handling foreign aid this way would have potentially problematic policy consequences, even if Israel’s aid package ultimately remained exactly the same size as previously.

In August 2007, the Bush administration signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" that outlined a 10-year framework for U.S. military assistance to Israel. So implementing the Perry proposal without allowing a waiver for Israel would require reneging on the amounts of aid specified in that agreement, which diplomatically is not a trivial issue.

Still, even during the debate itself, the candidates said only that they would use zero as a starting point for funding to Israel, not an end point. There would be nothing stopping negotiators from reducing funding to zero but then immediately deferring to the terms of the memorandum and leaving Israel’s promised funding level as is. They could even increase the levels beyond what the memorandum provides.

Perry himself made this point during the debate, saying, ""Obviously, Israel is a special ally. And my bet is that we would be funding them at some substantial level.""

It ignores statements the candidates made after the debate to explain their positions

After critics seized on Perry’s proposal, a Perry aide e-mailed POLITICO columnist Ben Smith to say, ""Perry believes Israel's an extraordinary friend and our greatest ally. … Under Rick Perry, Israel will set the bar for judging foreign aid to any country. Perry's Start at Zero is exactly the right policy -- no country stands to benefit more than Israel from merit-based foreign aid.""

Meanwhile, JTA reported that immediately following the debate, a Romney spokesman clarified that ""he would exempt Israel from the policy.""

And Gingrich -- who in general has taken strong pro-Israel positions -- reiterated his support for the idea in an interview with the Jewish Channel but added that the memorandum of understanding would prevent Israel from being sent back to zero funding, even temporarily.

""We have a 10-year commitment that we have to live out,"" Gingrich said. ""So I think because we’ve made this long-term commitment, you wouldn’t be able to go back to zero.""

The Obama claim misuses the term ""zeroing out""

Budget experts we contacted agreed that that the Obama camp erred in using the term ""zeroing out"" to describe what Perry was proposing. ""Zeroing out"" means that funding will be terminated. The actual term for what Perry suggests is ""zero-based budgeting.""

""Nothing the candidates said indicated that Israel would get a cut,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that analyzes federal spending. ""Zero-based budgeting just means funding levels must be justified year-to-year, rather than starting from a baseline. Funding for a particular program, in this case aid to Israel, could well end up being more than the previous year, or it could be less. The campaign is taking advantage of the word ‘zero’ without putting it in the proper budget context.""

Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist and budget expert at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed. ""The Obama campaign statement is misleading, to say the least,"" Meyers said.

 Our ruling

The Obama campaign said, ""Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Newt Gingrich all say they would cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero."" We find that a ridiculous distortion of their positions on this extremely sensitive issue.

First, the plan discussed in the foreign policy debate means only that future aid levels for Israel would be subject to negotiations, starting from a baseline of zero rather than the current level. A funding level of zero would be only a theoretical starting point, not an end point, just as easily leaving Israel with higher funding rather than lower.

Second, to varying degrees, the candidates pledged that they personally would either advocate ""substantial"" funding for Israel (Perry), an exemption from the policy for Israel (Romney), or an automatic waiver due to agreements already in force (Gingrich). None of the candidates actually said they supported making Israel’s funding level zero.

Finally, the Obama campaign misleadingly used the term ""zeroing out"" instead of accurately describing it as ""zero-based"" budgeting, making the three-sentence statement wrong in three different ways.

Is Rob Cornilles the real Tea Party candidate?
","
For months, Democrats have labeled Republican Rob Cornilles a Tea Party-er in order to persuade voters that he’s not as moderate as he claims. In TV commercials, on websites and in press releases Cornilles has been called the ""original Tea Party candidate"" or shorthanded as just ""Tea Party politician Rob Cornilles.""

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put up a website called teapartycornilles.comand started a twitter account for @TPartyCornilles. Its first campaign ad in the race features Cornilles saying ""I was the original Tea Party candidate"" from a May 2010 forum.

The Democratic Party of Oregon has jumped in, just as eagerly. In a press release issued Nov. 27, 2011, Democratic Party of Oregon executive director Trent Lutz chastised Cornilles for running on a ""far-right tea party platform"" in 2010 and then trying to refashion himself as a moderate in 2012.
  
""When Rob Cornilles brands himself ‘the original tea party candidate’ one year and then tries to align himself with the Occupy movement … voters are right to be skeptical about whether he has any convictions beyond getting himself elected to office."" 

As Democrats have taken advantage of this term, we thought it might be helpful to flesh out the origin of the statement and judge the accuracy of its use.

Here’s what Cornilles said in its entirety at a meeting of the Executive Club in May, 2010:

""I was the original Tea Party candidate because like the Tea Party movement, I got off the couch and I decided to run for office. I am the longest tenured candidate running for Congress of all five districts in the state of Oregon. You tell me that doesn't summarize and epitomize what the Tea Party movement is all about.""

For party Democrats, that’s all the evidence they need. He said it, therefore he’s a Tea Party candidate. (Democrats often repeat just the first part of his quote.) The rest of us are probably scratching our heads: Why is he talking about getting off the couch? How does that make him a Tea Party original?

We got some more clarity on his thoughts in a 2011 interview on KGW’s Straight Talk, which the Democratic Party of Oregon posted to its website, the realrobcornilles.com. He was asked: How closely do you affiliate with the Tea Party?  

""Well, I really don’t know what we mean when we say Tea Party, quite frankly. If we mean that the Tea Party is made up of individuals who decided to get up off the couch and actually hold their elected officials accountable, who decided to do more than just yell at the TV and become active and involved in the political process, then I think everybody who is paying attention right now is a part of that movement."" [News Channel 8, KGW.com, 4:55, 10/15/11]

More recently, Cornilles told KATU's Steve Dunn that the Tea Party quote from the Executive club meeting was taken out of context, and reiterated the explanation he gave to KGW.

Moreover, the Oregon Tea Party, which is not a political third party, has rejected Cornilles, saying that the group does not plan to endorse any candidate in the special election, nor is it affiliated with a specific party. The group’s John Kuzmanich said that as much as he prefers Cornilles over Democrat Suzanne Bonamici, Cornilles does not hold core Tea Party values.

For example, Cornilles has refused to call President Obama’s 2010 health care reform legislation ‘Obamacare,’ as some other Republicans do, and said in a debate last year that he wouldn’t waste time trying to repeal it, Kuzmanich said.

Just as alarming to Kuzmanich, Cornilles has stated he understands why we need a new Columbia River Crossing and at one point wanted to turn Portland’s Memorial Coliseum into a multimedia production space-- when neither project reflects the group’s main tenets of limited government, fiscal responsibility and free market principles.

On the other side, the DPO’s Lutz has no problem sticking a group label on a candidate when that group has rejected that candidate.

""I don’t think we’ve gone too far in depicting the story,"" Lutz said. ""I think it’s holding him accountable to where he was two years ago.""

Amber Moon, a spokeswoman with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said it’s more than just his truncated quote from the Executive Club meeting. Cornilles is collecting money from a tea party political action committeeand he appeared at a 9/12 Project forum in early 2010, where he said that he had attended tea party meetings for ""months and months and months.""

""The evidence speaks for itself,"" Moon said, ""and he speaks for himself.""

What’s PolitiFact Oregon to think? We go back to the original question. When we first heard the claim, we thought nothing of it. But the onslaught of websites, tweets, promoted tweets, commercials and press releases made us ask ourselves: Is it true that he’s a Tea Party candidate?

Certainly he’s a Republican candidate. Certainly Republicans who identify with Tea Party values are more aligned with Cornilles over the Democrat in the race. Certainly, Cornilles courted such voters in 2010, when the movement was more popular than it is now.

But let’s go back to the tenets of the Oregon Tea Party, as espoused by Kuzmanich and repeated by the national Tea Party Patriots: limited government, fiscal responsibility and free market principles. Instead, Cornilles supports the Columbia River Crossing and finds deportation of illegal immigrants impractical and won’t sign a pledge to oppose new taxes. U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., he’s not.

Democrats say Cornilles called himself the original Tea Party candidate, but he was referring to the grass-roots nature of the party, not idealogy. Democrats point to Cornilles’ opposition to abortion as evidence of his extremism, but there are lots of Republicans who feel as he does and aren’t considered Tea Party activists.

Is he pandering? Blowing smoke? That’s for voters to decide. We will note that Cornilles has been more willing to buck his party this cycle than Bonamici has. So we’re not sure how that makes him a ""Tea Party"" candidate. The statement contains an element of truth -- he said those things in 2010 -- but ignores critical facts, such as his platform and his lack of endorsement from the Oregon Tea Party.

We rule the statement Mostly False.

"['Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul says when Republicans held Congress and presidency, they doubled the size of the education department
","
A day after Texas U.S. Rep. Ron Paul finished second in the Republican Party’s New Hampshire presidential primary, Charlie Rose of CBS News asked Paul to comment on the view that as conservatives fail to coalesce behind an alternative to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, they’re making it easier for Romney to win the party's nomination.

""Yeah,"" Paul replied, ""but what if you coalesce with big spending and you elect somebody like that and you do the big spending? This is what we’ve done. When we’ve had the House and the Senate and the presidency, we coalesced, and we increased the (national) debt, and we increased the spending, we doubled the size of the Department of Education, we passed (the) No Child Left Behind (Act), we passed Sarbanes Oxley.

""Why should we coalesce behind conservatives who aren’t conservative?"" Paul continued. ""They’re just big government conservatives. That’s why there’s frustration out there. That’s why people have started the tea party movement. So I don’t know why people don’t understand this.""

We don’t doubt that federal spending and the debt were increased by Congress in past sessions and that Republicans aligned with Democrats to create the No Child Left Behind Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in January 2002, though Paul did not note that Democrats held a narrow Senate majority when the act advanced through that body in 2001.

In July 2002, Bush signed into law the Sarbanes Oxley act, which was intended to enhance corporate responsibility and financial disclosures while combating corporate and accounting fraud.

But were Republican majorities in Congress and a Republican president responsible for doubling the size of the education department?

To our inquiry, Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, reminded us that PolitiFact in 2007 rated True this Paul statement: ""It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we double the size of the Department of Education.""

The GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, the Senate for most of those years and the presidency from 2001 through 2008.

Significantly, the earlier fact-check weighed spending over years when Republicans controlled the House and Senate, regardless of who was in the White House. And the education department’s appropriation was $100 billion in 2006, nearly quadruple the $27 billion appropriated in 1994. Adjusting for inflation — the 1994 budget rises to $36.8-billion when calculated in 2006 dollars — the increase was 172 percent.

Much of the increase came as a result of the No Child Left Behind Act. In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability, states received an infusion of federal funds.

Some perspective: The $100 billion education department appropriation in 2006 was by far the largest up to that year, and something of an anomaly. It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of $71.5 billion. In 2007, indeed, the budget fell to about $67 billion, a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation-adjusted terms — big, but not doubled.

That 2006 bump was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one-time infusion of $4.3 billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students. Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs — including No Child Left Behind funding — are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year.

Fast forward: Paul outlined more restrictive partisan conditions to CBS News, saying there was a doubling in the department when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress plus the presidency.

Accordingly, let’s focus on spending over much of the first six years of Bush’s presidency when Republicans controlled Congress. From June 2001 into November 2002, Democrats narrowly held the Senate.

So, how did the education agency’s funding change during Republican dominance?

According to the department, its funding in fiscal 2001, which began before Bush became president, was $42 billion, which adjusting for inflation would have been $49.2 billion in 2007 dollars. The comparable figure for fiscal 2007,  the last budget year over which Republicans held full sway, was $67 billion -- nearly 60 percent higher than such spending in 2001, 36 percent adjusted for inflation.

This indicates that such spending went up under Republicans, but did not double.

Still, there remains a way to suggest Republicans more than doubled the department’s funding. Cutting off the comparison in 2006, the year with the highest spending, results in an increase of 138 percent compared with 2001. Adjusted for inflation, the 2006 spending was 109 percent more than the agency was appropriated for 2001.

Then again, the 2006 appropriation shakes out as the second-highest amount spent through the department for any year since 1980, according to the agency. It was later outpaced only by about $138 billion appropriated in fiscal 2009, an amount driven by nearly $100 billion in education spending included in the economic stimulus package approved that year.

Excluding the stimulus year, appropriations to the department from 2007 through 2011 ranged from nearly $44 billion in 2011 to $68.5 billion in 2008.

David Dunn of Austin, who was chief of staff to Bush’s secretary of education, told us in an interview that he considers the 2006 appropriation an aberration. Broadly, Dunn said, ""we never felt like we doubled spending"" on the department. ""We knew spending increased significantly. We were proud of that.""

Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, stood by the PolitiFact check of Paul’s 2007 claim, saying by email: ""...you are pathetic. You are about to contradict something that PolitiFact (al)ready fact checked. Why don'(t) you get a life?""

Our ruling

Paul’s comment to CBS News, reflecting on a shorter period than his 2007 claim, holds up by comparing spending in 2006 and 2001. However, in the last budget adopted when Republicans held full sway, the department's appropriation was 60 percent higher than in 2001, 36 percent accounting for inflation. 
That’s an increase, but not a doubling. One could also say Republicans cut the department’s appropriation between 2006 and 2007.

"['Jobs', 'Stimulus', 'Florida', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says since Obama's stimulus package over 1 million jobs were lost
","
Presidential candidates are zeroing in on job growth with just weeks to go before Florida's Jan. 31 primary. The state has suffered double-digit unemployment since May 2009. 

In a campaign brochure sent to voters in early January, Republican candidate Mitt Romney attacked President Barack Obama's fiscal policies as the ""failed job-killing policies of government spending, regulation and Obamacare."" The mailer then criticizes the $787 billion stimulus package that ""promised jobs and relief to small businesses but failed to deliver.""

""What did all that spending do for our economy, families and small businesses?"" the mailer asks. ""Since the passage of Obama's stimulus package, over 1 million additional jobs were lost and nearly 25 million Americans are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking."" 

Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, implies that if you've gotten the pink slip since the stimulus package passed, or are stuck in a part-time job, you should feel free to blame Obama. Are Romney's numbers right and is it fair for him to blame Obama?

Romney's numbers

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, to check Romney's numbers about job losses and unemployment. Obama signed the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, known as the stimulus, in February 2009. We aren't certain of the exact date of the Romney flier -- the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog posted it Jan. 6 -- but we believe it relied on November 2011 data. (We did not hear back from Romney's press office when we asked about it.)

• Jobs lost: In February 2009 there were about 132.8 million jobs in the United States. In November 2011 there were 131.7 million jobs. That means that there was a job loss of about 1.1 million -- or as Romney claimed ""over 1 million.""

Romney combines three categories for the remainder of his claim -- saying that nearly 25 million are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking. Let's look at each one individually:

• Out of work: 13.3 million were unemployed in November 2011.

• Stuck in part-time work: BLS has a category called ""part-time for economic reasons"" which was about 8.5 million in November 2011.

• Given up looking: BLS economist Jim Walker pointed us to the categories of ""marginally attached"" workers -- those who want a job and searched in the past year but not in the past four weeks. That figure was about 2.6 million in November 2011. 

If we add out of work, stuck in part-time work and given up looking this brings our total to about 24.4 million -- or as Romney said, ""nearly 25 million.""

Is Obama to blame?

Now that we've dispatched with the numbers, which are accurate, what about Romney's suggestion here that Obama is to blame or as Romney wrote on the mailer ""Obama isn't working""?

This report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, released in July, estimates the Recovery Act ""raised employment by 2.4 to 3.6 million jobs relative to what it otherwise would have been."" Don't trust White House advisers to evaluate the president's policies? It's not just their handiwork. The March report cited four independent analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and three by private economic analysis companies, IHS/Global Insight, Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody's Economy.com. Estimates ranged from 1.3 million to 2.45 million jobs created or saved. (We reviewed this evidence before in our December 2011 fact-check of Florida Republican Rep. Steve Southerland.)

In November, the Congressional Budget Office reviewed economic data related to the stimulus and concluded that in the third quarter of 2011, Recovery Act policies:

• Raised real gross domestic product by between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent. 

• Lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points.

• Increased the number of people employed by between 0.4 million and 2.4 million.

• Increased the number of full-time-equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million. 

Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution and an economist for the U.S. Department of Labor 1979-81, says that Romney's statement could cause listeners to incorrectly infer that Obama's stimulus package caused 1.1 million in lost jobs.

""Gov. Romney probably recognizes that most of the job losses in 2009 would have occurred, even if Romney himself had taken the oath of office on Jan. 20. (Recall that he was a candidate for the Republican nomination.) Even with all the powers of the U.S. presidency it’s hard to stop a serious recession on a dime,"" Burtless said. ""Many economists, including me, think the job loss would have been considerably greater and the recovery of payroll jobs weaker without the stimulus.""

Our ruling 
Romney said: ""Since the passage of Obama's stimulus package, over 1 million additional jobs were lost and nearly 25 million Americans are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking."" Romney's numbers about job losses and unemployment are correct. But Romney's suggestion that Obama's stimulus is to blame is misleading. Economists both inside and outside the government say the stimulus helped prevent further job losses. We rate this Half True. ","[('\nRomney campaign,\xa0The Obama Economy mailer, Accessed Jan. 6, 2012\n\nMiami Herald\'s Naked Politics blog,\xa0""Florida update: Mitt Romney\'s big ad buy and the Obama-bashing mailers,""\xa0Jan. 6, 2012\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,\xa0Labor Force statistics from the Current Population Survey, Accessed Jan. 6, 2012\n\nPolitiFact,\xa0""Rep.

Jon Huntsman accuses Mitt Romney of enjoying firing people
","
Republican primary front-runner Mitt Romney set off a firestorm on Jan. 9, 2012, when he said, ""I like being able to fire people.""

Or, at least, when he said something along those lines.

Romney’s comments, made at the Nashua, N.H., Chamber of Commerce, fed into an existing narrative, boosted by other candidates and the media, focusing on Romney’s record at Bain Capital. Supporters and critics sparred over the question of whether Bain, a private-equity firm, was a job creator or a corporate carnivore.

So the notion that Romney not only fired people while at Bain but enjoyed it was catnip for news outlets in full New Hampshire primary mode.

But did the critics take into account the quote’s context? Not necessarily.

For instance, one of Romney’s primary opponents, Jon Huntsman, took a shot at Romney in Concord later that day.

""It’s become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates Gov. Romney and me,"" he said, according to the New York Times. ""I will always put my country first. It seems that Gov. Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov. Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he’s slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that’s a dangerous place to be.""

We wondered whether Huntsman was accurately portraying Romney’s remark.

Once you look at the full context of Romney’s quote, it becomes clear that he was talking about the ability to get rid of a health insurance provider if its services are inadequate.

""I want individuals to have their own insurance,"" Romney said. ""That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don’t like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. You know, if someone doesn’t give me a good service that I need, I want to say I’m going to go get someone else to provide that service to me.""

So Romney wasn't referring to his work at Bain Capital -- or being a boss who relishes firing employees -- but rather the notion of switching service providers. He might as well have been talking about switching cell phone carriers or cable TV companies.

Romney himself said as much later in the day: ""Things can always be taken out of context. And I understand that that's what the Obama people will do. But, as you know, I was speaking about insurance companies and the need to be able to make a choice. And my comments entirely reflected that discussion, which is we should be able to choose the insurance company of our choice.""

Our ruling

Romney certainly phrased his comment awkwardly enough to give Huntsman support for his attack. But Huntsman distorted the comment by making it sound like Romney was heartlessly firing employees. Huntsman zeroed in on the ""firing people"" part of Romney’s quote while ignoring the fact that Romney was talking about switching insurance companies. Worse, Huntsman said it’s ""clear"" that Romney feels that way. In fact, it’s not clear at all. We rate Huntsman’s statement Mostly False.","[('\nNew York Times, ""Romney Firing Remarks Draw Criticism From Huntsman,"" Jan. 9, 2012\n\nMitt Romney, excerpt from speech to the Nashua, N.H., Chamber of Commerce, Jan. 9, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nABC News, ""Romney Likes ‘Being Able to Fire People,’"" Jan. 9, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThe Hill, ""Romney does damage control following remark about liking to fire people,"" Jan. 9, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nDavid Frum, ""‘I Like Being Able to Fire People’"" (column in the Daily Beast), Jan. 10, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nPBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Jan. 9, 2012 (via Lexis-Nexis)', 'https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/rommney-quips-about-liking-being-able-to-fire-people/')]",/factchecks/2012/jan/11/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-accuses-mitt-romney-enjoying-firing-p/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama has raised taxes 19 times
","
In a Jan. 5, 2012, Los Angeles Times article, Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, accused President Barack Obama of repeatedly raising taxes.
   
""President Obama has raised taxes 19 times,"" she said, ""stunting our economic growth and leading us further down the path toward a European-style entitlement society.""
   
A reader asked us to check whether Obama has really raised taxes 19 times. We began by requesting the list of 19 tax increases from the Romney campaign. They quickly complied.
   
Because the definition of ""tax"" can be subject to some disagreement, we asked tax experts for guidance on what constitutes a tax and what does not.
   
Joseph D. Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, offered a brief rule of thumb.
   
""Taxes have the primary purpose of raising revenue for general government,"" he said. ""Fees have the primary purpose of raising revenue for a specific benefit to the payer. Penalties have the purpose of imposing criminal sanction, and any revenue generation is incidental.""
   
Henchman added that removing a tax exemption -- even if its critics deride it as a loophole, even if it benefits one company -- counts as a tax increase as long as the purpose is revenue generation.
   
Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, offered broadly similar definitions. He called a tax increase ""anything that increases what most normal people would call a tax. A ‘rate increase’ is a tax. Changes in other rules that cause people whose behavior doesn’t change to pay more tax are also tax increases. The behavior point is key, as some rule changes may lead people to change behavior, sacrificing income and thereby paying the same amount or even less in taxes. Those rule changes should be called tax increases.""
   
Aaron went on to say that things get more difficult once you start looking at fees that can reasonably be characterized as user charges. ""I wouldn’t call an increase in a freeway toll a tax increase, but it can get muddy,"" Aaron said. ""The tunnels on the roads away from Logan Airport in Boston charge the cabbie two fees, a tunnel charge that every driver has to pay and an extra charge levied only on cabs and intended, I am sure, to hit travelers who are, in significant proportion, out-of-staters. The first part of that charge is a user fee; the second, I would call a tax.""
   
Aaron added that ""lots of regulations or rules result in people having to pay more money, but I wouldn’t call them taxes. The rule that drivers must carry auto insurance forces drivers to buy insurance that they might not otherwise want -- I wouldn’t call that a tax. A rule that food producers must take steps to make sure that their products are free of impurities or germs forces them to pay money, but is not a tax. More generally, the government requires people to do all manner of things that cost them money or inconvenience that should not be called taxes unless every law requiring some form of behavior is a tax, which would deprive the word of any clear meaning.""
   
We’ll list the 19 provisions in four groupings that reflect how much consensus there seems to be from our reporting.
   
Items that are clearly taxes, and that are already in effect
   
• Increasing the federal excise tax on tobacco. Obama signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009.
   
• A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. This tax is narrowly targeted at tanning bed users, but it is still a tax. This took effect July 1, 2010.
   
• Increasing corporate taxes by making it more difficult for businesses to engage in activities that reduce their tax liability. This appears to refer to the closing of a half-dozen existing exemptions and credits relevant only to large international corporations. (We wrote about this recently.) While this is a provision targeted narrowly at big conglomerates -- and while it’s popular as a way to keep deep-pocketed countries from sheltering excessive amounts of income -- our experts said it does count as a tax increase. Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2010.
   
• Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs, based on each company’s share of the total market. While some industry-specific levies are intended to help foot the bill for regulatory processes, this one is more of a revenue raiser for the more general goals of the health care overhaul. It took effect on Jan. 1, 2011.
   
Items that are clearly taxes, but which are not yet in effect
   
Listed in chronological order of date they will take effect:
   
• Increasing the hospital insurance portion of the payroll tax from 2.9 percent to 3.8 percent for couples earning more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for single filers. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
   
• Applying the 3.8 percent hospital insurance tax to investment income for couples earning more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for single filers, for the first time. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
   
• A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. This is a narrowly targeted tax, but still a tax (and will likely be reflected in consumer prices once it begins). Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
   
• Raise the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. People who would have qualified for the deduction this year would pay more. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
   
• Annual fee levied on health insurance providers, based on each company’s share of the total market. Same logic as the levy on branded drug companies cited above. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
   
• Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. While the Obama camp says this provision is intended in part to stop abuse of the system, our experts consider it a tax because it increases taxable income. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013
   
• Eliminating the corporate deduction for prescription expenses for retirees. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, certain employers were not only ""qualified to receive a subsidy equal to 28 percent of covered prescription drug costs for their retirees,"" but the employer also was entitled to an income tax deduction for the subsidy. The idea behind providing both a subsidy and a tax deduction was to reduce taxpayer costs for the Medicare drug plan by encouraging companies pay their retirees’ costs, but the way it was structured was criticized by some as double-dipping. No matter the justification, our experts agreed it was still a tax hike. It takes effect Jan. 1, 2013.
   
• Increasing taxes on health insurance companies by limiting the amount of compensation paid to certain employees that they can deduct from their taxes. According to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, this will be effective for compensation paid in taxable years ""beginning after 2012, with respect to services performed after 2009."" Once again, this is narrowly targeted at health care company executives -- not a popular group -- but it’s still a tax.
   
• A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018.
   
Items about which there is no consensus over whether they’re taxes
   
• Reduce the number of medical products taxpayers can purchase using funds they put aside in health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. The definition of which items qualify and don’t qualify for flex spending plans seems to us to be more like the kind of decision made by regulators than lawmakers responsible for writing the tax code.
   
• A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance and for employers to offer it to their workers. This one is a doozy, because the answer is crucial to the court case that challenges the entire health care law. Because the courts will ultimately decide whether the federal government is levying a tax on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it -- or whether the government is simply using the tax code to enforce a criminal penalty, as some critics of the health care law say -- we won’t take a side on this question.
   
Items where there is a strong argument that they are not taxes
   
• Exclusion of unprocessed fuels from the existing cellulosic biofuel producer credit. This provision -- which is already in effect -- was included in the health care bill even though it has nothing to do with health care. Though its inclusion as an unrelated item suggests that revenue-raising is the primary intention, it was actually intended to fix a legislative oversight.
   
According to the House Rules Committee, then controlled by the Democrats, Congress in 2008 ""enacted a $1.01 per gallon tax credit for the production of biofuel from cellulosic feedstocks in order to encourage development of new production capacity for biofuels not derived from food source materials. Congress is aware that some taxpayers are seeking to claim the cellulosic biofuel tax credit for unprocessed fuels. … The provision (in the health care bill) would limit eligibility for the tax credit to processed fuels.""
   
Beyond the question of whether it simply corrects an error, Aaron argues that this provision is not a tax, since ""there’s no logic requiring that unprocessed fuels qualify for tax credit. If this is a tax increase, then one should, presumably, treat as a tax the fact that fountain pens are not eligible for a tax credit, as they could have been, but weren’t included in this tax credit."" (The change has already taken effect.)
   
• The health care law’s ""medical loss ratio"" provision. Insurance companies will be required to spend either 80 percent (in the individual- and small-group market) or 85 percent (in the large-group market) of the money they receive from premiums on medical care and health care quality improvement, rather than on administrative costs. The provision took effect in 2011. The intention behind this provision is to shape how insurers spend premium dollars, making it more quality regulation than a revenue-raising tax.
   
• A $50,000 penalty per non-profit hospital if they fail to meet new ""community needs assessment."" This falls into the same category as the previous item -- a provision intended to regulate insurers’ practices rather than generate revenue.
   
• Increased penalty for purchasing disallowed products with health savings account, to 20 percent. This is a penalty for a violation, not a tax.

It’s worth pointing out that a number of these provisions are quite narrowly targeted, and some are likely popular among the public, such as those aimed at health-care executive compensation and tax-shelter strategies by billion-dollar multinational corporations. By contrast, as we have noted, the most expansive of Obama’s tax policies went the other direction, reducing taxes for 95 percent of working families.

And a final note: The president doesn’t have the authority to raise taxes on his own. He can only do so with the consent of Congress, which is what happened in each of these cases.

Our ruling
   
Of the 19 provisions Romney is citing, we conclude that 13 may be reasonably defined as taxes (though of those, only four are already in effect). Of the remaining six provisions Romney cites, we find two that are subject to disagreement and four that are probably not taxes at all. So, more than two-thirds of the 19 provisions Romney cited are pretty clearly taxes, but many of them are narrowly targeted at groups from tanning-bed users to health company CEOs. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.","[('\nLos Angeles Times, ""Romney\'s tax plan would slash revenue, reward the wealthy,\' Jan. 5, 2012\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, ""Summary of New Health Reform Law,"" accessed Jan. 9, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 .\nKaiser Health News, ""House Rules Committee\'s Analysis Of The Health Bill,"" March 18, 2010\n\nHealthCare.gov, ""Medical Loss Ratio: Getting Your Money\'s Worth on Health Insurance,"" accessed Jan. 9, 2012\n\nSociety for Human Resource Management, ""Still Worthwhile?

Mitt Romney says Obama once criticized appointments like Richard Cordray's as 'wrong thing to do'
","
With the presidential race intensifying, Richard Cordray is about to become a household name -- Republican shorthand for the recess appointment heard ‘round the political world.

Last week, President Barack Obama bypassed a Senate roadblock to install the former Ohio attorney general as the nation’s top consumer-finance watchdog. The decision, which Obama announced in a visit to Shaker Heights High School, brought immediate scorn from the GOP.

Mindful of the election-year climate, PolitiFact Ohio was eager for reaction from Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and favorite for the Republican presidential nomination.

Romney, in a pejorative nod to Obama’s hometown, delivered as might be expected.

""This action represents Chicago-style politics at its worst and is precisely what then-Sen. Obama claimed would be ‘the wrong thing to do,’ "" Romney said in an emailed statement.

PolitiFact Ohio will leave alone the ""Chicago-style politics"" remark. But because Republicans are likely to repeat variations of this argument in the coming months, we decided to dig deeper to learn whether the president had indeed departed from an earlier stance on recess appointments.

So first we checked in with the Romney campaign to ask for citations. Spokesman Ryan Williams quickly referred us to two Obama quotes from 2005. That was the year then-President George W. Bush bypassed Congress to install John Bolton as United Nations ambassador.

And as the quotes Ryan offered show, then-Sen. Obama was not at all happy about it.

On July 30, 2005, the Associated Press reported that Obama said a recess appointment would be ""the wrong thing to do."" Bolton, Obama added, ""is the wrong person for the job.""

The other article the Romney campaign cited appeared a few days later in the State Journal-Register of Springfield, Ill. Here’s how Williams presented Obama’s quote about Bolton to PolitiFact Ohio: ""To some degree, he’s damaged goods … somebody who couldn’t get through a nomination in the Senate. And I think that means we will have less credibility …""

But when we tracked down the original quotes, we found Williams left out key context.

In the AP story, Obama followed up his ""wrong thing to do"" comment by acknowledging that Bush ""is entitled to take that action, but I don't think it will serve American foreign policy well.""

And here is Obama’s full quote from the State Journal-Register:

""To some degree, he’s damaged goods. Not in the history of the United Nations representatives have we ever had a recess appointment, somebody who couldn’t get through a nomination in the Senate. And I think that means we will have less credibility and ironically be less equipped to reform the United Nations in the way that it needs to be reformed.""

In their entirety, these quotes suggest Obama’s reservations were less about the process and more about the appointee. Obama clearly recognized Bush’s right to make the recess appointment. But Obama and other Senate Democrats had opposed Bolton’s appointment primarily because he was a known critic of the U.N. They argued that Bolton’s record made him a bad fit for the job, a point that would be underscored by Bush’s recess appointment.

This is not the first time an Obama recess appointment has been compared with the Bolton pick. In early 2010, the president took flak for appointing Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Republicans feared Becker, a lawyer who had worked for the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, would favor unions in labor-management disputes.

At the time, PolitiFact noted that during the Bolton controversy, Democrats accused him of submitting inaccurate information to the Senate. PolitiFact also considered a letter that Obama and 35 other Senate Democrats sent to Bush in protest of the Bolton appointment. They asked that Bush ""submit a new nomination,"" rather than send an unconfirmed ambassador to the U.N.

PolitiFact found Obama’s recess appointment of Becker to be a ""Half Flip,"" noting that the GOP objected to Becker, as the Democrats objected to Bolton, on ""policy grounds"" and merits.

""If every appointee for whom Obama made a recess appointment was noncontroversial, Obama would have a good argument that the two situations were different,"" PolitiFact ruled.

Cordray, conversely, was not himself controversial. Republicans who blocked his appointment expressed little if any concern about his temperament or views. Many had kind words for him. Their beef was with the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau he now leads.

Jay Carney, Obama’s press secretary, explained the differences thusly in a Jan. 5 briefing: ""There is no question about [Cordray’s] qualifications for this job. In the case of Mr. Bolton there were a great many questions about his qualifications for the job and a great deal of opposition to his nomination on the merits, on his qualifications, and that makes this quite different.""

After reviewing the Bolton appointment and the full statements on which Romney bases his claim, we’re not sure the Cordray situation is, as Carney contends, ""quite different."" Nor is it, as Romney asserts, ""precisely"" what Obama once said was ""the wrong thing to do.""

Romney’s claim is partially accurate. In both cases you have a president ignoring the protests of the opposing party in Congress. And Obama did criticize the Bolton appointment.

But in Bolton’s case you have Democrats scrutinizing the appointee himself and then-Sen. Obama questioning whether Bolton can effectively work with an institution he has criticized. In Cordray’s case, you have Republicans blocking an appointee because they are unhappy with the agency.

Romney used the word ""precisely"" to draw a comparison that was not nearly as black and white as he implied. And the versions of the quotes that his staff cited in support of his claim were abridged, leaving out important details that would help the listener put Obama’s statements in context.

As such, on the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Romney’s claim Half True.","[('\nRomney for President, news release on Cordray appointment, Jan. 4, 2012\n\nEmail exchange with Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams, Jan. 5, 2012\n\nDemocratic senators’ letter to President George W.

Rick Scott says New Yorkers pay twice as much as Floridians in state taxes
","
Gov. Rick Scott, Florida's CEO in chief, often talks about making cold calls to companies in chilly cities as part of his effort to lure them here and create Florida jobs.

In his second State of the State address, he called out the state of New York by name.

""And I should add, to all of our friends in New York, come on down!"" he said in the Jan. 10, 2012, speech, adding an unscripted shout-out to Illinois, too. ""Our temperature outdoors is about twice as high as yours, and your (state) tax burden per citizen is about twice as high as ours. Those are good numbers for us.""

A clever play on words. But is he right?

The U.S. Census Bureau keeps tabs on state tax collections each year. In 2010, New York's state taxes were $63.5 billion. Florida's state collections were half as low at $31.5 billion.

Scott brought up the state's tax burden per citizen, which represents total tax collections divided by population. In 2010, New York's figure was $3,278, and Florida's was $1,675. State tax collection per capita in New York is very close to double, at about 97 percent more than Florida's, at least in 2010.

By the way, part of the disparity between New York and Florida's tax collections is New York's personal income tax. Florida is one of seven states without one.

Scott is right about the statistic, but the figure doesn't tell the whole story.

For one, his measure does not factor in local taxes. That's important because Florida ranks highest in the country for its reliance on local taxes, which include property taxes. Using this measure, and 2009 figures, New York's tax collections would be about 90 percent more than Florida's, not 97 percent, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research. 

There are also different ways economists measure tax burden. Some use the per capita method, as cited by Scott, but others cite what portion of your income goes to pay taxes. That rate was 9.3 percent for state and local taxes in Florida in 2009 and 14.3 percent in New York, according to figures from TaxWatch, a business-backed policy group. The disparity is smaller using this method.

A lower tax burden isn't the only way to measure the state of a state, though. As economists from the New York-based, left-leaning Fiscal Policy Institute pointed out, New York produced the country's second-fastest growth in gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2010. Florida trailed at 40th place. A similar dynamic played out in personal income growth: New York ranked second while Florida ranked 46th, according to a report generated by the Fiscal Policy Institute.

""This raises the question about what relative tax burdens really mean: Does a lower tax burden mean a less dynamic, robust economy?"" wrote James Parrott, deputy director and chief economist. ""2010 data could suggest that.""

There are other factors to consider, too. Unemployment remains higher in Florida (10 percent as of November 2011) than New York (7.9 percent as of November 2011). Wages for the average working family are more in New York than in Florida by about $6,000, according to a 2009 study. And you could argue New Yorkers get more for their tax dollars in areas such as mass transit. 
Still, low taxes are attractive to many. 
""If people believe that Florida provides services to them that are as good as New York, or at least acceptable, than a lower tax burden could be attractive,"" said Mark Robyn, Tax Foundation economist.

Our ruling

Scott correctly cites that New York's state tax burden per person is twice as much as it is in Florida, and no doubt this fact could be attractive to businesses thinking of moving to Florida. But businesses likely consider more than just tax burden when thinking of where to locate their businesses, and some states with higher tax rates have more robust economies. Still, if you want to count Florida's positives for business, a low tax burden is surely one of them.

Rick Scott says Florida's job growth is the third most of any state
","
Gov. Rick Scott boasted about job growth, his signature issue, during his second annual state of the state address Jan. 10, 2012.

""In the past year, Floridians, not government, created almost 135,000 new private sector jobs. We netted more than 120,000 total jobs in the first 11 months of 2011; the third most of any state in the nation.""

Were Scott's numbers right?

James Miller, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, pointed to his department's December press release based on BLS data that showed 120,200 net jobs between January and November 2011. That includes 134,800 private sector jobs added, but 14,600 government jobs lost.

We turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify.

Data from the BLS shows total nonfarm seasonally adjusted jobs in Florida grew from about 7.16 million to 7.28 million, or an increase of about 120,200 between January and November 2011. So that gets us to Scott's claim about netting more than 120,000 total jobs.

But the BLS would call that a 10-month change -- not an 11-month change because those numbers start with January and don't show how many jobs were added between December and January.

Scott might have wanted to look at the first 11 months of 2011 rather than the 12-month net change because he was sworn into office Jan. 4, 2011, and 11 months of data is available for that year so far. Scott appears to have lopped off the December 2010 job loss figures from before he was governor.

The BLS provides data for states' 12-month net jobs change, which was 110,500 for Florida for private jobs and 98,000 for total nonfarm jobs (both not seasonally adjusted.) Those figures put Florida third behind Texas and California.

Florida is the fourth most populous state in the country behind California, Texas and New York so its not particularly impressive that it would net the third most number of jobs. And by focusing on the number of added jobs rather than the unemployment rate, Scott is able to tell a more positive story. Florida's unemployment rate was 10 percent for November. Only four states had a higher rate -- California, Nevada, Mississippi and Rhode Island. Illinois and North Carolina tied with Florida.

Our ruling

Scott said, ""In the past year, Floridians, not government, created almost 135,000 new private sector jobs. We netted more than 120,000 total jobs in the first 11 months of 2011; the third most of any state in the nation."" Scott's figures are correct, although what he has done here is point to a 10-month job change. We also question how significant it is that Florida ranks third for new jobs, given that we're one of the largest states population-wise. Our unemployment rates would suggest we still have quite a way to go. Still, Scott's numbers are on track. We rate this Mostly True.","[('\nFlorida Department of Economic Opportunity, ""Florida\'s Job gains and losses,""Dec. 16, 2011\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, State and Metro Area Employment, Accessed Jan. 10, 2012\n\nGov.

Rob Cornilles claims Suzanne Bonamici has voted for 60 tax increases
","
Tax increases remain unpopular with voters so what better way to attack an opponent than with a commercial accusing that opponent of voting for a bunch of taxes? This is precisely what Republican Rob Cornilles has done in his latest television ad against Democrat Suzanne Bonamici.

Both are vying in the Jan. 31 special election to fill the seat of former U.S. Rep. David Wu. Bonamici served in the Oregon Legislature from 2007-2011. Cornilles has not held elective office, so there are no votes to track.

""She’s voted for 60 tax increases,"" says the female announcer in the campaign ad, ""hurting the middle class and small businesses.""

We’ve been around long enough to know that Bonamici has voted to raise taxes, but 60 times? We had to check.

The Cornilles campaign helpfully sent over a list of 62 bills to back up the claim. There were 26 votes during the 2007 session and 36 votes during the 2009 legislative session. The campaign did not calculate 2011 votes, saying that with a split Legislature there were few, if any, tax increases.

In 2009, 29 of the 36 bills increased fees, and not taxes. We know that for some readers who dislike government surcharges, the difference doesn’t matter, even if the industry asked for the fee.

Still we need to point out that fees differ from taxes in that the money doesn’t go into the general government fund. The money stays with the agency to pay for specific services. Think death certificate fees, hunting fees, land-use filing fees and psychologist license fees.

The campaign ad specifically says ""she voted for 60 tax increases."" It would have been more accurate to say Bonamici voted for 60 tax and fee increases.

Had that been all, we would rule more leniently. But then we moved backward to 2007 -- and our collective jaws dropped at the bills the Cornilles campaign included as ""tax"" votes.

House Bill 2034 specifies who does and who does not have to register a vehicle and get an Oregon driver license. Senate Bill 416 reinforces the authority cities and counties have to decide which properties benefit from special property tax assessments. Apparently, this was included under the theory that taking away a tax exemption is the same as levying a tax. We respectfully disagree.

But wait. There’s more, and these have nothing to do with tax increases, but with going after people who haven’t paid their taxes.

Senate Bill 39 raises the penalty for people who don't report using certain mechanisms to lowball their tax liability.  Senate Bill 175 shortens the period the Department of Revenue must wait before demanding a taxpayer file a tax report. Senate Bill 219 allows the Employment Department to provide information to the Transportation Department so tax collectors there can go after delinquent accounts.

Finally, there are bills aimed at helping taxpayers. House Bill 2237 streamlines -- streamlines! -- the method for war veterans to get property tax exemptions. Senate Bill 653 allows tax-exempt entities like charities to claim exemptions for subleased property, same as leased property.

We counted 14 of these Pinocchio-sized ""tax"" stretches out of 62 bills. We also counted 32 bills that increased fees, 13 bills that raised taxes (including federal connect and disconnect, and a public purpose charge), two bills that authorize tax increases but don’t actually increase them, and one that we honestly can’t figure out.

In response, Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, conceded five bills should not have been included, including Senate Bill 416, but swapped in four bills from 2009 and 2011 that increased fees and one more from 2007 that increased taxes. By and large, Ostrom defended the others, arguing that any time there’s a new reporting requirement or reduction in filing time or higher penalties, the government is assessing new fees and taxes.

So 2007’s Senate Bill 176, which allows the Department of Revenue to pursue outstanding taxes from a reorganized but essentially the same company, is counted as a new tax in the eyes of the Cornilles’ campaign. House Bill 2034, which requires residents of Oregon to register their vehicles and get an Oregon driver license after 30 days, is just another way to get more money -- fees -- out of people.

Mike Carew, the campaign’s deputy, included legislation where he believes the government squeezed more money out of people. Even Senate Bill 196, which increases the penalty and punishment for people who cheat the state of unemployment benefits. For him, increased penalties equals increased fees, which equals taxes.

""It’s a question of whether you consider a penalty or a fine a fee,"" Carew said. ""I’m not saying it’s a bad bill, but before this bill was passed, those charges did not exist.""

Let’s go back to the commercial, which states that Bonamici ""voted for 60 tax increases.""

It’s fair to say that Bonamici can’t recall ever voting against a tax increase or fee hike. It’s fair to say that she has one of the most liberal voting records in the Legislature. It’s fair to say that she has voted for big-ticket tax increases that have infuriated conservatives in Oregon. Cornilles could have stuck with that script and his statements would have been True.

But there is no way she voted for 60 tax increases. After we started questioning, the Cornilles’ campaign unearthed one more tax vote, bringing the number of tax bills to 14, maybe 16 if you include votes to authorize toll language and to put before voters a measure to put a cigarette tax in the constitution. Still, 16 is a long, long way from 60.

We can’t accept their explanation that punishing unemployment benefit cheats or allowing the state to go after people who haven’t paid taxes is a new tax or fee. Combine that reasoning with the heavy number of bills that increase fees rather than taxes and we have a statement that is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

We rule it Pants on Fire.

Rick Scott says he's adding $1 billion in new education funding
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott asked the Legislature to send more money to education during his State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012 -- and he said he’s not kidding.

""My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education,"" Scott said. ""And I ask you to please consider that recommendation very carefully. On this point, I just cannot budge. … This is the single most important decision we can make today for Florida’s future.""

But the $1 billion isn’t purely ""new"" additional funding as Scott said. About $190 million is needed to pay for 30,000 more students expected for next year, and another $220 million goes to make up for a 3 percent drop in property values.

Another problem with Scott’s claim to support ""new"" education funding: It doesn’t make up for budget cuts that Scott signed into law just last year.

This hasn’t gone unnoticed by Democrats in state government. Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, called Scott’s fervor for education funding ""new-found.""

""The bottom line is that we would still be funding education at a level hundreds of millions of dollars less than we did in 2007 if the governor’s proposal is passed. It won’t make up for the $1.35 billion that the Legislature cut from K-12 education last session,"" Rich said in a newsletter to constituents in December.

We went looking for budget documents and news reports on the matter, and we soon confirmed last year’s education cuts. We even found evidence of the decline in Scott’s own budget documents on his Let’s Get to Work website. (See page 33 of this chart.)

Scott’s data shows a few interesting trends. Starting with fiscal year 2003, total education funding climbed every year, reaching $18.75 billion in 2007. It then dipped to $17.92 billion in 2008, before climbing again to $18 billion in 2009 and $18.22 billion in 2010, thanks largely to federal economic stimulus funds.

In 2011, funding dropped to $16.58 billion, according to interim calculations. Scott’s proposal to add state funds would push total funding to $17.15 billion in 2012. As Rich noted, that’s still below pre-recession levels.

Scott is right that he wants to add roughly $1 billion in funding for schools this year, but we think it’s disingenuous to call that money ""new"" -- a descriptor that gives people a distinct impression that education funding is up. Some of that $1 billion in funding is to pay for new students and to close a gap created by lost funding from declining property values. And it doesn’t quite make up for the deeper cuts Scott signed off on a year ago. We rate his statement Half True.","[(""\nGov.

Rick Scott talks doughnuts in 2012 State of the State address
","
Like many Americans, Florida Gov. Rick Scott finds it hard to pass over a good doughnut.

Or a doughnut story.

Scott started his career running a pair of doughnut shops in Kansas City in the 1970s. He returned to his doughnut roots in 2011, spending a day working at Nicola’s Donuts in Tampa.

In a black hat that he clearly didn’t like wearing and a matching black shirt, Gov. Scott baked and then sold fried pastries by the dozen to customers. You can read all about his day, the first of Scott’s ""Let’s Get to Work Days"", here.

Or you can just listen to Scott tell the story himself -- which he did during his second State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012. With owner Rachel Waatti listening on from the House chambers, Scott went on about doughnuts.

He joked about how you don’t have to worry about employees eating too many doughnuts (they’re just too rich) and how Waatti complained that Scott was spending too much time with the media and not enough time working.

He then touted the accomplishments of his day back in the doughnut business.

""We sold out; more than 240 dozen by 8:30 a.m.,"" he said.

Your humble fact-checker happened to be tailing Scott that day and can report, the doughnut man-turned-governor is creating a bit of doughnut lore.

The doors to Nicola’s opened at 6 a.m. and doughnuts were being snatched off the shelves (Your fact-checker knows, because he purchased a dozen himself to share with his hungry colleagues.)

By 8:30 a.m., the store had already run out of doughnuts and had to grab another 15-or-so dozen doughnuts from Nicola’s second location.

How many doughnuts were sold by the time Scott left?

Waatti and workers told PolitiFact Florida the number was definitely above the 65 dozen they originally baked for the shop and was probably around 80 dozen. That’s probably at least 240,000 calories of breakfast, but it’s not the ""more than 240 dozen"" Scott bragged to legislators about.

Shortly after Scott’s speech, Waatti spoke to David DeCamp of the Tampa Bay Times. She said the 240-dozen figure includes all of the doughnuts sold at both Nicola’s locations throughout the entire day Scott worked at the bakery. But she also reconfirmed that the shop Scott worked at sold about 80 dozen while he was there.

At PolitiFact Florida, we’re almost as serious about our doughnuts as we are our fact-checks. We rate Scott’s ""240 dozen"" claim Mostly False.

Ronald Rice claims Newark schools are funded largely by local property taxes
","
It’s a slogan colonists rallied behind in the 18th century to cast off British rule: ""no taxation without representation."" Now, state Sen. Ronald Rice is fighting a bill known as the Urban Hope Act on the same grounds.

The legislation -- which was passed the state Senate and Assembly on Monday night --  allows private entities to build and operate public schools in three cities. Camden, Jersey City and Newark were originally included in the bill, but last week Jersey City was removed and replaced with Trenton.

Rice argued in a senate budget hearing on Thursday that it did not make sense to remove Jersey City -- where ""school board members have the ability to make a decision, yea or nay"" -- and keep Newark  -- ""where we have school board members that can't say nothing."" The state has been in control of the Newark school district since 1995.

""We've been there 16 years, but yet we have elected school board members. We're paying taxes, we're paying 80 percent of the school budget from local property taxes,"" said Rice, a Democrat from Essex County.  ""In the meanwhile, we're losing jobs, foreclosures, etcetera, and regardless of how much you minimize the risk with this private quote-unquote investor, ultimately it can come back and it will come back to haunt the local taxpayers.""

Are Newark taxpayers footing 80 percent of the bill for the school district? A reader asked us to check out this claim and PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s far from the truth.

According to budget documents, local taxes account for 11 percent of the Newark Public Schools’ overall budget in the 2011-2012 fiscal year. State aid, grants and entitlements make up the largest portion of the district’s revenues, at nearly 80 percent. Federal aid and various other funding sources make up the rest of the budget.

Rice acknowledged that the state finances the bulk of the district’s budget, saying he meant to reference the dollar amount -- ""about $80 million"" or more -- not the percentage, of the budget funded by local taxpayers.

Of the district’s $970 million spending plan for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, local taxes account for more than $106 million. The state is funding more than $775 million through aid and grants.

Still, Rice argued in an interview Monday morning that if the Urban Hope Act passed, it would effectively impose ""taxation without representation, because we have no voice to say ‘yea or nay’ on the project.""

""If they pass the bill with Newark in it, it’s going to hurt us a long time,"" he said. 
Our ruling

In a legislative hearing, Rice claimed that Newark funds ""80 percent of the school budget from local property taxes.""

Of a $970 million budget, more than $106 million, or about 11 percent, is raised from local taxes. State aid, grants and entitlements account for most of the budget, at $775 million. That’s nearly 80 percent.

Nina Turner says the redistricting process was manipulated to benefit incumbents
","
Oh, what might have been.

In November, State Sen. Nina Turner filed signatures to challenge U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge in this year’s Democratic primary. Within days, Fudge responded with her own declaration -- and she was joined by a posse of heavyweight Democrats to underscore her incumbent strength.

Turner vowed to soldier on against what she called ""The Club.""

But things changed. Specifically, the primary -- penciled in for June because of a dispute over new congressional boundaries -- was moved to March 6 after state lawmakers reached a deal. For the underdog Turner, that meant two fewer months to engineer an upset.

So on Dec. 30, the deadline to file for the earlier primary, Turner announced she was abandoning her bid against Fudge. And in her words, a quicker campaign was only half the problem.

""Last month, I filed to run for Congress with the intention to take on the status quo and give voters an opportunity for change. Since then, two things have happened,"" Turner said in an emailed statement. ""First, the redistricting process was manipulated to allow incumbent politicians to guarantee their re-election. And, the primary election was set for March 6, 2011, a date which gives challengers little time to wage competitive campaigns.""

After reading Turner’s suggestion that Fudge had somehow been handed a last-minute advantage, we at PolitiFact Ohio wondered if we had missed something.

From the start the 11th Congressional District was reconfigured to preserve its status as one where a majority of voters are minorities. To accomplish that, Republicans drew a district that fused Fudge’s East Side base with a portion of Akron. So pleased was Fudge when the first map was released in September that she was a rare Democrat to openly embrace the new lines.

Others complained that, in a state more-evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, the GOP gave itself insurmountable advantages in 12 of the 16 new districts.

After months of stalemate and threats to place the map before voters, lawmakers approved a revised, referendum-proof map in December.

In a telephone interview, Turner said she intended the first half of her withdrawal announcement as a ""broad statement"" about the redistricting process, ""not just the 11th Congressional District.""

Fair enough.

The new map united several urban areas across the state and added more of Toledo Rep. Marcy Kaptur’s base to a district in which she will compete against fellow Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland.

In that regard, the incumbent Kaptur’s turf was fortified -- at incumbent Kucinich’s expense.

Likewise, changes to the new 10th District likely helped GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Dayton at the expense of fellow Republican Rep. Steve Austria. Austria subsequently decided not to seek re-election.

But when PolitiFact Ohio looked closely at the 11th District, Version 2.0, it looked an awfully lot like Version 1.0. Because it is. State legislators made no changes there. The separate House bills that created the first map and its replacement confirm that the 11th District lines in place the day that Turner declared her candidacy were the same lines in place the day she withdrew.

""The 11th Congressional District was completely unchanged,"" Mike Dittoe, spokesman for Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder of Medina, told PolitiFact Ohio via email.

So citing an overall disdain for the gerrymandering process seems like a convenient excuse for departing a primary that was sure to be hotly contested. Particularly since there was no change to the 11th District.

Turner is correct in noting the earlier primary -- a development that was always possible but by no means likely at the time she entered the race. And she acknowledged that the other half of her statement could be misinterpreted, though she said that was unintentional.

There is an element of truth in her statement. The new congressional districts were drawn to lean solidly toward one party or the other. All but one has at least one incumbent running for election. But that was true with the September map, as well.

And some incumbents were aided by changes in the map. But it’s also true that those changes may have heightened the challenge for others.  

Those are critical facts that could give the listener a different impression.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Turner’s statement Mostly False.",[],/factchecks/2012/jan/10/nina-turner/nina-turner-says-redistricting-process-was-manipul/

Gingrey: Voter ID van made house calls
","
More states are adopting laws that require voters to show photo IDs at the polls, and the Obama administration is crying foul.

The U.S. Department of Justice recently announced that it’s challenging a South Carolina photo ID requirement because it discriminates against minorities and the poor. Supporters say the new rules prevent fraud.

As the debate intensifies, all sides are turning their attention to one of the first states to say paper identification isn’t enough: Georgia.

U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a recent article on the Fox News website that when the state passed its new rules in the mid-2000s, the state bent over backward to see that it disenfranchised no one.

After the state tightened the voter ID laws, it told people, ""Look, we will literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID and we will do it ... at the state's cost and the taxpayer cost and not at the individual cost,"" Gingrey said in the Dec. 28 article.

This was news to us. Since when did bureaucrats make house calls?

We asked Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber, who told us about the Department of Driver Services’ Georgia Licensing on Wheels, otherwise known as the GLOW bus.

Starting September 2005, an aging Blue Bird lumbered across Georgia making voter IDs. The poor got theirs for free. The rest paid $5.

The rug was the color of oatmeal, a media report said. A bench was upholstered in vinyl.

It was a bit of a junker.

Leaky hoses forced the rescheduling of stops in rural Pulaski and Wilcox counties, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A bad alternator pushed back a visit to Statesboro. A battery problem made the GLOW bus late for a Cherokee County appearance.

And the bus service wasn’t nearly as convenient as Gingrey said. It did not go to individual homes. Instead, it stopped at gathering places such as the Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center and the Talbot County Courthouse west of Macon, according to a 2005 schedule.

""Appointments cannot be made for individuals,"" said a 2005 Department of Driver Services press release announcing the service.

Still, it was the big bus that could. News accounts said the GLOW bus had the capacity to make as many as 200 cards a day.

Yet for the most part, it was the big bus that didn’t.

Between Aug. 30 and Oct. 1, 2005, the GLOW bus issued 22 voter IDs, according to Department of Driver Services figures. Today, there are 559 active voter cards statewide that were issued through the department.

The bus service was ultimately canceled.

Supporters and foes of Georgia’s voter ID law debated why the GLOW bus was such a dud. Then-Gov. Sonny Perdue argued the numbers were proof there was no need for it. Others said the service wasn’t well advertised, or that a single bus couldn’t handle the needs of a large state.

Helen Butler, executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a civil rights group, told PolitiFact Georgia that the bus didn’t solve the cost problem. While a voter ID card is free, getting the documentation to obtain one isn’t. It can cost $30 for a birth certificate, she said.

So yes, the GLOW bus existed. It made voter IDs for free.

But the state did not ""literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID,"" as Gingrey said  

The GLOW bus didn’t do house calls.  

It might have made getting a voter ID more convenient. And the fact that few used the bus might bolster Gingrey’s argument that people who want the IDs don’t need help.

But this is a far cry from door-to-door service. A wheelchair-bound senior with no car could not apply for an ID from her living room couch, as Gingrey’s claim suggested. A civic group would have to request the van travel to a nearby civic center or courthouse, and an individual would have to trek there to get one.

Gingrey’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
