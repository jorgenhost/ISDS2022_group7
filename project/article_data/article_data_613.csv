John Raese says health care law forces patients to go to a bureaucrat before a doctor
","
During the West Virginia Senate debate on Oct. 18, 2010, Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin and Republican businessman John Raese sparred over a number of topics, including the Democratic-backed health care law passed earlier this year. We were especially intrigued by one criticism raised against the law by Raese.

A questioner asked Raese: ""You have said you want to repeal the health care legislation Congress passed earlier this year. What is it about this new law specifically that you do not like?""

Raese jumped right in. ""Well, I don't like socialism, to tell you the truth, and when you have a doctor-patient relationship -- that's the way it's supposed to be, and that's the way we have the greatest health care system in the world, and that's the way it is right now,"" Raese said. ""That's all going to change because from here on out under Obamacare, something Gov. Manchin has always supported, you're going to have a patient-bureaucrat relationship, because the first person that patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel. I disagree with it. ... I'd like to repeal every part of it, because it is pure, unadulterated socialism. It is the worst bill ever to come out of the U.S. Senate and House.""

We decided to check one specific part of Raese's statement -- that under the new health care law, ""the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel.""

First, some background on the law. The goal is to expand coverage and reduce costs while leaving employer-provided insurance largely in place. To help people who have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-based exchanges, which are virtual marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can comparison shop. People of modest means would receive tax credits to buy insurance on these insurance exchanges. Employers are not required to offer insurance, but large companies must pay penalties if they don't offer insurance and if their employees qualify for new health insurance tax credits. 

The plan also expands eligibility for insurance programs like Medicaid. People who don't buy insurance and who don't qualify for programs like Medicaid would have to pay a penalty on their taxes.

When we first saw Raese's comment, we were a bit flummoxed, because after roughly two years of fact-checking dozens of claims on the health care bill, we didn't recall any requirement that patients go through ""bureaucrats"" to reach their doctor.

When we contacted the Raese campaign, they pointed us to a July 27, 2010, news release by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. It touts the ""Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act,"" co-sponsored with four other Republican senators. The bill would repeal one element of the health care law called the Independent Payment Advisory Board. 

In the release, Cornyn called the IPAB ""the definition of a government takeover. America’s seniors deserve the ability to hold elected officials accountable for the decisions that affect their Medicare, but IPAB would take that away from seniors and put power in the hands of politically-appointed Washington bureaucrats. This bill to repeal IPAB is just one step towards starting over with real health care reform that empowers patients instead of beltway bureaucrats.""

The IPAB is real. Whether its existence supports Raese's claim that ""the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat"" is another matter.

Here's how the Kaiser Family Foundation -- an independent health-care research group -- summarized the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board.

The board would ""submit legislative proposals containing recommendations to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate."" If Medicare spending is found to exceed certain inflation benchmarks, the board, beginning in January 2014, ""will submit recommendations to achieve reductions in Medicare spending."" Then, beginning January 2018, if the appropriate inflation targets are not met, the board will submit proposals to the president and Congress for immediate consideration.""

However, Kaiser Family Foundation adds that the board ""is prohibited from submitting proposals that would ration care, increase revenues or change benefits, eligibility or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including Parts A and B premiums), or would result in a change in the beneficiary premium percentage or low-income subsidies under Part D. Hospitals and hospices (through 2019) and clinical labs (for one year) will not be subject to cost reductions proposed by the board. The board must also submit recommendations every other year to slow the growth in national health expenditures while preserving quality of care by January 1, 2015.""

So the board is real. And Cornyn and his allies may have a case to make that the IPAB is a bad idea or poorly designed. Still, we don't see how its existence justifies Raese's statement.

-- The board's purview is limited to Medicare. Patients who have employer-provided health care, Medicaid or insurance through the health care exchange would not be affected at all by the board.

-- The board's powers are advisory. The board can only make recommendations, and it is expressly prohibited from anything that would ""ration care, increase revenues or change benefits, eligibility or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing ... or (change) the beneficiary premium percentage or low-income subsidies"" in the Medicare drug benefit.

-- The board doesn't interact with patients. The board is supposed to do big thinking about cost-containment, not judge individual patients to determine whether they qualify for care. The changes that it suggests to the president and Congress could eventually, many years hence, shape how care is provided. But it's a major stretch to say that under the new law ""the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat.""

-- Patients didn't live in a bureacracy-fee paradise before the health care law passed. Today, patients may need to check with an insurance company before undergoing a procedure or making a visit to the specialist. If an employer's HR department decides to change health care plans, a worker may have to drop a doctor or give up benefits. And employers can eliminate health insurance entirely, or drive up the cost of premiums, either of which could intefere with a patient's health care.

Though the Raese camp didn't mention it, we'll also pre-emptively dismiss any notion that the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute -- another entity created by the bill -- could wedge ""bureaucrats"" between a doctor and a patient. This institute, which would conduct research that compares the clinical effectiveness of medical treatments, is at least as controversial, if not more so, since it fed critics' fears that the bill could result in the rationing of health care services. However, the law prevents the institute's findings from being considered mandates.

When we sent Raese's comment around to health care experts, they universally said he overreached.

""This is purely ridiculous,"" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. ""Nothing changes in that respect relative to today’s system.""

""Choices, if anything, will be enhanced through the exchanges, with a much clearer description of what plans cover and their cost-sharing requirements,"" said Sara Collins, vice president of the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund's Program on Affordable Health Insurance. ""In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services has to certify that qualified plans offered through the exchanges have adequate provider networks.""

Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the statement a ""rant, appalling if based on ignorance, and mendacious if uttered knowingly.""

Even a major critic of the health care bill said he thought Raese went too far. ""As bad as I think this bill is, I don’t see that anywhere in it,"" said Michael Tanner, a health care specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute.

We usually accept a bit of overstatement if it's in the vein of artistic license. But Raese's statement is a gross distortion, along the lines of his subsequent claim that the law is ""pure, unadulterated socialism."" (The law preserves the private-sector health care insurance for most Americans who already have it, and lawmakers rejected a single-payer model early on.) We see Raese's claim as yet another attempt to demonize the health care law by twisting the facts beyond recognition. We rate it Pants on Fire.","[('\nC-SPAN, video feed from the West Virginia Senate debate, Oct. 18, 2010\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, side-by-side comparison of health care bills, accessed Oct. 19, 2010\n\nJohn Cornyn, ""Cornyn Introduces the Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act"" (news release),\xa0 July 27, 2010\n\nPolitiFact, ""The Truth-O-Meter and the health care debate of 2009,"" Dec. 29, 2009\n\nPolitiFact, ""Health care reform: A simple explanation, updated,"" Feb. 26, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Linda Blumberg, senior fellow with the Urban Institute, Oct. 19, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Sara Collins, vice president of the Commonwealth Fund\'s Program on Affordable Health Insurance, Oct. 19, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, Oct. 19, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Michael Tanner, senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, Oct. 19, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Kevin McLaughlin, spokesman for John Raese for Senate campaign, Oct. 19, 2010', 'http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/id/235536')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/19/john-raese/john-raese-says-health-care-law-forces-patients-go/

Kasich ad puts all the state's budget woes, job losses on Strickland
","
Republicans have made jobs the central theme of the campaign, and ""400,000"" -- an aptly titled TV ad from GOP gubernatorial candidate John Kasich -- dutifully delivers its refrain: ""Under Ted Strickland as governor, Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs.""

PolitiFact Ohio earlier rated that claim as Half True. We found it did not reflect the larger economic backdrop of a national recession and a steady loss of Ohio jobs since January 2000. We found the claim broke down at the suggestion that the governor, or any one official, is responsible for the job losses.

But the pitchman in ""400,000,"" a burly fellow with a white hardhat tucked under his arm, goes a step further. He says: ""Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget and raised our taxes to help pay for his mistakes.""

That's a mouthful. PolitiFact Ohio bit off a piece of it earlier, when we examined Kasich's charge that Strickland raised taxes on Ohioans, a charge the Democratic governor has vehemently denied.

Strickland says he didn’t raise taxes -- he only froze the final year of a five-year, 21-percent income tax cut that started in 2005. That move, narrowly approved by the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate, saved the state approximately $840 million. Strickland insists the only alternative was to cut the money from primary and secondary education.

But there are no guarantees that the tax cut will be unfrozen next year. Taxpayers, who had to pay more in income taxes for 2009 than they had expected, may continue to pay at the higher rate. That’s why PolitiFact Ohio rated Kasich’s statement as Mostly True.

But what about the first part of the statement, which we take up now. How did the governor destroy Ohio jobs? What does ""busted the budget"" mean? And what were Strickland's ""mistakes""?

We asked the Kasich campaign. This was the answer from press secretary Rob Nichols:

""He tried to fill the $850 million hole with slot machines and racetracks. And that didn't work. So he reneged on his pledge not to raise taxes, to the tune of $840 million, in a recession, in the worst economy since the Depression.""

That still didn’t tell us what ""busted the budget"" means, or how Strickland busted it. Ohio law requires the state budget be balanced, and the governor shares authority and responsibility for it with the General Assembly.

A share of the blame for the $850 million shortfall, or hole, can be pinned on Republicans, who were in power in the General Assembly while spending increased seven consecutive budgets while taxes were cut.

House Speaker Armond Buddish, a Democrat, recently chided Republicans for not paying for their tax cuts, a claim PolitiFact Ohio found Mostly True. Democrats, he said, ""made the cuts that Republicans wouldn’t"" slicing almost $2 billion from the current $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget.

Strickland did propose installing slot machines at horse racing tracks, a plan he said would have brought the state almost $1 billion. That plan -- which the legislature agreed to put in the budget bill -- was killed by a lawsuit from a group of conservative activists called LetOhioVote.

That doesn't make the plan a mistake. It still could be adopted.

When lawmakers draft a new two-year budget next year will have to find some source of revenue, or chop programs. They won’t have nearly $5 billion in one-time money that helped balance the current budget.

Finally, the claim that Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs amounts to political hyperbole. Ohio and other industrial states all hemorrhaged jobs when the economy hit the skids, and the causes of the recession are much broader than just the state’s budget woes.

So where does that leave us?  
We rate Kasich’s claim that  ""Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget"" as False.

Alexi Giannoulias attacks Mark Kirk on tax cuts, statements about military service and unemployment
","In the Illinois Senate race between Democrat Alexi Giannoulias and five-term Republican Congressman Mark Kirk, negative attacks have been flying from the get-go.

The intensity and frequency of those attacks has only increased as the election moves into the home stretch.

In his latest ad called ""My Left Foot,"" Giannoulias makes three quick claims about his opponent, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk.

According to the voice-over, ""Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle-class tax cuts. And said unemployment’s not that big an issue.""

The ad then features a parade of man-on-the-street comments disparaging Kirk, ending with a woman who says of Kirk, ""I would not trust him with my left shoe."" So that's how the ad got its name.

We'll go over each of the claims in order.

""Mark Kirk lied about going to war.""

Mark Kirk's misstatements about his military record have been a campaign issue for months.

Kirk has admitted to being ""careless"" with facts about his military record on a number of occasions, and we have checked several of them out at PolitiFact.

But it's also true that Kirk has had a fairly distinguished military record. He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer and currently holds the rank of commander.

In 1999, Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano, Italy, in support of Operation Allied Force, the war in Kosovo. He was the team leader for an ad-hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo. Commanding officers raved about his ""phenomenal performance"" and described Kirk as ""a natural and charismatic leader"" and ""head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met."" Elected to Congress in 2001, Kirk has continued his military service, which included two two-week training stints in Afghanistan, in late 2008 and 2009.

According to Navy records, Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.

But Kirk first drew scrutiny when he claimed he was the Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year. It turns out he didn't win that award. Rather, in 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award, which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals. And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Association’s annual awards banquet.

Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the ""Intelligence Officer of the Year.""

""Most importantly, I wasn't thinking,"" Kirk said in a press conference. ""This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me.""

At other times, Kirk and his campaign literature have described him as ""a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom."" He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations. The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served ""during"" the operations. His service in Afghanistan consisted of two two-week training sessions.

Giannoulias also has repeatedly criticized Kirk for once claiming, ""The last time I was in Iraq, I was in uniform flying, and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us.""

In 2000, Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, enforcing a no-fly zone in the northern part of the country.

In a June 4, 2010, interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Kirk later clarified ""that while he heard reports of enemy fire, he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo.""

""I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details,"" Kirk told the Sun-Times. ""And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was, I want to apologize.""

Okay, but what about the claim in the latest Giannoulias ad, that Kirk ""lied about going to war."" In the background, an out-of-focus Mark Kirk appears to be saluting a crowd. On the screen, it states, ""Mark Kirk 'lied' about going to war"" and sources it to a June 2, 2010, story in Newsweek.

We checked out the Newsweek story and it does, indeed, allege that Kirk ""lied."" But the story doesn't claim Kirk lied ""about going to war."" Rather, it calls Kirk out for ""explicitly, officially, and falsely claiming to have won the U.S. Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year award for service during NATO's conflict with Serbia.""

Misspeaking about an award you won is different that lying about going to war (a la Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat running for the Senate in Connecticut, who repeatedly said he served ""in Vietnam"" instead of ""during Vietnam""). One could make a strong case that Kirk has been too loose with the facts about having served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- he did two two-week training stints in Afghanistan -- but he has served during combat, in Kosovo. More importantly, when the ad puts ""lied"" in quotes, and prominently cites a specific Newsweek story, the implication is that the story claims -- as the ad says -- that Kirk ""lied about going to war."" The article says Kirk lied about being the Intelligence Officer of the year. That's different. And so we rate the claim Barely True.

The second claim in the ad is that Kirk ""opposed middle-class tax cuts.""

In case you missed the small print in the ad, it reads ""Vote 70, Feb. 13, 2009."" What is Vote 70 in the 111th Congress? The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aka the economic stimulus package.

Republicans criticizing the stimulus often ignore the fact that nearly a third of it -- $288 billion -- was for various tax cuts. And one of the biggest tax cuts was aimed squarely at the middle class. The Making Work Pay provision provided a refundable credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns in 2009 and 2010. Making Work Pay was estimated to benefit about 110 million working Americans -- most of them middle class -- at a cost of about $116 billion.

And Kirk voted against the stimulus.

So does that mean Kirk opposed middle-class tax cuts?

We think that's misleading. The stimulus was, of course, not just an up or down vote on Making Work Pay tax credits. The Making Work Pay tax credits made up less than a fifth of the overall, $787 billion cost of the massive economic stimulus bill, which included $275 billion on spending projects such as new roads, bridges and high-speed rail and $224 billion worth of payments to state governments for things such as hiring teachers and police officers and for services such as extended unemployment insurance and health coverage.

On Kirk's campaign website, it notes that ""Congressman Kirk voted against the stimulus because it wasted money on big government spending programs.""

The campaign website also claims Kirk has voted to cut taxes more than 40 times. We're not going to get into all those votes, but there's no evidence that Kirk opposed the middle-class tax cuts; he opposed the overall stimulus.

And so we rate this claim Barely True.

Last is the claim that Kirk ""said unemployment’s not that big an issue.""

That seems an odd claim given that Kirk has a whole section in the ""Issues"" section of his campaign website called ""Getting Illinois Working Again.""

The page outlines Kirk's philosophy of lowering taxes, reducing borrowing and investing in things like alternative energy to ""spur job creation."" Agree or not with his ideas, the positions suggest that Kirk believes unemployment is a serious issue.

So where does the Giannoulias ad's claim come from? The print in the background of the ad states, ""Mark Kirk: Unemployment is not a 'big issue'."" And then in small print, the ad sources a Roll Call story on June 16, 2008.

The story was about a battle between Democrats and Republicans over a plan to extend unemployment benefits.

Although the bill received some Republican support -- particularly from GOP senators in states hardest-hit by unemployment -- the plan was opposed by the Republican leadership and enough rank-and-file Republicans so that the bill did not have enough votes to override a veto from then President George W. Bush.

Republican leaders said they favored an extension of unemployment benefits only in states with high unemployment and only for people who had worked for at least 20 weeks before being laid off.

Here's the part of the Roll Call story that includes Kirk, who opposed the Democrats' plan:

""I want to make sure that when you get extended unemployment benefits, you've been working for more than two weeks,"" he said.

Kirk said the issue just isn't that big a deal in his district, where he said the unemployment rate is about 5.5 percent -- the same as the national rate.

""I know that others think this is a big issue, but I've heard very little,"" he said. ""I have a very high-income district.""

On its website, the Kirk campaign responded to a similar claim made by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- that Kirk had callously claimed unemployment wasn't a big issue -- by pointing out that the article is more than two years old, and that the comment came when unemployment stood at 5.5 percent (it's now at 9.6 percent).

The Kirk campaign also noted that Kirk voted to extend unemployment benefits numerous times between 2002 and 2010, and ""Mark Kirk has said he would vote to extend unemployment benefits again if the legislation did not add to the debt or raise taxes."" This past July, however, Kirk again voted against a bill to extend unemployment benefits, saying,  ""I opposed the last one because there was no effort to offset the cost. It just added $30 billion straight to the deficit.""

The Giannoulias campaign contends Kirk's comment in Roll Call was that unemployment isn't a big issue, but we think the fuller context of the article makes clear that Kirk is saying that extending unemployment benefits -- at that time -- was not ""that big a deal"" in his district. That's different than saying unemployment is not a big deal. We rate the claim Barely True. And that's how we rate the ad overall -- Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ","[('YouTube, Giannoulias campaign ad, ""My Left Foot,"" Oct. 15, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRMwKNemoxU&feature=player_embedded'), ('Mark Kirk campaign website, ""Fact Check""', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact.com, ""Alexi Giannoulias says Kirk mixed politics and military service,"" by Robert Farley, July 8, 2010', 'https://www.kirkforsenate.com/?page_id=677'), ('Newsweek, ""Three Reasons Mark Kirk\'s False Claims Are Getting Less Attention Than Richard Blumenthal\'s,"" June 2, 2010', 'No link'), ('Clerk of the House, U.S. House of Representatives Roll Call Votes, 111th Congress - 1st Session (2009), Vote 70, on H.R. 1, Feb. 13, 2009', 'https://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/08/alexi-giannoulias/alexi-giannoulias-says-kirk-mixed-politics-militar/'), ('Recovery.gov, Overview of Funding (in stimulus bill)', 'No link'), ('Library of Congress, H.R. 1, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009', 'http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/06/02/three-reasons-mark-kirk-s-false-claims-are-getting-less-attention-than-richard-blumenthal-s.html'), ('Chicago Tribune, ""Kirk again challenged over military record,"" by John Chase and Todd Lighty, June 13, 2010', 'No link'), ('AP, ""Kirk apologizes for being \'careless\' on his record,"" by Deanna Bellandi, June 29, 2010', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/ROLL_000.asp'), ('AP, ""Senate candidate faces more heat over Navy record,"" by Christopher Wills and Deanna Bellandi, June 2, 2010', 'No link'), ('AP, ""Mark Kirk Mixed Military Service With Politics And Was Warned Twice, Says Pentagon,"" by Christopher Willis, June 15, 2010', 'http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx'), ('Roll Call, ""GOP Rallies on Unemployment,"" by Steven T.

Jack Conway says Rand Paul would end faith-based initiatives, religious charity deduction
","
An ad unveiled Oct. 15, 2010, by Democrat Jack Conway so angered his opponent for a Kentucky Senate seat, Republican Rand Paul, that Paul refused to shake hands after a debate two days later.

The primary reason for the bad blood was the charge in Conway's ad that Paul, as a college student at Baylor University, had participated in some unorthodox activities, according to an account in GQ.

""Why was Rand Paul a member of a secret society that called the Holy Bible 'a hoax' -- that was banned from mocking Christianity and Christ?"" said the ad's narrator. ""Why did Rand Paul once tie a woman up? Tell her to bow down before a false idol and say his God was 'Aqua Buddha?'""

The ad provoked outrage in the Paul camp, and even some liberal commentators protested. The New Republic's Jonathan Chait called it ""the ugliest, most illiberal political ad of the year"" for coming ""perilously close to saying that non-belief in Christianity is a disqualification for public office,"" an idea that Chait called ""a pretty sickening premise for a Democratic campaign.""

Because the most salacious details of the GQ story were provided by a woman who requested anonymity, we're not going to attempt to fact-check that part of the story. But the ad does contain two policy-focused claims. We'll turn our focus on those instead.

After the reference to the ""Aqua Buddha"" story, the ad asks, ""Why does Rand Paul now want to end all federal faith-based initiatives and even end the deduction for religious charities?""

We thought we'd take a look.

The Paul campaign did not return a telephone inquiry, so we reviewed the sources cited in the ad.

To back up the first claim -- that Paul wants ""to end all federal faith-based initiatives"" -- the ad cited the June 20, 2008, edition of a public-affairs television show called Kentucky Tonight. Paul was one of four guests invited to join an hour-long discussion of the Kentucky state budget.

At one point -- it's about 70 percent of the way through the video -- the conversation turns to state budget cuts and the intersection of church-related charity work with state support for social services. Paul offers a note of caution.

""You mentioned faith-based intermingling -- government and faith-based,"" Paul said. ""George (W.) Bush did that, and I think it was a horrible mistake. One, I think the money sort of pollutes the mission of a purely Christian organization, or Muslim or whatever organization it is, and it obscures the church-state separation that there really ought to be. We shouldn't have tax money flowing into churches. We should let churches do charity work, and that's wonderful, but they shouldn't be corrupted with government money.""

This seems to be a pretty clear statement of Paul's views on the subject. The only potential complication we see with the ad's wording is that Paul's statement on Kentucky Tonight was focused on the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. It's possible to envision a partnership between the federal government and a religious group that doesn't involve money, but we think it's reasonable to assume that most would. So the ad's claim seems pretty accurate to us.

On the second point -- that Paul would ""end the deduction for religious charities"" -- the ad cites an Associated Press account. The AP actually ran a half-dozen stories beginning on Oct. 12, 2010, that addressed Paul's support for a national sales tax. The tale gets a bit complicated, so bear with us.

On Oct. 12, the AP quoted Paul saying, ""The federal tax code is a disaster no one would come up with if we were starting from scratch. I support making taxes flatter and simpler. I would vote for the Fair Tax to get rid of the 16th Amendment, the IRS and a lot of the control the federal government exerts over us."" The story attributed the quote to ""a written statement distributed by an anti-tax group and verified by his campaign."" 
The Fair Tax would eliminate the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes, replacing them with a 23 percent ""national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services."" Eliminating the federal income tax would also eliminate deductions such as tax deductions for donations to religious charities. Bills proposing to make that change, which have come up annually for years in Congress, have all failed to progress to a full hearing. Nonetheless, Democrats have used the Fair Tax as the basis for many ads against Republicans this year, one of which we recently rated Half True.

One day later, Paul began to walk back the comment. The AP reported that ""Paul, a limited-government advocate, said he supports a 'simpler tax code' but wouldn't offer specifics about his written comments to an anti-tax group supporting repeal of the 16th Amendment that created the federal income tax. 'I haven't really been saying anything like that,' Paul told reporters following a speech in Henderson as part of his Kentucky bus tour. 'I think it's probably better to go ... with what I'm saying on the campaign trail.'""

On Oct. 14, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer interviewed Paul before a rally. Paul told the paper that he is for ""tax reform in general"" but hasn't committed to the Fair Tax. ""I'd like to flatten the income tax,"" Paul said. ""The church doesn't ask for more than 10 percent of your income.""

On Oct. 15, Paul's campaign manager, Jesse Benton, told the AP that a tax reform activist -- former Paul campaign manager David Adams -- had distributed the statement that was the basis for the original AP story, and in so doing, distorted Paul's views on the Fair Tax. ""Our campaign respects the Fair Taxation movement, but the Kentucky coordinator got a little overzealous promoting his cause and created a statement that does not accurately reflect Dr. Paul's views,"" Benton said in a statement to the AP. ""Rand knows our tax code is broken and will fight for fundamental reform that both simplifies the system and reduces the financial burden for all Kentuckians. Dr. Paul will study and consider all plans that attempt to do so.""

The Oct. 15 AP story noted that Adams had said he distributed the statement only after receiving permission from Benton and that Benton had personally verified the statement to the AP for its initial story.

Finally, on Oct. 16, the AP reported the existence of a video from a campaign event in February in which Paul told Americans for Fair Taxation volunteer Terry Schmitt, ""I'm in favor of any change in the tax code that reduces the overall tax burden. That would include the Fair Tax, changing to a sales tax. One great advantage of it would be no more IRS, no more income tax, no more reams of paper that we all have to deal with.""

This series of explanations suggests that Paul is backtracking to avoid being associated with a policy proposal that could be unpopular among some voters. But even if he does seem ambivalent, we think there's enough evidence to justify the Conway camp's claim that Paul did support the Fair Tax, at least at one point. 
That said, we think the Conway ad is somewhat misleading in its description of Paul's views. We don't see evidence that Paul made the religious-charity exemption a target of his opposition. His opposition, such as it was, would have been part of his support for a broader, fundamental tax overhaul. So we think Conway's decision to focus on this narrow aspect of the Fair Tax is misleading.

All told, then, Conway is close to accurate on both claims but with a slight exaggeration on the question of religious tax exemptions. Keeping in mind that we're not rating the ""Aqua Buddha"" portion of the ad, we rate the two policy statements Mostly True.","[('\nJack Conway for Senate, ""Why?""

Ron Johnson says Russ Feingold supported stimulus plan that allowed company to create 3,000 jobs in China
","
Stung by a TV ad from Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold portraying him as anti-worker for supporting foreign trade deals, Republican challenger Ron Johnson is striking back.

In a new TV ad, Johnson tries to tarnish Feingold’s pro-labor credentials by casting him as a desperate hypocrite on trade.

Where Feingold has touted his opposition to what he calls unfair trade deals with China, Mexico and other countries, the Johnson ad links Feingold to job creation in China -- not through trade deals, but his vote on the 2009 stimulus package.

The Johnson ad begins with a narrator saying: ""Russ Feingold ... desperate ... running a misleading, negative campaign."" The video pans across headlines from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about PolitiFact Wisconsin items that rated past Feingold claims as Half True and Pants on Fire.

Then it turns to trade.

""Feingold says one thing, does another,"" the ad’s narrator charges. ""Feingold voted the party line for the stimulus bill that allowed U.S. tax dollars to go to foreign companies to create manufacturing jobs overseas.""

A large graphic then pops up and lingers -- ""Create 3,000 jobs in China"" -- as the narrators says: ""Democrat senators said the bill will create 3,000 jobs in China alone.""

So by supporting the stimulus bill, did Feingold sell out his stance on trade and pay for 3,000 jobs in China?  

That’s a big charge. Let’s dig in.

While there is no question Feingold supported the stimulus bill, the ad’s claims turn on whether the measure supports overseas jobs in general, and the jobs in China specifically.

With the China reference, the ad echoes spots by various congressional candidates across the country that -- according to an Oct. 9, 2010 New York Times article -- play on fears about China’s economic ascendancy.

As backup, the Johnson campaign cites two sources: a March 3, 2010 press release by Democratic senators, including Charles Schumer of New York, and a story the same day by Politico that picked up on the press release.

The controversy arose after a report by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University found that overseas firms had received 79 percent of $2.1 billion in renewable-energy grants under the stimulus plan, as PolitiFact National later recounted. That $2.1 billion piece is a tiny portion -- not even 1 percent -- of the overall $787 billion stimulus deal.

Only U.S. energy projects can be funded under the stimulus plan, but overseas companies were ahead of America on wind-turbine production, so many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies, PolitiFact National has reported.

This detail is glossed over in the ad, which suggests the stimulus money is primarily aimed at creating jobs overseas.

The Investigative Reporting Workshop report included reference to a west Texas wind farm proposal that would use made-in-China wind turbines, which would potentially create up to 3,000 jobs in China. That prompted Schumer and the other Democrats to condemn that prospect in a news release.

The release described the Texas project as  ""on the verge"" of receiving $450 million in stimulus funds.

That release overstated the case.

News accounts at the time quoted project officials in the U.S.-China joint venture as saying they would apply for stimulus funding, and the China jobs would total 2,400 to 3,000 jobs, with a much smaller number created in the United States.

But much has changed since fall 2009, when the project was announced.

The outcry over the investigation led to negotiations between the U.S. Steelworkers union and the U.S.-China joint venture.

In March 2010, the project announced that its Chinese manufacturing partner would build turbines at a plant in Nevada, creating up to 300 jobs there. The plant, which will have other manufacturing uses, could create a total of 1,000 jobs, project officials estimated.

In August, 2010, the United Steelworkers announced a deal with the wind-farm partners that they say will assure that major components for the project will be made in the United States.

According to United Steelworkers national spokesman Wayne Ranick, under the deal, a total of 1,000 U.S. jobs could be created by establishing a domestic supply chain for the project. Wind machines require hundreds of parts and even when key parts are made overseas, much of the work can be done domestically, renewable energy officials say.

Project officials now say that a minimum of 70 percent of each wind turbine, including the massive towers and blades, will be wholly manufactured in the United States and made of American steel.

Project officials no longer put an estimate on the Chinese manufacturing jobs, saying that the ""vast majority"" of all jobs created by the wind farm will be in the United States.  

Finally, the Texas project, which is in its early stages, has not applied for or received any stimulus funding to date, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

They are eligible to do so, however, and have not ruled out applying later.

In any case, the Johnson ad twists the reality of the Democratic news release it cites. The senators were opposed to the prospect of the jobs going to China. The Johnson ad presents their statement as some sort of virtue of the Democratic-backed stimulus plan.

The ad also leaves a false impression of Feingold’s views on Buy American provisions, including in relation to the stimulus, and on trade with China.

Feingold is a longtime advocate of Buy American provisions.  

In the stimulus debate, it was largely Republicans and business groups, as well as multinational companies and U.S. trading partners, who objected to including strict Buy American rules they viewed as overly protectionist.

Feingold voted against a Republican amendment that would have killed the Buy American provision in its entirety, roll call records show.

He did support the compromise version that survived.

In the Senate, Feingold has voted consistently against foreign trade agreements he deems as damaging to Wisconsin jobs because he believes they favor foreign competitors. This includes a 2000 vote against granting China permanent most-favored nation status for trade.

Let’s take stock:

In making his claim, Johnson notes that a side effect of the stimulus bill, which Feingold backed, was that in limited cases -- particularly in renewable energy -- foreign companies would benefit from some of the money. The approach spurs job growth in America as well, but undeniably would create some overseas jobs, too. Johnson tries to bolster this claim by citing a specific Texas project involving China and some 3,000 related jobs to be created there.

But he twists Democratic objections to the possibility into alleged support for it. And the outcry itself has prompted revisions that mean more jobs here -- and so far no application has been made by project officials for any stimulus money. What’s more, Feingold backed the Buy American provisions that were included in the bill, saying they were a step forward.

We rate Johnson’s claim Barely True.","[('\nPolitico,Stimulus Money Goes Overseas, March 3, 2010\n\nNew York Times, Wind Farm Deal Assures Bigger U.S. Role, Aug. 6, 2010\n\nU.S. Senator Charles Schumer, press release, March 3, 2010\n\nNew York Times,Chinese Involvement in Proposed Texas Wind Farm Stirs Passions, Nov. 1, 2009\n\nU.S. Renewable Energy Group,press release, Aug. 6, 2010', 'http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=24E88B26-18FE-70B2-A81B343E008EE7F7'), ('\nPolitiFact National, Sarah Palin wind farm item, Feb. 23, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nReuters,Texas wind farm announcement, Oct. 29, 2009\n\nLas Vegas Sun,New plant expected to bring more than 1,000 jobs to Henderson, Oct. 14, 2010\n\nNew York Times,Buy American provision in stimulus plan, Feb. 20, 2009\n\nE-mail interview, Sara Sendek, Johnson campaign spokeswoman, Oct. 10, 2010\n\nE-mail and phone interviews, John Kraus, Feingold campaign spokesman, Oct. 14, 2010\n\nE-mail interview, Wayne Ranick, United Steelworkers spokesman, Oct. 14, 2010\n\nE-mail interview, Carrie Annand, U.S. Renewable Energy Group spokeswoman, Oct. 14, 2010', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/23/sarah-palin/palin-falsely-claims-most-renewable-energy-stimulu/')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/19/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-russ-feingold-supported-stimulus-/

Jim Renacci has come down on both sides of privatizing Social Security
","
In the latest campaign ad for Alliance Democratic Rep. John Boccieri, a Greek chorus of indignant senior citizens ties Republican congressional candidate Jim Renacci to the third rail of politics.

""Mr. Renacci. I’d rather put my Social Security money in here, or in here, or in here, than let you privatize MY Social Security,"" a group of them scold, throwing cash into a hole in the ground, a coffee can, and a dresser drawer.

""I paid into Social Security for 40 years, it’s all I have, and you want to gamble it away on Wall Street, Mr. Renacci?"" ask another pair of seniors, as the words ""Jim Renacci wants to privatize Social Security"" flash onto the screen, as if to answer their question.

We thought we'd run Renacci's position on privatizing Social Security through the Flip-O-Meter, in light of Boccieri’s ad, to see if his position has been consistent.

Renacci campaign manager Jim Slepian says the ad is false, and that Renacci does not want to privatize Social Security.

He points to a spot on Renacci's website where the former Wadsworth mayor says the federal government must ""implement reforms to address the growing fiscal crisis that is facing the Social Security balance sheet."" On his website, Renacci stipulates Washington must ""ensure that Social Security benefits are protected and that needed reforms are brought to bear that would not raise taxes or privatize the system.""

Slepian said that's still Renacci's position. ""He has said time and time again that we cannot and should not privatize the system.""

We asked the Boccieri campaign what information they had that showed something different. Boccieri spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw pointed us to a survey Renacci filled out  for ""Project Vote Smart."" In that survey, Renacci said he favored of privatizing parts of the Social Security system.

""To the extent that I support privatizing elements of Social Security, I support allowing workers to privately invest a portion of their payroll taxes,"" Renacci explained on the Vote Smart website.

We do not think that Renacci is advocating measures that amount to turning the entire Social Security system over to Wall Street. But that's not been the case, either, for previous privatization proposals. In 2005, for example, President George W. Bush promoted moving toward a government-funded program that also allowed for personal accounts. Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has proposed a similar blend of programs as part of an overall budget plan he calls ""The Roadmap."" His plan, too, is a far cry from a wholly privatized system.

So while Renacci's opposition to privatization is firm on his website, his answers to Project Vote Smart's survey suggest support for privatization as it has been proposed in the past. 
Reconciling those two positions and landing on two feet requires a Full Flop.

US House hopeful said stimulus funds went to China
","
Your stimulus money is being shanghaied, Republicans are saying. Literally, it's going to China.

And credit belongs in part to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, according to a recent TV commercial by his Republican opponent, Austin Scott.

The attack claims Marshall, from Macon, voted for the stimulus bill, which ""sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China.""

U.S. stimulus money went to China? To create jobs there? AJC PolitiFact Georgia took a look.

Marshall spokesman Doug Moore said the claim is wrong.

""There is just no evidence to support the claim that jobs were created in China,"" Moore said.

Marshall and Scott are in one of the state's toughest races. Marshall, the incumbent since 2002, has a record of fending off serious challenges. But this season, Democrats are struggling and victory is far from assured.

Similar accusations about China and wind power are haunting Democratic congressmen in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia. They, like Marshall, voted for the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, otherwise known as the stimulus bill.

Republicans are attacking the stimulus because they think it was squandered. And that's where China comes in.

PolitiFact National assessed a similar claim in February on wind turbines and China by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. She said the stimulus bill was supposed to help create U.S. jobs, but 80 percent of the $2 billion in stimulus dollars spent on alternative energy went to buy wind turbines built in China.

The stimulus did include tax credits and grants to help investors develop wind and other alternative-energy projects in the U.S. But beyond that, Palin's claim fell apart.

Before the stimulus, the federal government gave tax credits to investors in U.S. alternative-energy projects. A program created by the stimulus bill lets the investors get that money up front if they meet certain conditions. But there was no requirement that equipment used in those projects be made in the U.S. or that the investment companies be American-owned.

In October 2009, American University's nonprofit Investigative Reporting Workshop published stories that said much of this program's stimulus money for wind projects ended up in the hands of foreign firms. Although the projects were located in the U.S., many were being built by American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies, reported Russ Choma, a reporter at the workshop.

In February, the workshop ran additional stories in partnership with ABC News and the Watchdog Institute at San Diego State University. By that time, about 79 percent of the $2.1 billion given to wind-energy companies had gone to foreign ones.

So Palin's claim did address a real controversy, but she misrepresented it.

Some of the stimulus money supports jobs abroad because turbine parts are often made overseas. But many are made by U.S. companies or made by foreign companies in the U.S. Not a single recipient of program money is owned by a Chinese company.

Back to Scott's commercial, which makes a claim that's slightly different from Palin's. It said that the stimulus sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build turbines and create jobs, mostly in China.

There are a few problems with this accusation.

The first is that it uses the $2 billion figure incorrectly. The amount, which is from the February stories, was the total for wind grants -- including domestic ones. About 79 percent of that money went to foreign-owned companies.

Secondly, the $2 billion number is outdated. Because claims about jobs in China and wind turbines began to re-emerge recently, Choma posted updated stimulus figures Sept. 27. on the workshop website.

Major wind farm projects in the U.S. received $4.4 billion worth of grants under the program, according to more recent calculations based on U.S. Department of Energy numbers. About $2.38 billion, or 54 percent, has gone to foreign-owned developers.

Third, the commercial's claim that the $2 billion got sent ""overseas"" is well short of correct. Although equipment was made overseas and foreign companies were involved, much of the money was also spent domestically. Every one of the projects was located in the U.S., and some of the turbines were manufactured here.

How much money stayed here? Experts said it's difficult to tell. But the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California used Energy Department funds to study the grant program's impact, including its effect on jobs.

The lab's calculations were rough, early estimates based on limited information and do not take into account nonwind-energy jobs lost because of the program. But its economic model showed wind projects funded by the grant program created or retained more than 55,400 domestic jobs, most of them short-term.

If the project were entirely domestic, it would have created more than 87,000 jobs, the report said. However, this was not possible. The U.S. does not have the capability to manufacture enough wind turbines, it noted.

Another estimate based on research from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, which has been critical of how the Obama administration handled the stimulus grants, indicates the projects created a total of 35,000 jobs.

But it's not clear how many jobs would be overseas. Too few are domestic, the group said, and the program doesn't do enough to foster the development of U.S. wind turbine manufacturing.

Unlike the lab's calculations, the REPP number does not include ""induced"" jobs, or jobs supported when workers and firms spend the money they make.

Regardless, these job estimates indicate money did stay in the U.S. Although turbine manufacturing does take place overseas, some takes place domestically, and the construction and operation of the sites take place in the U.S.

And finally, the most important problem with Scott's claim is China. It's barely a factor in this debate.

A wind industry trade group that's been critical of how Choma and others portray the issue confirmed that only three turbines were purchased outright from China. Not a single company that received these funds is owned by a Chinese company.

""When we talk about money going overseas, it's going to Europe,"" Choma said.

So while the green-energy grants did end up in the hands of foreign companies, the situation is far from what Scott's commercial claimed.

The $2 billion figure is old and incorrect. Even critics agree that money is staying in the country in the form of domestic construction and manufacturing jobs, though the amount is unclear and most jobs are short-term.

It's not possible for domestic manufacturers to produce all the wind turbines because they don't have enough capacity. And the overseas jobs in question are mostly in Europe, not China.

Scott Bruun says Kurt Schrader was the deciding vote in not extending Bush-era tax cuts
","
  
When Democrats adjourned without taking action on the George W. Bush-era tax cuts, which will expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t act, they had to know that it would be the perfect fodder for Republican attacks.

So maybe Rep. Kurt Schrader, who represents Oregon’s 5th District, wasn’t surprised when he saw this recent e-mail jab from Republican challenger Scott Bruun: ""Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon’s middle-class families and small businesses.""

The attack goes on to quote some bits from a Sept. 29, 2010, article in The Hill.

Bit No. 1: ""House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters Wednesday that the House would not vote on the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts before lawmakers break for the November midterm elections.""

Bit No. 2: ""Members who voted to adjourn were ‘putting their election above the needs of your constituents,’ (House Minority Leader John) Boehner said in his speech. ‘Vote no on this adjournment resolution. Give Congress the chance to vote on extending tax rates.’""

PolitiFact Oregon decided to do a quick reality check on this claim, lest those ""middle-class families and small businesses"" Bruun references be misled by some political doublespeak.

Let’s start first with the vote’s dynamics: On Sept. 29, 2010, the House voted to adjourn. The vote was a close one. So close, in fact, that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi actually had to cast a vote -- something she doesn’t do all that often. (The Washington Post’s Votes Database says she has cast 94 votes this Congress; other members have voted more than 1,500 times.)  In the end, 210 representatives voted to adjourn while 209 voted against adjourning.

Schrader was in the majority. Did he cast the deciding vote?

We’d say the deciding vote belongs to Pelosi, if only because she doesn’t typically vote on procedural things like this. But we’ll be ridiculously lenient here and say that because the difference between the two sides was just one vote, any of the members voting to adjourn could be said to have cast the deciding vote.

So, let’s get into the politics of the thing. Normally, a procedural vote wouldn’t be an issue, but it is this time around because Democrats and Republicans had been going back and forth for a couple of weeks -- at least -- about just what parts of the Bush-era tax cuts should be allowed to expire. As The New York Times put it, generally everybody agrees that the cuts will be extended ""for the roughly 98 percent of households in which couples have less than $250,000 in annual income or individuals earn less than $200,000.""

Most Republicans and some Democrats, however, also want to extend the tax cuts for the top 2 percent.

Ultimately, Democratic leadership decided to table the matter until after the November elections and adjourn without deciding one way or another. Bruun takes this to mean that the House (read: Democrats) failed to extend tax cuts for ""Oregon’s middle-class families and small businesses.""

But that’s not right. Congress is expected to pick the issue up once it reconvenes. There’s been no decision for or against the extension, but, generally, most everybody seems to agree that some piece of the tax cuts will be extended.

Bruun is clearly trying to equate a vote for adjournment with a vote not to extend tax cuts, and that’s just not the case. PolitiFact Oregon dubs this claim False.

Pacheco says Little has 'a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst types of corporate polluters'
","
Christopher H. Little, the Moderate Party’s candidate for attorney general, has tried to position himself as the candidate with the best experience to clean up Rhode Island’s politics and environment. Among other credentials, he cites his past chairmanship of Common Cause of Rhode Island and his three years as president of Save the Bay, beginning in 1987.

So it was no surprise that someone might try to sully his Mr. Clean persona. Earlier this month, state Democratic Party Chairman Edwin R. Pacheco said Little’s claim to being an environmental champion was contaminated by his private law work for polluters.

""Attorney general candidate Chris Little and his law firm have a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst type of corporate polluters,"" Pacheco said in an Oct. 4 news release.

Little dismissed Pacheco’s charges, saying ""Mr. Pacheco, you need to actually read these cases you’re citing. If you do you will find that I was actually trying to help preserve the environment.""

An open invitation to look at the record. How could we refuse?

Pacheco cites three instances in which he claims Little represented clients who were polluters:

* Two Massachusetts towns that took the federal Environmental Protection Agency to court over a proposed sludge  dump

* A chemical company whose North Carolina facility was designated a hazardous waste site

* A Massachusetts-based gasoline station operator that was fined for a gasoline spill in Brockton

We’ll look at them one-by-one.

The EPA suit

Pacheco’s first claim involves the Massachusetts towns of Walpole and Norfolk, which challenged a 1989 federal Environmental Protection Agency study that said it was environmentally safe to build a landfill for dried sewage sludge in Walpole.

Pacheco’s news release said the EPA found ""the towns violated water pollution laws. … Chris Little was on the side of polluters and lost.""

That case stemmed from the 1980s effort to clean up Boston Harbor. New filtration plants were built to purify sewage effluent before it was discharged into the harbor. But the new plants generated sludge, which had to be dumped somewhere. In 1989, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority decided that somewhere was in Walpole, near the Norfolk town line.

The towns objected and sued the EPA, claiming the EPA’s environmental impact study failed to address environmental threats the landfill would pose.

Little — who was with Tillinghast, Collins & Graham at the time — said he joined the effort in 1989 or 1990 on Norfolk’s behalf, after he’d represented the Rhode Island town of Richmond in its successful fight to stop a 70-acre landfill from being built there.

A federal district court judge ruled for the EPA, finding that the agency had considered the issues and met the federal standards for an impact study.

In the end, the dump was never built. In 1993, after lobbying by the state, the EPA agreed to a plan to have the dried sludge trucked to dumps in Utah.

Pacheco bases his criticism of Little on a summary of the suit on LexisNexis, an Internet data base, which said ""the EPA found that the towns had violated the Water Pollution Control Act...""

However, the judge’s decision shows that summary was inaccurate. Rather than violating water pollution control laws, the towns were trying to get them enforced more stringently. In fact, the ruling shows it was Little’s client who sought tougher environmental law enforcement.

The North Carolina company

Pacheco's news release said: In 1988, Little's law firm continued their quest against environmental protection when his firm defended a company that had a history of contaminating drinking water supplies.""

That company was National Starch and Chemical, a North Carolina firm that makes chemicals for textile and furniture makers.

Pacheco’s statement cites a 1980s case in which National Starch was cited for storing 350,000 gallons of liquid waste in unlined trenches on its property. Because of the threat to local drinking water wells, the EPA ordered it to clean up the site.

Little did represent National Starch, but it was in a case in Rhode Island, not North Carolina.

National Starch was among several companies that used a New Jersey company to dispose of their waste.

The companies thought their waste was going to an incinerator in New Jersey, but instead it was taken to Rhode Island, where it was illegally dumped at the Davis site in Smithfield, later designated as a Superfund site.

The company agreed to pay $5 million toward the cleanup; Little represented it in subsequent lawsuits to recover that money from the disposal company that misled it.

Little maintains his work for National Starch wasn’t to defend a polluter but to make sure the real guilty party paid financially.

The oil company

Pacheco’s third claim involved legal work Little did for gasoline station owner Mutual Oil of Massachusetts. His news release says Mutual Oil was fined $50,000 by the state for spilling gasoline at a station it owned in Brockton, a claim we verified through the Massachusetts attorney general’s report for fiscal year 2002.

Little did represent Mutual Oil, but not in that case. Instead, it was in a Rhode Island zoning dispute. In 1999 a developer wanted to build a gas station in a Stop & Shop shopping center on Mendon Road, in Cumberland, near the Blackstone River.

A group of local gas station owners that wanted to stop a new competitor convinced the zoning board to reject the plan, in part because the gas station would have been built on a floodplain of the Blackstone River. Little said Mutual Oil financed his work on behalf of the local station owners.

To summarize:

Pacheco was wrong when he said Little ""was on the side of the polluters"" in the Massachusetts sludge case.

He was correct when he said Little represented a North Carolina company that caused pollution problems in that state. But Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that case.

He was correct when he said a Little client had been fined for a spill in Massachusetts. But again, Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that spill.

Bottom line: None of the cases Pacheco cites supports his attack on Little.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Jennifer Carroll']","
Jennifer Carroll says Rick Scott has no ties to a lobbyist
","
Rick Scott, the millionaire Republican gubernatorial candidate, is a businessman who has never been elected to public office. He has promoted himself as someone outside of the political GOP establishment, which largely backed Bill McCollum, a former congressman and current attorney general, during the primary. Clearly, the lobbyist/insider GOP crowd had hoped McCollum would win.

But since he won the primary Aug. 24, 2010, Scott has had to make nice with those involved in GOP politics in Florida -- and they with him -- in hopes of defeating Democrat Alex Sink. Generally, that would include lobbyists.

In a Sept. 27 speech to the Broward Republican Executive Committee we attended -- the Broward County party's central group -- Scott's running mate Jennifer Carroll tried to reinforce that outsider image for Scott. Listen to Carroll around minute 5:30 on this video posted on the Sun-Sentinel Broward Politics blog:

Rick Scott ""doesn't have any ties to Tallahassee, he doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist,'' Carroll said. She continued but some of her comments were drowned out by cheers.

For this Truth-O-Meter we will check, is Scott devoid of any ties to lobbyists?

We e-mailed and called spokespersons with the Scott campaign for several days starting on the morning of Oct. 1 to ask what Carroll meant when she said Scott ""doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist."" We heard back Monday, Oct. 4, when  Carroll spokeswoman Erin Isaac responded in a brief e-mail:

""Clearly, Rep. Carroll was noting that Rick is not a career politician, but an outsider who risked his own money on a campaign to get this state back to work. As governor, Rick will be beholden to no one except the citizens of Florida.""

We agree that Scott is not a career politician and spent his own money on his campaign. But note that Isaac did not address the claim Carroll made about him lacking ties to lobbyists.

We would define a tie to a lobbyist as receiving campaign donations from lobbyists, attending fundraisers hosted by lobbyists on his behalf, or employing lobbyists in Scott's Florida companies.

Fundraisers hosted by lobbyists 
Let's start with the post-primary fundraisers.

An item in the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog Sept. 3 stated that Scott had a fundraiser at the offices of lobbyists.

""After his morning fundraiser at Associated Industries of Florida, Republican Rick Scott continues the rounds in Tallahassee today with a $10,000 a person fundraiser at the offices of health care lobbyists Jon Johnson and Travis Blanton at 3:30 p.m. today. Question to ponder: what is the definition of 'insider?' ""

On Aug. 28, The Buzz blog of the St. Petersburg Times published an e-mail from lobbyist Marty Fiorentino inviting others to a reception with Scott in Jacksonville ""so we can get to know Rick better"" and asked that participants bring five checks or $2,500.

So, Scott has attended fundraisers hosted by lobbyists.

Donations by lobbyists 
Next we wanted to check whether any lobbyists had donated to Scott's campaign. First we went to the Florida Division of Elections website to search Scott's contributions from anyone who identified themselves as lobbyists for reports through Sept. 17 -- the most recent report posted by the time Carroll made her claim. Note that it's possible that some contributors were listed as attorneys, consultants or by other titles who are also registered lobbyists. But here are contributors in the order the Scott campaign listed them who were identified on Scott's own fundraising reports as lobbyists. All but one were after the primary and many on the same day.

• Stephen S. Dick. June 25. $500

• David I. Bitner. Sept. 2. $500

• Henry Dean & Associates. Sept. 7. $500

• Paul R. Bradshaw. Sept. 8. $500 (Sally S. Bradshaw, listed as a consultant at the same address, also gave $500 the same day. She was a chief of staff to former Gov. Jeb Bush.)

• Jefferson Monroe Consulting. Sept. 8. $500

• Johnson & Blanton. Sept. 8. $500

• Steven J. Madden. Sept. 8. $500

• David A. Rancourt. Sept. 8. $500

• Stacey S. Webb. Sept. 8. $500

• Brian D. Ballard. Sept. 13. $500. (Kathryn Ballard, listed as a homemaker at the same address, gave $500 the same day.)

• John M. Stipanovich. Sept. 14. $500

• Hunt-Watters. Sept. 15. $500

A few of those lobbyists -- Paul Bradshaw, Madden, Rancourt, and Webb work at Southern Strategy Group. Those listed as lobbyists in the campaign reports add up to about $6,000 (add another $1,000 if you include the two donors at the same address as the lobbyists) out of $807,582.45 in monetary donations by Sept. 17. Scott's campaign is largely bankrolled on his own money.

So he also accepts money from lobbyists. But wait, we're not done yet.

Still more donations by lobbyists 
We also checked the donors to Scott's electioneering communication organization Let's Get to Work. That campaign finance report identified two as lobbyists:

• Susan Goldstein Consulting. Aug. 13. $1,000

• Larry J. Overton & Associates. Aug. 19. $5,000

But we recognized a couple others who work as lobbyists including:

• Ronald Book. Aug. 17. $25,000. Attorney

• Brewton Plante. Aug. 13 and Sept. 20. $7,500. Attorney.

We feared we could have missed many lobbyists who were listed on campaign finance reports by other occupations such as ""consultant"" or ""attorney."" With the help of St. Petersburg Times Tallahassee bureau chief Steve Bousquet and Miami Herald bureau chief Mary Ellen Klas, we found several other lobbyists who gave directly to Scott's campaign account. We verified that these donors were 2010 registered lobbyists on the state's legislative lobbyist database and/or the executive branch lobbyist database. Here are a sample of the some of the well-known lobbyist donors to Scott's campaign we found:

• Akerman Senterfitt: Sept. 14. $500. Has several clients including Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and City of Miami.

• Thomas Arnold: Sept. 8. $500. Southern Strategy Group whose principals include the state's agency for health care administration and several companies. (He was Medicaid director under Bush and, under Gov. Charlie Crist, served as secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration.)

• Peter Antonacci: Sept. 8. $500. Works for Gray Robinson. Clients include cities of Hollywood, Key West and several other entities.

• Wilbur Brewton: Sept. 14. $500. Brewton Plante firm. Calder Race Course in Opa-Locka is among the clients.

• Colleen Castille: July 15 and Sept. 8, total of $600. Go Green Strategies. Several different clients including environmental-related entities. Castille was a former secretary for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection from 2004-2007.

• Jorge Chamizo: Sept. 16. $500. Floridian Partners. Clients include Cuban-American Bar Association, North Broward Hospital District, Florida Power & Light.

• Dutko Poole McKinley: Dutko Worldwide's clients include Comcast, Florida Power & Light, Miami Dade County. (Dutko Poole McKinley is a subsidiary of Dutko Worldwide.) The company's website states that managing partner Van B. Poole is a former state House minority whip and a state Republican Party chair (he is actually a past chair.)

• John French. June 17 and Sept. 8, total of $1,000. (On June 17, The Buzz described French as the records custodian for Scott's Let's Get to Work political committee and as an election law specialist and paid consultant to Scott's campaign.)

• Fowler White Boggs: Sept. 14. $500. Clients include U.S. Sugar Corp.

• Beth Gosnell: June 4. $500. BG & Associates International in Tallahassee. Clients include AT&T and Florida Power & Light.

• The Rubin Group. May 21. $500.

Note we could have kept going but stopped around the letter ""G"" after we had made the point. Lobbyist donors to Scott's campaign include those with high-placed ties within state government and represent some major companies in Florida as well as public entities with interests ranging from gambling to the environment. To put it bluntly, these are some hot-shot lobbyists with influence in a range of state government areas.

Employing lobbyists 
What about Scott the businessman himself? We wanted to know if he had employed lobbyists. We checked Solantic, the company of urgent care centers Scott co-founded. The 2010 legislative lobbyist database for principals did not include Solantic but the 2009 legislative lobbyist database and the 2009 executive branch lobbyist database included three for Solantic: Melissa Akeson, William Rubin and Heather Turnbull, who all work for The Rubin Group, according to that company's website.

We sent most of our findings to Isaac, Carroll's spokeswoman, and she did not dispute them in her Oct. 4 e-mail reply to us and did not respond when we contacted her again with our findings on Oct. 18.

Our ruling 
Carroll told the Broward GOP in September that Scott ""doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist."" Scott wasn't the go-to preferred pick among the lobbyist crowd during the primary. But he has taken multiple donations from lobbyists and, since the primary, lobbyists organized at least two fundraisers for him. And in 2009, Scott's Solantic employed Florida lobbyists. It would be extremely unusual for any statewide candidate who won the primary to be completely devoid of lobbyist ties. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Rick Scott, Mr. Outsider, on the verge of being kingpin to insiders,"" Aug. 31, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Inside Southern Strategy, connections help,"" March 7, 2004\n\nMiami Herald Naked Politics blog, ""#FF: Rick Scott, who is making the rounds of Tallahassee lobbying offices,"" Sept. 3, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg Times The Buzz blog, ""GOP heavy-hitter$ lining up for Rick Scott and Jeb may join unity tour,"" Aug. 28, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg Times The Buzz blog, ""Scott\'s new 527 fund will boost his campaign"",June 17, 2010\n\nFlorida Division of Elections, Rick Scott campaign finance reports, 2010 election\n\nState of Florida, Registered lobbyist legislative directory, 2009-2010\n\nInterview, Rick Scott spokeswoman Erin Isaac, Oct. 4, 2010', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/rick-scott-mr-outsider-on-the-verge-of-being-kingpin-of-insiders/1118547')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/18/jennifer-carroll/jennifer-carroll-says-rick-scott-has-no-ties-lobby/
"['Social Security', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist says Social Security plan embraced by former labor secretary Robert Reich
","
It's election season in Florida, which means it must be time to talk about Social Security.

In particular, the federal entitlement program has found a prominent role in the compelling three-way race for U.S. Senate between independent Charlie Crist, Democrat Kendrick Meek and Republican Marco Rubio.

Crist is airing a television ad saying that Rubio wants to raise the retirement age for beneficiaries and cut benefits. PolitiFact Florida ruled the claim Half True because Crist doesn't tell voters that Rubio's plan wouldn't affect current retirees or people nearing the retirement age.

Rubio -- and even Meek -- are now piling on Crist for supporting what Rubio says amounts to amnesty for illegal immigrants in order to fund Social Security beyond 2037.

Social Security was the first major policy issue discussed in the trio's past two debates, Oct. 6, 2010, with ABC News and on Fox on Oct. 15. Here's how Crist described his plan during the ABC News debate.

""I think it's important that we realize where Social Security is today. And let's have a mature discussion about it,"" Crist said. ""Report after report says that it's solvent until 2037 or 2041. I'm an optimist. I'm hopeful that the economy will continue to improve. But I've also offered a plan that can help it that's supported by Robert Reich, secretary of labor-- previously, in a previous administration. And it's straightforward and simple.

""There are 11 (million) to 14 million people, different estimates by different people, that are not American citizens today -- not participating in the American economy,"" Crist said. ""If we can find a pathway to earn citizenship for those 11 to 14 million people, they would be paying into the system. And when 2037 or 2041 comes, if in fact Social Security is still being challenged, we have another way and an opportunity to pay for it that provides jobs in a legal sense, and is compassionate to immigrants who come to our country.""

Meek called Crist's idea ""bizarre,"" and Rubio said it's akin to amnesty. (For the record, Crist does talk about earned citizenship).

In this fact check we're focusing on Crist's plan for Social Security and ultimately whether Reich, President Bill Clinton's labor secretary, can be counted among its supporters.

Social Security is always a big issue in Florida. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, more than 3.5 million Floridians receive Social Security benefits. Typically, you need to work in order to be eligible for Social Security and benefits are based on what you earned. The program is funded by payroll taxes.

In 2010, for the first time, Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it takes in. The deficit, approximately $41 billion, will be offset by money in the Social Security trust fund. By 2014, as the baby boomer generation retires, deficits are expected to increase, according to the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. By 2037, the trust fund will be empty, trustees predict, and incoming taxes will only be able to pay out 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2084.

So something needs to change between now and 2037 -- whether it's raising the retirement age, altering benefits, or something else -- to keep Social Security solvent.

Crist says he thinks one way to keep Social Security solvent is by having people currently working in the country illegally earn citizenship and pay payroll taxes, which in turn would fund future Social Security benefits.

And Reich, who now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley, also pointed to immigration as a way to solve problems funding Social Security. He wrote a blog for the Christian Science Monitor in April 2010 entitled ""Immigration: Could it solve Social Security, Medicare woes?""

""The biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast,"" Reich wrote. ""It's not just that so many boomers are retiring. It’s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children. Add it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking.

""Forty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There's no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree.

""This is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people. Yes, I know: There aren't enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades.

""Get it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States.""

Unlike Crist, Reich's comments do not address illegal workers. Rather, his point is to allow more people to legally immigrate to the United States. That's different from what Crist is saying.

In fact it turns out Social Security already is receiving a huge benefit from illegal workers who are paying into the system but as of now are unable to receive any of the benefits. Back in 2005, the New York Times reported that illegal workers essentially are contributing a $6 billion to $7 billion annual subsidy. More recent estimates suggest illegal workers are now paying $9 billion to $12 billion a year into Social Security, with no legal way to get that money back in retirement benefits.

Some illegal workers are paid under the table in cash, meaning there is no record that they're working, and of course, no taxes for the federal government to extract. But many more purchase fake IDs and get fake Social Security cards in order to work, on the surface, legally.

When those workers are paid, they still pay Social Security payroll taxes. But the federal government can't match those taxes up to a living, real person -- which is the way the government determines a worker's retirement benefit.

Some of the Social Security discrepancies are clerical in nature and get fixed. But many of them are thanks to illegal workers submitting bogus Social Security information. The Social Security Administration estimates that two-thirds of illegal workers are paying Social Security payroll taxes.

Over the life of Social Security, government actuary Stephen C. Goss said, illegal workers have contributed between $120 billion and $240 billion.

That's money that is helping keep Social Security afloat for current and future beneficiaries.

Crist's plan would potentially tap the other third of illegal workers not paying payroll taxes, but also would allow all workers access to Social Security benefits when they reach retirement age. Added benefits, yes. But added costs, too.

Needless to say, that wasn't what Reich was even talking about in his blog for the Christian Science Monitor. ""I've said we'll have to increase legal immigration in order to secure the Social Security of boomers (otherwise, the ratio of working population to retirees gets too far out of whack), but don't recall saying anything more,"" Reich wrote to the National Review.

In an ABC News debate, Crist said his plan to help preserve Social Security -- to have illegal workers earn a path to citizenship -- was supported by former Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich. But Reich hasn't taken a side on that issue. Reich proposes allowing increased legal immigration to add more workers for each retiree, which is different. We rate Crist's claim False.","[('\nABC News, Senate debate transcript, Oct. 6, 2010\n\nRobert Reich, ""Immigration: Could it solve Social Security, Medicare woes?""

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Michael Bennet']","
Ken Buck opposes abortion, including cases of rape or incest
","
The race for U.S. Senate in Colorado is neck-and-neck between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and Republican Ken Buck. Bennet, a former superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, was appointed to the seat when then-Sen. Ken Salazar became the U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the Obama administration. Buck, the district attorney for Weld County, has support from the tea party movement and defeated a more establishment rival in the Republican primary.

A recent ad from Bennet attacks Buck's views as out of the mainstream.

""Extreme beauty, extreme sports -- good extremes in Colorado,"" the ad says. ""But what about Ken Buck's extreme ideas? Do we really want to privatize Social Security and risk it in the stock market? ... Are we ready to outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest? Extreme beauty is a good thing, but Colorado's no place for Buck's extreme ideas.""

We fact-checked the charge that Buck wants to privatize Social Security, and we rated that statement Half True. We found that Buck has been clear that he does not want to change the program for current retirees or those close to retiring.

This time we wanted to look at Buck's views on abortion. During a debate on NBC's Meet the Press on Oct. 17, moderator David Gregory asked Buck about waffling on issues like abortion, which made us wonder if Bennet's charge that Buck wants to ""outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape or incest"" was true. We want to be clear here that we're not checking whether Buck's views on abortion are ""extreme"" but only whether the Bennet ad accurately characterizes them.

Our first stop was Buck's website. ""As a father of two, Ken believes in the value of life and is opposed to abortion except to protect the life of the mother,"" the site says. ""As U.S. Senator, Ken will oppose federal funding of abortion and will fight to protect the life of the unborn.""

We then turned to news coverage of Buck's public statements. Buck has said in response to questions from voters that he opposes abortion and that includes pregnancies that result from rape or incest.

""I don't believe in the exceptions of rape or incest. I believe that the only exception, I guess, is life of the mother,"" Buck said. ""And that is only if it's truly life of the mother. To me, you can't say you're pro-life and say -- if there is, and it's a very rare situation where one life would have to cease for the other life to exist. But in that very rare situation ... we may have to take the life of the child to save the life of the mother. In that rare situation, I am in favor of that exception. But, other than that, I have no exceptions in my position.""

In the course of our research, we noted two instances in which Buck has changed position on abortion-related issues, but neither one was about exceptions for rape or incest. Earlier in the campaign, Buck indicated he favored a state constitutional amendment that would have granted personhood to people ""from the beginning of biological development."" Later, he backed off full support for the amendment, because some people believe the amendment will outlaw some forms of birth control.

""I have said that I am in favor of personhood as a concept,"" Buck said in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS's Face the Nation. ""I am not taking a position on any of the state amendments, and I have said over and over again -- and it has been reported over and over again -- that I am not in favor of banning any common forms of birth control in Colorado or in the United States.""

His website also says, ""Ken believes life begins at conception and does not favor doing away with common forms of birth control, like the pill.""

The other question has been whether Buck would vote to confirm presidential nominees who favor abortion rights. Buck indicated earlier in the campaign that he would not confirm such nominees, but later he said he would only oppose nominees who are activists for abortion rights.

""I won't use abortion as a litmus test with a pro-choice individual,"" Buck told Schieffer. ""Someone that is an activist on the abortion issue, I think, goes outside the pale, and I cannot support an activist on the abortion issue.""

To be clear, we did not find any instance of Buck changing position from the view that abortion law should not include exceptions for rape or incest. And a campaign spokesperson reaffirmed that position.

""Ken is pro-life, and only has one exception -- that's when the life of the mother is at risk,"" said Owen Loftus.

But Loftus also said that Buck is focused on economic issues and government spending. ""The reality is that the Senate only deals with a few abortion related issues -- partial birth abortion and public funding. Ken would not support either. This ad is another example of how Michael Bennet wants to talk about anything but the issues that Coloradans care about -- creating jobs, controlling spending and getting our economy back on track.""

In reviewing the record, Buck has said he opposes abortion, even in the cases of rape or incest. We did not find any evidence of him changing position on that issue over the course of the campaign. So we rate Bennet's statement True.","[('\nMichael Bennet for U.S. Senate, ""Extreme"" ad against Ken Buck, Oct. 15, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SAwzrvGjIk&feature=player_profilepage'), ('\nNBC News, ""Meet the Press"" transcript, Oct. 17, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nKen Buck campaign web site, ""Respect for Life,"" accessed Oct. 18, 2010', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39674828/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts'), ('\nYouTube, Ken Buck: No abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, Aug. 3, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nFace the Nation, Interview with Ken Buck, Sept. 26, 2010', 'http://buckforcolorado.com/respect-life'), ('\nPikes Peak Citizens for Life, 2010 Candidate Survey', 'No link'), ('\nThe Denver Post, Buck softens stance on abortion and ""personhood,"" Sept. 19, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh0iWCqAkps'), ('\nThe Associated Press, Colo.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Small Business', 'U.S. Chamber of Commerce']","
U.S. Chamber says health care law hammers small businesses in an attack on Betsy Markey, D-Colo.
","
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is attacking Betsy Markey, a Colorado House member running for re-election, for supporting major Democratic initiatives. But in making its criticism, the chamber distorts key parts of the proposals.

""Colorado is facing economic disaster,"" the ad says. ""We told Betsy Markey we needed jobs. Why didn't she listen? Markey fought for the Obama-Pelosi government take over of health care, crushing small businesses with billions in penalties. Now Markey wants a national energy tax, costing families nearly $2,000 a year. Call Betsy Markey, tell her to listen. Tell her to stop supporting Pelosi and making the economy worse.""

Markey did vote for the new health care law, a major overhaul of health care regulations, as well as a cap-and-trade law intended to curb carbon emissions and address climate change. But the ad's descriptions of those measures are deceptive.

For example, Markey does not favor a national energy tax. She did support a cap-and-trade proposal that limits carbon emissions of polluters by requiring them to buy permits. Companies would more than likely pass on their costs to consumers, but it wouldn't cost nearly $2,000. Nonpartisan agencies estimate it would cost families between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. We wrote a detailed analysis last year when Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create ""a $1,761 yearly energy tax."" We rated the statement False. The $1,761 number was a figure created and promoted by a conservative blogger.

Here, we're looking at the ad's claim that the Democratic health care law crushes small businesses ""with billions in penalties.""

We found this claim perplexing, because small businesses can actually qualify for tax credits under the new health care law.

Generally speaking, tax credits are available to employers with fewer than 25 employees who are paid average annual wages of less than $50,000. If the employer pays for at least half of the insurance for workers, the employer gets a tax credit for part of the contributions. Those tax credits start for the 2010 tax year, and they increase in 2014 when more provisions of the health care law take effect.

During the debate leading up to the health care law, members of Congress considered -- but ultimately rejected -- a straightfoward mandate requiring employers to offer health care to workers and imposing penalties if they didn't. Instead, they came up with a complicated fine for large employers. Starting in 2014, large employers who don't offer health care face a fine, but only if their workers qualify for tax credits from the government to buy health care. It's likely that most large employers who don't offer insurance will have to pay the fine.

But again, small employers -- those with 50 employees or fewer -- are exempt from the fine.

Still, that's the provision the Chamber pointed to when we asked them for evidence for the claim in the ad. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the fines would come to $52 billion over 10 years.

We should note that there's a lot of political mischief to be had around the term ""small business."" Pollsters tell us that Americans have very positive opinions of small businesses, but people often have different ideas of what size a small business is. 
In a similar vein, Republicans have made the case this year that most of the wealthiest Americans are actually small business owners, but that's a dubious claim. We looked into a statement to that effect earlier this year and rated it Barely True. And the health care law does impose some new taxes on the wealthiest Americans: It imposes a 3.8 percent tax on the investment income of couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000.

The Chamber argued that businesses can have more than 50 employees and still be considered small businesses.  Spokesman J.P Fielder pointed to regulations from the Small Business Administration that consider a small business to be anyone with 500 or fewer employees. 
And it's true that generally speaking, the Small Business Administration does consider a small business to be a firm with 500 employees or less. But there are exceptions for that, depending on the industry. For example, a manufacturing firm with 500 employees is probably a small manufacturer, but an accounting firm with 500 employees is relatively large, said spokesman Hayley Matz. In some cases, the small business designation is determined by the firm's revenues, not the number of employees. 
We also looked at research the Small Business Administration compiles using data from the U.S. Census. Their research shows that the vast majority of businesses in the United States have fewer than 50 employees. In 2007, 5,814,584 firms had fewer than 50 employees, compared with a total just over 6,049,655 firms. In other words, 96 percent of U.S. small businesses are specifically exempted from fines on employers who don't insure their employees.

The Chamber's ad said that the new health care law crushes small businesses ""with billions in penalties."" But some small businesses will actually get tax credits from the health care law. Meanwhile, almost all small businesses -- those with fewer than 50 employees -- are exempt from penalties, whether they offer insurance or not. Some small businesses are larger than 50 employees and could face fines if they don't offer employees insurance. But a vast majority of U.S. firms are smaller than 50 employees and are exempt from the health insurance requirements. The chamber's ad is sweeping, and doesn't account for any of the positive provisions that don't ""crush"" small business but actually help them. So we rate the Chamber's statement False.","[('\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, campaign ad on Betsy Markey, Oct. 5, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RvMpfuDVnI'), ('\nE-mail interview with J.P Fielder of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce', 'No link'), ('\nKaiser Family Foundation, Employer Roles, accessed Oct. 15, 2010', 'http://healthreform.kff.org/video-explainers/employer-roles.aspx'), ('\nU.S. House Clerk, Roll call vote 477 (cap and trade), June 26, 2009', 'No link'), ('\nThomas,\xa0 American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (cap and trade)', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll477.xml'), ('\nU.S. House Clerk, Roll call vote 165 (health care), March 21, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nThomas, Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hr2454'), ('\nU.S. Government Printing Office, Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, accessed Oct. 15, 2010\n\nThomas, Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, accessed Oct. 15, 2010\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, Summary of new health reform law: Tax changes related to health insurance, last updated June 18, 2010, accessed Aug. 18, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nCongressional Budget Office, H.R. 4872, Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Final Health Care Legislation), March 20, 2010', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml'), ('\nInterview with Hayley Matz of the U.S. Small Business Administration', 'No link'), ('\nU.S. Small Business Administration, Firm Size Data', 'http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hr3590'), ('\nU.S. Small Business Administration, Employer Firms, Establishments, Employment, and Annual Payroll Small Firm Size Classes, 2007', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/18/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-says-health-care-law-hammers-small-busi/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Sarah Ponder']","
Austinite says $800,000 cost of special session could pay for 1.6 million condoms, 90,000 months of the pill or 20 sexual health educators
","
Amid thousands of protesters at the Texas Capitol, Sarah Ponder of Austin carried a sign with a financial comparison: ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 90K months of the pill, 20 full-time sexual health educators or 1 medically unnecessary & hypocritical special session,"" it read. 
The July 1, 2013, rally took place the first day of the 2013 Legislature’s second special session, called by Gov. Rick Perry after a filibuster and demonstrators kept legislation restricting abortions from winning final Senate approval. 
Ponder, who works for an education technology company, said she wanted to show that the money likely to be spent on the special session could instead pay for measures she said would be more effective at reducing abortions: providing substantial contraception aids or paying 20 educators’ salaries for a year. 
We shopped around, comparing the costs of a special session to Ponder’s alternatives. 
In a June 26, 2013, news story Ponder sent us, Waco ABC affiliate WXXV-TV said, ""Each special session could cost taxpayers more than $800,000,"" based on per-diem payments to legislators to cover their food and expenses. 
Other news stories we found typically gave either a per diem cost of $800,000, a per diems-plus-overhead cost of $1 million or both. 
Per diems are the biggest cost of Texas special sessions, which can last up to 30 days. At the current per diem rate of $150, with 182 lawmakers eligible (31 senators, 150 representatives and the lieutenant governor), 30 days of payments would equal $819,000. 
Not all lawmakers take the payments, though. June 18, 2013, news stories from the Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle indicated that during the year’s first special session, six or eight senators and 26 House members declined some or all of the payments. Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine told us by phone that Dewhurst turned down all per diem payments for both special sessions. If 33 lawmakers rejected the payment on days their chambers did not convene, the state might have shelled out $716,100 on per diems during the session. 
Other costs bring the total up. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton told us by email that, wrapping in overhead costs such as utilities, security, printing and staff support, a 30-day special session could cost $1 million to $1.2 million. 
Ponder emailed us a March 12, 2012, news story from The Week, a news magazine, that said generic-drug versions of birth control pills cost $9 a month and brand-name pills cost $90 a month. 
The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy offers information at bedsider.org on the availability and costs of contraceptive options. The group is a nonprofit that produces research frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention organizations. 
The campaign’s site gives the same $9-$90 range cited in The Week’s article, with explanatory details. 
Oral contraception pills, containing hormones that prevent egg production or fertilization, are usually taken once a day. ""A woman without insurance using generic birth control pills will typically pay about $25 a month,"" according to the site. The group’s chief program officer, Bill Albert, told us by phone that information on the site is updated and current. 
With Medicaid or private insurance, according to the site, women can get the pill free or for just the cost of their co-pay (the fixed amount an insured patient pays out-of-pocket each time he or she gets a medical service). ""For most people,"" the Bedsider article said, the co-pay ""ranges from $5 to $35."" 
Federal funding makes free or low-cost pills available to many, the site said. 
Without insurance, generic pills at pharmacies can cost $10-$20 a month, the site says, or $20-$30 a month from Planned Parenthood, with name-brand pills selling for $60-$90 a month at pharmacies. The site says its information came from a survey of Planned Parenthood clinics and birth control manufacturers. 
Ponder told us she chose an average cost per condom of 50 cents by looking at items for sale on Amazon.com. 
Bedsider.org gives prices from a survey of online retailers: 30 cents to $1.54 apiece for male condoms at national chain pharmacies and 18 cents to 60 cents apiece at Walmart. As with the pill, the site said, condoms can be obtained for free or at reduced costs at clinics. 
But also as with the pill, there are more expensive options available. In a December 2009 article, Consumer Reports rated 22 types of condoms on strength, reliability and whether holes were present in the material; the best seven ranged from 71 cents to $1.10 each. 
To check options that are widely available, we visited a CVS pharmacy on South Congress Avenue and found prices from 79 cents to $4.35 apiece. 
Ponder said she estimated from personal knowledge that the annual salary of an entry-level sexual health educator at a nonprofit organization might be about $35,000 to $40,000. 
Francine Gertz, human resources manager for the City of Austin’s health and human services department, told us by phone that the city employs health educators in programs such as its adolescent health initiative, which according to its website provides education and presentations for students, parents and others. 
The entry-level salary for a first-level public health educator -- a job that requires a four-year degree and two years of experience -- is $40,000, Gertz said, and a second-level public health educator with 13 years of experience might earn $54,000. 
Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Lisa Givens suggested by email that we look at a couple of the federal government’s occupation categories. One was ""health educators,"" which encompassed broad job titles such as community health worker and narrow ones such as early breastfeeding care specialist. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website, most people employed in this category nationwide earned about $53,000 a year as of May 2012. 
Job search website Indeed.com, whose data has been cited by Forbes and U.S. News and World Report magazines, says the average annual salary for a ""sexual health educator"" in Texas is $50,000 (compared with $52,000 nationally). Such averages are based, the site says, on ""salary information extracted from over 50 million job postings from thousands of unique sources over the last 12 months."" 
Now, let’s take another look at that sign. 
A 30-day special session might cost $716,100 to $819,000 in per diems alone; Ponder assumed an $800,000 cost. 
And how do the alternative expenditures on her sign price out? 
Like Ponder, we found estimates saying a month of oral contraceptive pills could cost $9 to $90, but we also read that a typical cost would be $25. Ponder went with the $9 figure and said $800,000 would buy 90,000 months of pills. We calculate that $800,000 would pay for 88,900 months of pills at $9 or 32,000 months at $25. 
That’s a difference of 4,700 years. To phrase it another way, $800,000 would buy 32,000 women a month’s worth of pills at $25 or 88,900 women’s pills for a month at $9. 
Condoms, Ponder estimated, would cost about 50 cents on average. With $800,000, we calculate, you could indeed provide 1.6 million 50-cent condoms. Using Bedsider.org’s range, we figure $800,000 would buy 2.7 million condoms at 30 cents each or 520,000 condoms at $1.54 each. 
To predict that $800,000 would pay for 20 full-time sexual health educators, Ponder said she estimated an annual salary for an entry-level position at a nonprofit at $35,000 to $40,000. That doesn’t contradict what we found, because the salaries we gathered covered a spectrum, from $40,000 for a city job requiring two years’ experience to $54,000 for veteran educators. We calculate that $800,000 would pay 20 educators at $40,000 or 16 educators at the Texas average salary of $50,000 listed by Indeed.com. 
Our ruling 
Ponder used a conservative estimate for the cost of the second special session, presuming it runs for the full 30 days. She used the lowest price we found for the pill, a mid-range price for condoms and a salary that doesn’t seem out of line for an entry-level sexual health educator position, so it’s probably true that under certain circumstances, you could pay for the items on her sign with $800,000 apiece. 
Then again, it might be fairer to estimate the pill at $25 a month instead of $9, which means you could only pay for 32,000 months of contraception, not the 90,000 months she cited. And unless you only wanted to hire newly-graduated sexual health educators, you might have to pay them more like $52,000 per year, which would cover 16 instead of 20 educators. 
So an adjusted version of the sign might read: ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 32,000 months of the pill, 16 full-time sexual health educators"" instead of ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 90K months of the pill, 20 full-time sexual health educators."" 
We rate Ponder’s claim as Mostly True.","[('\nInterview and email interview, excerpted, with Sarah Ponder, July 1, 2013', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SFZX9siuYQD88yim_G5Z93efZWkDmhTSr1g9qAo0E2Y/edit?usp=sharing'), ('\nWXXV-TV news story, ""2nd special session could cost taxpayers additional $800K,"" June 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nAustin American-Statesman, news story, ""Special session drags on, with legislators questioning focus, cost,"" June 6, 2013', 'http://www.kxxv.com/story/22697717/2nd-special-session-could-cost-taxpayers-additional-800k'), ('\nKUT-FM news story, ""As Special Session Lengthens, Cost to Texas Taxpayers Grows,"" June 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nDallas Morning News news story, ""Texas lawmakers draw extra pay for special session while far from Capitol,"" June 18, 2013', 'http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/special-session-drags-on-with-legislators-question/nYD27/'), ('\nHouston Chronicle news story, ""Lawmakers collect pay for expenses in recess,"" June 18, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nTexas Ethics Commission, Chapter 50.

Cuccinelli says McAuliffe opposes Virginia's right-to-work law
","
GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli is painting Democratic rival Terry McAuliffe as a pawn of labor unions. 
During a June 21 radio interview on WWRC 1260-AM, Cuccinelli dubbed his opponent ""Union Terry"" and said McAuliffe’s pro-labor stance goes beyond the bounds of most Democratic lawmakers in Virginia. 
""He’s not even in the same place as most of his Democrats in the General Assembly,"" Cuccinelli said. ""I mean, over three-fourths of them have supported the right-to-work, while he opposes it."" 
Few things are as sacred in Virginia politics as the right-to-work law, which bars compulsory union membership to hold a job. Virginia is among 24 right-to-work states and supporters have long argued the law spurs economic development and affirms personal freedom. It’s become a rite that successful statewide candidates in the Old Dominion -- Democrats and Republicans -- bow at the law’s altar. 
McAuliffe expressed his fealty during a Jan. 21 speech before the National Federation of Independent Business. ""We are a great right-to-work state,"" he said. ""We should never change that. It helps us do what we need to do to grow our businesses here in Virginia."" 
So we asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof that McAuliffe ""opposes"" the right-to-work law and received a three-page response from spokeswoman Anna Nix. 
Much of the response centered on a June 18 article in The Washington Post that said McAuliffe, during a visit to Northern Virginia, ""declined to say whether he would protect the commonwealth’s status as a right to work state or search for ways to make the state more friendly toward organized labor."" 
McAuliffe’s quoted response in the article, however, says nothing negative about right-to-work. 
""I’m going to work with management. I’m going to work with labor. I’m going to work with everybody to move Virginia forward,"" McAuliffe said. ""It’s not ‘either-or.’ We are a right-to-work state that has been here for many years, and it’s not going to change. But the focus has got to be not on trying to divide folks. [It] is, how do we work together to grow the Virginia economy to have the most diverse economy to bring in those 21st-century jobs?"" 
At a June 20 news conference in Northern Virginia, McAuliffe was again asked whether he would try to ""soften or weaken"" the law. He replied, ""Right-to-work has been the law here in Virginia for 65 years and I wouldn’t change it."" 
Other backup sent by Cuccinelli’s campaign equated McAuliffe’s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes the right-to-work law. 
But that’s a flawed argument. ""Just because he says, 'I don’t have a problem with union people,'  doesn’t mean he wants to do away with the right-to-work law,"" said James Meath, board chairman of Williams Mullen, a Richmond-based law firm. (Meath represents the Richmond Times-Dispatch in labor matters). 
Cuccinelli's camp, for example, pointed us to a blog posted by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in spring 2010 discussing McAuliffe’s plans, which he later dropped, to open an electric car manufacturing plant in Virginia. ""We’re going to have 2,000 folks down there -- all of them union members,"" McAuliffe said of his employment plan. 
Meath said it’s legal for McAuliffe or anyone starting a Virginia business to contact a union and say, ""Send me all your people; I’ll hire them."" The right-to-work law merely states that the employer could not insist those workers remain in the union after they were hired, Meath said. 
Cuccinelli, in laying his charge against McAuliffe during the radio interview, also noted that his opponent has supported collective bargaining for public workers and has received and has received ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" in campaign donations from organized labor. These issues, however, do not compromise the right-to-work law.    
Our ruling 
Cuccinelli said McAuliffe ""opposes"" the right-to-work law. He focuses on a June 18 news report that McAuliffe, during an interview, refused to defend right-to-work. But McAuliffe, in that article, did not criticize the popular law and was quoted as saying that right-to-work is ""not going to change."" 
On at least two occasions prior to Cuccinelli’s attack, McAuliffe stated that he would not try to alter the law, which he said ""helps grow our businesses here in Virginia."" 
Cuccinelli also makes a guilt-by-association argument, offering McAuliffe’s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes right-to-work. But this, too, is a flimsy argument: It is entirely possible to support unions and the right-to-work law. 
Cuccinelli fails to provide credible proof of his claim and we rate it False.","[('\nKen Cuccinelli, ""3/4 of VA Dems Support Right-To-Work; Why Not McAuliffe?""', 'http://www.nrtw.org/c/vartwlaw.htm'), ('\nNational Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, ""Right to Work States: Virginia,"" accessed June 26, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nNational Journal, ""Cuccinelli Stretches Labor Argument vs. McAuliffe,"" June 23, 2013.', 'http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/hotlineoncall/2013/06/cuccinelli-stretches-labor-argument-vs-mcauliffe-23'), ('\nYouTube, ""Terry McAuliffe Says He Would Sign A Collective Bargaining Agreement As Governor,"" March 13, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nVirginia Public Access Project, ""Donations by Industry Reported by Terry McAuliffe Committees,"" accessed June 26, 2013.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gSc9cCbOlDw#at=29'), ('\nWashington Post, ""McAuliffe, at Silver Line station, touts support of project, says Cuccinelli fought it,"" June 18, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nNational Federation of Independent Business, ""VIDEO: McAuliffe Tells NFIB He Supports Right-To-Work, Regulatory Reform,"" Jan. 22, 2013.', 'http://www.vpap.org/candidates/profile/money_in_industry1/11897?start_year=2010&end_year=2013&lookup_type=year&filing_period=all'), ('\nYouTube, ""Terry McAuliffe Answers Questions from the Press,"" June 20, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nRichmond Times-Dispatch, ""Business, tech leaders question gubernatorial candidates,"" June 21, 2013.', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/mcauliffe-at-silver-line-station-touts-support-of-project-says-cuccinelli-fought-it/2013/06/18/9c8315ba-d858-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html'), ('\nInterview with James Meath, attorney and chairman of the board for Williams Mullen, June 28, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nVirginia Public Access Project, Donations by industry reported by Terry McAuliffe committees, accessed June 28.', 'http://www.nfib.com/nfib-in-my-state/nfib-in-my-state-content?cmsid=61845')]",/factchecks/2013/jul/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-opposes-virginias-right-/

Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke says 4 homicides a year in Milwaukee would be a record when he was a kid
","
At a Milwaukee forum entitled ""The Second Amendment and the Black Community,"" two high-profile African Americans with opposing views on firearms spoke of an earlier time they vividly recall as a safer time. 
Longtime community activist and radio voice Earl Ingram Jr., a critic of concealed carry laws, said his first question to classrooms of city students is always: ""How many of you know someone who’s been shot?"" 
""I’ll tell you, 60 to 70 percent and maybe higher will raise their hand,"" Ingram told an audience at the Community Brainstorming Conference breakfast meeting on June 22, 2013. ""And then I think about that question being asked to my generation. If one person raised their hand we would all look at them in disbelief."" 
Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who urges citizens to arm themselves to ward off harm, offered his own memories. 
""When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number,"" said Clarke, 56. ""So a lot obviously has gone on since then."" 
A good chunk of the sheriff’s childhood overlapped with the 20-year run of Police Chief Harold Breier as Milwaukee’s top cop. Breier called Milwaukee ""the safest city in the nation"" just months before retiring in 1984. 
Clarke went to work in Breier’s MPD as a patrolman in 1978 at the age of 21, and later worked his way up to homicide detective and various command staff positions. He was appointed sheriff in 2002 and has been re-elected since. 
Is Clarke right that homicides were a rarity when he was growing up? 
We took a walk back in time through Milwaukee Police crime stats and news stories to get an answer. Clarke declined to discuss his remarks. 
One of the first news stories we found from the era said that Milwaukee’s 1960 murder rate per capita was lowest of any major city. At the time, Milwaukee was the nation’s 11-largest city (population 741,324). 
But Clarke’s memory for the frequency of homicides was fuzzy. He recalled ""if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number."" 
Milwaukee’s lowest annual homicide total in Clarke’s childhood was 12 in 1956, the year he was born. 
Homicides tallied in the 20s in most of his first 10 years, and then picked up their pace, totaling 36, 46 and 51 before Clarke’s teen years began. 
And if you include his early teenage years as part of his time as a ""kid,"" the count had risen sharply to 75 in 1973, when Clarke was 17. 
So, instead of coming in at record-setting lows, as Clarke recalled, homicide was doubling or tripling during his youth. 
As a point of reference, the figure of 75 was higher than the homicide total in both 2008 and 2009. At the same time, that figure looks low when compared with the early 1990s, when homicides hit 160 as crack cocaine and related violence took hold. 
The sheriff, we found, would have better made his point about changes in safety by citing per-capita figures and national rankings. 
PolitiFact Wisconsin ran those numbers in March 2013 when analyzing a dispute over homicide figures used by Clarke and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn. 
The picture is much-changed compared with 1960, when that  study put the city’s homicide ranking as lowest among the largest cities. 
For starters, the city’s population is now 598,916, a number that dropped it to the 30th-largest U.S. city. And nationally in 2011, Milwaukee’s homicide rate was fifth highestin the country among cities of 500,000 to 999,000 people. And it was 18th-highest of 73 cities, when cities of 250,000 or more were included. 
Just looking at Milwaukee over time, the city’s homicide rate in 1960 was eight times lower than the 2010 rate, we found. 
Our rating 
Speaking about changes in the crime picture over time, Clarke said, ""When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number."" 
The sheriff’s memory misfired. In reality, homicides ranged from 12 to 75 during Clarke’s pre-adult years, accelerating at a steady clip.

State Rep. Ed Lindsey of Buckhead, one of the four major announced candidates for Georgia’s 11th Congressional District seat, accused fellow Republican candidate Bob Barr of waffling in his position on DOMA over the years. The 11th Congressional District seat is currently held by Marietta Republican Phil Gingrey, who’s running for the U.S. Senate.  
""Bob must have been so busy working for the ACLU that he missed that protecting traditional marriage was on the ballot in Georgia in 2004,"" Lindsey, R-Atlanta, said in a campaign email last week. ""... Given Bob’s gymnastic changes in his position on DOMA over the years, we do not know what his position was on traditional marriage in 2004, but I campaigned for it then and I will stay the course for my constituents now."" 
Has Barr changed his position on DOMA over the years? PolitiFact Georgia  wondered whether Lindsey’s claim had any merit, so we decided to investigate. 
The Supreme Court’s DOMA ruling came on a 5-4 vote. On the day of the ruling, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens made it clear that Georgia’s definition of marriage, as that between a man and woman, would stand. (In 2004, about 76 percent of Georgia voters approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.) 
On the same day as the court decision, Barr -- a former federal prosecutor and a former member of Georgia’s congressional delegation -- released his own statement about the DOMA ruling on his Facebook page: 
""I personally believe marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and, if it were on the ballot in Georgia, I'd vote that way. However, I have come to believe that it's yet one more example of the federal government's delving into areas that throughout our history have been best left to the states. I trust the judgement of the people of Georgia more than that of Washington, D.C."" 
We checked with Lindsey’s campaign spokesman, who said his candidate’s criticism of Barr was a reference to Barr’s Facebook statement. Lindsey’s statement also seems to play to the 11th District’s conservative base by making a pointed jab at Barr and reminding voters of Barr’s past consulting work with the liberal-leaning American Civil Liberties Union. (The group brought Barr on back in 2002 to consult on informational and data privacy issues.)  
Barr’s history with DOMA spans several decades. 
Barr -- who was the 2008 Libertarian Party presidential candidate -- actually introduced DOMA in the U.S. House of Representatives in May 1996. Barr, then a Republican, was still fresh in his congressional tenure, which stretched from 1995 to 2003. Then-President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law in September 1996. 
Years later, after leaving Washington and switching his party affiliation, Barr apologized for his role in DOMA’s passage. At the May 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Barr said to the audience: ""Standing before you, looking you in the eye, the Defense of Marriage Act -- in so far as it provided the federal government a club to club down the rights of law-abiding American citizens -- has been abused, misused and should be repealed, and I will work to repeal that."" 
In 2009, Barr called for DOMA to be repealed. In a Los Angeles Times editorial, Barr said, ""I have concluded that DOMA is neither meeting the principles of federalism it was supposed to, nor is its impact limited to federal law."" 
Two years later, in an interview posted on the national gay and lesbian news magazine website Advocate.com, Barr said DOMA had become ""the tail wagging the dog"" and that the eventual goal was to ""get the government out of the marriage business.""  
When he announced his congressional candidacy this time around, Barr told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter in March: ""The federal government has become so big, so intrusive ... we really need to start pulling that back."" 
Barr has not directly commented on the Supreme Court’s ruling to us or other media outlets. Through a spokesman, Barr said he stands by his Facebook post on the issue. ""Some believe in a top-down approach from Washington on every issue that faces this country. The conservative approach, Bob’s approach, is to let the people of the states decide these issues for themselves,"" Barr’s spokesman told us in an email message. 
So does Lindsey’s claim live happily ever after? 
Congressional candidate Ed Lindsey said former congressman and DOMA author Bob Barr has changed his position on DOMA over the years.  
Barr guided DOMA to passage as a Republican in the mid-1990s. But then Barr became a Libertarian and apologized for his role in getting the bill passed. As a Libertarian, Barr has said DOMA has been used by the government to overstep its authority.  
Now, seeking office as a Republican, Barr says he has come to understand that this is a matter for states to handle. 
Barr has refused to directly comment on the Supreme Court’s decision last week striking down a part of DOMA. But his silence doesn’t dismiss his past.

Rep. Todd Young says Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid make up 70 percent of federal budget
","
Recently, a reader sent us a letter they received from their local congressman, Indiana Republican Todd Young. The reader was surprised at one of the claims. 
It said ""nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid"" in fiscal year 2014. 
The reader wondered whether that was true, and so did we. So we turned to the most recent budgetary estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
If you add together the costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for fiscal year 2014, and then subtract the offsetting receipts for those programs, you come up with 45 percent of all federal spending. That’s far lower than ""nearly 70 percent."" 
However, if you broaden the definition to include all forms of mandatory spending (or ""entitlements"") rather than just Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the percentage gets larger. 
These additional entitlements include many different programs: food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, unemployment compensation, the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, child nutrition programs, federal civilian and military retirement payments, and veterans' benefits. 
Adding together all forms of entitlements gets the share up to 61 percent. And if you add in a separate category of mandatory spending -- net interest on the national debt -- the number rises to 68 percent. That’s very close to 70 percent. 
When we presented our research to Young’s office, a spokesman acknowledged the error. 
""You hit the nail on the head,"" said spokesman Trevor Foughty. ""The letter should have referred to all mandatory spending, including interest, with the those programs (Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid) being the most recognizable. We will make sure to update the letter with more clarity."" 
Our ruling 
Young’s letter said that ""nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid"" in fiscal year 2014, and that’s not even close -- the real share is 45 percent. 
Young’s office acknowledged that they should have clarified that they were including all types of entitlements plus net interest, rather than just those three programs. They said they would correct the statement in the future. However, our policy is to rate the original statement, and in this case, we conclude that it is False.","[('\nTodd Young, constituent letter forwarded to PolitiFact, June 19, 2013', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/723673-todd-young-letter.html'), ('\nCongressional Budget Office, ""Updated Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023,"" May 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, July 2, 2013', 'https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44172-Baseline2.pdf'), ('\nEmail interview with Trevor Foughty, spokesman for Rep.

"['Georgia', 'Occupy Wall Street', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
GOP group takes on potential candidate
","
Republicans are wasting no time defining a Georgia Democrat considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2014. 
Michelle Nunn has never run for political office, so the National Republican Senatorial Committee is eager to tell Georgians all about her. 
Case in point, a June 17 news release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
""Nunn's extreme record of praising radical liberal groups like the Occupy Movement illustrates just how dangerously out of touch she is with voters in Georgia,"" NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen wrote. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the NRSC is correct that Nunn praised the Occupy movement. 
The movement began in September 2011 when protesters camped out for months in a park near New York City’s Wall Street to voice their grievances against what they describe as ""the corrosive power of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process."" 
In Atlanta, Mayor Kasim Reed had police remove Occupy sympathizers from a city park after a three-week stay. The Occupy movement is now less demonstrative, with more strategic protests against banks and other businesses for various practices. 
So what does Hougesen have to prove she’s right about Nunn? She pointed to an op-ed that Nunn wrote in The Washington Post a few days before Christmas 2011 titled ""Millennials to business: Social responsibility isn’t optional."" It contained a few references to the Occupy movement. 
Here’s what we know about Nunn. She is the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat who is respected by many conservatives on national security issues. She is the chief executive officer of the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan volunteer organization inspired by then-President George H.W. Bush. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the foundation brought in $55 million in revenue in 2011 and mobilized 4 million volunteers worldwide for a range of causes last year. Neil Bush, son of the former president, is the board chairman. 
Being in charge of a nonpartisan volunteer organization requires skill in working with people of all political positions. As an elected official once told us ""I have friends on both sides of the issue and I always support my friends."" One recent Nunn blog post on the Points of Light website had a picture of Republican strategist Karl Rove and Democratic Party organizer Donna Brazile dancing together at a conference. 
So what did Nunn write about it in her op-ed? 
""The Occupy Wall Street movement is largely fueled by a relatively small set of young people who view the protests as a fight for their future,"" her op-ed began. ""The vast majority, however, are getting up and going to work every day — or wishing they could. These individuals are part of a less dramatic but, perhaps, equally powerful movement of Millennials shaping the future of business. As consumers, employees and entrepreneurs, Millennials are shifting the norms of corporate America’s conduct, ethical imperatives and purpose."" 
Most of the article was about millennials, people typically born between 1980 and 2000. Nunn’s only other reference to the Occupy movement was at the end of her op-ed. 
""The values behind Occupy Wall Street are manifesting themselves in the marketplace and companies that are failing to take notice should start,"" she wrote. ""These people-powered movements may not have stopped the markets in their tracks, but they are creating the demand for new forms of corporate behavior and ethical imperatives. The winning brands of the future will be ones that authentically respond."" 
Hougesen said she was convinced Nunn was praising Occupy Wall Street upon reading the op-ed. 
""When Michelle Nunn wrote that the ‘values behind Occupy Wall Street are manifesting themselves in the marketplace and companies’ and that protestors are ‘fighting for their future,’ it led us – and many progressives - to believe that she supported the movement. If over the past seventeen months Ms. Nunn has changed her view or beliefs, we would welcome her clarification,"" Hougesen said. 
  
Nunn referenced Occupy Wall Street in a January 2012 blog post reflecting on a dinner party discussion at her Atlanta home involving Martin Luther King Day. 
""We broke bread and talked about the bright spots and challenges in our community in terms of race, class and the unfulfilled dimensions of Dr. King's dream. We talked about how Dr. King's nonviolent and creative dissent continues to animate our world - from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street,"" she wrote. 
Nunn did not respond directly to our interview requests. Gordon Giffin, a former aide to her father who has been involved in discussions with the younger Nunn about her political future, contacted us via email. Giffin and a Points of Light spokeswoman said Nunn’s op-ed was aimed at talking about millennials. 
""Her writings do not endorse the actions of the ‘occupy’ movement but rather point out that there are numerous other examples of how the younger generation is seeking to make a difference that might be ignored by (the) press’’ focus on the ‘occupy’ crowd. Perhaps misrepresentation is the game of the day in DC but we have higher standards in Georgia,"" said Giffin, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada who now is a partner at the influential law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge. 
This was a tough call for us. To sum up, the NRSC claimed that Nunn praised the Occupy movement. Its argument is based on an op-ed she wrote in 2011. 
The op-ed referenced Occupy a couple of times, but Nunn supporters say the intent of the article was to talk about young people and their role in the marketplace. The bulk of the op-ed was about millennials. 
The claim has an element of truth but ignores critical factors that give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Newcomer Nunn built service career,"" May 28, 2013.', 'https://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/jun/20/michelle-nunn-runs-big-time-circles/'), ('\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""What a non-political speech tells us about Michelle Nunn,"" June 20, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\nEmails from Brook Hougesen, spokeswoman, National Republican Senatorial Committee, June 18, 2013.', 'http://www.pointsoflight.org/blog/2012/01/16/change-notes-reflections-mlk-day'), ('\nEmail from Stefanie Weiss, spokeswoman, Points of Light, June 22, 2013.', 'No link'), ('\n\xa0', 'http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-12-20/national/35286903_1_millennials-volunteer-opportunities-social-responsibility'), ('\nEmail from Gordon Giffin, June 25, 2013.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/jul/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-group-takes-potential-candidate/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Pundits', 'Bill Maher']","
Bill Maher says the immigration bill will ""make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet""
","On a recent episode of his HBO talk show, comedian Bill Maher said it was outrageous how much the Border Patrol is poised to expand due to an amendment to the Senate immigration bill. Maher was referring to an amendment sponsored by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee that would add ""19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border."" The amendment was widely seen as as a way of garnering votes from undecided Republicans. (The amendment, and eventually the bill itself, passed the Senate easily with bipartisan support, though the measure now faces an uncertain fate in the House.) If the bill is enacted as is, Maher said during a roundtable segment of his June 21, 2013, show, it is ""going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet. There'll be over 40,000 agents. It's four times more than any of the Republicans were asking for in their wildest dreams. It's like, to get Republican senators to vote for something now, you have to get to crazy."" A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The bill is ""going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI"" The amendment promises 19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. In most media accounts, this has been shorthanded to be roughly a doubling of the size of the southwest border agent ranks to 40,000. The most recent published statistics we found reported that in 2012, there were 18,516 Border Patrol agents on the southwest border. That would make the new total 37,716 once the newcomers are all sworn in and wearing uniforms. That’s not quite 40,000, but even at 37,716, it’s still enough to beat the FBI, because in 2012, the FBI had 35,629 employees. Want an even more striking comparison? Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies. The FBI has 13,766 special agents. This means that once the amendment’s plan is carried out, the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world. (And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that. It assigned an additional 2,430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions, and its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has nearly 39,000 additional employees in the U.S. and around the world.) So, however you slice it, Maher’s correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted. ""You could put one (Border Patrol) agent every 250 feet"" According to the International Water and Boundary Commission -- a bi-national body that oversees governance issues on the U.S.-Mexico border -- the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1,954 miles long. That works out to 10.32 million feet. Doing the math, you could space out 37,716 agents one every 274 feet (or, using the widely published 40,000 figure, you could put them every 258 feet). Either way, Maher’s calculation strikes us as very close to accurate. Needless to say, the Border Patrol wouldn’t deploy their personnel in this fashion. Not only do patrols work on shifts, but some agents are flying helicopters, some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder-to-shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars, searching for drugs. But Maher’s rhetorical point is well-taken: The agency literally, if it wished, could place agents every 274 feet. Our ruling Maher said that if it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is ""going to make the border patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet."" He’s right on the first claim and on target with the second. In all, we rate his statement True.","[('HBO, ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" June 21, 2013', 'https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s744es/pdf/BILLS-113s744es.pdf'), ('Text of S.744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act as passed by the Senate, accessed July 1, 2013', 'No link'), ('International Boundary and Water Commission, map of U.S.-Mexico border, accessed July 1, 2013', 'https://www.ibwc.gov/Files/US-Mx_Boundary_Map.pdf'), ('U.S. Border Patrol, ""Border Patrol Agent Staffing By Fiscal Year (Oct. 1st through Sept. 30th),"" accessed July 1, 2013', 'No link'), ('Fedscope, main federal employment statistics search page, acessed July 1, 2013', 'https://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/usbp_statistics/usbp_fy12_stats/staffing_1993_2012.ctt/staffing_1993_2012.pdf'), ('Federal Bureau of Investigation, diversity statistics, accessed July 1, 2013', 'No link'), ('Sen.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
More border security and patrols under Obama than previous presidents, says Debbie Wasserman Schultz
","
A few days before the U.S. Senate took a vote in favor of an amendment to expand border patrol and other border security measures, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz defended President Barack Obama’s record on border patrol and security. 
MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts asked Wasserman Schultz to respond to critics, including House Republicans, who say the bill as amnesty or portray immigrants as ""takers."" 
Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as chair of the Democratic National Committee, portrayed Obama as tough on enforcement. 
""President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president,"" said Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama ""has cracked down employers -- on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president."" 
PolitiFact has previously examined some similar claims about border patrol during Obama’s presidency. But here we wanted to fact-check Wasserman Schultz’s specific claims that Obama holds a record for border patrol and security. 
Border patrol 
The Border Patrol buildup began under President Bill Clinton with Operation Gatekeeper and Safeguards, but expanded dramatically under President George W. Bush, said Katherine Benton-Cohen, a Georgetown history professor. 
The number of border patrol agents increased dramatically between fiscal years 1993 and Sept. 30, 2012. (So did spending.) Nationwide, the peak year was in 2011 with 21,444 agents -- the number dropped slightly to 21,394 in fiscal year 2012. 
Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues, previously told PolitiFact that the total number of agents is a record going back to at least 1924. 
The biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000. 
Border fence 
In addition to border patrol, Wasserman Schultz also gave credit to Obama for the most ""border security deployed"" -- a more general term that we took to include fences or other technological or infrastructure improvements. 
The first fence along the southwestern border was built in 1990 but was comparatively small: Prior to 2005 there were 78 miles of pedestrian fencing and 57 miles of vehicle barriers, according to a paper by the Migration Policy Institute. 
The Secure Fence Act of 2006, passed by a Republican-led Congress and was signed by Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico and called for adding unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites, radar and cameras. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long. Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law. 
The act specified ""at least two layers of reinforced fencing,"" but in 2007 the law was altered to give the Border Patrol leeway to decide the type of fencing. By the time Obama became president in January 2009, much of the fence was completed -- but not of the type originally planned. 
In February 2011, a GAO report about the border presented a mixed picture of progress. 
The report states that between fiscal years 2005 and 2010, the number of border miles that had fences increased from about 120 to 649. A preliminary analysis of border miles under control showed 15 percent were ""controlled"" while the rest were ""managed"" and left vulnerabilities to illegal activity. 
For this fact-check, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman sent us a 2011 White House immigration report that stated ""DHS has also completed 649 miles of fencing out of nearly 652 miles planned, including 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of pedestrian fence, with the remaining 3 miles scheduled to be completed."" 
Spokesman Jonathan Beeton also pointed to the fact that Obama signed a bill in 2010 in response to increased violence in Mexico that included $600 million in supplemental funds for enhanced border protection. Separately, an additional 1,200 National Guard troops were authorized for the the border. 
Fencing isn’t the only way the federal government has attempted to manage the border. The Secure Border Initiative launched in 2005 with the intention to combine fencing with technological tools such as cameras, sensors and radar, according to a paper from the Migration Policy Institute. Boeing won a contract and received about $860 million from the federal government. 
But it quickly ran into technical difficulties, cost overruns and delays, which have been criticized in numerous Government Accountability Office reports. Under the Obama administration, the program was canceled in January 2011, and the Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano ordered that the government should focus on using proven technologies, such as video and mobile surveillance and thermal imaging. 
Under Obama, border apprehensions have fallen from their high points. Border apprehensions peaked at almost 1.7 million in 2000 under President Clinton, and apprehensions in 2011 were at the lowest level since 1970. The post-2008 declines are due to the recession and loss of jobs which had attracted unauthorized immigrants. Net illegal immigration from Mexico has fallen to zero or even fewer coming than leaving. 
Expert analysis 
We sent Wasserman Schultz’s claim to immigration experts. No one disputed the border patrol numbers, but they also pointed to other factors when examining changes in border security that provide a more complex picture. 
""Yes, the number of Border Patrol agents is at an all-time high,"" said Rey Koslowski, an expert on the border and an associate professor of political science and public policy at the University at Albany. ""Whether that equates to ‘border security’ is another question. As to who should get more credit for border security, the fence was a bipartisan project."" 
Christopher Wilson, an associate with the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute and an expert on border management, noted that border patrol agents don’t precisely equal border security. 
""In the end, though, you can’t deploy border security, it must be something that is achieved. This gets into one of the major problems with the whole border security debate—the lack of an accepted definition of the term."" 
Our ruling 
Wasserman Schultz said, ""President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president."" 
She is correct that the highest number of border patrol agents has been under Obama: there were 21,444 in 2011. Wasserman Schultz was careful here and said ""most"" and didn’t talk about the growth rate. But it’s worth noting that the big growth was during Bush’s tenure: between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000. 
Other border security measures are not as simple to quantify. The key piece of infrastructure -- the fence -- was launched under Bush. Work on the fence and other border security improvements continued under Obama.

Sen. Joe Manchin says 1999’s NRA supported expanded background checks
","Washington may have moved on to immigration and the scandal du jour, but the gun law debate still simmers in states like Sen. Joe Manchin’s West Virginia. Dueling ads from the NRA and Manchin target West Virginia voters: ""Tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment!"" and ""Call the NRA and tell them to support criminal background checks!"" Manchin’s not giving up his quest to broaden gun buyer background checks, the Associated Press reported June 26, 2013. The Democratic senator told Chris Matthews on MSNBC that he’s still making his case to the people in West Virginia to resurrect the bill that died in April. ""When they start seeing what we have done to the bill, you know what they said? And you mean the NRA in Washington is against this? We have been fighting for some of these provisions for the last decade or more. ""And I said, all we have done — and I said, guess what? In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this. I haven't changed. They changed, Chris."" Was the NRA leadership for the provisions of Manchin’s gun proposal back in ‘99? ‘Instant criminal background checks’ We’ve checked related claims from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Barack Obama that Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, once supported wider background checks. It’s true he told a House subcommittee in May 1999 that ""it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes for anyone."" But the House rejected an expansion of background checks in June 1999 — a rejection the NRA supported. A Washington Post headline at the time said, ""NRA Achieves Its Goal: Nothing."" LaPierre’s testimony before the House subcommittee hadn’t been in support of background checks legislation — it was against an amendment from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.. In his testimony, he outlined a set of proposals the NRA at the time found ""reasonable,"" such as ""instant criminal background checks."" But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the legislation defined a gun show, how the law handled inheritance of weapons, and that the instant check system didn’t destroy records of transactions immediately. The NRA ultimately backed legislation in the House that did expand background checks to sales at gun shows — but cut the time allowed for background checks to 24 hours, a change that ultimately killed the legislation. Manchin’s recent legislation, which he offered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, addressed a number of the NRA’s concerns with Lautenberg’s 1999 provisions. (We summarized Manchin-Toomey back in April.)  It didn’t apply background checks to transfers between close relatives. Its definition of a gun show increased the number of guns from 50 to 75 and excluded residences of private collectors. It ultimately would have cut the time allowed for background checks down to 24 hours. But the NRA still challenged applying background checks to transfers between distant relatives and ""lifelong friends,"" for example, echoing its opposition to 1999 proposals. Our ruling Manchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks, saying that in 1999, even ""the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this."" He’s correct that LaPierre, at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle, testified before lawmakers that the NRA supported ""mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale."" But then, as now, the group was opposed to specific legislative measures behind implementation of expanded checks. Even Manchin’s compromise measure may not have passed muster with 1999’s NRA. He’s right that the leadership expressed support for expanding background checks generally, but the details get more complicated, especially in the context of specific legislation. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('CQ Newsmaker Transcripts, ""Sen. Manchin Interviewed on MSNBC,"" June 20, 2013, subscription only', 'http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4300853'), ('Sen.

E.W. Jackson says 20 percent of black children are being raised in traditional married households
","
E.W. Jackson, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, says black families have deteriorated over the last 50 years.   
""In 1960, most black children were raised in two-parent, monogamous families."" he said. ""By now, by this time, we have only 20 percent of black children being raised in two-parent, monogamous families with a married man and woman raising those children."" 
We wondered whether the stark drop Jackson described during a June 20 speech in Newport News was accurate. He attributed the deterioration of black families to the expansion of welfare programs in the 1960s. 
Gregory Aldridge, Jackson’s campaign manager, told us the figures came from a chart by the conservative Heritage Foundation. It shows less than 20 percent of black babies in the 1950s were born to single mothers and that rose to 72.3 percent in 2008. Heritage attributed its figures to the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control. 
These figures, however, don’t quite fit Jackson’s statement. His claim focused on the percentage of black children ""raised"" in two-parent, married families. Some single mothers at birth might later marry and raise their children in two-parent homes. 
So we turned to Gretchen Livingston, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center. She said U.S. Census data shows that in 1960 about 65 percent of black children under 18 were living in households with two married parents -- well in accord with Jackson’s claim that ""most"" of the children were reared in such homes. 
U.S. Census Bureau tallies for 2012 show that of 11.2 million black children, 3.7 million were living with two married parents. That works out to 34 percent -- higher than the 20 percent Jackson claimed. 
The reason for the drop, Jackson opined, is that welfare and food stamp expansion in the 1960s ""began to tell women you don’t need a man in the home, the government will take care of you. That began to tell men you don’t need to be in the home, the government will take of this woman and take care of these children."" 
Jackson’s opinion is not universally shared. A lot of research has been done on welfare’s effect on the black family and the conclusions are mixed, according to Gregory Acs, director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center. Acs doesn’t think welfare is completely unrelated to the drop in the percentage of children living with two parents, but he said a lot of other issues are at play. 
For example, Acs said economic opportunities for women have risen over the decades and fallen for men. That has contributed to a drop in marriage rates that also explains why more children -- black and white -- are being raised by one-parent families. 
In 1960, 91 percent of white children of under 18 were living in two married parents in the household, according to a 2010 report by the Pew Research Center. By 2012 that had dropped to 70 percent of white children living with two married parents, according to U.S. Census figures. 
Our ruling 
Jackson said in 1960 most black children were raised in two-parent, married households and now only 20 percent of them live in two-parent households. 
In 1960, about two-thirds of black children were living with two parents so that part of Jackson’s statement is correct. The most recent figures show that 34 percent are living with two married parents. 
So Jackson’s latest figure is off, but that doesn’t harm his gist that there’s been a significant decline in traditional black families. 
We rate his statement Mostly True.","[('\nAmerican Bridge 21st Century, video of E.W.

"['Georgia', 'Criminal Justice', 'Jimmy Carter']","
Carter correct on death penalty claim
","
Former President Jimmy Carter, in preparation for a conference in Atlanta, recently gave an interview in which he highlighted his opposition to the death penalty. 
""The Carter Center and I personally are very deeply opposed to the death penalty,"" he told Time magazine. ""But when the United States government and its Constitution says that people can be put to death, that sets an example of extreme violence that very few other developed, industrialized nations would have."" 
With all of the debate about capital punishment in recent years, PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the former president was correct about the Constitution and the death penalty. 
Carter, a Democrat, gave the interview in advance of the Mobilizing Faith for Women conference, which was scheduled from June 27-29 at his Presidential Center in Atlanta. The conference focused on improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center’s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, was scheduled as a speaker. 
Carter cites the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution for his argument that the death penalty should be considered unconstitutional, said Deanna Congileo, a spokeswoman for Carter. There’s plenty of debate about what that amendment says about the Constitution, which we’ll visit later in this article. As for whether the U.S. government says people can be put to death, there’s a long history of federal executions. 
There have been 37 federal prisoners executed since 1927, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The most notable U.S. execution took place in June 2001, when Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing that killed 168 people, was executed by lethal injection in a federal prison in Indiana. The last federal execution was in 2003. 
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has authorized several death penalty prosecutions since he took office in 2009. In 2011, he revised some procedures on how federal prosecutors can consider death penalty cases. 
Now, does the Constitution say people can be put to death? There’s healthy legal debate among scholars and jurists concerning that argument. 
The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says no one can be held for a capital crime ""except by due process of law."" Death penalty proponents say that language confirms its legality. Capital punishment opponents contend the words ""cruel and unusual punishments inflicted"" in the Eighth Amendment is an indictment of the death penalty and its legality. 
The state of Georgia has been the genesis for many of the questions concerning whether the Constitution allows the death penalty, with two landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings, one occurring when Carter was elected president in 1976. 
In the 1972 case, Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court concluded that the arbitrary application of the death penalty and the disproportionate number of minorities that were executed made the death penalty ""unusual."" By declining to rule that capital punishment was unconstitutional in and of itself, however, the Supreme Court left the door open for state legislatures to draw more narrowly construed death penalty statutes. 
In 1976, Georgia's newly written death penalty statute was challenged before the Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia. This time, Georgia won. The Supreme Court ruled the death penalty could be used under careful conditions. 
The website ProCon.org highlights the dispute. It contains a quote from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan disagreeing with the Gregg v. Georgia ruling, saying it violated the Eighth Amendment. Brennan later expressed his moral objections to the death penalty. Next to Brennan’s quote on the website is a quote from the current chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr. In a 2008 ruling, Roberts wrote that a method of execution ""cannot be viewed as probative of the wanton infliction of pain under the Eighth Amendment."" 
To sum up, Carter claimed the federal government and the U.S. Constitution say people can be put to death. The U.S. attorney general’s office has guidelines on prosecuting such cases, and the Supreme Court has ruled capital punishment can be employed under the Constitution, although there is still much discussion about its interpretation.

Chris Christie claims there have been no tax increases since he's been governor
","
If Chris Christie is sure about one thing, it’s the lack of any tax increase in New Jersey since he’s been governor. 
So confident is the governor that he pointed out his achievement during Wednesday’s monthly ""Ask The Governor"" radio call-in program on New Jersey 101.5 FM. It’s a claim he’s made before. 
""Not one tax has been raised since I've been governor,"" Christie said during a brief portion of the show where he compared his fiscal actions as governor with those of state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging him in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest. 
Previous Truth-O-Meter rulings have determined this claim isn’t entirely accurate. And PolitiFact New Jersey remains as confident as the governor in that fact. 
Let’s begin by reviewing the major taxes in New Jersey. 
It’s true that rates for income, sales and corporation business taxes -- the state’s three biggest revenue generators -- have not gone up under Christie. 
But tax increases have resulted when Christie cut funding for tax-credit programs, according to several experts who have told us that those reductions are essentially tax increases. 
""For practical purposes, decreasing tax credits is the same as a tax increase. The person's effective tax rate goes up,"" David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University, explained in an e-mail. ""Still, most people think of tax increases as rate hikes."" 
Rates haven’t increased, but the reduced tax credits mean some homeowners and certain low-income individuals are receiving less money to offset their tax bills. 
The Earned Income Tax Credit is one example. 
New Jersey scaled back the EITC during Christie’s first year in office. The state Treasury Department website has explained that the EITC ""reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey."" 
In addition to that reduction, Christie cut spending for two property tax relief programs. 
Budget analyses from the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services showed that  homeowners who qualified for one of those programs, now called the Homestead Benefit program, received an average rebate of more than $1,000 in fiscal year 2010. Now, the average credit is less than half that amount.   
State Treasury Department officials have argued that the tax credit programs are payments from the state, and reductions in credits do not represent tax increases. 
Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, has said that the EITC in most cases actually represented a subsidy to low-income people and noted that more than 75 percent of people getting the credit in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax. 
Still, Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said that a reduction in a tax credit is ""absolutely a tax increase."" 
""Tax credits reduce tax liability for eligible claimants. Thus, cutting, restricting, or repealing a tax credit for an otherwise eligible individual or business would -- absent other changes to the tax system such as a reduction in rates -- result in higher taxes owed,"" Ventry said. 
Richard Pomp, a law professor at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said debate about the issue is semantics. ""To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend,"" whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut. 
However, Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, said it’d be wrong to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. ""They have elements of both and are strictly neither,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Christie said on a radio program, ""Not one tax has been raised since I've been governor."" 
The governor is correct that the major taxes in New Jersey that generate revenue have not increased. But he doesn’t acknowledge that cuts he’s made to tax-relief programs have resulted in tax increases for certain segments of the population. 
Several experts we talked to agreed that reductions in tax-relief programs can result in higher taxes owed for some people. That amounts to an increase, and that’s why this claim is rated Half True.

R.I. Rep. Raymond Gallison says 74 percent of Rhode Islanders want a national popular vote for president instead of the Electoral College
","
Should we change the way we pick our president? 
That was the issue June 13, 2013, when the Rhode Island House of Representatives debated a proposal that would give all four of the state's electoral votes to whomever won the popular vote nationwide in a presidential election, regardless of whether the majority of Rhode Islanders voted for that candidate. 
The change is designed to bypass the Electoral College system, which encourages candidates to devote the vast majority of their energy to swing states, where the race is close. States like Rhode Island, where the Democratic candidate typically wins, are ignored. 
The proposal would not take effect until enough states -- enough to represent a majority of all electoral votes -- agree to the plan. 
Both the House and Senate have passed comparable versions of the bill but they have to agree on at least one chamber's version before it can go to the governor. 
During the House debate, Rep. Raymond Gallison, a Democrat from Bristol, asserted that the ""National Popular Vote"" initiative has widespread support in Rhode Island. 
""Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote,"" Gallison said. 
Getting 74 percent of Rhode Islanders to agree on anything controversial would be an accomplishment. But because we had never heard of a poll -- recent or otherwise -- on the issue, we asked Gallison for his source. 
He told us he would get back to us. Meanwhile, we checked around. 
We could find only one poll where Rhode Islanders were asked about the topic. It was on the website of National Popular Vote Inc., a ""social welfare"" nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that paid for the survey. The poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Democrats tend to favor popular vote proposals. 
The question: ""There is a proposal to change the way we elect the President. The current system elects a President based on the state-by-state vote totals. The new proposal would switch to a system that elects the President according to the vote totals in all 50 states. Would you generally support or oppose switching to a system that counts the votes in all 50 states combined?"" 
As Gallison reported, 74 percent who responded supported electing the President by a purely popular vote. The margin of error was plus/minus 3.5 percent. 
But there are a few things to note. 
The poll was done five years ago. 
Nobody was interviewed for the survey. The data from 800 registered Rhode Island voters were collected by robocalls, where people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people were hanging up without answering. Jim Williams, a polling analyst with Public Policy Polling, which did the survey, said about 9 out of every 10 people called typically hang up without answering a question. 
Perhaps most important, there was no ability for residents to indicate that they were undecided or didn't care. They had two choices: ""support"" or ""oppose."" Historically, 12 to 15 percent of the population has had no opinion on the subject, according to older Gallup surveys listed on National Popular Vote's website. 
Patrick Rosenstiel, spokesman for National Popular Vote, said the survey was designed to force a choice. ""We didn't offer an 'undecided' or 'don't know' because a legislator, when the bill comes before them, can't be undecided. They've got to vote green or vote red,"" he said. 
The difference is that legislators have time to gather the facts, pro or con, before they are expected to make a choice. The poll offered no such guidance. 
When Gallison got back to us, he told us that his information came from that 2008 survey. 
We found a more recent Gallup poll on the question, conducted in October 2011. It posed the question in a way to help ensure that the wording did not affect the outcome and it allowed ""undecided"" as an option. In that survey, 62 percent supported a national popular vote and 35 percent endorsed keeping the Electoral College system. The rest were undecided. (The margin of error was plus/minus percentage points.) 
Sixty-two percent is a far cry from 74 percent. But that was a national survey, and Gallison was talking about Rhode Island. 
Rhode Islanders might feel differently because the Ocean State tends to be awash in Democrats, and Democrats favor the popular vote option. When Gallup only looked at the results for Democrats nationwide, the level of support was 71 percent. 
During his floor speech, Gallison said 74 percent of Rhode Islanders supported a popular vote because they believed in the concept of one person, one vote. 
Yet the automated survey didn't ask respondents to give a reason. 
When we asked Gallison about that, he said his statement was based on comments he had received from constituents who wanted him to vote in favor of the plan. 
Our ruling 
Rep. Raymond Gallison said, ""Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote."" 
In the first half of his statement, he was correctly quoting a single five-year-old robocall poll from a special interest group in which respondents only had two options to choose from. Those who didn't know or didn't care either had to either pick an answer -- without the ability to hear arguments pro or con -- or just hang up, as most people do with such surveys. 
Nonetheless, other surveys have shown a high level of support for a national popular vote, even if it's not quite as high as the percentage quoted by Gallison. 
The second half of his statement implied that Rhode Islanders had been polled about their reasons for supporting the proposal. But the 2008 survey -- the one Gallison relied on -- never even posed that question. We can think of a few other reasons (such as wanting to bring more campaign money into Rhode Island) why residents might want a national popular vote. 
Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

"['Oregon', 'Children', 'Public Health', 'Jason Conger']","
Are Oregon children subjected to 71 immunization shots, each? 
","
The Oregon Legislature just made it harder for parents to exempt children from vaccinations required for school. This does not sit well with people -- including some lawmakers -- who say parents know best when or if their children should receive shots to protect them from whooping cough and measles. 
Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend, voted no on Senate Bill 132. He spoke on the floor about the number of mandatory shots a child must receive in the course of his or her time in school: 71 times. 
""So there’s 17 at preschool, child care or Head Start  enrollment. There are 19 at K through 5 grade, there are 17 in 6th grade and there are 18 in high school, well, 7th grade through high school,"" he said. ""That’s not the number of immunizations, that’s the number of actual shots."" 
He went on to say: 
""Understand that the mandate is 71 times that a child’s body will be injected with a disease. It is not, clearly, something we should take lightly when balancing the parent’s opinion about what is good for the child and the fact that the mandate is for 71 injections into their child’s body.""   
Yeah, we did a double take, too, when we heard that. Three score and 11 shots? We wanted to know if this was true. 
It turns out that in citing this fantastic number Conger relied on a fact sheet, detailing which immunizations are required for the 2013-14 school year, based on the student’s grade. Unfortunately for Conger, this is the same fact sheet relied on by a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, in showing why the representative’s statement is not accurate. 
The sheet lists the immunizations needed for a child 18 months or older entering preschool, child care or Head Start. The child would need four doses for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; three doses for polio; one for chickenpox; one for measles, mumps, rubella; three doses for Hepatitis B; two doses for Hepatitis A; and three or four doses against Hib disease. We count at most 18 shots. 
Now, when the student enters kindergarten, or any grades 1 through 5, the child needs another immunization shot against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; one more shot against polio; and one more shot against the measles. We count 21 shots total. 
Because, you see, the categories of immunization shots are cumulative. It’s not that the child has to receive three shots to ward off Hepatitis B in preschool, and then again in kindergarten. 
Let’s continue. There are no new shots needed for the vaccinated child who enters grade 6. A student entering grades 7 to 12 needs to get one booster shot against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. We count 22 vaccination shots, at most. 
These vaccinations apply to children in public school and private schools, Head Start, preschools and certified child care programs. Home-schooled students are subject to immunization requirements in certain situations.  
Separately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children receive two influenza shots in the first year and a shot once a year, thereafter, wrote Susan Wickstrom, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Health Authority. There are also vaccines for pneumococcal, meningococcal conjugate, and HPV. 
""But even with annual flu shots, the total of immunization injections that a child receives before high school graduation would be less than 71,"" Wickstrom wrote to PolitiFact Oregon. 
She said it for us: Nowhere near 71 shots. The state requirements total, at most, 22 shots, including the Hib shots. 
We caught up with Conger and asked him to confirm our understanding. He did and immediately owned up to his mistake. He said he just counted up the number of shots before making his floor speech. 
""I was wrong about that,"" Conger said. ""I certainly wasn’t trying to distort the truth. But I was wrong about that."" 
Conger said his larger point remains: Government should be careful when curbing parental rights, he said. ""In my view, the debate around SB 132 was about the need for legislative restraint and deference to parents generally in decisions about the welfare of their children.""

Gene Green says student loan interest rates will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1
","
U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, recently urged colleagues to move quickly because Congress had ""only three days left until student loan interest rates double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st."" 
That statement, from a June 28, 2013, press release, matches recent declarations from other politicians; in fact, we had already started checking a version from President Barack Obama when we received Green’s release by email.   
Green’s statement further describes the loans as Stafford loans. A spokeswoman for Green, Veronica Custer, emailed us details including a June 18, 2013, report from the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic Committee (Congress’ economic advisory committee) that said, ""Unless Congress acts, the interest rate on subsidized federal Stafford loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st."" 
Half of the nation’s roughly 21 million college students get some form of federal aid, according to the government’s National Center for Education Statistics. Much of that comes in the form of federal student loans, guaranteed by the government and with low interest rates set by Congress. 
And about 80 percent of federal student loans are Stafford loans, according to a June 13, 2013, Washington Post news story. Named in memory of a U.S. senator from Vermont who championed education measures, Staffords are either subsidized, meaning the government pays part of the interest, or unsubsidized, meaning the student pays all the interest. 
Subsidized Stafford loans are available to undergraduates who show financial need; according to the Post story, they make up about a quarter of federal student loans. The unsubsidized variety doesn’t require proof of financial need and is open to graduate students as well as undergrads; about half of all federal student loans are of this type, the Post said. 
About 7 million students are expected to take out subsidized Stafford loans after June 2013 -- and they’ll get the 6.8 percent rate unless Congress acts as it did at a similar juncture in 2012. 
Tom Melecki, director of the Office of Financial Services at the University of Texas, described via email the effect of such a rate on a subsidized Stafford loan: ""If an undergraduate were to borrow the $23,000 maximum – something which is increasingly common -- he or she would repay $31,761.60 over 10 years at a 6.8 percent interest rate, but $27,163.20 at a 3.4 percent interest rate. So this student would save $4,598.40 in interest payments at the lower rate."" 
The government pays billions to keep its interest rates on federal loans low. According to the Department of Education’s student aid website, rates range from 5 percent to 7.8 percent on non-Stafford types of federal loans taken out from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013.   
Unsubsidized Stafford loans in the same timeframe have an interest rate of 6.8 percent and aren’t scheduled to change, so subsidized Staffords will match the unsubsidized kind if their rate reverts July 1, 2013.   
In a 2007 overhaul of the federal student loan system, Congress passed a temporary act reducing the rate on new subsidized Stafford loans gradually from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, set to expire July 1, 2012, according to a Sept. 8, 2007, Los Angeles Times news story and a Sept. 28, 2007, Washington Post news story. 
But lawmakers swooped in June 29, 2012, to postpone the rate hike until July 1, 2013, at an estimated cost of $6 billion. 
The revised deadline looms amid competing claims about how the issue might be resolved. 
A June 26, 2013, New York Times news story said plans had been offered by President Barack Obama as well as Republican, Democratic and bipartisan combinations of Congress members. Green’s press release said he supported a measure that would freeze the 3.4 percent interest rate for two years. 
But with time running out and no agreement on the horizon, the Times said, it appeared likely that a measure addressing the rate would have to be applied retroactively to loans taken out after July 1. 
Our ruling 
Green said ""student loan interest rates"" would double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1. 
That accurately describes one specific rate change. However, the majority of new federal student loans won’t be affected. 
We rate the statement as Mostly True.","[('\nPress release, U.S. Rep.

Pro-Democratic group says Rep. Tom Cotton voted to give lawmakers, aides taxpayer-funded health care ""for life""
","
Ahead of what’s expected to be a bruising battle for an Arkansas Senate seat, a pro-Democratic group called Patriot Majority USA is out with an ad attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a potential challenger to incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor. 
Here’s the voice-over from the ad: 
""Tom Cotton -- just elected and already seeking the national limelight. Behind the glitz, Tom Cotton forgot about us. Supporting a plan the Wall Street Journal said essentially ends Medicare, costing some seniors $6,000 more a year, while voting Congress taxpayer-funded health care for life. Congressman Cotton: Out for himself, not us."" 
As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker recently noted, the major fact-checking outlets, including PolitiFact, have been critical of the ending-Medicare claim repeated in the ad. 
But in this item, we’ll look at the ad’s second claim, which we hadn’t seen before -- that Cotton voted to provide Congress with ""taxpayer-funded health care for life."" 
PolitiFact didn’t hear back from the ad’s sponsors, but Ty Matsdorf -- a spokesman for Senate Majority PAC, a group apparently involved in the ad alongside Patriot Majority USA -- explained the group’s logic in an email to the Post’s Fact Checker. 
Matsdorf said that in March, Cotton voted for a repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law. So how does this relate to health care for life? It gets a little complicated, so bear with us. 
Before Obama’s law was approved by Congress in 2010, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed an amendment that won enough votes to be attached to the measure. The amendment required lawmakers and their aides to obtain their health care through the new insurance marketplaces that were a cornerstone of the bill. 
So, if the health care law is ever repealed, the requirement that lawmakers and aides buy their health insurance through the insurance marketplace would be repealed as well. 
In its place, lawmakers and aides would return to what they’ve already been doing for years, which is to purchase insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. This decades-old program was something of a model for the exchanges themselves: Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings; they pay a share of the premiums and their employer, the government, pays the rest, just as private-sector employers typically do for their employees. 
First off, we'll note that the vote in question was to repeal Obamacare, and that the impact on congressional health coverage amounted to only a tiny portion of the repeal effort. The ad portrays Cotton's vote as one that's greedy and self-interested for a member of Congress. But in reality, achieving the complicated legislative bank-shot suggested by the ad was not the point of the repeal vote. 
The claim also faces some important substantive problems: 
• ""Taxpayer-funded"" is technically correct, but misleading. ""Taxpayer-funded"" suggests that the employee is getting a free ride because the taxpayer is picking up the entire tab for health insurance. That’s not the case -- the worker pays a share of the premiums, roughly 25 percent, although the exact share can vary by plan. 
""Federal employees still pay a portion of premiums, co-pays, co-insurance, and can face a deductible,"" said Joshua Archambault, director of health care policy at the Pioneer Institute, a free-market think tank. 
And while it’s technically true that taxpayers are indirectly paying the government’s share, this is no special perk for federal employees. The government simply happens to be their employer, filling the same role that most private employers above a certain size do when they offer health insurance to their workers on a shared-cost basis. 
• It’s not ""health care for life."" The federal health plan doesn’t last forever: At age 65, Medicare kicks in. And before age 65, it’s no freebie gravy train. Unlike Medicare recipients, a federal health plan beneficiary ""has to elect to remain in the program -- if they stop paying, the coverage ends,"" said John Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, which promotes government service. (Federal workers on Medicare can choose to continue to purchase insurance off the federal plan as supplemental coverage, but it’s not mandatory.) 
And, of course, if the voters don’t send you back to Congress, or if you’re an aide who leaves to join a lobbying firm, your new employer will be picking up a share of your health insurance -- not the taxpayer. 
In all, Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said the ad makes ""a misleading and peculiar claim."" 
Our ruling 
The ad suggests that Cotton, in a self-interested fashion, voted to provide lawmakers and aides with free ride from the taxpayers -- a boondoggle, basically. But viewed in context, the vote wasn't about that. 
Moreover, it’s a stretch to say the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program amounts to ""taxpayer-funded health care for life."" While the government does fund a portion of federal employees’ health insurance costs, it does so in the same capacity as any private-sector employer that offers health insurance to its workers. And the coverage doesn’t last ""for life.""

Rick Perry says Wendy Davis is daughter of single mother and was a teenage mother herself
","
Near the end of a 15-minute speech to the National Right to Life Convention in Grapevine, Texas, Gov. Rick Perry suggested the Democratic state senator who stood for more than a dozen hours toward defeating proposed abortion restrictions could draw a lesson from her own life.

Perry edged toward talking about Wendy Davis, whom he did not name, by asking who ""are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can’t grow to live successful lives?""

""In fact, even the woman who filibustered the Senate other day was born into difficult circumstances,"" Perry continued. ""She was the daughter of a single mother. She was a teenaged mother herself. She eventually graduated from Harvard Law School and served in the Texas Senate. It’s just unfortunate that she hasn’t learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to recognize its full potential and that every life matters.""

A reader questioned whether the circumstances into which Davis was ""born"" included having a single mother. We also looked at if she was a teenage mother herself.

Davis, who represents a Fort Worth district, has previously referred to her teenage motherhood and to her mother being single, according to web posts and news articles in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Her Senate website says Davis ""began working after school at 14 to help support her single mother and three siblings. By 19, Wendy was a single mother herself, working two jobs to make ends meet in hopes of creating a better life for her young daughter."" The biographical entry on her campaign website has the same sentences.

Responding to our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens noted the campaign-site reference. ""What the governor said is consistent with what the senator has written in her bio,"" Havens said by email.

Davis’ Senate spokesman, Rick Svatora, said by telephone that the senator, whose June 25, 2013, filibuster drew national and international attention, was ""booked up"" and unavailable to immediately discuss this claim.

But in 2012, Davis gave sworn testimony about her life in a lawsuit brought before a panel of federal judges in Washington, D.C. ""When I was only 18 I got married,"" Davis said, according to a transcript of her Jan. 20, 2012, testimony. ""I had a baby, I got divorced by the time I was 19 years old. And I had started working, I actually started working when I was 14. I was raised by a single mother. My mother only had a 6th grade education. My parents divorced when I was 11 years old.""

Davis also testified that she was born in West Warwick, R.I., before moving to Tarrant County. She testified, too, that she graduated from Texas Christian University and then Harvard Law School, with honors.

Jerry Russell, Davis’ father and the founder of a Fort Worth theater, returned our telephone call about Perry’s claim and challenged the reference to Davis being ""born into difficult circumstances.""

Russell said it was ""totally incorrect"" to conclude that Davis was born to a single mother. Rather, he said, he and Davis’ mother were wedded in Rhode Island in 1958, some five years before Davis, the third of their four children, was born there, he said.

Russell initially told us the couple moved to Fort Worth in 1973 and separated in 1976, around when the future senator was 13. He shortly called back and said the separation probably occurred ""closer to"" a couple years earlier, as Davis testified.

""From that point on,"" Russell said, ""I wasn’t present in the"" family ""home, but I was present in Wendy’s life.""

Russell said that his ex-wife remarried two or three years after their split and then another time later. He declined to elaborate. According to online Tarrant County records, Davis’ mother, Virginia, whom we failed to reach, married Ira Cornstubble in May 1994.

Our ruling

Perry said Davis, ""born into difficult circumstances,"" was the daughter of a single mother and a teenage mother herself.

His statement, offered in the cause of a law to curb abortions, could leave the incorrect impression that Davis was born to a struggling single mother, which is not so, best we can tell. Still, the senator’s parents divorced midway through her childhood and Davis spent at least part of her adolescence in a one-parent home. Also, Perry is correct that Davis was a teenage mother herself.

This partially accurate claim distorts important details. We rate it as Half True.","[('\nBiographical web pages, Sen.
