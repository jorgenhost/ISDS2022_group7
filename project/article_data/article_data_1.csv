Image of Ukrainian president in military fatigues is not recent
","As Ukrainian President Zelensky has refused to leave his country during the Russian invasion, social media posts claim an image shows him fighting alongside the military. A Feb. 27 video on Facebook shows a photo of Zelensky wearing military fatigues with a text overlay that says, ""Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president who has joint (sic) the front lines with his troops."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the photo included in the post of him wearing fatigues is from 2021, when he visited Ukrainian forces near the frontline with Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass region. Since Russia began to advance into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Zelensky, 45, has stayed in Ukraine, frequently posting videos of himself on the streets of Kyiv while urging Ukrainians to resist the invasion. In a March 2 column that ran in the New York Times, one of his top aides described the experience of taking shelter with Zelensky in a Kyiv bunker. And on March 3, Zelensky wore a military T-shirt as he hosted his first press conference since the invasion began, according to journalists who covered it. Fact-checkers, meanwhile, have debunked claims that viral images of Zelensky in uniform are current, noting that they are from 2021. The image used in this Facebook post was published by Reuters in April 2021. The Reuters caption said Zelensky was visiting ""positions of armed forces near the frontline with Russian-backed separatists in Donbass region, Ukraine April 9, 2021."" It is credited as a handout photo from the Ukrainian Presidential Press Service. The 22-second video includes more claims about what it describes as Ukraine’s ""greatest soldiers"" so far:  ""Vitaly Skakun blew himself up with a bridge to stop the Russian advance. The 13 soldiers who were killed on Snake Island after telling a Russian warship to ‘go f--- yourself.’ The ghost of Kyiv, he shot down six Russian fighter jets in under 24 hours making him the only ace pilot of the war."" The account of Skakun appears to be largely accurate; media reports indicate he died while detonating a bridge to slow the Russian invasion. The stories alternately give his name as Vitaly Skakun Volodymyrovych and Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun.  Thirteen soldiers on Snake Island in the Black Sea were initially believed to have died after a Russian warship attack. But they were later confirmed by both Russia and Ukraine to be alive and in Russian custody. Russia claims that the soldiers surrendered, while Ukraine maintains that they were taken captive.  Finally, it is unclear if the so-called ""Ghost of Kyiv"" pilot actually exists. Aviation experts have said it is doubtful a single fighter pilot could down six planes in a day, PolitiFact reported.  A Facebook video says an image of Zelensky in military fatigues shows him on the frontline with his troops. Zelensky has filmed himself numerous times and said he is defending the capital of Kyiv from advancing Russian troops. But this photo is from 2021. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CF68C0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/04/facebook-posts/ukrainian-president-not-frontline-military/

Fact-checking whether Biden’s Russia sanctions over Ukraine didn’t start for 30 days, had loopholes
","In ads for their 2022 campaigns, some Republicans are attacking President Joe Biden’s sanctions on Russia as too slow and too weak. One ad is in the race for an open Senate seat in Ohio, which could help determine which party controls the Senate. ""Biden's sanctions are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days,"" investment banker Mike Gibbons said in his ad on Facebook and Instagram. ""They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors."" The claim is a mixed bag: Some of the sanctions took immediate effect, some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly. Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, but the United States began imposing sanctions two days earlier, in response to Russia’s deployment of troops into two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine.  The Feb. 22 sanctions focused on two major Russian state-owned financial institutions, imposed restrictions on Russian sovereign debt and sanctioned five ""Kremlin-connected elites,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Feb. 24 sanctions, according to a Treasury Department news release, targeted ""all of Russia’s largest financial institutions and the ability of state-owned and private entities to raise capital — and further bars Russia from the global financial system."" Gibbons’ ad cited that news release. In all, between Feb. 22 and March 3, the U.S. imposed 148 sanctions on Russia, according to a running list produced by CORRECTIV, a nonprofit investigative newsroom in Germany. In announcing the Feb. 24 sanctions, Biden said some effects were immediate, but he also alluded to 30 days in terms of assessing their effects. ""We’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank — a bank that holds more than one-third of Russia’s banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system,"" Biden said. He added: ""The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two-thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions.  Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.""  Navin Bapat, a professor of peace and war in political science at the University of North Carolina, said the Feb. 24 sanctions provided for a period of 30 days to allow U.S. financial institutions to wind down their transactions.  But the Feb. 22 sanctions took effect more quickly. They prohibited U.S. institutions from participating in purchasing rubles or any other assets from Russian financial institutions after March 1, Bapat said.  Gibbons’ campaign cited clauses in the sanctions that allow exceptions for certain financial transactions, including some related to the energy industry. The Biden administration, facing the possibility that energy sanctions could lead to higher gas prices in the United States and energy prices abroad, has acknowledged that the energy sector was not a major target. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security advisor and deputy director of the National Economic Council, said at a news conference on the Feb. 24 sanctions:  ""To be clear: Our sanctions are not designed to cause any disruption to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world.  We’ve carved out energy payments on a time-bound basis to allow for an orderly transition of these flows away from sanctioned institutions, and we’ve provided other licenses to provide for an orderly winddown of business."" Republican and Democratic lawmakers have moved to stop the U.S. from importing oil from Russia. Alan Cole, a former economist with Congress’ Joint Economic Committee and former adviser to U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an article cited by Gibbons’ campaign that while the sanctions are ""an impressive effort overall, the sanctions also have a glaring weakness: They largely spare Russia’s all-important energy sector, the backbone of its entire economy, and its agricultural center — the country is a major wheat exporter."" Russia expert Harley Balzer, an emeritus professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that Biden ""is endeavoring to balance punishing Russia and preventing serious damage in Europe from rising energy prices and threatened supplies."" ""The financial sanctions are causing havoc on the Russian stock market, causing the market cap of major Russian firms to drop more than 90% on foreign exchanges and clobbering the ruble,"" he added.  ""Freezing the Russian Central Bank assets abroad reduced their reserves from $600 billion to $300 billion. They are spending $5 billion to $10 billion per day to keep the ruble from depreciating even more. Cronies' assets are being confiscated at an increasing pace. All of that has far more immediate impact than the oil and gas sanctions."" Other Republicans have run ads similar to Gibbons’.  Rep. Ted Budd, who is running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, and Georgia U.S. House candidate Alan Sims both said the sanctions were ""too little, too late""; Jeffrey Sossa-Paquette, who is running for a U.S. House in Massachusetts, said the sanctions ""leave out gas and oil.""  The Ohio Senate seat Gibbons wants is open because the incumbent, Republican Rob Portman, is not seeking reelection. Both the GOP and the Democratic Senate primaries, to be held May 3, are contested. Besides Gibbons, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan; former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel; former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken; and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance. The leading Democratic candidate is U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan.  Overall, the Ohio race is rated variously by campaign watchers as ""lean Republican,"" as ""likely Republican"" and ""solid Republican.""  Gibbons said Biden's sanctions on Russia ""are riddled with loopholes and don't even start for 30 days. They have carve outs for the energy and financial sectors."" Some of the sanctions made a quick impact and some were phased in over 30 days. The energy sector was largely spared, but banks were targeted directly.

Misleading post links unemployment benefits and reduced tax refunds
","Does receiving unemployment benefits mean the IRS could take away your tax refund?  A post on Facebook suggests that.  The post contains a screenshot from the IRS’s app, IRS2Go, informing the user that ""Your refund amount has been reduced by $13,424.40 to pay a past due obligation such as child support, another federal agency debt, or state income tax.""  The Facebook user wrote: ""The IRS IS NOT PLAYING ABOUT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT YALL TOOK   I WISH y’all LUCK."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We asked some tax experts whether receiving unemployment benefits could lead to a reduced tax refund. They told us that if the unemployment benefits were properly claimed, a taxpayer would not have to pay them back, but would be liable for income taxes on the amount they received. Any tax refund can be reduced because a filer owes a debt to the federal or state government or has unpaid child support, said Erica York, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit organization that analyzes tax policy. A refund occurs when a taxpayer has overpaid their taxes during the year or is eligible to receive refundable tax credits that exceed the amount of their tax liability, York said. Through the Treasury Offset Program, the Bureau of Fiscal Service can reduce a tax refund to recover delinquent federal nontax debt, unpaid child support, or state debt, whether from taxes or another obligation. A state debt could include fraudulently claimed unemployment compensation, which would have to be repaid.  In 2020, some states gave more money to unemployment recipients than they were eligible for, and demanded that the money be paid back, even if the recipients were not responsible for the error or knew they were being overpaid, according to the New York Times.   If the unemployment benefits were properly claimed, a taxpayer would not have to pay them back, but would be liable for income taxes on the amount they received, she said. Unemployment recipients can choose to have federal income tax withheld, at a rate of 10%, or they can make quarterly estimated payments.  If someone properly claimed unemployment benefits, and overpaid the taxes on them, the resulting refund could be reduced to satisfy unpaid government debt or unpaid child support, she said.  Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, described the IRS as the ""middle man,"" and said that the Treasury Department’s Treasury Offset Program collects debt through reduced tax refunds.   The IRS stopped collecting income taxes on most unemployment benefits collected in 2020, but started collecting them again in the 2021 tax year.  Every tax situation is different, and refunds depend on each individual’s taxes paid, eligibility for tax credits and deductions, and a person’s particular outstanding debts to the government or unpaid child support. There is no universal tax penalty for receiving unemployment benefits.  A Facebook post suggested that a tax refund could be reduced because someone received unemployment benefits.  It appears that in the case of this Facebook post, based on the screenshot from the IRS app and the poster’s own words, someone who received unemployment benefits then had their income tax refund reduced because of an unpaid debt.  But the government does not require unemployment benefits that have been properly claimed to be paid back, and it does not reduce the amount of a tax filer’s refund if that filer does not have unpaid government debts or child support.  We rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280974FC300>],/factchecks/2022/mar/03/facebook-posts/misleading-post-links-unemployment-benefits-and-re/

Biden exaggerates trips to Iraq, Afghanistan in State of the Union address
","In his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden focused on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation and the coronavirus pandemic. At one point he turned to the U.S. military, and started to speak about toxic burn pits at bases in Iraq and Afghanistan that may have caused serious illnesses among troops — possibly including his late son Beau Biden, who served in the military and died from brain cancer in 2015. But as he spoke, he made a questionable claim about the number of times he had visited the two countries. ""Our troops in Iraq have faced — and Afghanistan — have faced many dangers. One being stationed at bases, breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits,"" Biden said during the March 1 joint session of Congress. ""Many of you have been there. I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste — the wastes of war, medical and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more."" PolitiFact readers reached out and inquired whether the statement was accurate. It’s not, and it was not included in his prepared remarks. Biden has traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq many times, including to visit his son who was serving in Iraq. But his statement nearly doubled the number of trips. And it’s not the first time Biden has embellished the number of times he’s traveled to the two countries.  In 2019, while on the campaign trail, Biden told a dramatic — but false — story about a general asking him to travel to Afghanistan to recognize the heroism of a Navy captain. At one point while relaying the tale, Biden said he had been to Iraq and Afghanistan ""over 30 times."" But his campaign later clarified, and told the Washington Post that the correct number was actually 21. Some of these trips occurred when Biden was serving as a U.S. senator from 1973 to 2009. There have been no news reports or press releases about Biden visiting either country for the remainder of 2019 or any time in 2020. PolitiFact reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back. Just after Biden made this statement, he was interrupted by Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who yelled out a reference to 13 service members who died while the U.S. was evacuating Afghanistan. Boebert was shushed by her colleagues.  As president, Biden visited Europe in a trip that included meetings with NATO leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He traveled to Italy and the United Kingdom in the fall of 2021 for the G20 Leaders’ Summit and the U.N.’s convention on climate change.  According to searches of Nexis news archives, the last time Biden visited Iraq was in 2016 to try to quell a political rebellion that threatened to undercut the Obama administration's counterterrorism efforts. It was his first visit to the country in five years.  The last time we found that he traveled to Afghanistan was in 2011 for meetings meant to gauge the progress toward a drawdown of U.S. forces. Biden said he has visited Iraq and Afghanistan ""over 40 times."" This isn’t accurate. There is no evidence that Biden has been to either country since being president. The last time he was in Iraq appears to be in 2016. For Afghanistan, it was in 2011.  The latest estimate of his travels to the two countries come from his presidential campaign, which said in 2019 that he had visited both a combined 21 times.  Biden’s statement is off by about half. We rate it False.  PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D75B40>],/factchecks/2022/mar/03/joe-biden/biden-exaggerates-trips-iraq-afghanistan-state-uni/

CNN clip on Russia’s ‘military moves in America’s backyard’ ran in 2018, not during Ukraine invasion
","Social media users have resurfaced a years-old CNN clip about Russia’s encroachment on the United States as though it reflected a new development in the Ukraine invasion.

FEMA added COVID-19 safety measures to nuclear explosion protocols before Russia invaded Ukraine
","On Feb. 27, as Russian forces continued a wide-ranging assault on Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. That development renewed concerns that Russia might turn its nuclear arsenal on the United States. On Feb. 28, President Joe Biden said that Americans shouldn’t be concerned about nuclear warfare, but his reassurances didn’t stop some from looking up the government’s recommendations for surviving a nuclear attack. Some people turned up something unexpected: a recommendation to wear a mask even in nuclear fallout. ""You can’t make this stuff up…"" said one March 1 Facebook post from Lance Wallnau, a podcast host. His post included an image that read: ""NEW: Biden Admin. instructs Americans to social distance and wear masks in the event of a Nuclear Fallout.""  The words were followed by a partially truncated website URL and screenshots that explained what to do after a nuclear explosion.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Donald Trump Jr. and politics and sports commentator Clay Travis shared it, too.  ""Our government wants us to make sure we socially distance in the event of nuclear war because obviously you’re worried about dying of Covid and not nuclear fallout. These are not serious people they are imbeciles,"" Trump wrote. The screenshots of Federal Emergency Management Agency guidelines are real. But they were not updated recently amid Putin’s threats of nuclear war.  FEMA says the changes happened during the Trump administration, in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the website URL in the post was cut short, it appeared to point to ready.gov/nuclear-explosion, a page run by FEMA that provides instructions on ways to minimize radiation exposure following a nuclear explosion. Ready.gov was designed to educate Americans on preparation and response for various emergencies — both natural and man-made. And yes, the guidelines on the ""Nuclear Explosion"" page include recommendations to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19.  The ""Get inside"" section of the guidelines, for example, instructs people to go to the basement or the middle of a building, avoiding the outer walls or roof. It adds: ""Try to maintain a distance of at least six feet between yourself and people who are not part of your household. If possible, wear a mask if you’re sheltering with people who are not a part of your household."" But Jaclyn Rothenberg, a FEMA spokesperson, said the pandemic safety language was added before Russia’s use of force in Ukraine. ""COVID protocols were originally added in 2020,"" Rothenberg said. She said some pages are now being updated to reflect the CDC’s latest guidelines, which recommend wearing a mask indoors only in counties where the community-level risk of COVID-19 is considered high. The ""Nuclear Explosion"" page was last updated on Feb. 25, 2022, to remove a broken link, Rothenberg said.  ""No new language was added to or taken off of that particular page,"" she said. Links were updated throughout the Ready.gov site. Using previously archived versions of the site, PolitiFact confirmed that the site’s guidelines have incorporated COVID-19 protocols since at least November 2020, even before Biden’s inauguration. Guidance incorporating COVID-19 safety measures appeared on the site throughout 2021 and remained there as of March 1. Social media posts said in a ""new"" update, the Biden administration instructed Americans to ""social distance and wear masks in the event of a Nuclear Fallout.""

Border encounters up partially due to COVID-19 expulsions
","U.S. immigrations officials are reporting an increase in immigration encounters across the country’s southern border with Mexico, leading Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to say the Biden Administration needs to enforce immigration laws.  Grassley tweeted on Feb. 5: ""The Biden Border Crisis is still here During the first 3 months of FY2022 Customs& Border Protection recorded 518k encounters w illegal immigrants at S border That’s up 137% from same point in FY2021. Biden Admin ought 2get serious about enforcing our immigration laws"" During a press call with The Daily Iowan and other Iowa reporters on Feb. 9, Grassley said he wants to vote on a bill that allocates funds for finishing the border wall, something the Democrat-majority Senate has no plans of introducing. ""We have already, over a period of decades, passed plenty of laws, saying it’s illegal to come into this country without our permission,"" Grassley said.  Grassley said it’s up to the executive branch to enforce immigration laws and that, while not solely Biden’s fault, the increase in encounters was the highest of Biden’s 13-month-old administration.  Grassley’s numbers were correct, and they have continued to grow since he made the tweet. Through January, there have been 672,838 encounters. The number was 296,450 during those four months the previous fiscal year and the increase from then dropped, statistically, to 127% for the first four months. Federal fiscal years start Oct. 1, so the previous fiscal year’s numbers include three-and-a-half months of the Trump Administration. But a Feb. 18, 2022, Customs and Border Patrol update on the January 2022 numbers said the total number of encounters overstates the number of unique individuals trying to cross the border.  A large number of expulsions during the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to a higher number of migrants making multiple border crossing attempts, the update stated. For example, the report stated, one of every four of the 153,941 encounters in January was with someone repeating an attempt to migrate into the United States. The five-year repeat average was one of every seven from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2019, the report said. According to the Department of Homeland Security, expulsions have increased at the border because Customs and Border Protection started requiring non-U.S. citizens looking to enter the country to show proof of vaccination. The restriction applied to people with essential and non-essential reasons.  Customs and Border Protection defines an encounter as anyone who is apprehended or expelled under the agency’s Title 8 or Title 42 provisions. Title 8 apprehensions refer to people who seek legal entry, due to refugee status or other personal reasons, but cannot be considered admissible by lack of proper paperwork or a breach in quota. Title 42 expulsions refer to individuals who try to enter the U.S. illegally and are expelled to the country of their last transit or their home country.  We won’t know the official deportation numbers for fiscal 2022 for a while because the most recently available numbers are from 2020.  According to Pew Research Center, the number of border crossings in fiscal 2021 was the highest in 21 years. Pew reported that the more-than 200,000 crossings in July 2021 was the highest monthly total in two decades. This increase came after COVID-19 forced the southern borders to close and slow immigration down.  The previous monthly record was 220,063 in March 2000. The 2000 fiscal year total for encounters was 1,643,679.  Biden issued an executive order on Jan. 20, 2021, that overturned former president Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Grassley said his order meant that Biden was offering an open border policy. The executive order says differently.  When he issued his executive order, Biden said immigrants strengthen America’s communities and economy. Enforcing immigration policy, the executive order said, is complex and requires setting priorities to best serve the national interest.  ""The policy of my Administration is to protect national and border security, address the humanitarian challenges at the southern border, and ensure public health and safety.  We must also adhere to due process of law as we safeguard the dignity and well-being of all families and communities,"" the executive order said.  The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 restructured American immigration policy. With this law, each of the subsequent 13 presidents, from Eisenhower to Biden, has enacted executive action for immigration policy.  Immigration numbers skyrocketed in 1970, during the Nixon Administration, after quota numbers were increased through the Immigration and Nationality Act. Encounters rose from 9.6 million to 14 million in 10 years. The previous decade saw a decrease of about 100,000.  Grassley called the Biden Administration out for not being strict enough on immigration policy. He based his criticism on encounters that have risen 137% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022.  Grassley did not mention how multiple repeated attempts by individuals blamed on COVID restrictions have caused a rise in numbers. This provides context.  But, Customs and Border Protection numbers line up with what Grassley said.

Russia’s Pants on Fire claim that it is not occupying Ukrainian territory
","As Russian troops were pushing deeper into Ukraine, the Russian Embassy in Canada sent a tweet depicting a situation starkly at odds with what was being reported on the ground. ""Russia continues its special military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine. The Russian army does not occupy Ukrainian territory and takes all measures to preserve the lives and safety of civilians,"" the March 1 statement posted on the embassy’s verified Twitter account said. Raging against ""an unprecedented wave of lies, fake news, distorted and fabricated facts,"" the embassy asserted that ""the Russian Army is fighting neither Ukraine nor the Ukrainians. ... Russia is not starting wars. It is ending them.""  ❗Embassy statement pic.twitter.com/cHlAJ1JaA4 This message echoes a point publicly asserted by Putin on the eve of the invasion. Putin said his government’s plans ""do not include an occupation.""  This is undercut by a wealth of evidence, starting with independent reporting. (The Russian Embassy in Canada did not respond to an inquiry.) For instance, a map produced by Reuters to track the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine showed broad swaths of Ukrainian territory held by Russia as of March 1. It included two separate corridors heading from Belarus and Russia towards the capital, Kyiv. It also included corridors heading for Russia towards Kharkiv and north from Crimea, a region of Ukraine that Russia had already occupied before the current incursions. In several cases, not only media reports but several public statements by Russia’s own government conflict with the notion that Russia is not occupying Ukrainian territory. One of the earliest locations to fall to Russian troops was Chernobyl, the site of the major nuclear disaster in the 1980s:  ""On February 24, Russia’s paratroops put under control the territory around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said, according to TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency. ""An agreement was achieved with Ukraine’s separate battalion guarding the country’s (nuclear plant) to jointly ensure the safety of nuclear reactors and the nuclear shelter."" Two days later, Russian officials claimed that troops controlled the southwestern city of Melitopol. ""In the evening of February 26, after an amphibious landing near the populated locality of Azovskoye (Ukraine), Russian units were on the march, and entered Melitopol, meeting no resistance,"" the defense ministry said, according to TASS. ""Melitopol residents welcomed the Russian troops who were moving around the city. Some elderly citizens took to the streets (waving) red flags."" (Western news reports cast doubt on the residents’ welcome of troops, as did government officials in the United Kingdom.) And just hours after the tweet was sent, Russian officials announced that troops had secured the southern city of Kherson. ""The Russian divisions of the armed forces have taken the regional center of Kherson under full control,"" Konashenkov said in televised remarks.  Military experts said that they can’t envision how what is occurring on the ground in Ukraine qualifies as anything other than an occupation. ""They are certainly holding territory, and seeking to expand their area of control,"" said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org. Pike pointed to the 1907 agreement known as the Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, which Russia signed shortly after its establishment. According to this agreement, ""territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army."" The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, established in 1949, further outlines various responsibilities of occupying powers and rights of people located in occupied territory. And the International Committee of the Red Cross, who are widely considered to be a key voice on international humanitarian law, ""occupation basically equals ‘effective control,’"" said Tanisha M. Fazal, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, said that a series of actions by Russia since 1991 lay a clear predicate for considering Russia’s military actions to be an occupation. ""Russia recognized Ukraine’s independence and borders in 1991,"" Janda said. ""More than 90% of Ukrainians voted for independence. Ukraine retained approximately 1,700 nuclear warheads under Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) control and agreed to give them up in 1994 based on the Budapest Memorandum, which was signed by the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom."" Collectively, he said, this means that Russia ""recognized Ukraine as an independent state that it would negotiate agreements and treaties with. The whole world has seen Ukraine as independent, and that means their territory is theirs."" The Russian Embassy in Canada said, ""The Russian army does not occupy Ukrainian territory."" Not only does independent reporting find this notion to be wrong, the assertion is undermined by multiple statements by Russia’s own government, relating Russian control of Chernobyl, Melitopol and Kherson. Russia currently controls areas that had been internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory since 1991, which would meet the definition of occupation under international law.

NC lawmaker misleads about Union County COVID cases, criticism
","A North Carolina legislator dismissed the need for mask mandates in schools, citing his home county’s recent COVID-19 hospitalization counts as evidence they’ve been doing just fine without them. North Carolina has no statewide mask mandate for students. However, until recently, state health officials recommended that students wear masks and many school districts required them. COVID-19 infections have declined since late January, prompting Republican lawmakers to push a bill that would block school mask mandates altogether. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper later vetoed it. During a Feb. 17 debate on the state House floor, Rep. David Willis (R-Union County) rose with a microphone to praise his local school leaders for their move to make masks optional. ""As of today in Union County—after being threatened that we were killing kids and killing teachers and killing staff and running people off—there are exactly zero students, staff, members, teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, yard workers, maintenance people, delivery people, anyone in Union County in the hospital related to our school system with COVID,"" Willis said. This made us wonder: Who has criticized Union County school policies, and was Willis right about the Union school district’s hospitalization numbers? On the day Willis spoke, his comments accurately reflected the number of Union school district employees and students hospitalized with COVID-19. However, it’s misleading for Willis to suggest that there are no hospitalizations among people ""related to"" the Union County Public School system, since the term is so vague that it isn’t quantifiable. His comments also gloss over the reasons why the Union County school system has faced criticism. PolitiFact NC reached out to Union County Public Schools on Feb. 17, shortly after Willis spoke on the state House floor. We spoke by phone with Tahira Stalberte, assistant superintendent of communications. The Union County Public School system has about 5,000 employees and 40,500 students, Stalberte said. On that day, she said, 95 students and 15 staff members were isolating after testing positive for COVID-19, she said. None were hospitalized, she said. For the entire week, Stalberte said the school system had a total of 127 cases: 112 students and 15 staff members.  It wasn’t clear what Willis meant when he referred to hospitalizations. So we emailed his office twice to ask what he was referring to when he said no one ""related to"" the school system was hospitalized, but he didn’t respond.  But it’s unclear whether anyone in that category was among the 74 people hospitalized. Stalberte said Union County Public Schools only tracks the COVID status of its students and employees. It doesn’t track COVID-19 infections among employees of the school system’s partners or contractors. Willis mentioned that Union County had been accused of ""killing kids and killing teachers and killing staff and running people off."" We don’t know if Willis was referencing a specific critic or if he was speaking generally about scrutiny the county has faced. Stalberte said she was ""unable to confirm this information."" Union County’s school board was singled out by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services in September for dropping many of its COVID-19 restrictions during a wave of infections. Union County Public Schools was one of only five North Carolina public school districts to start the 2021-22 year without a mask mandate, according to the North Carolina Association of Educators and WCNC-TV. And on Sept. 13, the board voted to end quarantine requirements for asymptomatic or nonpositive students and staff while also halting the district’s contact tracing efforts. On Sept. 16, North Carolina’s health department sent a letter to board members. It emphasized that student and staff quarantines were required by law—not merely a recommendation—and pointed out that the board’s action came at a time when the number of COVID cases in Union County were disproportionally high: ""Children under 18 are being hit particularly hard and now have the highest rate of cases in the state for the first time in the pandemic. Children in Union County are among the most impacted. Union County had the third-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the state for children under 18 for the week ending Sept. 11. This rate is substantially higher than counties of similar size and population, including Cumberland, Cabarrus and Durham."" The health department is led by a secretary who was picked by Cooper, a Democrat. But the department wasn’t alone in its agitation with the Republican-majority school board. After the district leaders’ quarantine decision, the all-Republican Union County commissioners expressed their lack of confidence in the school board through a 3-2 vote. The Charlotte Observer and WCNC reported on the conflict. A few days later, the school board reimplemented its quarantine policies in accordance with state law. Union County, the eighth-largest in a state with 100 counties, has the eighth largest number of cases and the 11th most deaths in the state. It has the 49th most cases per 100,000 residents, according to WRAL-TV. Sandeep Patel, a physician who has a child in Union County schools, is a member of the SOS Union County group of parents who have called for stronger COVID policies. In an email, Patel told PolitiFact NC that the district’s pandemic strategies shouldn’t be judged by hospitalizations on a single day. ""People really need to look at what their response was in the worst of times,"" Patel said. ""Despite the times of extreme surge in cases, this board of education failed to implement even temporary measures to do their small part in helping to reduce community transmission."" Willis said that, despite criticism of the Union County school board, none of its employees and no one ""related to"" the school system was hospitalized with COVID-19. The school system told PolitiFact that no employees were hospitalized with COVID on the day Willis spoke. But its spokeswoman said the district doesn’t track the health status of people who work with schools but aren’t school system employees.  It’s also misleading for Willis to suggest that the school district’s lack of hospitalizations on a particular day demonstrates that criticism of the school leaders is unwarranted.  Willis’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E1580>],/factchecks/2022/mar/02/david-willis/nc-lawmaker-misleads-about-union-county-covid-case/

These photos of Molotov cocktails are from 2014 protests in Kyiv, not 2022
","Social media users continue to share videos and images of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine for audiences around the world. But not all of the photos show the current invasion. ""Ukrainian citizens d€str0y 2 Russian tanks with molotov cocktails (Petrol, Gasoline) in Kiev,"" read one Feb. 26 Facebook post that included four flame-filled photos. ""They are using the guerrilla war tactics to counter Russian army in their capital.""  The Facebook user also shared the hashtag ""#RussiaUkraineWar,"" again claiming that the photos depicted the ongoing Russian invasion. The photos feature visually dramatic scenes filled with fire, billowing smoke and silhouettes of people engaged in a fight. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Reports show that some Ukrainians have been making Molotov cocktails to use against the Russian forces threatening major cities. On Feb. 25, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry instructed residents in Kyiv to make Molotov cocktails, which are improvised incendiary devices often made with glass bottles, flammable liquid and some type of cloth fuse that can be set on fire.  Using reverse image searches on Google, Bing and Yandex, PolitiFact found that each of the Facebook photos were taken during protests in Kyiv in January 2014. At the time, there were mass protests in Ukraine, fueled by opposition to then-President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to turn away from a free trade agreement with Europe and instead pursue closer cooperation with Russia. In late January 2014, the once-peaceful protests against Yanukovych’s government erupted into fiery battles in the streets, as ""thousands of demonstrators hurled rocks and firebombs to set police vehicles ablaze,"" according to the Associated Press. The photos shared in the Facebook post were taken during those battles with police.  The photo of a man pointing at the sky against a backdrop of flames and smoke was taken on Jan. 22, 2014, according to the European Pressphoto Agency. ""A protester gesticulates during clashes with riot police at an anti-government protest in downtown Kiev, Ukraine,"" the caption said.  A reverse image search for two people who appeared to be throwing something into the flames traced the photo back to an Irish Times article from 2014.  From there, we found the original photo on Getty Images.  ""Ukrainian anti-government protesters throw Molotov cocktails during clashes with riot police in central Kiev early on Jan. 25, 2014,"" said the corresponding caption. ""Protesters and Ukrainian police were locked in a tense standoff in Kiev after a night of sporadic clashes that erupted despite a truce and offer of concessions by President Viktor Yanukovych."" The third photo featured in the post, which features a person throwing something in the direction of burning tires, also traced back to Getty Images.  ""An anti-government protester throws a Molotov cocktail during clashes with police on Hrushevskoho Street near Dynamo stadium on Jan. 25, 2014 in Kiev, Ukraine,"" read the caption. ""After two months of primarily peaceful anti-government protests in the city center, new laws meant to end the protest movement have sparked violent clashes in recent days.""  The final photo of a person preparing to fire a slingshot first appeared in Russian journalist Ilya Varlamov’s LiveJournal blog post, in which he wrote about his experience during the 2014 protests. Varlamov did not share specific details about the photo, but he noted that the photos shared were all taken in Kyiv on Jan. 22 or 23, 2014.  Facebook users have also shared videos of the 2014 unrest and falsely claimed they show Ukrainians destroying a Russian tank during the current conflict. A Facebook post claimed four fiery photos showed Ukrainian citizens destroying two Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails in Kyiv.  The photos actually date back to 2014 anti-government protests in Ukraine.  Claims that the photos depict the current fighting are False.

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s State of the Union claim on scale of job gains in 2021
","In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden touted the strength of the nation’s job growth in 2021. ""Our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America,"" Biden said. He has a point, but it’s important to put these gains into context.  The United States did finish 2021 with some 6.6 million more jobs than it started with the previous January. This far exceeded the previous one-year record of 4.2 million additional jobs in 1979.   However, as the nation’s population has grown, so has the number of jobs. Using the annual percentage increase is a better way to make comparisons across the 80-plus years for which data is available. Using that metric, 2021 put up strong numbers but did not set an all-time record. The number of jobs in 2021 increased by about 4.4%, which was the highest percentage since 1979. Still, going back to 1940, the percentage increase seen in 2021 was exceeded 10 times.   It’s also important to provide some additional context. Comparison to the pre-pandemic level. The U.S. economy is still about 2.88 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak — 149.6 million jobs in September 2021, compared with 152.5 million jobs in February 2020. The question of timing. Biden entered office during a recession (and a global pandemic), but while the economy was on the upswing. Since different presidents have been sworn in at different points in the economic cycle, Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. Who gets the credit? Experts always caution that a president is not all-powerful in economic matters, since many factors beyond their control, from international oil supplies to changes in technology and demographics, can shape the health of the U.S. economy. Biden said, ""Our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America."" He accurately cited the raw number of jobs created and the fact that it was bigger than any previous year for which data is available. However, looking at the percentage increase — a fairer way to compare 80-plus years of data — 2021 did not set a record. Going back to 1940, the percentage increase seen in 2021 was exceeded 10 times. Also, since different presidents have been sworn in at different points in the economic cycle, Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples.

Jeff Shipley says teachers should not get raises if pushing topics the Legislature banned in law
","Education has been a hot topic in the Iowa Legislature, where Republicans in charge have introduced several reforms to the way K-12 children are taught in the state’s public schools. In the House, Democrats posted on their Twitter account on Feb. 10 that Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, wants to withhold raises from public school teachers who teach topics the Legislature has prohibited.  House Democrats wrote: ""School Funding Debate Update: According to Republican Rep. Jeff Shipley, teachers should not receive a pay raise if they teach American history that Republicans don’t agree with.#ShipleysGonnaShipley"" The Democratic caucus was responding to a comment Shipley made during a Feb. 10 debate on the state’s education budget. ""If Critical Race Theory is important to a teacher, they just don’t get a pay raise for that year,"" Shipley said in that debate. The House voted 94 to 1 to approve HF 2315, which provided for the state’s funding for public schools in fiscal 2023. Shipley was the lone ""no"" vote. We spoke with Shipley after the Democrats wrote their February 2022 tweet and he said it does not accurately represent what he said on the House floor. He said it was a mischaracterization.  ""From my perspective, the problems get worse, the more money we spend,"" Shipley said to The Daily Iowan, PolitiFact’s Iowa partner. ""I really want to examine the policy more than the funding."" Some background: A  2021 state law says public school teachers cannot ""teach, advocate, act upon, or promote divisive concepts"" that include racial or sexual stereotyping and scapegoating that includes blaming inherent discrimination on someone’s race or sex. The bill was touted as a ban on Critical Race Theory, the concept that race is a social construct, and that racism is not just an individual’s prejudice, but something that’s embedded within legal systems and policies. Critical Race Theory was not being taught in Iowa’s public schools before the law passed. Shipley supported the 2021 law, which prohibited ""assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex, or claiming that, consciously or unconsciously, and by virtue of persons’ race or sex, members of any race are inherently racist or are inherently inclined to oppress others, or that members of a sex are inherently sexist or inclined to oppress others."" ""No one teaches that members of a race or sex are inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive,"" University of Iowa Gender, Women’s, and Sexuality Studies Department Chair Leslie Schwalm told The Daily Iowan at the time. ""In fact, one of the things that Critical Race Theory helps us understand is that racism isn’t about individual acts of discrimination, but rather about the system."" The House version of the bill was introduced by Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, and passed the House for a final time on May 6, 2021, of a vote of 53 to 35. All 53 in favor were Republican, Shipley being among them. ""I do believe the term ‘white privilege’ is racist on its face,"" Shipley said while arguing in favor of the bill, HF802, last year. ""What stifles communication is blatant accusations of racism."" During debate on the school funding bill, Shipley rescinded an amendment he had introduced that stated that Iowa teachers would not receive a raise if they had violated state law that prohibits teaching ideas determined to be divisive concepts.  Shipley told The Daily Iowan in the recent interview, ""If you got into the teaching profession because you want to teach critical race theory to children, while you’re still technically at liberty to do so, don’t be surprised if lawmakers aren’t going to give you a pay raise and you got to stay at your base salary.""  He continued, ""As a legislator voting on pay raises for these people, I want to make sure that you know if you’re getting a pay raise from the state of Iowa, that you’re at the very least making an effort to follow state law."" School boards approve pay raises for teachers, not legislators, although legislators have an impact on boards’ available money when approving how much state money school districts receive. Democrats in the Iowa House accused Shipley of saying teachers should not get pay raises if what they teach doesn’t align with what Republicans want. Shipley says they mischaracterized his House floor comments. The Democrats’ tweet leaves open the suggestion that Shipley would punish teachers for teaching anything Republicans don’t approve of, which would be a stretch of what he talked about on the House floor. But, Shipley made clear that he thinks teachers who veer into teaching that inherent racism exists or tenets of critical race theory should not get raises.

Kelley is now a distinguished associate fellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The weapon has a capacity of 10 to 15 warheads, all of which can target a different location, according to Newsweek. ""Individual warheads would strike distinct targets within a very limited ballistic ‘footprint,’ or many warheads from the same missile would strike the same target, increasing the likelihood of destroying that target completely,"" according to a 2021 report from EurAsian Times.

Ohio’s Josh Mandel repeats false claim of stolen 2020 election
","Josh Mandel faces at least five competitors for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Ohio. He aims to win by being the most pro-Donald Trump candidate in the field. Mandel made his MAGA credentials the centerpiece of his speech in Florida at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual go-to gathering of the Republican base. ""I'm the only candidate in Ohio who's willing to say this, and I want to say it to all of you very clearly,"" Mandel said Feb. 25. ""I believe this election was stolen from Donald J.Trump."" Mandel’s words drew a long cheer. Few presidential elections have been as thoroughly vetted, audited and reexamined as the one in 2020, when Democratic candidate Joe Biden beat Trump. Not a scrap of evidence has emerged to support Mandel’s assertion of a stolen election. The Associated Press published one of the most sweeping investigations into voter fraud cases around the country in December 2021, contacting more than 300 local election offices as well as state officials. The AP found fewer than 475 voter fraud cases in six battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The disputed ballots represent 0.15% of Biden’s victory margin in those states, the AP found. The AP concluded that most of the cases involved lone actors — and no evidence of ""rigging"" or collusion. Some cases involved people who sought to cast a ballot on behalf of a dead relative. In Nevada, for example, Donald Kirk Hartle told a TV station that someone cast a ballot in his dead wife’s name, but Hartle himself later pleaded guilty. Other cases of disputed ballots were a result of administrative error or voter confusion. One Wisconsin man who was on parole for a drunk driving felony told the AP he voted after asking poll workers if it was OK. It wasn’t. Arizona officials investigated the largest number of disputed votes — 198 out of 3.4 million cast, the AP found. Only nine resulted in charges.  Here’s a sample of other reviews that confirmed Biden’s victory: Arizona: State Senate Republicans ordered a review of 2 million ballots in Maricopa County that ultimately upheld the finding that Biden beat Trump.  Michigan: An investigation led by Michigan Republican lawmakers found no basis for claims that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Wisconsin: A conservative group found no evidence of widespread fraud and nothing suspicious about turnout or the timing of the vote tally. Georgia: Trump said thousands of dead people voted, but investigators found just four absentee ballots from Georgia voters who had died, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in December. All were returned by relatives. Georgia conducted multiple recounts, including one by hand.   ""Law enforcement has had a year to investigate and nothing has been identified that would come close to changing any outcome,"" Trey Grayson, a Republican and former Kentucky secretary of state, previously told PolitiFact. ""It is not accurate to say that there were zero incidents of fraud. But there is no evidence showing that anything would change or that anything was rigged."" Mandel also said that Trump’s 8-point margin of victory in Ohio was an undercount. He provided no evidence, and the number of questionable ballots — some of them for Trump — are less than 100 in an election with about 5.9 million votes. We reached out to the Mandel campaign and did not hear back. Mandel said that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Multiple investigations in six key states that Trump lost uncovered scant cases of fraud, and nothing on the scale needed to have changed the outcome. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

No, vaccination does not cause COVID-19 to mutate faster
","Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Senate has advanced a bill that would count prior COVID-19 infection as immunity, a sure sign that the partisan fight over the state’s pandemic response will continue to churn along.  The bill was passed Feb. 15, 2022 and is all but certain to be vetoed when it reaches Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ desk.  But the body’s discussion of the bill underscored the deep divide between Evers and Republican members of the Legislature about how to bring the pandemic to an end.  That discussion also included misinformation about COVID-19 vaccination from Sen. Mary Felzkowski, R-Irma.  ""Over-vaccination causes faster mutation of the virus, which causes a super virus we may not have the ability to fight off,"" Felzkowski told her Senate colleagues during the floor session.  She’s way off base.  Let’s break it down.  Felzkowski’s office did not respond to a request for evidence to back up her claim.  In any case, the claim is inaccurate, said Ajay Sethi, associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health.  The virus will always try to mutate to guarantee its own survival and evade people’s immunity, Sethi said in an email — and it doesn’t care whether that immunity comes from a vaccine, from prior infection, or both. In other words, it’s not mutating faster because people are vaccinated. Politifact National rated a similar claim False last May, when a French virologist said  vaccination is creating the virus variants.  In that fact-check, Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the immunology and infectious diseases department at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, offered the same conclusion that Sethi did.  ""Either people are going to get sick and get COVID-19, and the virus tries to escape that immune selection, or people can be vaccinated and the virus is going to try to escape that immune selection,"" Fortune said. ""Avoiding vaccination is not going to limit the evolution of the virus.""  In fact, vaccinations play a role in slowing mutations of the virus.  Each new infection gives the virus another chance to mutate. While it’s possible for people who are vaccinated to become infected with COVID-19, research shows getting the shot makes that less likely to happen. Data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, show that in December 2021, unvaccinated people were testing positive for the virus at a rate that was three times higher than vaccinated people.  Vaccinated people who do contract the virus also have a shorter course of illness than unvaccinated people, Sethi said, reducing the time and thus the opportunity for it to spread further, which gives it a greater chance to mutate. As for Felzkowski’s claim about a ""super virus,"" it is possible that a variant that can evade all forms of immunity could develop. But as explained above, that wouldn’t be caused by vaccinations — it would be caused by unfettered spread of the virus through the population.  ""If the next Variant of Concern circumvents immunity from vaccines, immunity from past infection, and monoclonal antibody treatments, it is because society allowed the virus to continue to spread, evolve and mutate into new variants,"" Sethi said.  Felzkowski said ""over-vaccination"" causes the COVID-19 virus to mutate faster, which could produce a virus that humans may not be able to fight off.  But state and national experts agree that the virus is seeking to evade any form of immunity to stay alive, not just immunity from vaccines. In reality, vaccines can play a role in slowing mutation of the virus because vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and tend to recover quicker.  We rate her claim False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C1B2C0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/01/mary-felzkowski/no-vaccination-does-not-cause-covid-19-mutate-fast/

Biden’s blanket statement — ‘No more surprise billing’ — doesn’t quite cover it
","During a Feb. 10 speech about lowering health care costs, President Joe Biden made a sweeping declaration that Americans would no longer need to worry about surprise medical bills. ""No more surprise billing. No more,"" said Biden. ""Millions of hardworking Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills."" Biden was referring to a bipartisan law, the No Surprises Act, that was passed by Congress during the Trump administration in late 2020 and took effect on Jan. 1, 2022. The law is supposed to protect consumers from often-expensive out-of-network medical bills. Biden offered this example of the kinds of bills the law would prevent: ""If your health care plan did not cover a particular doctor but you didn’t even know he was being consulted and you get an extra bill for $2,000-$5,000 — they can’t do that anymore."" Still, Biden exaggerated when he said there would be no more surprise billing. He had a point that the new law would provide newfound protection against certain charges for millions of people, but his statement went further than what the law accomplishes.  We decided to dig in and find out how far the law goes to prevent unexpected medical costs.  The No Surprises Act primarily protects consumers against certain types of medical bills: those received by patients for care at an out-of-network facility — specifically, a hospital, a hospital outpatient department, or an ambulatory surgery center; or from an out-of-network medical provider whom patients did not get to choose. The act also protects patients from ""surprise"" bills from an out-of-network air ambulance transport. Out of network means the doctor doesn’t take your medical insurance or isn’t included on the list of approved providers in your insurance network. The federal government estimates that the law will apply to about 10 million surprise bills a year. They are often associated with emergency care provided when patients must go to the closest medical facility and can’t check the network status of the facility or emergency room physicians. They also may stem from nonemergency hospitalizations or surgeries at an in-network facility that involve a provider, such as an anesthesiologist or radiologist, who is out of network and bills separately. Before the law, patients could be left on the hook for charges much higher than their insurer’s in-network negotiated rate because their health plan might pay only part of the bill or deny the claim completely. Trying to get any portion of an out-of-network bill covered often required lots of paperwork and phone time with insurance providers, and consumers were sometimes still left with a big bill. However, with the No Surprises Act, consumers are shielded from these out-of-network bills. Insurance companies are required to cover the out-of-network claims, paying providers the rate they pay for the service when it is delivered by an in-network provider or facility and leaving consumers responsible for only the in-network cost sharing. Finally, the new law created an arbitration process that kicks in if the insurer and provider dispute the payment rates and takes the consumer out of the negotiation. ""So if the new law works well, patients should not only save money, they could be relieved of some complicated claims-filing paperwork,"" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow for health reform and private insurance at KFF. Although the No Surprises Act is relatively comprehensive for out-of-network bills, some notable exceptions could result in large bills for consumers, said Loren Adler, associate director of the University of Southern California-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. One glaring omission is that charges associated with using a ground ambulance to get to a hospital in an emergency are not covered. A 2021 Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker analysis found that half of emergency ground-ambulance rides resulted in an out-of-network charge for those with private health insurance. It’s also important to note that politicians often use the term ""surprise bills"" as shorthand for out-of-network bills. Certain large medical bills that consumers receive for in-network care may be ""surprising"" to them, but, technically, they won’t fit under the No Surprises Act if they’re not an out-of-network bill. ""There are certainly plenty of things that are surprises in the medical system,"" said Adler. ""Such as people don’t realize they have a deductible, and that’s a surprise. Or your insurance company denies a claim, and that’s a surprise."" This can be confusing to consumers who receive a bill that has nothing to do with what the No Surprises Act was designed to address. For instance, consumers can still be subject to huge fees because of hospital overcharges or insurer mistakes, as shown in many stories in the KHN Bill of the Month series. Still, the four health policy experts we consulted told us that Biden’s statement was mostly accurate. ""My general reaction is that it’s broadly correct,"" said Benedic Ippolito, a senior fellow and health care expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But it’s not quite true to say that there are bills that you don’t need to worry about anymore."" There are a couple of other sticking points in the No Surprises Act that could mean patients still end up with a large or surprising medical bill. Currently, the interim final rule implementing the No Surprises Act leaves some medical facilities — including urgent care centers, birthing centers, hospice, addiction treatment facilities, and nursing homes — off the list of places covered by the law. One other issue: Facilities can ask patients to sign a prior written consent that waives their rights under the No Surprises Act in certain situations; this allows patients to be charged out-of-network prices for procedures. Medical providers are not allowed to ask patients to sign the form for emergency care or for services in which the patient doesn’t choose the doctor. ""That’s not to say that there is absolutely zero risk,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. ""Probably the scenario I am most worried about is post-stabilization care following emergency care."" Fiedler said that could mean an out-of-network facility would be able to charge a patient at out-of-network rates if it received the prior written consent and showed that the patient could have traveled to an in-network facility; or, perhaps, for certain services in which the patient doesn’t choose the doctor. Even in those cases, the provider would have to get patients to sign a form they may not understand in which they waive their rights and put themselves at risk of getting an out-of-network bill they weren’t expecting. ""That’s not impossible, but I think it’s probably also not trivial,"" Fiedler said. ""So, all things considered, I think we are talking about really unusual scenarios."" Even so, it’s important for consumers to be aware that while the No Surprises Act will protect them from most out-of-network bills, they could still receive other types of surprising bills because the U.S. has such a complex health care system. While effective, the law is not infallible. Biden declared that because of the No Surprises Act, which took effect in January, millions of Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills. It’s estimated the NSA will protect against 10 million surprise bills a year.  Although it’s true that consumers are now shielded from many out-of-network bills, which are often termed ""surprise bills"" by lawmakers, patients still could end up with other types of large and unexpected medical bills. Biden’s statement is a bit too general and sweeping and needs clarification and additional context. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C1BFC0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/01/joe-biden/bidens-blanket-statement-no-more-surprise-billing-/

Keystone wouldn’t simply offset oil US imports from Russia
","As Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden faced accusations at home that he had made the United States more dependent on Russian oil. The attacks came in social media posts, on television and, in at least one instance, in a paid ad from the House office of Rep. Jake LaTurner, a Kansas Republican who is seeking re-election to a second term.  In the ad, which began running on Facebook and Instagram on Feb. 25, the day after the invasion, LaTurner stated:  ""President Biden canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office. This project would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia."" The ad draws a misleading relationship between Russian imports and the Keystone pipeline project. RELATED VIDEO:    In May 2021, the U.S. imported more than 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. But the latest figures show a general trend downward and that by October 2021, the figure was 595,000. The Keystone XL pipeline would have been able to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil every day, the figure used in LaTurner’s ad. LaTurner’s office cited reports showing the two figures.  But the pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day. The purpose of the pipeline was to transport oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. And, in any event, producers would be under no obligation to sell that oil to the U.S. Biden on Jan. 20, 2021, his first day in office, used the power of the executive branch to cancel the Keystone, which would have transported crude oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. From there, refined petroleum products could be sold either in the U.S. or to foreign buyers.  LaTurner represents Kansas’ 2nd District, which covers the Topeka area and points south. The other major candidate for the seat is Democrat Patrick Schmidt, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer. Campaign watchers rate the race as solid  or safe Republican. LaTurner said in an ad: The Keystone XL pipeline ""would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what we import from Russia. President Biden's energy agenda has strengthened Putin at the expense of hard-working Kansans."" The transport capacity of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Biden canceled, would have been about 830,000 barrels per day — more than the amount of oil being imported to the United States from Russia. But it’s not as simple as substituting one source for the other.  The pipeline would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges, so it couldn’t have solved today’s demand needs. Even in the future, there would be no certainty that the pipeline could produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way. Nor would producers be obligated to sell that entire amount to the U.S. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A73400>],/factchecks/2022/feb/28/jake-laturner/keystone-wouldnt-simply-offset-oil-us-imports-russ/

No, the U.S. did not end its domestic oil production. But it does import some of its oil from Russia

Below the still image is a block of text mentioning the possibility of the United States going to war with Russia.

The chance of the U.S. going to war is low as President Joe Biden announced Feb. 24 American forces ""will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine."" While the post doesn’t cite where it got the figure from, the federal Energy Information Administration reported the U.S. did receive 206,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Russia in October 2021. However, that number is fairly miniscule when placed in the larger context of U.S. oil imports. Crude oil is the largest source of energy imported into the U.S., according to the EIA. The U.S. imported around 7.86 million barrels of petroleum products, including crude oil, per day in 2020 from about 80 countries. Around 5.88 million barrels, or 75% of imported petroleum products, was crude oil, the EIA reported. Complete statistics for 2021 were not available from the EIA. The top five sources of imported petroleum in 2020 were Canada, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Colombia, the federal agency reported. Canada accounted for 52% of the imported petroleum, with 4.13 billion barrels per day coming into the U.S. from the north in 2020. Of that amount, 3.59 million was crude oil. Russia on the other hand, accounted for only 7% of the petroleum brought into the U.S. for 2020, with only 540,000 barrels per day. Of that amount, 76,000 barrels were of crude oil, according to the EIA. Historical importation data from the EIA also shows the amount of petroleum and oil the U.S. receives from Russia fluctuates and has not been a steady source like Canada. The Facebook post also claims the U.S. ended its domestic oil production a year ago, but provides no source for the information. The claim might be a misrepresentation of an executive order issued by Biden on Jan. 27, 2021, pausing any new federal oil and gas lease sales on government-owned land and waterways, ""pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of Federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices."" However, a federal judge struck down the order that June, saying only Congress has the authority to pause oil and gas leasing, The Washington Post reported. Oil production remains unphased in the U.S., even when the order was in effect, and the federal government was on track this year to auction off oil and gas drilling rights on more than 1.5 million acres of public land, the Post reported. The EIA also reported earlier this year that domestic crude oil production is expected to top 12.4 million barrels per day by 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. A Facebook post said that the United States buys ""206,000 barrels of oil a day"" from Russia but ""had shut down domestic oil production a year ago."" The post gets the number of barrels right, but the U.S. has not shut down domestic production.  Domestic oil production is on track to surpass pre-pandemic levels. Oil imports from Russia to the U.S. are only a small fraction of the country’s total imports.

Democratic group’s false attack on Wis. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson over outsourcing to China
","Candidates and third-party groups have seized on China as a theme in their advertising in the runup to the 2022 primaries. In some ads, candidates vow to get tough on China; in others, candidates are painted as too cozy with the nation. A TV ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee takes the latter approach in targeting Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in swing-state Wisconsin. The ad makes a variety of attacks on Johnson, including one that claims he has been ""rewarding companies that outsource to China."" It’s the same type of attack that Democrats failed in making during Johnson’s second Senate campaign in 2016. But the committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Senate, refers only to Johnson’s support of former President Donald Trump’s 2017 law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had many provisions.  Experts said it’s not clear that the law caused U.S. companies to move jobs to China. ""The bill overall does not encourage offshoring,"" even though ""it’s often portrayed that way,"" said Thornton Matheson, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. The law has no provision specific to China, he said, and U.S. multinational corporations still must pay foreign income taxes. Menzie Chinn, a professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, ""There is debate whether the international provisions of the law actually increased offshoring. Some say absolutely it didn’t, but I think in general there’s no strong evidence one way or the other."" The ad includes a footnote to a Jan. 8, 2018, New York Times news story about the 2017 law. A committee spokesperson told us Johnson’s vote for the law is the basis of this attack. Highlights of the law include: tax cuts in income tax rates for individuals; doubling the standard deduction, so that fewer taxpayers have to itemize in order to reduce their tax burden; additional child tax credits; and fewer estates being subjected to the estate tax; income tax cuts for every income group in 2019, though with the benefits flowing disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers;  a reduction in the top corporate rate from 35% to 21%. The New York Times story cited in the ad did not mention China, but it said the law ""could make it attractive for companies to put more assembly lines on foreign soil."" That’s because one provision made income made by American companies’ overseas subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxes that are half the rate applied to their domestic income, the story said.  The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee cited data indicating that U.S. companies moved thousands of jobs to China after the tax law was adopted. But Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the data don’t indicate whether the tax law was the reason for the job moves, and there is no indication how many jobs moved back to the United States because of the law. ""One purpose of reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate was to encourage factories and multinational headquarters to move here. The rules before the law encouraged headquarters to move abroad. The law mainly solved that problem,"" he said. ""Perhaps some companies shifted jobs to China, but perhaps other companies shifted jobs here from Canada or Germany,"" he added. ""It’s complex — each multinational faces different incentives based on their particular industry, whether they are research-intensive, whether they earn a lot of foreign royalties, and many other factors."" The DSCC also cited a provision of the law that allows companies to escape U.S. corporate taxes on foreign earnings if those earnings are smaller than 10% of their tangible foreign assets. But Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst of the Tax Foundation, said the tax changes to foreign income for multinational firms did not significantly change their tax burden overall.  ""Most of the reduction in the tax burden for U.S. multinationals came from lowering taxes on domestic income through changes like the lower corporate tax rate,"" he said. Johnson’s campaign said the ad ""is a weak attempt to distort the pro-America, anti-Communist China record"" of Johnson’s tenure in the Senate. The Wisconsin race is rated by campaign watchers as a tossup or as leaning Republican. It’s one of the contests that could determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. No major candidates are running for the GOP nomination against Johnson, a businessman who is seeking a third term, in Wisconsin’s Aug. 9 primaries.  The Democratic candidates include Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes; state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, Tom Nelson; the county executive for Outagamie County; and Alex Lasry, an executive with the Milwaukee Bucks National Basketball Association team. A Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ad said Johnson has been ""rewarding companies that outsource to China."" The only evidence cited was Johnson’s vote for a 2017 GOP tax law that included many provisions, including a variety of tax breaks for individuals as well as some for companies with foreign operations. The law does not contain a provision specifically for China. Moreover, experts said there is no evidence the law incentivized U.S. companies to move jobs to China. We rate the statement False.

Hearing did not include DNA evidence to vindicate rapper charged in Megan Thee Stallion shooting
","A high-profile court case where one rapper stands accused of shooting another is the subject of social media speculation. A viral Feb. 23 post on Facebook says, ""It was revealed in court a few moments ago that Tory Lanez DNA WAS NOT found on the weapon in the Meg Thee Stallion case."" The post is a screenshot of a Feb. 23 tweet by DJ Akademiks, which has since been deleted from Twitter. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) At a Feb. 23 pre-trial hearing for Lanez — charged in the 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion — no one said that his DNA was not found on the weapon. A transcript from the hearing indicates that Lanez’s attorney said, ""We are in the process of actually retaining an expert with respect to DNA,"" according to a tweet by Rolling Stone reporter Nancy Dillon. ""It is our hope that we will be able to review and confirm the (Los Angeles Police Department’s) analysis, which from our standpoint was favorable."" But the ""precise nature"" of the LAPD analysis and its results were not disclosed or described, Dillon wrote in a follow-up tweet. ""There is a discovery protective order on this case, so it's not public."" The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office told a news organization, ""We believe the evidence substantially supports the charges and allegations and that evidence will be borne out in court."" Lanez is charged with one count of assault with a semiautomatic handgun and one count of carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle. In July 2020, Megan, whose real name is Megan Pete, attended a party at Kylie Jenner’s house with Lanez, and later that night, Megan was shot. Initial reports indicated conflicting information about what had unfolded. ""The Los Angeles police have not named a suspect or explained her injuries in detail,"" the New York Times reported in late July 2020. ""The police would not even confirm whether the injuries were gunshot wounds."" In October 2020, Lanez was charged in connection with the shooting. A Facebook post says, ""It was revealed in court"" on Feb. 23, 2022 ""that Tory Lanez DNA WAS NOT found on the weapon in the Meg Thee Stallion case."" At a Feb. 23 pre-trial hearing for Lanez no one said that his DNA was not found on the weapon. Lanez’s attorney said they were in the process of retaining a DNA expert, and that the LAPD had done a DNA analysis. The nature and results of that analysis were not disclosed. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097238400>],/factchecks/2022/feb/28/facebook-posts/hearing-did-not-include-dna-evidence-vindicate-rap/

This ‘Ghost of Kyiv’ clip is from a video game, not a video of fighting in Ukraine
","A 22-second video circulating on Facebook shows a plane being shot mid-air on a sunny day. The caption says it might be a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter pilot nicknamed the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" shooting a Russian plane out of the sky. ""Air fighting continues,"" reads a Feb. 25 Facebook post that shared the video. ""Ukrainian mig-29 takes down russian su-35. Is this the ‘ghost of Kyiv’ which allegedly took down 6 Russian warplanes single handed?"" The video is one of many Facebook posts about the so-called Ghost of Kyiv being shared amid Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. This video post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It remains unclear whether such a pilot even exists. But some claims, like this one, are easily disproved. The video shared on Facebook is a simulation that was created in the video game Digital Combat Simulator, a free online game. The stated goal is to ""offer the most authentic and realistic simulation of military aircraft, tanks, ground vehicles and ships possible,"" according to the DCS World website. A person on YouTube with the username Comrade_Corb uploaded the short clip on Feb. 24.  ""This footage is from DCS, but is nevertheless made out of respect for ‘The Ghost of Kiev,’"" the video description said. ""If he is real, may God be with him; if he is fake, I pray for more like ‘him.’"" The video’s title on YouTube also indicates the video is a simulation: ""GHOST OF KIEV | dogfight between Ukrainian MiG29 and Russian Su27 simulated in DCS World."" As the YouTube user acknowledged, it remains unclear if the famed Ukrainian pilot is real. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the Ghost of Kyiv was responsible for downing six Russian planes on the first day of the invasion.  Bolstering the claims, the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported that five Russian aircraft and a helicopter were shot down on Feb. 24. The Russian military denied those reports. Aviation experts have said it is doubtful a single fighter pilot could down six planes in a day. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and other officials have referenced the Ghost of Kyiv in social media posts, further fueling speculation that the fighter pilot is real. Ghost or no ghost, the video some social media users shared claiming that it showed a Ukrainian MiG-29 taking down a Russian Su-35 is not real. The clip shows a video game simulation, not the fighting in Ukraine. We rate the video False.

Action star Steven Seagal is a friend of Putin, but not a soldier in Ukraine
","Podcast host Joe Rogan has come under fire in recent months for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 on his popular Spotify podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience."" On Feb. 28, Rogan shared, then deleted, a fake story on Facebook and Instagram that said actor Steven Seagal was spotted among Russian special forces outside an airport in Kyiv after that country invaded Ukraine. ""If I had to guess the plot of this (expletive) up movie we’re living through I would say we are about 14 hours from the arrival of the aliens,"" Rogan wrote in his since-deleted Facebook post.  The post showed a screenshot of a supposed CNN tweet with a photo of the action star in military gear with a gun and several soldiers behind him. The caption said that ""Intelligence agencies around the world have spotted American actor Steven Seagal among Russian special forces positioned around the outskirts of Gostemel airfield near Kyiv captured by Russian airborne troops."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Other people shared similar images across social media. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the CNN story and tweet was fabricated, a spokesperson for the news network told PolitiFact. The image is a screenshot of Seagal in the movie, ""Cartels,"" Newsweek fact-checkers reported.  Rogan, after several fact-checkers debunked the post, took down the post and followed up with another post explaining that he took it down because ""it was parody, which isn’t surprising, but honestly it wouldn’t be surprising if it was true either."" He shared a screenshot of a 2017 Washington Post headline, which read, ""Amid Putin ‘bromance,’ Steven Seagal banned from Ukraine as national security threat."" That article said that Seagal was banned for five years because he ""committed socially dangerous actions ... that contradict the interests of maintaining Ukraine's security."" Seagal does indeed have ties to Russia. The 69-year-old actor was born in Michigan, but was granted Russian citizenship in 2016. In June 2021 he joined ""A Just Russia For Truth,"" a pro-Kremlin political party, CNN reported. Seagal spoke about the current conflict in Ukraine with Fox News Digital on Feb. 28, saying, without evidence, that he believes ""an outside entity"" is ""spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other."" In 2018, the actor was appointed as a ""special representative on U.S.-Russia humanitarian ties,"" according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. In May 2021, Reuters reported that Seagal traveled to Venezuela as a representative of Russia to give a samurai sword to President Nicolas Maduro, who called Seagal his ""brother"" and said they ""talked about mutual friends like the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, because of his interest in protecting forests.""  In response to criticism about Rogan giving a platform to guests who shared misinformation about COVID-19, Spotify began adding a content advisory to any content about the pandemic, sending listeners to a page it said would provide facts and information from trusted sources. Spotify did not return a request for comment for this story. Rogan shared, then deleted, a screenshot of a fake CNN story that said actor Steven Seagal was spotted among Russian special forces in Ukraine. CNN said the story was fabricated, and Rogan took down the post, saying that it was ""parody"" but that ""it wouldn’t be surprising if it was true either."" Alas, it was not true.
