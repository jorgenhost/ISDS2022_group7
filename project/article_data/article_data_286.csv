Do low natural gas prices save 11,000 lives a year?
","The chair of the House Republican Policy Committee, Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., says he opposes the Democratic climate change plans because they will land heavily on families of modest means. In particular, Palmer warned that shifting toward clean energy will raise the price of natural gas at a time when tens of millions of Americans struggle to pay their energy bills.  ""This impacts low-income people,"" Palmer said Sept. 13 at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Higher energy costs literally lead to more weather-related deaths."" Palmer went on to say that the reverse is also true. ""There’s a study that indicated that as a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices that literally we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S.,"" he said. Palmer’s claim fairly represents the findings of a 2019 study on natural gas prices, but it takes a narrow view of the implications of Biden’s policies for combating climate change. And it leaves out important context about the connection between temperatures and mortality.  We reached out to Palmer’s office and did not hear back.  The 11,000 lives estimate comes from a 2019 paper from three economists that linked lower wintertime deaths to declines in natural gas prices between 2005 and 2010. They looked at the deaths from causes that are particularly high in winter — primarily cardiovascular and respiratory problems. They found that those deaths went down at the same time that natural gas prices fell. Accounting for a number of other possible factors, they said the ""price decline caused a 1.6% decrease in the winter mortality rate for households using natural gas for heating."" And they said that the impact of the lower price was greater for households making under 150% of the federal poverty level. One of the researchers, economist Seema Jayachandran at Northwestern University, said their working theory was that with lower fuel prices, people kept their homes warmer. Jayachandran acknowledged that the study didn’t consider all the implications of using more natural gas. ""We looked at mortality caused by households facing lower prices for home heating, but air pollution is another implication that we did not incorporate, and it affects mortality too,"" Jayachandran said. Public health researchers caution that the link between winter weather and mortality is poorly understood. One complicating factor is the seasonal flu. Its toll can vary greatly from year to year, as it did during the period in the study Palmer cited. A generally mild flu season, such as the one from 2006 to 2007, led to fewer deaths than the year before, quite apart from fuel prices or temperatures. ""We still don’t know that it’s the overall colder temperatures that cause the higher mortality in the winter,"" said University of Washington professor of environmental and occupational health Kristie Ebi. ""Many deaths don’t occur in the coldest places. Hypothermia is a higher risk in Houston than in New York City."" Ebi noted that if colder temperatures increased deaths, then warmer winter temperatures ought to reduce them. But ""despite warmer temperatures from 1985 to 2012, cold-attributed mortality increased in the U.S.,"" Ebi said. Other researchers —focused on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels like natural gas — look at deaths when it’s hot. In a 2020 study published in GeoHealth, a group of researchers estimated that higher temperatures caused 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S. A review of over 400 studies found that ""most research on household energy does not consider climate change."" But what that review found suggested that the effects of climate change are particularly dangerous for the very people Palmer mentioned at the hearing. ""Mortality from heat waves disproportionately affects older, minority and low-income residents who are less equipped socially, economically and physiologically to withstand high temperatures,"" the authors wrote. ""After the 1995 Chicago heat wave, there was a clear demographic disparity in mortality rates — lower-income and older people died at much higher rates than the rest of the population."" For perspective, today's natural gas prices are up from recent lows as economic activity recovers, but not even close to historical highs. They are about where they were in 2010. That said, the issue Palmer raises about natural gas costs is real. If the country seeks to cut back natural gas production to curb emissions, it’s possible that the price will rise. If that happens, low-income families that rely on natural gas would be vulnerable.  The Biden administration has plans to reduce those households’ energy bills by helping them consume less. It’s promoting programs to cut the cost of insulating and weatherproofing people’s homes and apartments. It wants to make home appliances more efficient. Whether that’s enough to offset the higher energy prices is an open question. ""Energy efficiency has historically helped to address some of the energy cost burdens for the poor, but it usually does not go far enough to really shield them from the economic shocks of high energy pricing,"" said Diana Hernandez, a researcher at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. It might also be difficult to tease out the impact of climate change policies on energy prices. Global prices are spiking primarily because demand is outpacing supply. But that’s a global phenomenon, not driven by U.S. policy. And concern about climate change may be a contributing factor: Investors are wary of sinking millions into new natural-gas production capacity at a time when the global appetite appears to be shifting toward renewable sources. Palmer said, ""As a result of the massive decline in natural gas prices, we’re saving 11,000 lives per year in the U.S.""  That claim fairly represents a study’s findings. But the study looked narrowly at wintertime mortality related to prices, without taking into account other implications of increased natural gas use, such as air pollution. Public health researchers warned that variation in seasonal flu and other factors make it difficult to draw clear links between cold and mortality. Meanwhile, other research finds that warmer temperatures due to climate change cause 12,000 premature deaths a year. Palmer’s claim is partly accurate, but takes a narrow view of the implications of Biden’s policies for combating climate change and leaves out important context about research on the connection between temperatures and mortality. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C2CDC0>],/factchecks/2021/sep/23/gary-palmer/do-low-natural-gas-prices-save-11000-lives-year/
"['Abortion', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe stretches Youngkin's opaque anti-abortion plans
","Former and possibly future Gov. Terry McAuliffe says his Republican rival, Glenn Youngkin, would end abortions in Virginia.  McAuliffe has been focusing on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 1 declined to block a Texas law that bans abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected. That occurs about six weeks into pregnancy, before many women realize they are pregnant. The law challenges longstanding precedent that allow abortions until a fetus is viable outisde the womb, at about the 22nd to 24th week of pregnancy. ""Time and again Glenn Youngkin has made it clear: He would ban abortion as governor,"" McAuliffe tweeted on Sept. 17. He made a similar claim three times the previous night during a debate and aired a TV commercial through much of September saying Youngkin wants to end abortions. McAuliffe’s claims stretch comments Youngkin made in June to liberal activists posing as anti-abortion advocates at a Republican gathering in Loudoun County.  In a quiet conversation that was secretly videotaped, Youngkin was sympathetic to the activists, described himself as ""staunchly, unabashedly pro-life,"" and spoke of tightening state abortion laws.   Youngkin, however, never said he would ban ""all abortions"" as McAuliffe said once, at a Sept. 7 news conference. Since then, McAuliffe has been less specific, saying Youngkin wants to ""ban abortions"" and removing the word ""all."" The tape leaves many of Youngkin’s words up for interpretation, and so have some Youngkin’s subsequent comments on abortion. McAuliffe’s campaign says Youngkin, at the very least, would ban some abortions. Youngkin avoided giving the activists details about his anti-abortion agenda. He told them that focusing on the topic could alienate independent voters that he needs to win the election. Youngkin assured the activists he is not ""squishy"" on abortion and that, ""When I’m governor and have a majority in the House, we can start going on the offense."" He told the activists he opposes public funding of abortions and that he wants to take back ""the ground that has been taken away from us."" Youngkin’s campaign says this refers to repealing changes to abortion laws passed by Democrats since they took control of the General Assembly in 2020. Democrats ended requirements that women receive ultrasounds and wait 24 hours before they can have abortion. The activists mentioned the Texas law, and Youngkin did not state a position. During the debate, Youngkin said he would not have signed the law, calling it ""unworkable and confusing.""  The Texas law has an exception only when a mother’s life is endangered by continuing a pregnancy. Youngkin has said women should be allowed abortions in cases of rape, incest and life of the mother. Youngkin did not give a direct answer when he was asked at the debate whether he would sign a fetal heartbeat bill if it had those three exceptions. Youngkin said during the debate that he favors shortening the period that women have unconditional paths to abortions, from fetal viability to the moment a fetus can feel pain - pain is a much-debated determination that some anti-abortion advocates place at 20 weeks into pregnancy. If so, it would be two to four weeks shorter than now. Youngkin does not address abortion on his website. McAuliffe said, ""Time and again Glenn Youngkin has made it clear: He would ban abortion as governor."" His statement creates a inaccurate impression that Youngkin has said he would ban all abortions. Youngkin has not said that. Youngkin has made it clear, however, that he would seek to ban some abortions. He supports a fetal pain law that would shorten by two to four weeks the time women can unconditionally end a pregnancy. He won’t say whether he’d support a fetal heartbeat law, which would ban abortions before many women knew they were pregnant. He promised to go ""on the offense"" as governor if Republicans reclaim a House majority. So Youngkin’s words are open to some interpretation. We rate McAuliffe’s statement Half True. Editor’s Note: After publication, Youngkin’s campaign clarified that he wants to repeal a law passed by Democrats that allows health insurance plans bought through state-run exchanges to cover abortions. His campaign says he has not taken a position on Democratic actions ending requirements that women receive ultrasounds and wait 24 hours before they can have an abortion.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097643100>],/factchecks/2021/sep/23/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-stretches-youngkins-opaque-anti-abortion/

No evidence that the Pfizer vaccine causes deaths
","A man who promotes himself as an entrepreneur and technology expert made a COVID-19 claim that drew wide attention on Facebook and elsewhere: ""Pfizer vaccine kills more people than it saves."" That’s not accurate. Steve Kirsch made the claim in a presentation he gave during the public comment period of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration committee meeting on Sept. 17; he had tweeted out a slide show of his presentation three days earlier.  The meeting was held by FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee to discuss Pfizer’s application to give booster shots of its COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer’s COVID-19  vaccine is the only one approved in the U.S. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines continue to be used under an emergency use authorization. In non-binding votes, the committee recommended that the FDA not approve the booster for all adults, but approve it for people 65 and older and those at risk of serious disease.  Kirsch made many allegations in his presentation about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines. Regarding the Pfizer vaccine, he claimed that a six-month study showed the Pfizer vaccine ""killed five people"" for each COVID-19 death it prevented. At the hearing, he said the statistic was not statistically significant but was still troubling.  That’s not what the study he cited showed. The study was a non-peer-reviewed preprint posted July 28. It concluded that, ""with up to six months of follow-up and despite a gradually declining trend in vaccine efficacy,"" the Pfizer vaccine ""had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19."" In response to PolitiFact’s request for evidence to support his statement about the Pfizer vaccine, Kirsch said ""my statement about deaths was not based at all on the Pfizer study."" He referred us to several other documents he produced, in which he said he used the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, jointly run by the CDC and the FDA. Kirsch told us he used VAERS as ""one of eight methods to determine the number of excess deaths,"" and that ""we could only find that the vaccine was the only plausible cause of the excess deaths."" ""Excess deaths"" is a statistic that takes the number of actual deaths in a given period and subtracts the expected number of deaths from all causes for that period, based on an average of recent years. Though the VAERS database is an important tool to help researchers detect trends in vaccine-related side-effects, the CDC makes very clear on the VAERS website that the data available through VAERS can’t be used to conclude that COVID-19 vaccines caused deaths. The FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS,  even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. What’s more, anyone can submit a report, and the reports are widely accessible, a fact that has made VAERS a popular breeding ground for misinformation.  More than 386 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from mid December through Sept. 20. And in that period, VAERS received 7,899 reports of death (0.0020%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.  But, the CDC, which analyzes all reports to VAERS, has determined that ""a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" The CDC notes that recent reports indicate ""a plausible causal relationship"" between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and TTS, a rare condition with blood clots with low platelets that has caused deaths. It’s also worth noting that the CDC requires users of its search engine for VAERS data to agree to a disclaimer that says in part that ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness."" However, the document Kirsch presented to the FDA committee cites an alternative portal that does not require agreeing to the disclaimer. That portal is offered by the National Vaccine Information Center, an anti-vaccine advocacy group. COVID-19 has killed nearly 675,000 people in the U.S., and more than 4.5 million worldwide. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. And no evidence has established that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. caused any deaths. The CDC analyzed vaccine effectiveness across 13 jurisdictions from April 4 to July 17 and matched that data to vaccine registries from those areas. It found that after delta became the most dominant variant of the coronavirus, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected than fully vaccinated people, and more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die.  ""Across 13 U.S. jurisdictions, incidence rate ratios for hospitalization and death changed relatively little after the delta variant reached predominance, suggesting high, continued vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19,"" the Sept. 10 report said. Kirsch’s presentation said: ""Pfizer vaccine kills more people than it saves.""  There is no evidence that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has caused death. Available data indicate just the opposite: Vaccines are overwhelmingly effective at preventing death and serious illness from the virus that causes COVID-19.

COVID-19 vaccines work, even if they aren’t 100% effective
","Reports of vaccinated Americans catching COVID-19 have invigorated vaccine skeptics, but such breakthrough infections are expected, and no vaccine is 100% effective. And that’s not unique to COVID-19 vaccines.  Still, some Facebook posts have suggested otherwise. ""First in history, a vax that does not prevent catching or spreading a virus, and only lasts for months,"" one post says. ""Mind boggling!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Vaccines are the best defense we have against infectious disease,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website, ""but no vaccine is actually 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person’s body reacts to vaccines differently.""  This is as true for the flu vaccine as it is for COVID-19 vaccines. ""Some fully vaccinated people will get sick, and some will even be hospitalized or die from COVID-19,"" the CDC says. Vaccinated people with breakthrough infections can also spread the disease.  But most people who get COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and fully vaccinated people who are infected are less likely to suffer a serious illness. Studies show that vaccinated people are eight times less likely to be infected and 25 times less likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19 than unvaccinated people, according to the CDC.  ""Vaccines remain effective in protecting most people from COVID-19 infection and its complications,"" the agency says.  All COVID-19 vaccines approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use are required to have an efficacy rate of 50% or greater.  As for how long the COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against the disease, if and when everyone will need a booster shot is still being debated. In August, the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer and Moderna to give a third dose of their vaccines to certain immunocompromised people because it could increase protection for people such as organ transplant recipients, Yale Medicine recently noted. In September, an FDA advisory committee recommended booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for people who receive their second shot at least six months prior and who are 65 and older or have a high risk of a severe case of COVID-19.  But, again, plenty of other vaccines have boosters. The flu vaccine, of course, is annual, and vaccines against Hepatitis B, whooping cough, chicken pox and measles, among other diseases, require multiple shots.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809679F840>],/factchecks/2021/sep/21/facebook-posts/covid-19-vaccines-work-even-if-they-arent-100-effe/

Would Joe Biden’s clean energy plan bring 20,000 jobs to West Virginia?
","As the Biden administration pulls out all the stops to promote passage of its infrastructure proposals by Congress, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm made a late-night cable news appearance to sell parts of the plan. In a Sept. 8 appearance on CNN, Granholm was asked by host Don Lemon about negotiations between the administration and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who is a pivotal vote on almost every piece of legislation in an evenly divided Senate. Manchin is widely considered the Senate’s most moderate Democrat, and his state backed Donald Trump over Joe Biden by a wide margin in both 2016 and 2020. In her CNN appearance, Granholm touted clean-energy proposals that could boost the economy in West Virginia, a state that has long been reliant on the coal industry and is now experiencing pressure to shift its economy toward clean energy. ""West Virginia University just came out with a study that showed that there will be almost 20,000 jobs created in clean energy in West Virginia if these bills are passed, if the ‘Build Back Better’ agenda is passed,"" Granholm said. (""Build Back Better"" is one of the branding labels used by Biden to describe his agenda during the 2020 campaign.) We can’t verify a prediction of future job growth, but we can verify whether Granholm correctly cited the WVU study in question. Does it say that Biden’s agenda could bring 20,000 jobs to West Virginia? Basically, yes — but there are some caveats. The report Granholm was referring to was written by researchers at West Virginia University’s Center for Energy and Sustainable Development, her office confirmed to Politifact West Virginia. In August 2021, the center published ""West Virginia’s Energy Future: Build Back Better,"" an analysis of proposed clean-energy legislation as well as Biden’s American Jobs Plan. The researchers looked at Biden’s call for a ""path to achieving 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035"" as well as a 10-year extension of clean-energy tax incentives. Their modeling shows that this would add 3,508 full-time jobs to the West Virginia economy and produce $20.9 billion of investment in new power plants in the state by 2040. The remaining jobs to reach 20,000 would come from a bill sponsored by Manchin, the American Jobs in Energy Manufacturing Act. This measure proposes $8 billion in tax credits and carves out specific credits for communities affected by the decline of the coal industry. Manchin’s proposal, the researchers projected, would create between 12,550 and 16,750 jobs in clean-energy manufacturing as well as indirect spending from the investment. The tax credits are estimated to generate $1.7 billion of investment in energy manufacturing in West Virginia towns where coal plants or coal mines used to be. The researchers say the two proposals taken together are the type of federal reinvestment necessary to ensure West Virginia’s role in the renewable-energy economy.    ""Sen. Manchin’s proposal is sort of the detailed legislative proposal for what Biden has put in the American Jobs Plan,"" said Tim Cronin, energy fellow at the center and one of the authors of the report. ""And then he got a portion of it into the bipartisan package that the Senate already passed. Now they're looking at getting the balance of it into"" an even larger spending measure known as the reconciliation bill, he said. Taken together, the 3,508 projected jobs from the Biden plan plus 16,750 projected jobs from the Manchin proposal would slightly surpass the 20,000 figure cited by Granholm. ""I think that’s pretty close to hitting the nail on the head,"" Cronin said of Granholm’s claim. But there are a few important caveats. First, getting to 20,000 requires using the top figure in the range provided for Manchin’s bill. If the figure at the lower end of this range is used instead, the number of jobs would be about 16,000, about 20% lower than what Granholm cited. Second, the researchers projected that between 9,300 and 12,400 jobs gained — a majority of the total —  would be created ""indirectly"" from the manufacturing investment. This means they would stem from economic activity that flowed from the manufacturing investments.  By this logic, workers at an industrial facility created by the bill would spend money at the local grocery store, go out to dinner, see movies and more. But economic development experts warn that indirect job creation is hard to measure and may not materialize. And these jobs are not ""in clean energy"" per se, as Granholm indicated on CNN. Finally, it’s important to note that these are proposals, and thus are not guaranteed to make it into law. In fact, as Granholm was appearing on CNN, Democrats faced major challenges in unifying the party’s moderate and progressive wings and members of the House and Senate behind the various pieces of legislation. Granholm said, ""West Virginia University just came out with a study that showed that there will be almost 20,000 jobs created in clean energy in West Virginia if (President Joe Biden’s) agenda is passed."" An analysis by WVU researchers did project that a combination of the Biden and Manchin proposals would create up to 20,000 jobs if enacted. One of the study’s authors characterized Granholm’s recap of the report’s finding as fair. However, Granholm use of the word ""will"" suggests greater certainty than is warranted. She also used the top figure from a range of possible job gains, and a majority of these gains would come from indirect economic activity that can be hard to predict and would not be specifically in clean-energy manufacturing.

Biden has overseen a large increase in jobs, but he’s not really the one creating them
","In recent months, many people have returned to work, but the pace of new jobs hasn’t quite matched expectations as the delta variant has sent hospitals reeling with new cases.  So, the performance of the economy has been closely watched. U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee on Sept. 3, 2021 took to Twitter to credit President Joe Biden with a historic upturn in the number of new jobs: ""President Biden has created more jobs in his first 7 months than any POTUS in history. During a pandemic. And an economic downturn. President Biden’s leadership is helping America bounce back and our economy recover. Democrats will continue moving us forward.""  For the purpose of this fact-check, we’re going to focus on the first part of that tweet -- that Biden has created more jobs than any other president in his first seven months in office.  Is it true? And should Biden get the credit -- as Moore frames it -- for that increase. When asked for backup for the claim, Moore’s staff sent us two links: the Sept. 3, 2021 economic update from the Joint Economic Committee, issued the day of Moore’s tweet, and data compiled by Federal Reserve Economic Data, which pulls its information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  First, let’s look at how many jobs have been created in 2021, starting in February, the first full month of Biden’s presidency, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: February: 536,000 new jobs March: 785,000 April: 269,000 May: 614,000 June: 962,000 July: 1.1 million August (latest month available): 235,000 That all adds up to about 4.5 million net new jobs added since Biden was sworn in.  And that number is higher than any other president since the end of World War II, said Sophia Koropeckyj, managing director for Moody’s Analytics. Here’s a breakdown of job growth (or loss) for the first seven months for those presidents, with the year their terms began:  Joe Biden, 2021: gain of 4,454,000 Jimmy Carter, 1977: 2,385,000 Richard Nixon, 1969: 1,569,000 Bill Clinton, 1993: 1,412,000 Donald Trump, 2017: 1,312,000 Lyndon B. Johnson, 1963: 964,000 George H.W. Bush, 1989: 959,000 John F. Kennedy, 1961: 615,000 Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953: 345,000 George W. Bush, 2001: - 670,000 Ronald Reagan, 1981: -701,000 Gerald Ford, 1974: -1,971,000 Harry Truman, 1945: -2,450,000 Barack Obama, 2009: -3,570,000 So, Biden does top the list. But in making the claim, Moore gave all the credit to Biden, when -- in reality -- many other factors are at work. In short, experts say too much credit -- and blame -- goes to presidents, governors and mayors for things out of their control. ""The increase in jobs is explained by the reopening of businesses and government and schools following shutdowns in 2020 due to the pandemic,"" said Koropeckyj of Moody’s. ""Favorable fiscal policies have helped."" To be sure, Biden did sign the American Rescue Act, in March 2021, a massive stimulus plan that provided checks to all Americans, extended unemployment and expanded child tax credits.But much of the money meant to help states and businesses is still being distributed, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, so it’s hard to judge what impact that spending has had on the overall economy and jobs.  In any case, the job growth began before Biden took office. There had been monthly increases from May through November of 2020, followed by a drop in December 2020, then an increase of 233,000 jobs in January 2021. That’s evidence the economy was getting back on track before Biden did anything. Presidents -- and other top officials --  love to measure their success by the success of the economy.  But experts have long cautioned that though presidents hold a powerful position, they don’t really dictate the economy.  For instance, Biden inherited an economy that was beginning to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and with vaccinations about to roll out for millions of Americans. With more people vaccinated and able to move about more freely, more money was being spent. That increased demand and the need for workers. And with vaccinations available, more went back to work. In short, how you do as president depends a lot on where you start. When you take office at the bottom of a recession with high unemployment numbers, you ""achieve"" a lot of growth as the economy heals, according to a Jan. 17, 2017 article in the New York Times. When you take office with a low level of unemployment and more job growth, there is often nowhere to go but down.  Moore claimed that Biden has ""created more jobs in his first 7 months than any POTUS in history.""  As is typical with such claims, Moore is on target with the numbers -- though, we’d note the increase in jobs began before Biden took office -- but gives too much credit to Biden for his role in something that is largely out of his control. Our definition for Half True is: ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EA8F40>],/factchecks/2021/sep/21/gwen-moore/biden-has-overseen-large-increase-jobs-hes-not-rea/

It was about military contractors and corporations raking in the profits. I am numb. I am sure everyone who spent years there feels the same!""  2 trillion dollars to train and equip the Afghan military over the past 20 years. They fell in a week. It was never about real training. It was about military contractors and corporations raking in the profits. I am numb. I am sure everyone who spent years there feels the same! On the day Ojeda sent his tweet, Taliban fighters entered Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the nation, effectively sealing the U.S.-backed government’s downfall. We wanted to check whether Ojeda was using accurate figures for the money spent on the Afghan military and how quickly the country fell to the Taliban.  We found that Ojeda’s $2 trillion figure covers much more than just training and equipping the Afghan military. (Ojeda did not respond to inquiries for this article by email and phone.) The $2 trillion figure is close to the headline number from a widely reported study by the Costs of War project, an effort headquartered at Brown University. The study found that the U.S. spent $2.3 trillion in the region since the post-9/11 military campaign in 2001 and in 2021 But there’s an important caveat, said Heidi Peltier, a contributor to the Costs of War project and a political scientist at Boston University: The figure includes more than just money spent on military equipment and training. ""This is a more inclusive estimate than just the ‘war budget,’"" Peltier said. The ""war budget,"" officially known as the budget for ""overseas contingency operations,"" was just over $1 trillion in Afghanistan during that period, she said.  ""Once you add veterans’ costs, interest costs, and other increased (Pentagon) expenses, the full cost of the war in Afghanistan surpasses $2 trillion,"" Peltier said. The total figure for spending will grow over time, since the $2.3 trillion amount does not include costs for the future care of veterans. Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s accounting of 20 years of spending in Afghanistan also undercuts the figure Ojeda tweeted. The Defense Department spent more than $1.6 trillion between 2001 and March 2021, said Christopher Sherwood, a public affairs specialist with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Sherwood said these funds were spent in a variety of areas, including war operational costs, troop support, and transportation.  But even that figure overshoots the cost to specifically ""train and equip the Afghan military,"" as Ojeda put it. According to the Costs of War project, the Pentagon spent just over $83 billion within the last two decades specifically to support Afghan military and security forces In recent years, the amount has been lower than it was in the earlier years of the conflict: The U.S. has spent between $3 billion and $5 billion a year to support Afghan troops in the region, said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""We did not spend $2 trillion to train and equip the Afghan military,"" Harrison said. ""The cost of training and equipping the Afghan’s is a relatively small subset of the total cost. The vast majority of the costs for the war were for the operation of our own forces and support for our own service members."" Ojeda has a better case to make with the second part of his statement. The Afghan military fell nine days after the Taliban seized its first provincial capital, Zaranj, on Aug. 5. Still, the Taliban surge had been building for some time.  Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign policy specialist at the Brookings Institution, said that saying it took a week or nine days is defensible, he’d be more inclined to call it ""a matter of weeks."" Signs of the Taliban’s rising power could be seen as far back as May when U.S. troops began to withdraw, he said. In the absence of U.S. troops, the Taliban set up dozens of checkpoints along main highways going in and out of the capital, Kabul.  The Taliban continued to improve their position over the next few months, and at the beginning of August, its forces launched attacks on Herat and Kandahar, two large Afghan cities.  Ojeda said the U.S. had ""2 trillion dollars to train and equip the Afghan military over the past 20 years. They fell in a week."" While the U.S. is credibly estimated to have spent more than $2 trillion during its involvement, only a fraction of that -- an estimated $83 billion -- was specifically spent on training and equipping Afghan military and security forces. Meanwhile, the Afghan military went into something of a freefall about nine days before Kabul fell, but it’s worth noting that the Taliban had begun making steady advances about three months before Kabul’s fall.

As more get vaccinated, spread and severity of COVID-19 worse among unvaccinated
","A viral image pushes back against data showing that COVID-19 has a bigger impact on people who are not vaccinated than on those who are. The image states: ""2020: Peak active cases — 9,034,460; vaccinated — 0%. ""2021: Peak active cases — 9,243,682; vaccinated — 71%. ""I hate to break this to you, but this is not a ‘pandemic of the unvaccinated.’"" The claim is made in an image of a tweet that was widely shared on Facebook. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) New cases of COVID-19 peaked again in August 2021, after the more contagious delta variant became predominant in late June 2021, and there are cases of breakthrough infections among people who have been fully vaccinated. But the virus is much more likely to spread, and the disease presents far greater health risks, among the unvaccinated than the vaccinated. It’s not clear what ""peak active cases"" are, or what the numbers stated in the image are counting. Hannah Ritchie, head of research at the England-based Our World in Data research organization, said peak active cases is not a metric commonly used by researchers. A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the CDC does not use that term. Daily new cases in the United States peaked at 293,000 on Jan. 6, 2021, as vaccines were being rolled out, and at 188,000 on Aug. 12, 2021, after the more contagious delta variant had taken hold, according to the CDC. ""The epidemic has matured, and the virus has evolved, so comparing overall counts in 2020 and 2021 isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison — much has changed,"" said Dr. Stuart Ray, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University.  ""When comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated people, rates are lower in vaccinated people, whether looking at likelihood of testing positive; duration of testing positive; the number of close contacts infected by an infected person; the likelihood of needing hospitalization or intensive care unit care; and the likelihood of death,"" Ray said. In total, there have been more than 41 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. The CDC in May 2021 stopped monitoring breakthrough cases — infections in fully vaccinated people — that did not result in hospitalization or death. Zeroing in on severe breakthrough cases is meant to provide vaccine researchers with more complete and reliable data on the cases they’re most concerned about, since not all people with breakthrough infections can be identified, particularly those with asymptomatic or mild illness who do not get tested.   So, we don’t know exactly how many vaccinated people are coming down with COVID-19. But we reported in September that a New York Times analysis found that the average vaccinated American’s odds of experiencing a breakthrough infection are roughly 1-in-5,000 a day and 1-in-10,000 in highly vaccinated states.  That analysis relied on data from three places that have reported detailed data on COVID-19 infections according to vaccination status: Utah; Virginia; and King County in Washington state. A Kaiser Family Foundation researcher used CDC data to calculate the chance of a breakthrough case across all jurisdictions. She found the chance from June 20 to July 17 was lower than what the Times had found: about 1-in-5,000 per week, or about 1-in-35,000 per day. Meanwhile, data continue to come in showing how much more dangerous COVID-19 is for the unvaccinated. On Sept. 10, 2021, the CDC analyzed vaccine effectiveness across 13 jurisdictions from April 4 to July 17 and matched that data to vaccine registries from those areas. It found that after delta became the most dominant variant, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected than fully vaccinated people, and more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die.  ""Across 13 U.S. jurisdictions, incidence rate ratios for hospitalization and death changed relatively little after the delta variant reached predominance, suggesting high, continued vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19,"" the report said. In August, we rated  False a claim that ""it is the vaccinated, not the unvaccinated, spreading mutant variants."" We found that the alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants were first detected in unvaccinated populations. We also found that, while research has found that vaccinated people who become infected with COVID-19 are able to transmit the virus, studies also show that unvaccinated people are far more likely to contract and spread the delta variant than vaccinated people. A viral image claimed that ""peak active cases"" of COVID-19 for 2020 vs. 2021 show ""this is not a ‘pandemic of the unvaccinated.'"" ""Peak active cases"" is not a term used by researchers and it was not clear what figures listed in the image were counting. New cases in the U.S. peaked in August 2021, after the more contagious delta variant became predominant. But data show the unvaccinated are far more likely to become infected, and to become hospitalized or die, than the vaccinated.

No evidence of COVID-19 vaccines causing deaths
","UPDATED Sept. 20, 4:15 p.m.: This fact-check was updated to include Facebook's explanation for why the video was not available on the site. The rating is not changed. A 24-minute video that slams celebrities for recommending COVID-19 vaccinations claims the vaccines have killed hundreds of thousands of people. ""You may never trust another celebrity after watching this video,"" the text at the start of the video reads. ""Hundreds of thousands died after taking the advice of these celebrities. Should they be tried for murder? Aiding and abetting mass murder through vaccination, all for population control."" An Aug. 24 post with the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That post was marked on Facebook with, ""This content isn’t available right now,"" after we began work on this fact-check, though the video was still circulating on the Internet. After we published this fact-check, a Facebook spokesperson told us that Facebook ""took down the video for violating our policies against harmful COVID misinformation, specifically for claims that the COVID vaccine is a form of population control."" COVID-19 has killed nearly 675,000 people in the U.S., and more than 4.5 million worldwide. The vaccines authorized in the U.S. have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. And no evidence has established that a COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. caused any deaths, let alone hundreds of thousands.  Benjamin Linas, professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine and associate professor of epidemiology at BU’s  School of Public Health, called the statement misinformation. ""Yes, there are many people — thousands even — who have died within weeks or even days of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. That is because there are hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. and human beings are mortal,"" he said. After the introductory text, the video shows clips of celebrities, including talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, singer Elton John and actors Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, endorsing COVID-19 vaccines.  But most of the video features anti-vaccine clips, including many claiming serious side effects. In one clip, a distressed woman implores people not to take a vaccine, claiming her daughter took the Pfizer vaccine yesterday ""and she’s dead."" We’ve fact-checked some of the claims made in the anti-vaccine clips. We rated False a claim that ""80% of women who have been jabbed have lost their children in the first trimester."" And we rated Pants on Fire a statement that the surge in COVID-19 cases is caused by ""antibody mediated viral enhancement"" from the COVID-19 vaccines. The video does not state where the hundreds of thousands of deaths purportedly linked to the vaccines occurred, but the video includes European as well as American celebrities.  Dr. Matthew Laurens, of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and a CDC spokeswoman said they are not aware of an international database that tracks deaths following COVID-19 vaccinations. The U.S. has its own database, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. VAERS is designed so that any person can report an adverse event that occurs after a vaccination, and anyone can scour the reports. The system helps researchers detect patterns for events that occur after vaccination and that may warrant a closer look. But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere.  The FDA and CDC warn throughout the website that reports on VAERS are not sufficient to prove whether a vaccine caused a particular adverse event, and should not be interpreted that way. Even so, for more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful.  We have debunked multiple claims of COVID-19 ""vaccine deaths"" that misused data from a U.S. database. Here’s what the CDC says about deaths occurring after vaccination: The FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.  More than 380 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Sept. 13, 2021. In that period, VAERS received 7,653 reports of death (0.0020%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.  ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" The CDC has also reported: As of Sept. 8, 2021, VAERS received 1,413 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccine, and the CDC and FDA have confirmed 854 of them. ""CDC and its partners are investigating these reports to assess whether there is a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination."" ""Recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between"" the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and TTS, ""a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths."" A viral video claimed: ""Hundreds of thousands died after taking the advice of these celebrities,"" who are ""aiding and abetting mass murder"" through COVID-19 vaccination. There is no evidence to back the claim. According to the CDC, there is no evidence in the U.S. that the vaccines have caused any deaths, though it is continuing to investigate cases of death that are reported following vaccination.

Congressman half right about Black Hawks left in Afghanistan
","Republicans say the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was so haphazard that it left the Taliban with a weapon only used by 15% of the world’s countries. In a Facebook post on Sept. 1, North Carolina Congressman Richard Hudson posted an image that said the ""Taliban’s new arsenal"" included 33 Black Hawk helicopters, adding:  ""Thanks to President Biden, the Taliban now has more Black Hawk helicopters than 85% of countries in the world.""  Hudson didn’t respond to an email about his post. But he later updated it, saying that social media companies had ""censored this post"" and that ""fact-checkers have disputed the exact dollar amount of equipment left in Afghanistan."" Hudson acknowledged that some of his numbers might be off, but said he wanted to emphasize the poor execution of the withdrawal.  The claim comparing the Taliban’s Black Hawk arsenal to the rest of the world appears to have originated with Congressman Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana. Banks cited the same statistic in a press conference on Aug. 25.  It’s unclear whether the U.S. military left as many as 33 usable Black Hawks behind in Afghanistan.  But even if the Taliban has just one, which reports seem to indicate, the claim that the Taliban has more helicopters than ""85%"" has factual basis. The U.S. military did have 33 operational Black Hawks in Afghanistan as of June 30, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Defense. (They’re also known as UH-60 helicopters) However, as PolitiFact previously reported and as Banks’ office acknowledged, it's unclear how many of the Black Hawks are now in the hands of the Taliban.  Media outlets such as the BBC, NPR and the Washington Post have hesitated to report a specific number of Black Hawks under Taliban control. Meanwhile, one blog run by independent military analysts reports the Taliban seized 18 Black Hawks but that only six are operable. It’s also unclear whether the Taliban has the ability to effectively operate Black Hawk helicopters for warfare.  Bradley Bowman, a former Black Hawk pilot in the Army, told NPR that learning to pilot Black Hawks is ""not something that you can do in a week or a month."" But that obstacle isn’t insurmountable. A bigger problem for the Taliban may be maintaining the Black Hawks, said Jonathan Schroden, the director of the Countering Threats and Challenges Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. Schroden told NPR the Taliban might ""not be able to fix them."" John Pike, a longtime military expert who founded the nonprofit research group GlobalSecurity.org, said the Taliban may have trouble finding pilots, too. ""The Taliban made a practice of assassinating pilots and air crews in recent years and might have some difficulty in tricking them to return to the warm embrace of the Motherland,"" Pike told PolitiFact NC in an email.  ""Pakistan does not fly the UH-60 and so they will be of little help to their puppet regime,"" he continued. ""With few pilots, few maintainers, and no spare parts, the handful of flyable UH-60s will be of little use to the Taliban over the coming months, before they become completely unflyable due to lack of maintenance and spares."" Hudson and Banks both said the Taliban now has more Black Hawk helicopters than 85% of the world’s countries.  Banks defended the figure saying that 85% of the world’s countries don’t have a Black Hawk at all. He cited a page on Black Hawk-builder Lockheed Martin’s website, which says the company supplies the helicopters to 29 countries in the world.  PolitiFact NC called and emailed a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin to see if the company’s website is up to date, but didn’t receive a response. So let’s move forward with the information available and do some math. If there are 195 countries in the world and 29 have Black Hawks, that means 166 of them don’t — which comes out to 85%. That means, if the Taliban has taken even one Black Hawk, they would have more Black Hawks than 85% of the world. And it appears they do. CNN reported the Taliban included a Black Hawk helicopter in a recent air display. Russian media also tweeted a video purporting to show footage of the Taliban flying a Black Hawk. ""The simple math checks out,"" said Mitchell Hailstone, communications director for the Republican Study Committee, which Banks chairs. ""If the Pentagon would tell us how many Black Hawk helicopters the Taliban has in its possession, we’d be able to calculate a more accurate percentage,"" Hailstone said. Hudson’s post said the U.S. military left 33 Black Hawks that are now part of the ""Taliban’s new arsenal,"" and that the group now has more of the helicopters than ""85%"" of all countries. Hudson’s claim about the ""Taliban’s new arsenal"" is based on a report published before the last troops left Afghanistan on Aug. 30. So that may be off. His claim about how the Taliban’s stock of Black Hawks compares to other countries appears to be accurate.  Hudson’s post gets some of the numbers right, but leaves out key context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B46140>],/factchecks/2021/sep/20/richard-hudson/congressman-half-right-about-black-hawks-left-afgh/

John James levels misleading attack on Sen. Gary Peters’ coronavirus response
","A new TV ad from Senate Republican candidate John James attacks incumbent Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., over his response to the coronavirus pandemic. The ad features an elderly patient lying on a hospital bed. Over the sound of a beeping ventilator, the ad’s narrator issues a long list of accusations against Peters: ""He ignored all the warning signs. He downplayed the pandemic. … He failed to lead. Gary Peters leads the committee charged with pandemic response but Peters skipped hearings, blew off reports, downplayed risks."" The ad features a short clip from a Fox News interview on Feb. 12 in which Peters said, ""We think the risk right now to the United States is very low."" The ad comes amid a running political battle over the government’s coronavirus response, with some Democrats accusing Republicans and the Trump administration of downplaying the threat posed by the virus, and Republicans accusing Democrats of hyping the threat to undermine the president ahead of the election. Trump himself has consistently downplayed the virus in public and admitted in a recorded interview to doing so intentionally. Even after contracting the disease, Trump continued to minimize the risk posed by COVID-19. In light of that, we found it curious that James has commended Trump for his response to the pandemic, while faulting Peters for downplaying the risk. We decided to take a closer look at his claims. James is wrong to claim that Peters ""leads the committee charged with pandemic response."" Peters is in the Democratic minority in the Senate and serves as the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who recently tested positive for COVID-19 and opposes mask mandates. James’ campaign cited one hearing and several reports related to pandemics. But we found that those reports came years before the current coronavirus pandemic and were aimed at executive branch officials. Meanwhile, James’ ad leaves out some key facts about Peters’ response to the virus and actions he took well before the outbreak became a global pandemic. When Peters said in mid-February that the virus posed a low risk to the U.S., his assessment aligned with what public health experts were saying at the time, and he joined them in warning that the virus needed to be monitored vigilantly. The interview came several weeks before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on Mar. 11 and President Trump declared a national emergency on Mar. 13. In an email promoting the ad, James’ campaign pointed to oversight and emergency management subcommittee hearings Peters missed in 2015 and 2016, years before the pandemic, to support its claim that Peters ""skipped hearings."" James’ campaign similarly said Peters ""blew off reports,"" citing a number of reports issued before the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. In 2015, his first year in the Senate, Peters attended a homeland security committee hearing on a Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense report calling on the federal government to better prepare for a future global pandemic. By 2020, most of the panel’s recommendations had not been implemented. Other reports showed the federal government did not do enough to prepare for the coronavirus outbreak. These include a July 2016 memo submitted to then-National Security Adviser Susan Rice on lessons learned from the 2014 Ebola outbreak, an October 2016 audit of the Department of Homeland Security’s pandemic planning and a Health and Human Services report issued in October 2019 which found that the department was not ready to serve as the lead federal agency in response to an influenza pandemic. Still, James’ campaign did not provide evidence to substantiate its claims that Peters ""blew off"" the reports or ""failed to act."" The hearing on pandemic preparedness James’ campaign pointed to was held in 2015, before Peters became ranking member of the committee. The bulk of the recommendations presented at that hearing were for the executive branch to implement. What James’ ad doesn’t mention are the actions Peters took at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak to oversee and improve the government’s response, well before global health officials declared it a pandemic. On Jan. 25, four days after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the U.S., Peters claimed in a tweet that the virus posed a public health risk and security threat. ""This is something we have to watch very closely and I’m concerned about it,"" he said in an interview on CNN that day. On Jan. 28, Peters wrote a letter with Johnson asking DHS to share its strategy for responding to the coronavirus. On Feb. 7, Peters, along with three other Democratic senators, wrote a letter to Mick Mulvaney, then director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, urging the Trump administration to fully fund pandemic preparedness and response efforts in its budget for the next fiscal year. The Trump administration had repeatedly proposed cuts to such programs in its previous budgets. On Feb. 12, Peters helped convene a panel of public health and security experts to discuss whether the U.S. was prepared to confront a global coronavirus pandemic. ""I don’t think we’re alarmed at this point, but we need to be leaning in to what will the next step be if we can’t contain it,"" said panelist Julie Gerberding, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Peters echoed this point in his Fox News interview later that day when he said, ""We think the risk right now to the United States is very low, but we have to keep our eye on it."" His assessment aligned with what public health experts were saying at the time, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Ten days after Peters’ interview, Fauci told CNN’s Michael Smerconish: ""At this particular moment, Michael, the risk is very low. But — and I have to underline ‘but’ — this could change and it could change rapidly."" Peters also signed on to a Feb. 13 letter calling for the appointment of a senior global health security expert to coordinate the United States’ global health security work. After the head of global health security on the White House’s National Security Council was removed in May 2018, the Trump administration left the position vacant. ""As Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Gary Peters not only sounded the alarm long before the pandemic but has battled to get Michiganders the relief and resources they need throughout this crisis,"" Peters for Michigan Communications Director Vanessa Valdivia wrote in an email denouncing James’ ad. James’ ad claims that Peters ""downplayed the pandemic"" and ""failed to act."" That’s not accurate. Peters’ assessment in mid-February that the coronavirus posed a low risk to the U.S., but needed to be monitored carefully, squared with what public health experts were saying. Starting Jan. 28 — a week after the first U.S. COVID-19 case was confirmed — Peters took a series of actions to press administration officials on their preparations to deal with a potential outbreak.  We rate James’ claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C62F00>],/factchecks/2020/oct/08/john-james/james-ad-peters-coronavirus-response-misleading/
"['Michigan', 'Haley Stevens']","
Haley Stevens’ ad gets details on ACA repeal wrong
","Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., seeking re-election in Michigan’s traditionally Republican 11th congressional district, is attacking her challenger, Eric Esshaki, over how his opposition to the Affordable Care Act would affect Michiganders hit by COVID-19. ""Esshaki supports a dangerous health care plan that would allow insurance companies to kick people with a preexisting condition off their plans in the middle of a pandemic, including over 100,000 Michiganders who have survived COVID-19,"" a Stevens ad claims. What is the purportedly ""dangerous healthcare plan"" that Esshaki supports? Like many Republicans, Esshaki, a former nurse and lawyer, has vowed to support fully repealing the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which bars insurance companies from discriminating against people with a preexisting health condition in both enrollment and pricing. The law is now facing a Supreme Court challenge backed by the Trump administration, and Democrats running for Congress this fall have hammered Republicans over the potential threat to those protections in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic recession. Stevens’ ad predicts that if the ACA is repealed by Congress or overturned by the Supreme Court, insurance companies would be free to designate coronavirus infections as a preexisting condition and restrict or deny coverage for those infected. But Stevens’ claim exaggerates the potential impact by citing the roughly 100,000 Michiganders who have survived COVID-19, because not all of them have insurance through the individual market. Most people who are currently covered by job-based programs, or through Medicaid or Medicare, for example, would not be at risk of suddenly losing their coverage if insurers designate COVID-19 a preexisting condition. A different story would play out for Michiganders who may lose or change jobs amid the recession if the ACA is repealed or overturned. They could be subject to discrimination based on a preexisting condition in the individual insurance market or temporarily excluded from a job-based group plan.    In 2018, 51% of Michiganders were insured through their employer, 22% through Medicaid, 15% through Medicare and 5% through individual insurance plans, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. For years, Republicans have promised to replace the ACA with a law that maintains protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, but a plan that guarantees the same level of protection has never materialized. The ACA’s original protections were made possible by a complex system of mandates and subsidies designed to stabilize the individual insurance market. ""In a voluntary insurance market that is not subsidized, there is a powerful and innate need for insurers to avoid the highest-cost people,"" says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""There’s always this powerful incentive to compete on the basis of cherry-picking."" Ahead of the August primary, Essahki committed to waiting to repeal the law until one that protects coverage of preexisting conditions is enacted and said he opposes Republican efforts to repeal the ACA without a replacement. In an email to PolitiFact Michigan, Esshaki called Stevens a ""scaremonger"" who ""fabricates attacks."" Stevens’ campaign called Esshaki one in a ""long line of Washington Republicans who promise to conjure up a brand new plan to protect people with preexisting conditions, even though we all know the new plan is never coming."" President Donald Trump has not presented a Republican-backed health plan, despite repeated promises to do so. Republicans in the current Congress have also been unable to come together behind a major plan. Esshaki has not endorsed any specific replacement plan or released a detailed vision for an alternative.  The ACA prohibits health insurers from denying coverage to people with a preexisting condition or charging them more. Stevens predicts that with the ACA gone, insurers would designate coronavirus infection as a preexisting condition and restrict coverage accordingly. That could happen unless states act to protect those infected with coronavirus from discrimination, but it wouldn’t mean every Michigander who has survived COVID-19 would be kicked off their plans as Stevens claims. The most recent data shows just under 100,000 people in Michigan have recovered from COVID-19. These people are likely covered through a variety of health insurance plans: insurance they purchased through the individual marketplace, job-based group health plans, Medicaid and Medicare. Repealing the ACA would affect each of these groups differently, but it’s the people in the individual market whose coverage is most at risk. Before the ACA was enacted, insurers in the individual market regularly discriminated against people with preexisting conditions, such as arthritis, asthma, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes. That discrimination could resume if the ACA were repealed or overturned without an equivalent replacement. If COVID-19 is designated a preexisting condition, infected people could be denied coverage or charged higher premiums in the individual market. But people already insured through a job-based group health plan wouldn’t be affected the same way, because they had some protections under federal law even before the ACA. Before the ACA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act required insurers selling policies in the group market to cover everyone regardless of a group member’s health status. While people currently insured through a job-based group health plan would not be kicked off their plans, new employees enrolling in a job-based program could be denied coverage if the ACA’s strengthened protections are taken away. Under HIPAA, people newly enrolling in a job-based group health plan could be denied coverage for up to a year if they had a preexisting condition that was diagnosed or treated in the previous six months.   That means that a new enrollee in a job-based group health plan who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last six months could be denied coverage for up to a year, according to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, the federal- and state-funded plan for low-income people, do not discriminate on the basis of preexisting conditions in coverage or price. However, if the ACA is repealed or overturned, adults who have gained Medicaid coverage through the program’s expansion under the ACA could lose coverage and be forced to turn to the individual market, where they would be subject to discrimination based on preexisting conditions. A Haley Stevens campaign ad says her challenger, Eric Esshaki, supports a plan that would allow insurers to kick over 100,000 COVID-19 survivors in Michigan off their health care plans. Stevens cites Esshaki’s support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which includes protections for preexisting conditions. But Esshaki has called for waiting to repeal the ACA until there’s a replacement that maintains those protections. Stevens’ ad also assumes that all Michiganders who have survived COVID-19 would be affected in the same way — and lose their coverage — if the ACA were repealed or overturned. That’s not the case. People in the individual insurance market would be most at risk if insurers designate coronavirus infections as a preexisting condition. But the effect on people covered by job-based group plans, Medicare or Medicaid would be more limited. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809757C940>],/factchecks/2020/oct/08/haley-stevens/haley-stevens-ad-gets-details-aca-repeal-wrong/

Trump falsely claims Democrats want to ‘shut your churches down’
","As he spent the day at the White House, tweeting and recovering from COVID-19, President Donald Trump claimed Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to target Christians. ""DEMS WANT TO SHUT YOUR CHURCHES DOWN, PERMANENTLY,"" he tweeted Oct. 7. ""HOPE YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. VOTE NOW!"" (Screenshot from Twitter) The president’s post was a quote tweet of Cliff Maloney, president of Young Americans for Liberty, a libertarian nonprofit organization. The original post included a video that Maloney said shows a man ""being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services."" Worshipers can be heard singing in the background. ""This is one of the most heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen,"" Maloney said in the Sept. 24 tweet. But the man pictured in the video was not arrested for holding a church service. He was arrested on suspicion of resisting or obstructing police. The Associated Press reported Sept. 24 that three people were arrested in Moscow, Idaho, after a church held a ""maskless psalm singing event in a city hall parking lot."" The event, which nearly 200 people attended, violated a town face mask and social distancing order aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Ben Zornes, a pastor at Christ Church and the organizer of the protest, told the Moscow-Pullman Daily News that the event was aimed at criticizing the order. Five people were issued citations for violating it, and three of them were arrested for allegedly resisting officers. We reached out to the White House and Trump’s re-election campaign for additional evidence, but we haven’t heard back. Democrats are not calling for churches to be permanently closed.  Many states — including those governed by Republicans — have required residents to wear face coverings in public, banned large gatherings and ordered non-essential businesses to close. Some states exempted churches from their coronavirus restrictions. Trump’s tweet is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

No, the Rock didn’t lose millions of followers after publicly announcing his support for Biden
","At the end of September, Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson took to his social media accounts to endorse Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Sen. Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 3 election. The move prompted both support and outrage from his millions of followers, and also inspired some questionable online claims. ""The Rock has lost 48 million followers on his IG and YouTube after coming out for Biden,"" one Oct. 2 Facebook post reads.

PolitiFact reviewed news stories and websites that track social media analytics and follower counts and found Johnson didn’t lose anywhere near 48 million followers after his announcement. Instagram followers On Instagram, Johnson gained about 196,000 followers the day he posted his endorsement and his conversation with Biden and Harris, according to Trackalytics, a website that provides free social media and website analytics.  Social Blade, another website that tracks user statistics on various social media platforms, shows a smaller gain, but still a gain — about 95,000 followers the day he posted the video.  Neither website shows Johnson losing more than about 30,000 Instagram followers in any single day of the week, Sept. 27  to Oct. 4, following his endorsement of Biden and Harris. We also found a story about Johnson’s experience with coronavirus that mentioned he had 196 million Instagram followers at the beginning of September. Johnson now has more than 200 million followers on Instagram, and had 199 million followers by Oct. 1. Even if Johnson’s endorsement of the Democrats had prompted a mass unfollowing of his account, he seems to have had a net gain of around 3 million followers during September. YouTube followers On YouTube, Johnson’s following is less strong, but there’s still no indication that he hemorrhaged millions of followers or subscribers after announcing his support for Biden. At the start of September, his channel had 5.27 million subscribers, according to an archived version of the channel from Sept. 1. The day before his announcement, that had increased to 5.32 million subscribers.  Johnson had 5.35 million subscribers on YouTube as of Oct. 6.  Overall, he gained subscribers since endorsing Biden and Harris. Social Blade’s statistics for The Rock’s YouTube channel are less detailed than the Instagram stats, but they also indicate an overall gain of about 60,000 subscribers over the last 30 days.

 Four years later, there’s still no evidence to support Pizzagate theory
","On Oct. 7, 2016, WikiLeaks published the hacked emails of John Podesta, then the campaign chairman for former Secretary of State and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  There is no evidence to support the allegation that Clinton and Podesta were involved in sex-trafficking children, or that there’s a child sex-trafficking ring.  The claim stems from an email exchange about a fundraiser at Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in September 2008, when Barack Obama was seeking the presidential nomination. People started to peddle the baseless idea that Podesta’s use of the word ""pizza"" was code for pedophilia, and that Comet Ping Pong had secret rooms where Clinton and confidantes kidnapped and imprisoned children to be sexually abused, tortured, or sacrificed for Satan. Believers started to refer to the conspiracy theory as Pizzagate. In November 2016, BuzzFeed News published a story investigating how the theory spread.

Yes, Wisconsin legislators haven’t passed a bill in 6 months
","The stalemate between a Democratic governor and a Republican-dominated Legislature has left Wisconsin without a clear path forward to address the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Tony Evers has declared multiple states of emergency to implement a stay-at-home order and mask mandates. Republicans — who have a stranglehold on both Legislative houses — have challenged those in court, once successfully. But they have chosen not to overturn Evers’ orders themselves, despite having the authority to do so. One viral Facebook post goes a step farther to say Republican legislators haven’t done anything at all of late. ""Wisconsin Republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months,"" says the Oct. 4, 2020, post, which is a screenshot of a tweet from the day before. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The post goes on to criticize Republicans for pushing back against Evers, saying they haven’t ""done a single thing"" to slow the spread of COVID. (That’s not accurate, as Republicans did pass a COVID-19 relief bill early in the pandemic.) But let’s focus in on the timeframe claim.  Amid a global pandemic that has fundamentally changed society throughout 2020, has the Legislature really not passed a single bill in half a year? The most recent law passed through the state Legislature came in April. The Assembly passed a COVID-19 response bill on April 14, and the Senate passed it a day later. The wide-ranging bill addressed unemployment, health care, education and government procedures in the wake of the pandemic, many provisions of which applied only during the first public health emergency that was declared by Evers in March. That was more than five and a half months before this Facebook post. So the reference to six months is pretty much correct. The Legislature has taken up no legislation since then. The only other action came Aug. 31, when legislative leaders held a pro-forma special session for a less than a minute without addressing police use-of-force legislation that Evers urged them to take up. The context But let’s take a little wider view before we rule on this claim. The Legislature is a cyclical body, and a lengthy period of inaction this time of year is actually normal. The Legislature typically adjourns in spring of an election year and doesn’t come back until the new calendar year, and the 2020 calendar approved for this year back in January 2019 was no different. Of course, this year is anything but normal. So a better gauge may be how other state Legislatures have responded to the coronavirus. And Wisconsin lawmakers have been among the least active in the country, according to a database of all COVID-related legislation across the country maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures. The bill passed in mid-April is the lone piece of coronavirus legislation adopted or enacted here, as nine other proposals failed. Only three states have done less, as North Dakota, Texas and Montana have passed no bills. Indiana has also passed one. Nationally, 810 COVID bills have been adopted or enacted by state legislatures, led by 71 in Louisiana, 51 in California and 50 in New Jersey. In many respects, it would be fair to hold Wisconsin to a higher standard of action, since it has a full-time Legislature. The national conference says Wisconsin is one of 10 states it considers full-time, meaning legislators work 80% or more of a full-time job, have large staffs and are paid enough to make a living without needing outside income. A Wispolitics.com analysis found Wisconsin has done far less than the other nine during the pandemic. The Assembly and Senate have met just twice since the pandemic began — for each house to pass the April COVID bill. The other states have met an average of 38 times, with only Illinois (nine meetings) coming in at less than 20. It’s important to note, however, that seven of the nine other full-time legislatures are in states with an annual budget (as opposed to Wisconsin’s biennial budget), meaning they need more floor sessions to pass that each year. Kit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, noted that while the Legislature has not been in session, legislators have other work as well. In the past six months she said legislators have worked to help constituents with issues like getting unemployment benefits and have continued to meet in committees to prepare future legislation. A viral Facebook post says, ""Wisconsin Republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months,"" criticizing a lack of legislative action amid the coronavirus pandemic. The timeframe is largely accurate. It’s been more than five and a half months since the Legislature passed any bill. It’s not unusual in an election year for the Legislature to adjourn from spring until the new year. But the Wisconsin Legislature’s inaction is unusual for this year, as lawmakers have done less than almost any other state to address the pandemic despite being one of just 10 full-time legislatures in the nation. That makes this a reasonable statement. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EB4B80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/07/facebook-posts/yes-wisconsin-legislators-havent-passed-bill-6-mon/

No evidence Kamala Harris backs tax to pay for slavery reparations
","On the day of the only scheduled vice presidential debate for 2020, a Facebook post attacking Sen. Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s running mate, was shared widely. Alluding to compensation for slavery, the Sept. 25 claim read: ""GET READY TO PAY A FEDERAL TAX ON YOUR HOME FOR REPARATIONS!!, YES!!, KAMALA HARRIS SAID THAT!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Harris — the first Black woman and first person of Indian descent to be on a major-party presidential ticket in the United States — has stated her support for studying reparations, but has stopped short of endorsing direct payments. We found no evidence that she has supported any tax for reparations. Since 1989, Democrats have introduced bills that call for studying reparations for African Americans to address the nation’s legacy of slavery. House leaders have said they expect to pass this year, for the first time, a proposal creating a federal commission to craft an official government apology and remedy plan. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, supports a study. Black Americans constitute about 13% to 14% of the nation’s population, but own less than 3% of the nation’s wealth, according to testimony to a House committee given in 2019 by William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy and African American studies at Duke University. ""Reparations designated specifically for Black American descendants of slavery must be enacted"" to move Black wealth roughly, from less than $3 trillion to between $13 trillion and $14 trillion, he said. Before ending her own run for the Democratic presidential nomination in December 2019, Harris, a California senator, supported studying reparations. But she did not call for them to take the form of payments. We looked through her interviews and comments she made during her campaign and found no statements from her in support of direct payments or a tax on homes to fund such payments. Asked in a February 2019 interview if Black people should get reparations, Harris said: ""I think there has to be some form of reparations, and we can discuss what that is."" In another February 2019 interview, she cited a proposal to help families generally, saying: ""I’m proposing the LIFT Act. Give people who are making $100,000 or less as a family a tax credit, which will benefit and uplift 60% of Black families who are in poverty."" An interviewer in March 2019 noted that Harris had floated the idea of mental-health funding as a form of reparations. Harris again steered away from direct payments: ""I think that the word, the term reparations, it means different things to different people,"" she said. ""But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention, to correct course."" In April 2019, Harris said in response to a question that if elected president, she would sign a bill to study paying reparations. In an August 2019 interview, Harris repeated her support for a study, but said: ""If we're talking about writing a check, I don't think it is that simple. And frankly, I don't support an idea or a notion that after all this, we're going to say, 'OK, I'm going to write you a check, and then be quiet.' Because that won't solve the problem, which is the systemic issues that are present and will continue to exist.""

Trump was triumphant after leaving the hospital, but he didn’t say this about COVID-19
","President Donald Trump isn’t afraid of hyperbole. But if a recent statement attributed to the president sounds like something you’d hear from actor Alec Baldwin as he impersonates Trump on ""Saturday Night Live,"" that’s because it’s a fake quote.  ""The doctors said they’ve never seen a body kill the coronavirus like my body,"" reads the text over an image of Trump speaking. ""They tested my DNA and it wasn’t DNA. It was USA."" A post sharing the image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Searching for the quote on Google we only found two pages of results, none of them credible sources to support that Trump said this.  Trump did appear triumphant after he left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he had been receiving treatment for COVID-19, removing his mask as he stood on the balcony after returning to the White House. He tweeted that he felt ""better than I did 20 years ago!"" ""Feeling really good!"" he tweeted. ""Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.""  But there’s no evidence he said doctors found ""USA"" instead of DNA in his cells. Trump has not said ""DNA"" since Jan. 6, 2020, while chatting with Rush Limbaugh, according to Factba.se, which maintains an archive of Trump’s tweets and transcripts of his interviews and speeches.

No evidence Christie told Trump to exploit Biden’s stutter
","Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie spent several days helping President Donald Trump prepare for the presidential debate. A quote attributed to the Republican politician that has since emerged offers one tip — exploit Democratic presidential nominee’s stutter.   ""People who overcome stuttering have a harder time maintaining their train of thought when interrupted,"" reads the statement that’s circulating on social media. ""Keep interrupting him and he’ll stumble when he tries to speak. This will enforce the ‘senile’ narrative.""  But Christie says he never said this.  Posts sharing the quote were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  One post that shared the quote refers to a post in a forum on Democratic Underground as a source. In the forum, someone shared a screenshot of a grammatically problematic tweet that said: ""VP Joe Biden has a speech impediment and Christie told Trump to interrupt him as much as possible, hoping Biden will be loose his cool."" It wasn’t the only account to make that claim. CNN anchor Jake Tapper shared another on Oct. 6 with a caveat.  ""I asked Gov Christie about this viral tweet and he says it’s ‘completely false’ and that Biden’s stutter ‘never came up as a subject’ in debate prep,"" Tapper tweeted. Some users chided Tapper for taking Christie at his word but others expressed bewilderment — they couldn’t find an original, credible source supporting the claim that he actually said this.  Neither could we. We found multiple social media posts sharing the statement, but nothing to corroborate them.  On ABC News after the presidential debate on Sept. 29, Christie said the plan was for Trump to be aggressive but that it was ""hotter than it was planned to be"" and that he could ""potentially turn that heat down"" going forward. Christie also addressed Biden’s performance, and he said that he thought Trump’s interruptions ""saved him"" at times when Biden was ""not seeming on the ball, getting numbers wrong, wandering in mid-sentence, not being able to finish thoughts."" Still, there’s no record of Christie giving the advice that we could only trace to posts on social media and an online forum.

Donald Trump’s false claim that COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu
","President Donald Trump’s fight with COVID-19 has left him striking a defiant tone. When he headed back to the White House from the hospital, he advised people on Twitter, ""Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life."" He followed that up with another tweet the next morning. ""Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,"" he wrote Oct. 6. ""Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!"" Twitter has now flagged that tweet for ""sharing misleading and potentially harmful information"" about COVID-19. For the same reason, a similar post from Trump on Facebook was taken down completely.  In the U.S. so far this year, about 210,000 people have died from COVID-19. Trump’s figure for the number of people who have died from seasonal flu is wrong on its face, and distorts the government’s actual estimates. For the worst season this decade — 2017-18 — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the death toll at 61,000. Taking into account uncertainties in reporting flu deaths, the CDC offered a range of 46,000 to 95,000 deaths. But the more typical range is significantly lower. The average number of deaths per year over the past decade has been 35,900. And even taking the high-end of the range for each year, the average is 51,800. That’s half Trump’s number. Infectious disease researcher Marm Kilpatrick at University of California Santa Cruz said one has to go back to 1968 to find a seasonal death toll of 100,000 — and that was when a brand new strain emerged. Trump also said that for ""most populations,"" COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu. That’s also wrong, but it reflects that the patterns for the two diseases are different. The CDC reports that flu is most deadly for children and the elderly. The CDC said that ""the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19."" Broadly, for people of all ages who show flu symptoms, the CDC data shows a death rate of about 0.1%. Given that the CDC says only about half of all flu infections lead to symptoms, the actual infection fatality rate could be in the range of 0.05%. Data on COVID-19 remains a moving target, and current estimates should be seen in that light. Using the CDC’s age-specific data on COVID-19, and the U.S. age distribution, Kilpatrick estimated the infection death rate for COVID-19 is about 0.7%. That’s in the ballpark of other estimates, and would make the coronavirus more than 10 times more deadly than the flu. Drilling into the details for different age groups, Kilpatrick cautioned that the data is still emerging. But he said the best comparison he’s found of the death rates among age groups for COVID-19 and the seasonal flu comes from independent researcher Marc Bevand. Bevand drew on 13 studies of COVID-19 and the CDC’s influenza data. In every age group over the age of 30, COVID-19 was more deadly than the flu. For people in their 30s, COVID-19 was 2.9 times more deadly. For those in their 70s, it was 14.4 times deadlier. The CDC doesn’t provide an apples-to-apples comparison of flu and COVID-19 deaths by age. It currently estimates that the COVID-19 death rate ranges from .003% for children and teens to 5.4% for people 70 and up.  We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Trump said that more than 100,000 people die from the flu and ""in most populations, COVID-19 is far less lethal."" In the past decade, the average yearly death toll from the flu has been 35,900. About 50 years ago, 100,000 people died one year, but that was an anomaly. Overall, the data show that COVID-19 is more deadly than the flu. By one estimate, it is 10 times more deadly. Comparing death rates for age groups is more challenging, but the data shows that for everyone over 30, COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu.

Most high-risk counties in Missouri don’t have mask mandates, despite Parson’s claim
","Missouri Gov. Mike Parson’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been under fire lately after he and his wife tested positive for the virus on Sept. 23. His Democratic opponent, Nicole Galloway, has criticized his refusal to impose a statewide mandate requiring Missourians to wear a face mask in public, something Parson has claimed is unnecessary outside the major cities. He’s opted instead to encourage masks. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains that wearing a mask is a proven way to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. In an Aug. 18 press conference, Parson said: ""All Missouri’s high-risk areas have mask mandates in place."" He repeated the claim two days later.  We don’t have a great idea of what he meant by high risk. However, many of the counties and municipalities in the state that don’t have mask mandates have been deemed ""red zones"" — the most severe rating — by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The White House Coronavirus Task Force regularly sends reports to governors about the current state of the pandemic. While those are not publicly released, journalists have obtained several of them over the past few months. In its Aug. 9 report, issued nine days before Parson's press conference, the task force categorized 15 Missouri counties in the ""red zone"" due to their high amounts of new cases, their increasing positivity rates — the percentage of tests that come back positive — and other data.  We examined health department websites and media archives for each county to see whether a mask mandate was reported. Of those 15 counties, 12 did not list any mask mandate or expressly stated there was no mask order. Taney, Nodoway and Newton counties had mandates. The red zones have grown since Parson’s comment. The task force’s Aug. 30 report, issued 12 days after the press conference, categorized 32 Missouri counties in the ""red zone,"" 28 of which did not and still do not have mask mandates in the county. The outlook has gotten worse since then. In the most recently released report dated Sept. 27, the task force listed 48 different counties in the ""red zone."" Of those, 42 counties had no mandates. These ""red-zone"" counties without a mask mandate range from suburban areas such as Jefferson County outside of St. Louis to mid-sized cities like Joplin in Newton and Jasper counties to rural areas such as Miller County. A representative from Parson’s office, Kelli Jones, declined to comment on what exactly the governor meant by ""high-risk."" She instead provided a statement that said, ""Governor Parson has encouraged, recommended, and reminded every Missourian to social distance, wear a mask, and wash his or her hands to protect themselves and others, no matter where they live."" Red is the most severe of the five ratings the task force gives out — the ratings are red, orange, yellow, light green and dark green. ""The red indicates it’s an alarming upsurge in cases,"" said public health expert Lynelle Phillips. ""They’re definitely going in the wrong direction."" Phillips is a professor at the University of Missouri School of Health Professions and a former public health advisor to the CDC. She is also vice president of the Missouri State Public Health Association. Phillips said that when assessing the COVID-19 risk of an area, the most important factors to look at are the number of new cases per 100,000 people, the positivity rate and the weekly changes in those two numbers. Counties in the red zone all have more than 100 new cases per 100,000 residents and a 0.6% or more increase in test positivity. ""The areas that are experiencing an upsurge in cases right now do not have a local mask mandate,"" Phillips said. She said that the areas with a mask mandate are doing better than those without. She noted how Saint Louis and Kansas City have moved to the yellow and orange zones respectively in the Sept. 27 report. She pointed out that in Columbia — which enacted a mandate in July — and other cities with mandates, people are now used to wearing a mask. In all three of the reports we mentioned and several of its other reports, the White House Coronavirus Task Force recommended Missouri enact a state-level mask mandate of some kind. Parson said in August: ""All Missouri’s high-risk areas have mask mandates in place."" It was not true when he made the claim in mid-August, and it is not true now. At the time, 12 of the 15 highest risk counties in the state had no mandates. The trend continues.

Biden inflated the number of clemency actions by Obama
","During a town hall in Miami, NBC’s Lester Holt asked former Vice President Joe Biden about the Obama administration’s record on criminal justice reform. Holt said that President Donald Trump and Biden’s critics will say that Biden had almost 50 years in government and wasn’t able to accomplish criminal justice reform including when the Obama/Biden administration had a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress.  Biden pushed back with a defense of the Obama/Biden administration’s efforts related to criminal justice. ""Yeah, we did. 18,000 people got clemency,"" Biden said. ""He got two or three, what he's talking about."" We thought the 18,000 clemency figure for Obama sounded high based on our fact-check of a Facebook post comparing the pardon records of Obama and Trump. It was. We asked the Biden campaign about what he was referring to when he said ""he got two or three."" The Biden campaign didn’t reply to our questions seeking clarification. Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution says the president ""shall have the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.""  The general term for these presidential actions is clemency, but there are two types. A pardon, described as an ""expression of the President’s forgiveness,"" is issued after a person’s conviction or after a person’s sentence has been completed. It restores rights, such as the right to vote or run for office. A commutation reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, but it does not remove the conviction. Over his two terms, Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, for a total of 1,927 acts of clemency, according to federal Department of Justice data. The Biden campaign said he misspoke and meant to say about 1,800, but instead said 18,000.  Trump has taken 38 clemency actions during his nearly four years in office, according to data through Sept. 8. Experts previously told us that Obama followed a policy of clemency actions aimed at low-level criminals who were given long sentences many years ago, and he followed recommendations made by the Justice Department. Trump has largely acted on his own based on recommendations from friends, celebrities, media personalities and business colleagues. In July, the White House announced that Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone on charges stemming from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. Trump’s announcement occurred days before Stone was set to begin a 40-month prison sentence. In announcing Trump’s clemency actions in February, the White House cited the election of Edward DeBartolo Jr. to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as an NFL team owner and his charitable contributions; called Michael Milken one of America’s greatest financiers and noted his philanthropic work; and praised former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for tutoring and mentoring fellow prisoners. (You can read more about their crimes here.) Trump has taken some steps toward criminal justice reform. In December 2018, Trump signed the First Step Act of 2018, which the Washington Post described as ""the most far-reaching overhaul of the criminal justice system in a generation.""  RELATED: Super Bowl Ad Watch: Trump on criminal justice reform Biden said that during the Obama/Biden administration ""18,000 people ... got clemency.""
