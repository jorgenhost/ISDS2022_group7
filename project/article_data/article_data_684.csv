No, millions of Chinese didn’t convert to Islam seeking coronavirus immunity
","Amid fears about the coronavirus disease, a YouTube video offers a novel way to inoculate yourself: convert to Islam.  ""20m Chinese gets converted to Islam after it is proven that corona virus did not affect the Muslims,"" reads the title of a video posted online Feb. 18.

Video footage shows Bernie Sanders talking about racial stereotypes — not making racist comments
","As U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has tightened his hold on frontrunner status for the Democratic presidential nomination, having clinched the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 23, his detractors have tapped into an archive of video footage from the longtime lawmaker’s career.   ""Here are the videos Bernie DOESN’T want you to see,"" reads the description of a video posted to Facebook on Feb. 19.  It starts by showing what looks like an old clip of Sanders speaking to a class of middle-school children.  ""What we learned is that black people smell,"" he says. ""All right, what about Jewish people? … How are they different than other people? Their religious beliefs were different but also they were greedy and selfish people, also had strange sexual habits so forth and so on. What does everybody know about the Irish? They …"" A student offers: ""Get in fights?"" ""Get in fights because they’re drunk,"" Sanders says. ""All the Irish people do is drink. That’s the Irish. All Italians are gangsters, and Irish are drunk, and Jews are greedy, and black people smell. OK?"" Not OK.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The footage of Sanders is authentic, but it’s been edited to appear that he is offering his derogatory opinions on black, Italian, Irish and Jewish people. (For the record, Sanders is Jewish.) The clips featured in the Facebook post are from a television show called ""Bernie Speaks with the Community"" that Sanders hosted on a public access channel when he was the mayor of Burlington, Vt. In episode 39 of the show, which aired on Dec. 4, 1987, Sanders discusses racial stereotypes and the importance of humanizing people who are different from you with a group of schoolchildren. One student talks about how black people were dehumanized during slavery.  ""What you’re getting at is a word that I will use: stereotype,"" Sanders replies. ""What does the word stereotype mean in the context that you’re talking about it?""  After fielding a few answers from the class, Sanders says: ""If you want to deal with a group of people, essentially if you want to do bad things to them, you do, what I call, dehumanize them. You make them less than human beings. And what you do therefore is you develop a stereotypical image of them. A stereotype. … What about black people? What’s the stereotype that we know about black people? … When I was a young person, what we learned is that black people smell. They had a special odor. That was what went all around, that black people smelled and that they were pretty stupid. Over the course of the nearly hourlong segment, Sanders engages with the class, asking questions, listening to the students’ answers and sharing his own experiences. Within the scope of the show, it’s clear that he’s criticizing racial stereotypes, not professing them as his own opinions about Italians, Irish, Jews and others. But that context does not appear in the seconds of footage that appears on Facebook. ""The Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah covered the comments in May 2019 after the public access channel released recordings of Sanders’ show. On YouTube, the Daily Show describes Sanders as ""giving Vermont children head-scratching lessons on stereotypes.""  Our ruling A video shared on Facebook appears to show Sanders on a TV show making derogatory remarks about Italians, Irish, Jews and blacks.  The video was heavily edited to create a false impression. On the show, Sanders was discussing the impact of racial stereotypes with a group of children.

"['Health Check', 'Pete Buttigieg']","
Past as prologue: Questioning Buttigieg’s claim about keeping your health care
","As the Democratic presidential campaign moves to the battleground of South Carolina this weekend, candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is highlighting his health plan as he seeks to slow the momentum of the front-runner, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In a video ad airing across the state, Buttigieg argues that his health plan — called ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" — offers Americans their choice of insurance plans, in a way he says Sanders’ more sweeping ""Medicare for All"" plan does not. The Sanders plan would eliminate private insurance and move everyone into a government-run program. Under Buttigieg’s proposal, the ad says, ""Everyone gets access to Medicare, if they choose."" Specifically, according to campaign documents, people or employers could buy into a government-provided health plan, which the campaign says would provide an ""affordable, comprehensive alternative"" to what is sold on the private market. But, the voiceover adds, ""if you like your private plan, you can keep it."" This isn’t the first time a politician has made such a promise. Arguing in favor of the Affordable Care Act, then-President Barack Obama repeatedly said the health law would let people keep their private health plans, if they liked them. That didn’t pan out: Millions of Americans’ plans were canceled, spawning months of controversy. In 2013, PolitiFact rated Obama’s statement the ""Lie of the Year."" With that context, we decided to look deeper at Buttigieg’s remark. We reached out to his campaign but never heard back. An uncertain market Experts we talked to said the former mayor’s remark is remarkably similar to Obama’s ― right down to the pitfalls it encounters. Those policy analysts said Buttigieg is trying to differentiate his plan from Sanders’ sweeping proposal, arguing his offering is more moderate than Sanders’ and preserves choice. He suggests many Americans would be able to pick between buying private insurance or opting into the government plan. But does that mean that if you like your plan, you can keep it? As the Obama White House learned, not necessarily. ""It’s like déjà vu all over again,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The problem is that private insurance availability isn’t up to the government. To be sure, state and federal regulators have the power to dictate, for example, the inclusion of certain benefits and to set basic consumer protections. But the government cannot specifically require insurance companies to offer plans, and any carrier has the option to stop providing coverage. Already, market forces dictate what health insurance is available from year to year. For example, negotiations between an insurer and physicians could mean that an insurer drops doctors from its network. Changing profit margins could drive a private carrier to exit a certain market. An employer looking to trim expenses might decide to change health insurers, changing coverage offerings for employees. Buttigieg’s health plan — which would more generously subsidize people buying private insurance than the ACA does and create a public health insurance option that individuals and employers could buy ― wouldn’t change any of those economic scenarios. ""When you have private plans offered and sold by private companies, those private companies are going to make business decisions that might affect your coverage,"" Corlette said. ""They can opt to get out of the business."" That’s been especially clear in the ACA individual marketplace. In many counties, only one private insurer sells coverage on the marketplace. It’s impossible to predict, but a competing public option might change the financial incentives for those plans and push some of those carriers to abandon the exchange. If that happened, people using that plan would lose the insurance they have, regardless of how they feel about it. Put more forcefully, ""There’s no way the government can guarantee a private plan will continue, without mandating it will,"" said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. So, she added, suggesting that people who like their private plans will have the option to keep them under Buttigieg’s proposal is ""probably not true."" (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) The employer question This is especially the case when it comes to the nearly 160 million people who get their insurance from an employer. Already, that group experiences volatility when it comes to their health insurance. In 2019, 53% of employers providing coverage considered changing the plan or the carrier they offered, according to a KFF survey. Of that group, almost a fifth — 18% ― ultimately did change insurance carriers. That flux would likely increase under a plan like Buttigieg’s. Already, many employers (particularly smaller ones) indicate frustration with providing a health benefit that is increasingly complex and expensive. If a public option were cheaper, more might shift employees into that pool, dropping private insurance. ""Even if you don’t want the public option, your employer might decide that they do,"" Cox said. How big the change would be is difficult to gauge. It depends, for instance, on how generous the public option is, how much it costs employers and whether current private insurance trends continue. Still, ""any change you make to the health care environment would cause changes to reverberate throughout the system,"" said Sherry Glied, a health economist and dean of New York University’s Wagner School of Public Service. ""Any government action will cause change to happen more than they would otherwise."" It’s worth noting that many people may not be affected. Under the ACA, for instance, 4 million lost their plans, or fewer than 2% of all people who had coverage. Most people who move from private insurance to the public option would likely have better benefits, said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But, some would be unhappy to lose the existing, private coverage that they know. ""The more accurate soundbite would be most people with private insurance would be able to keep it,"" he added. ""That would beg the question of who isn’t included there — and the answer is, we don’t know."" And, in contrast with Sanders’ Medicare for All single-payer proposal, Buttigieg’s plan would preserve much of the current private insurance. But Buttigieg suggests that Medicare for All Who Want It — if administered well — could function as a ""glide path"" to a Medicare for All world, eventually bringing everyone into the public system. ""There’s good reason to think some of the private insurance competition won’t fare well against ‘Medicare for All Who Want It,’ "" Sommers said. ""You might see some of the private plans dropping out. And that may be a sign the policy is working."" Our ruling In a new campaign ad, Buttigieg claims that under his proposal to overhaul the health care system, ""if you like your private plan, you can keep it."" This may be true for some Americans who have private coverage, but it is not true for all. It ignores the inherent instability of the private insurance markets — in which plans are canceled or changed all the time, people often don’t get to pick which private plan is even available to them, and government intervention would likely exacerbate that volatility. Introducing a public option, as Buttigieg intends to do, could create more incentives for employers to drop private coverage and switch to the public Medicare plan — and, in some cases, for private carriers to exit the individual marketplace. The fact that it would be less disruptive than Medicare for All doesn’t change this. Buttigieg’s claim has some truth to it, but leaves out key facts and context. We rate it Mostly False.  ","[('Pete Buttigieg for President, ""Progress,"" Feb. 21, 2020.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3JX-SbgvSU'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""2019 Employer Health Benefits Survey,"" Sept. 25, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Insurer Participation on ACA Marketplaces, 2014-2020,"" Nov. 21, 2019.\xa0', 'https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2019-summary-of-findings/'), ('Pete for America, ""Medicare For All Who Want It,"" accessed Feb. 24, 2020.', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Lie of the Year: \'If You Like Your Health Care Plan, You Can Keep It\'"" Dec. 12, 2013.', 'https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/insurer-participation-on-aca-marketplaces-2014-2020/'), ('Telephone interview with Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, Feb. 24, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Cynthia Cox, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation and director for the Program on the ACA, Feb. 24, 2020.', 'https://storage.googleapis.com/pfa-webapp/documents/MFAWWI_white_paper_FINAL.pdf'), ('Telephone interview with Sherry Glied, dean of the New York University Robert F.

Violent crime in South Bend did not double during Pete Buttigieg's time as mayor
","A conservative commentator attacked the mayoral record of Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, using data to show how the city of South Bend, Ind., became less safe under his watch. ""Violent crime in South Bend doubled during Mayor Pete’s tenure,"" said the headline on Bongino.com, the web home for content shared and created by radio host Dan Bongino. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Bongino uses charts to suggest that violent crime spiked during Buttigieg’s two terms, which ran from Jan. 1, 2012, to Jan. 1, 2020.  At first glance the claim appears to be backed up with the gold standard of violent crime statistics — the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report.  But there’s more to this story: South Bend changed how it reported the numbers to the FBI, making it appear that violent crime experienced an alarming spike under Buttigieg’s leadership. That isn’t what happened. Let’s take a look. Violent crime defined The FBI says violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. South Bend reported 744 violent crimes to the FBI in 2011 — the year before Buttigieg took office. In 2012, Buttigieg’s first year as mayor, the number fell to 622 — a drop of 16%. Then, violent crimes rose in 2013, 2014 and 2015 — but still remained lower than 2011. After that, the numbers get tricky. In 2016, based on advice from the FBI, South Bend police changed how it counted aggravated assaults — and the number of violent crimes reported by South Bend spiked, exceeding 1,000 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available. Previously, South Bend had not been counting instances where a weapon was shown or implied as an aggravated assault, said Jeff Asher, data analyst and consultant at AH Datalytics who has written in the New York Times about violent crime in South Bend.  ""The evidence is telling us that South Bend didn’t become more violent; it simply changed how it counted assaults,"" he wrote. The FBI noted the issue in comparing annual totals in South Bend from 2016 forward this way:  ""Because of changes in"" South Bend's ""reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data."" Similarly, the FBI changed its definition of rape in 2013, which led to an increase in rape figures nationwide, Asher said. A Wall Street Journal editorial also took Buttigieg to task, saying an increase in violent crime in South Bend outpaced that of Indiana as a whole. But the editorial also noted the change in how South Bend counts violent crimes.  
An article shared on Facebook claims: ""Violent crime in South Bend doubled during Mayor Pete’s tenure."" The raw numbers suggest such an increase — but not because the number of violent crimes doubled. What happened is that, based on guidance from the FBI, South Bend changed the way it defined a type of assault, and counting of that violent crime increased significantly. The FBI said South Bend’s violent crime numbers from 2016 forward can’t be compared with those from previous years. We rate the statement Mostly False.","[('Bongino.com, ""Violent crime in South Bend doubled during Mayor Pete’s tenure,"" Feb. 10, 2020', 'https://bongino.com/violent-crime-in-south-bend-doubled-under-mayor-petes-tenure/'), ('Email, Pete Buttigieg campaign spokesman Matt Corridoni, Feb. 18, 2020', 'No link'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2011,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table8statecuts/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_indiana_by_city_2011.xls'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2012,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2013,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/8tabledatadecpdf/table-8-state-cuts/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_by_indiana_by_city_2012.xls'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2014,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2015,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_indiana_by_city_2013.xls'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2016,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2017,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-8/table-8-by-state/Table_8_Offenses_Known_to_Law_Enforcement_by_Indiana_by_City_2014.xls'), ('FBI, ""Indiana — Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by City, 2018,"" accessed Feb. 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""South Bend and St. Louis, Where Crime Statistics Can Mislead,"" Dec. 17, 2019', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-8/table-8-state-pieces/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_indiana_by_city_2015.xls'), ('Interview, Jeff Asher, data analyst and consultant at AH Datalytics, Feb. 25, 2020', 'No link'), ('South Bend Police Department, ""Part I Crimes Annual Totals (through 2017),"" accessed Feb. 18, 2020', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/table-6/table-6-state-cuts/indiana.xls'), ('Email, South Bend police Sgt.

Liberal Facebook pages, blogs fabricate Devin Nunes quote about Trump
","A popular Facebook post is putting words in the mouth of Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. The post, which includes a quote about President Donald Trump alongside an image of Nunes, was shared in a popular liberal Facebook page called Go Left. The post claims to be based on leaked audio from July 2019. ""Defending Trump is more important than the United States,"" the image reads.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

As the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes was one of Trump’s staunchest defenders during the president’s impeachment. But the Facebook post is inaccurate — the leaked audio it cites was recorded in July 2018, not 2019. And Nunes didn’t say anything close to the quote Go Left published. The audio was recorded at a private fundraiser for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., that Nunes attended in July 2018. MSNBC first obtained and aired the clips during the Rachel Maddow Show on Aug. 8, 2018. Nunes’ comments focused on former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of 2016 Russian election interference and the role of the Trump campaign.  ""So therein lies, so it’s like your classic Catch-22 situation where we were at a – this puts us in such a tough spot. If (then-Attorney General Jeff) Sessions won’t unrecuse and Mueller won’t clear the president, we’re the only ones. Which is really the danger,"" Nunes said in one of the clips that MSNBC published. ""That’s why I keep, and thank you for saying it by the way, I mean we have to keep all these seats. We have to keep the majority. If we do not keep the majority, all of this goes away."" The audio shows that Nunes was interested in defending Trump from the Mueller investigation to try and keep the Republican majority in Congress ahead of the midterm elections. But none of the four clips that MSNBC published included Nunes saying anything close to ""defending Trump is more important than the United States.""

Polls show most Democrats, many Americans back key Bernie Sanders' policies
","In his speech after the Nevada caucuses, Pete Buttigieg took a shot at his rival Bernie Sanders, who had just won a clear victory. ""Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil,"" Buttigieg said. ""He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support."" Buttigieg is wrong to say most Democrats don’t support Sanders’ agenda. Polling shows that key elements of Sanders’ economic platform are strongly popular among Democrats. And several of them score majority support among all voters. However, support among all voters for some of Sanders’ proposals declines when poll respondents are told about the costs. And in some cases, less-aggressive policy options — some of them backed by Sanders’ competitors — receive wider support from voters than his proposals do. We looked at several elements of Sanders’ platform that could potentially have an impact on the economy. They include instituting single-payer health care; the Green New Deal to combat climate change; tuition-free college; student debt forgiveness; a $15 minimum wage; breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. We found broad acceptance among economists that at least some of these policies would qualify as ""reordering"" the economy.  By shifting payments from private insurers to the federal government, single-payer health care would dramatically change the health care sector, which accounts for 17.7% of the nation’s gross domestic product.  This policy, and breaking up big banks, ""would change things in a major way,"" said Stanford University economist Roger Noll. ""These are huge sectors.""   The Green New Deal would affect a smaller, but still substantial, share of the economy that relates to energy, by setting aggressive targets for phasing out fossil fuels. The proposal also includes a federal job guarantee. Economists’ views vary on the scale of the other proposals, but some said that changes to the higher-education sector — making college tuition free and forgiving student loan debt — could have a significant impact on the economy. And while the impact of other aspects of Sanders’ plan, such as a $15 minimum wage or paid family leave, might be less dramatic, they could have significant effects on certain regions and employment sectors. ""It's quite fair to say he is reordering the economy, given the massive transfer of money from the private sector to the government,"" said Daniel Mitchell, a pro-free market economist. We collected recent poll results on most of these proposals and put them into the chart below. The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved.  The data shows that — contrary to what Buttigieg said — a large share of Democrats support Sanders’ economic proposals, according to polls. Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%.   Among all Americans, only one of these policies — single-payer health care — gets less than 50% support. Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters. That said, other poll results give Buttigieg’s remark some support. First, when we inquired about his comment, the Buttigieg camp pointed to health insurance. As it turns out, Buttigieg’s own policy preference — a public option to buy into Medicare for those who want it — wins majority support from all Americans, a level of support significantly stronger than the 30% to 40% national approval rates for a Sanders-style single-payer system. In February 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 44% of voters preferred a public option, compared to 26% of voters who preferred single-payer and 23% who opposed both. Democrats alone also expressed a preference for the public option, with 51% favoring the public option compared to 39% for single-payer. Second, providing poll respondents with more complete descriptions of a policy option — often including the cost required — usually reduced the levels of support. Here are some examples: • $15 minimum wage. A SurveyMonkey poll conducted for Business Insider asked two questions about the $15 minimum wage. The first was, ""Do you support or oppose increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour?"" This question elicited 63% support among all respondents. The second question added that the Congressional Budget Office — the non-partisan number-crunching arm of Congress — found that a $15 minimum wage would increase wages for 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million households out of poverty, but could also eliminate 1.3 million jobs. Adding this caveat dropped support levels to just 37%. • Student loan forgiveness. A Quinnipiac University poll in April 2019 asked two questions about a plan for student loan forgiveness. First, the pollsters asked, ""Do you support or oppose the federal government forgiving up to $50,000 in student loans for individuals who live in households that make less than $250,000 a year?"" This won support from 57% of all Americans, and 79% of Democrats. Then they asked, ""Would you support or oppose this plan to forgive student loans if it was paid for by a new tax on wealthy individuals?"" On this question, Democratic support remained strong — 72% — but reaction among respondents overall turned negative, with 44% support and 52% opposition. • Paid family leave. A survey sponsored by the libertarian Cato Institute showed strong initial support — 74% among all respondents — for a paid family leave program granting 12 weeks for birth, adoption, or medical need. But support dropped significantly when possible impacts were mentioned. The poll found that only 48% would still support the policy if it cost another $450 a year in taxes. • Green New Deal. A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July and August 2019 found broad support for individual elements of the Green New Deal, which Sanders backs. These include a jobs guarantee (78%), energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings (70%), a goal of 100 percent of U.S. power coming from emissions-free sources within 10 years (69%), increased federal spending on disaster-prevention infrastructure (67%), new regulations on businesses (61%), and reductions in coal mining jobs (55%). The one unpopular aspect of the plan? Increasing spending by trillions of dollars, which was backed by just 30% of respondents. Buttigieg said that Sanders would ""go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support."" In reality, polling consistently shows that most Democrats do approve of key parts of Sanders’ economic agenda, including single-payer health care, the Green New Deal, tuition-free college, student debt forgiveness, a $15 minimum wage, breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. And for each of those issues except single-payer health care, a more modest percentage of all Americans — but still a majority — signal their support. It’s important to note, however, that support levels by all Americans drop significantly once voters are informed about the policies’ costs, often to majority disapproval. And on health care policy, Buttigieg’s plan — the public option to buy into Medicare — is more popular than Sanders’ single-payer proposal is, both among all voters and among Democrats.

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders' claim on Cuba literacy under Castro
","Bernie Sanders' past praise for the welfare policies of countries such as Cuba and Nicaragua is front and center as he has moved into the lead in the Democratic primary. In an interview on CBS News’ ""60 Minutes,"" Sanders described what he saw as two sides to the regime of Cuba’s Fidel Castro. ""We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad,"" Sanders said Feb. 23. ""When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?"" Interviewer Anderson Cooper pressed Sanders on the dissidents sent to Cuban jails. ""That's right,"" Sanders said. ""And we condemn that."" Sanders’ critique of Cuba fell well short for many opponents of the regime. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted, ""It really makes a difference when those you murder at the firing squad can read and write."" U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., said, ""I'm hoping that in the future, Sen. Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro.""  Sanders’ focus on the teaching side of Castro’s campaign downplayed its substantial political overtones. But Castro did significantly expand literacy rates after seizing power. ""The academic consensus seems to be that Fidel Castro’s government did increase the literacy rate of the island’s population, at the same time that it clearly used the literacy campaign for propaganda purposes,"" said Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. A 1984 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report found that in 1959, 23.6% of the population above the age of 10 were illiterate. By 1961, the number had fallen to 3.9%. While health care statistics on Cuba have been questioned, experts we interviewed told us they were not aware of issues with this data.  Bringing literacy to Cuba’s peasants was a long-standing policy in Castro’s broader agenda. In his 1957 manifesto, he included: ""Immediate initiation of an intensive campaign against illiteracy, and civic education emphasizing the duties and rights of each citizen to his society and fatherland.""  In 1961, about a quarter of a million teachers fanned out across the island nation. Their ranks included formally trained teachers and members of such groups as the National   Federation of Sugar Workers, the Rebel Youth Association and the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. They identified nearly 1 million illiterate people, and by the end of the year over 700,000 passed a basic literacy test. The teaching materials came with a blunt political message. They were built on 15 lessons with titles that included ""Fidel is Our Leader,"" ""The Land is Ours,"" ""Racial Discrimination"" and ""Housing."" The final literacy exam was based on the lesson ""The Cuban Fishermen."" Education researchers Carolyn Davidson Abel and Charles Frederick Abel at Stephen F. Austin State University looked at whether the Cubans set the literacy bar too low, and found that they used a reasonable benchmark. ""We did see evidence of basic literacy development, typical of what we might like to see in first graders here in America,"" Abel said. Today, the World Bank puts the adult literacy rate in Cuba at 99.8%, about 8 points higher than the average for the Caribbean region. Sanders’ comments about Cuba mirror those of President Barack Obama in 2016, soon after he had moved to open diplomatic relations with Cuba. Obama spoke to a group of up-and-coming leaders of the Americas, and said their generation had the chance to get beyond old political labels and explore practical solutions. ""I said (to Castro), look, you've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education — that's a huge improvement from where it was."" But Obama continued on to describe the benefits of private enterprise and the failures of the Cuban economy. Above all, he urged his audience to be ""practical."" Sanders said that when Fidel Castro ""came into office"" in Cuba, he ""had a massive literacy program."" Multiple reports confirm that. Using large scale mobilization, within two years of the revolution, over 700,000 Cubans were taught to read and write for the first time. Castro did not simply take office. He won a drawn-out military campaign and toppled the government in power. As for the literacy effort, in Castro’s own words, the goal wasn’t simply to teach, but to instill political beliefs. That’s important context to capture the nature of the literacy campaign. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('CBS News, Bernie Sanders on being the Democratic front-runner and taking on Donald Trump, Feb. 23, 2020', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-democratic-presidential-candidate-anderson-cooper-60-minutes-2020-02-23/'), ('UNESCO, Campaigning for literacy: eight national experiences of the twentieth century, with a memorandum to decision-makers, 1984', 'No link'), ('Cuban Research Institute, Cuba: Country profile, accessed Fab. 24, 2020', 'https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000062893'), ('Fidel Castro, Sierra Maestra Manifesto, July 12, 1957', 'No link'), ('Texas Journal of Literacy Education, EARLY LITERACY IN CUBA: LESSONS FOR AMERICA, Summer 2017', 'https://cri.fiu.edu/research/cuba-profile/cuba-country-profile.pdf'), ('Arkansas State University, Perspectives on the Cuban National Literacy Campaign, Sept. 24, 1998', 'No link'), ('World Bank, Education statistics, accessed Feb. 24, 2020', 'http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuban-rebels/manifesto.htm'), ('White House, Remarks by President Obama in Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative Town Hall, March 23, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email exchange, Jorge Duany, director, Cuban Research Institute, Florida International University, Feb. 24. 2020', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1147644.pdf'), ('Email exchange, Carolyn Davidson Abel, professor, Department of Elementary Education, Stephen F.

Facebook post overplays Bloomberg’s reference to 3-round limit for guns
","Mike Bloomberg has made gun control a central pillar of his Democratic campaign for president, including a call for limits on assault weapons. But limiting guns to three rounds? That social media claim is based on vague comments Bloomberg made in 2012 about how to define such weapons. He does not have such a policy in 2020. The headline of one Facebook post, paired with a video commentary, says of the former New York City mayor:  ""Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds."" The post resembles comments made in 2013 by Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, on NBC’s Meet the Press. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two problems:  1. The claim uses the present tense in describing what it refers to as Bloomberg’s proposal, but it cites comments Bloomberg made in a 2012 TV interview. 2. In those comments, which were in response to questions about how to determine which weapons would be subject to restrictions, Bloomberg alluded to limiting the number of rounds a gun could fire quickly. But he didn’t explicitly say he supported a limit of three. Bloomberg has publicly endorsed a ban on ""military-style assault weapons"" and ""high-capacity ammunition magazines,"" such as in a Feb. 11, 2013, letter to lawmakers from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition Bloomberg co-founded in 2006. The recent Facebook post includes a video with a narrator commenting on excerpts from an ABC News Nightline interview with Bloomberg on Dec. 20, 2012.  The interview referenced the 20 first-graders and six school staffers who were killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. In the interview, anchor Cynthia McFadden asked Bloomberg about the challenge of defining an ""assault weapon."" Bloomberg responded by expressing a desire to limit how quickly a gun can fire rounds and the number of rounds a gun can carry. ""Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that's a good place to start, OK, and then you can argue about what a lot is,"" Bloomberg said. McFadden started to interject, and the mayor continued: ""OK, let's pick it. Let's say three. If you haven't hit the deer with three shots, you're a pretty lousy shot. That deer deserves to get away. Let's get serious here."" The Bloomberg campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg supports reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; it banned certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Under Bloomberg’s proposal, current assault weapons owners could keep their guns, but would have to report them to federal officials. A Facebook post says: ""Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds."" The post is misleading in that Bloomberg made the reference to three rounds in a 2012 interview. And while he suggested restricting the number of rounds that can be fired quickly, and tossed out the idea of three, he didn’t articulate a particular proposal. He also expressed a desire to limit the number of rounds a gun can hold. His 2020 presidential campaign platform includes reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons, which prohibited certain types of semi-automatic firearms along with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

Facebook post misrepresents Obama’s use of pardon power
","The latest round of clemency grants from President Donald Trump sparked new criticism that he was abusing his expansive pardon powers by skirting the normal review process and favoring white-collar criminals who were prominent and well-connected. But two days after the Feb. 18 announcements, a Facebook post implied that it was Barack Obama, not Trump, who had abused the largely unchecked pardon power. The post said: ""Pardons — Obama: 1,927, Trump: 26. And Trump is abusing that power?""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The numbers in the post are roughly accurate totals for presidential clemency actions, which include both pardons and sentence commutations. But either way, they’re not a good measure of abuse of power. In his eight years in office, Obama issued 1,927 clemency actions. The vast majority of them — nearly 90% — were sentence commutations granted to ordinary individuals, based on a policy of criminal justice reform in drug cases, and specific recommendations from the U.S. Justice Department. Trump has acted outside the Justice Department process in granting clemency to a few well-known white-collar offenders. Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution says the president ""shall have the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.""  The general term for these presidential actions is clemency, but there are two types, the Justice Department says on its website. A pardon, described as an ""expression of the President’s forgiveness,"" is issued after a person’s conviction or after a person’s sentence has been completed. It restores rights, such as the right to vote or run for office. A commutation reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, but it does not remove the conviction. Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, for a total of 1,927 acts of clemency — the number used in the Facebook post.  Trump has taken 35 clemency actions, more than the figured cited in the Facebook post. Roughly two-thirds of them were pardons, including two posthumous ones. Trump has been criticized for issuing the actions outside the usual review process and for seeming to favor certain high-profile or connected individuals. ""Obama acted in each case pursuant to a report and recommendation from the Justice Department, which came to him through an orderly and regular process that gave everyone a fair chance of success,"" said Margaret Love, a lawyer specializing in executive clemency who was a Justice Department pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997. ""By contrast, Trump has almost totally ignored the established DOJ process, and acted pursuant to informal and unofficial recommendations from friends, celebrities, media personalities, business colleagues, etc."" The Trump White House has noted the achievements and the prominent supporters of people whom Trump granted clemency. In announcing Trump’s 11 most recent actions, the White House cited the election of Edward DeBartolo Jr. to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as an NFL team owner and his charitable contributions; called Michael Milken one of America’s greatest financiers and noted his philanthropic work; and praised former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for tutoring and mentoring fellow prisoners.  DeBartolo, whose family controls the San Franscisco 49ers, was convicted in 1998 and sentenced to probation for failing to report a felony regarding an extortion attempt. Milken pleaded guilty to securities violations in 1989 and served two years in prison in the early 1990s. Both were pardoned. Blagojevich received a commutation after spending eight years in prison for a scheme to sell an appointment to the U.S. Senate seat Obama vacated in 2008. A Facebook post claims: ""Pardons — Obama: 1,927, Trump: 26. And Trump is abusing that power?""  The numbers for Obama are roughly accurate if you count total acts of clemency — pardons plus sentence commutations. But only about 11% of those were pardons.

Contrary to Todd Gilbert, U.S isn't reducing carbon emissions at world's highest rate
","House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, recently accused the newly-elected Democratic majorities in the General Assembly of undermining Virginia’s pro-business environment. In a blunt Feb. 12 floor speech, Gilbert criticized Democrats for advancing bills that would raise Virginia’s minimum wage, increase the gas tax to aid transportation, and impose a five-cent state fee on each disposable bag stores provide to consumers.  Gilbert particularly focused on bills passed by the House and Senate that would require Virginia to completely rely on renewable energy sources by mid-century - a death knell for Southwest Virginia’s declining coal industry. ""Democrats apparently want to run Virginia’s thriving economy, not on the abundant energy resources that we already have at our disposal here in this country and this Commonwealth, but merely on rays of sunlight and gusts of wind,"" he said. ""They are unyielding in this pursuit of their agenda, even though America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world while we are presiding over one of the largest energy booms in world history."" We fact-checked Gilbert’s assertion that ""America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate higher than any country in the world."" We asked Garren Shipley, Gilbert’s communications director, for the source of the minority leader’s claim. He sent us a report on global carbon emissions in 2019, published Feb. 11, 2020 by the International Energy Agency - a 30-nation organization that researches and makes policy recommendations for sustainable energy sources. The report said carbon emissions declined in the U.S. last year and held steady across the world. The language in the report can be a bit confusing. ""The United States saw the largest decline in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019 on a country basis – a fall of 140 Mt, or 2.9%, to 4.8 Gt.""  Thoroughly read, the reports says U.S. led all nations in reducing its tonnage of carbon pollution last year. But contrary to Gilbert’s statement, other countries cut their emissions by larger rates. Let’s explore this distinction. Tonnage The IEA found that the U.S, carbon emissions fell from 4.94 billion metric tons in 2018 to 4.8 billion last year. That’s a reduction of 140 million metric tons  - the most in the world, according to IEA. The report attributed the drop to a 15% decline in the use of coal-fired energy, largely caused by competition from cheaper, cleaner natural gas. Also, mild summer and winter weather eased demand for air-conditioning and heating. The IEA won’t publish carbon data for every nation until March. But here are the few comparison numbers that can be gleaned from the February report: Germany reduced its carbon emissions from about 674 million metric tons in 2018 to 620 million last year, its lowest level since the 1950s. The 54-million-ton drop led European Union nations. Japan cut its emissions from about 1,076 million cubic tons in 2018 to 1,030 million last year - a drop of 46 million cubic tons.  The drop in the U.S. was encouraging to some environmentalists because it reversed an increase in carbon emissions in 2018. But the one-year measurement starting in 2018 produces a myopic result. That’s because carbon emissions in 2018 soared to a four-year high, erasing progress that had been made in 2017.  If you measure from 2017 to 2019, U.S. carbon emissions increased by 39 metric million tons, and fell in Germany and Japan, according to IEA data. If you measure from 2016 to 2019, U.S. emissions declined by 38 million tons - about one-third as much as they fell in Germany and Japan. If you start in 2010, U.S. emissions dropped by 452 million tons - far outpacing Germany and Japan. In other words, the data can show different trends. ""A lot of it depends on where your baseline is,"" said Jamie Russell, director of the Appalachian Energy Center at Appalachian State University.  The U.S. and China are by far the world's largest carbon polluters. China is responsible for 28% of emission tonnage; the U.S. for 15%. Chinese pollution is increasing.  It’s also increasing in the third-place country, India, which spews 7% of the world’s carbon tonnage. No other country is above 4.6%. Although many European nations have cut emissions, none of those countries discharge more than 2 percent of the global tonnage. Think of a group of people that have all decided to lose weight. If one person weighs several times more than that the others, he’s likely to lose the most pounds. But that doesn’t mean he’s the most effective dieter. Rate  That heaviest person may not be losing weight at the highest ""rate"" - the term Gilbert used when talking about U.S. emission cuts. A 500-pound person dropping 50 pounds in a year lost weight at a 10% annual rate. But a 150-pound person who shed only 20 pounds during that period lost weight at a faster 13% annual rate. The same principle applies to measuring rates of U.S. carbon reduction. The U.S. cut emissions by 2.9% in 2019, according to the IEA. That’s not the highest rate. European Union nations cut emissions by 5%, with Germany leading the way at 8%. Japan reduced emissions by 4.3%. The February report doesn’t offer this datum for other countries. From 2007 to 2017, U.S. lowered carbon emissions by an average 1.5% a year, according to BP. Nine European countries cut their emissions at a higher rate: the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Italy, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The IEA report describes the U.S. progress last year in terms of reduced tonnage. But it does not say the U.S. cut carbon emissions at the world’s fastest rate, nor do two articles on the report that Shipley sent us to back Gilbert’s claim. ""It was the largest drop in terms of tons, but that is not a ‘rate,’"" we were told by John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. ""Your percentage calculation is a ‘rate.’  Since the U.S. is among one of the biggest emitters among countries, much smaller drops for other countries translate to larger rates of reduction."" Robert Brecha, a professor in the department of physics and the renewable and clean energy program at the University of Dayton, agreed. ""Since the US is the second largest emitter, the magnitude of reductions is important,"" he wrote. ""But it is certainly not true that  ‘America's carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any other country in the world.’"" Our ruling Gilbert misstated the findings of an IEA report when he said, ""America’s carbon emissions are being reduced at a rate far higher than any country in the world."" The report requires close reading. It found that in 2019, the U.S. cut carbon emissions by 140 million metric tons, the highest weight loss in the world. That’s significant because the U.S. is the world’s second-largest carbon polluter.   But the IEA did not say the U.S. is cutting emission higher rate than any nation, let alone a ""far-higher"" rate that Gilbert described. America’s 2.9% percent reduction last year was below Japan’s, Germany’s, and the combined rate of European Union nations. We rate Gilbert’s statement False.   Editor's note: On a Feb. 18, 2020 VPM radio broadcast, PolitiFact Virginia rated Gilbert's statement Mostly False. We downgraded it to False after coming across additional information on carbon emissions.  ","[('House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, floor speech, regular session, Feb. 12, 2020 (12:26 p.m. mark).', 'https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php'), ('Emails from Garren Shipley, communications director for Gilbert, Feb. 13, 2020.', 'No link'), ('International Energy Agency, ""Global CO2 emissions in 2019,"" Feb. 11, 2020.', 'https://www.iea.org/articles/global-co2-emissions-in-2019'), ('IEA, ""Data and Statistics,"" accessed Feb. 18, 2020,\xa0', 'No link'), ('The Hill, ""U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide lowered in 2029: report,"" Feb. 11, 2020.', 'https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=GERMANY&fuel=CO2%20emissions&indicator=CO2%20emissions%20by%20energy%20source'), ('ABC News, ""\'Grounds for optimism\': Global carbon emissions level out despite growing economy,"" Feb. 11, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Global Carbon Atlas, ""CO2 Emissions,"" accessed Feb. 13, 2020.', 'https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/482601-us-energy-related-carbon-dioxide-emissions-lowered-in-2019-report'), ('BP, ""BP Statistical Review of World Energy,"" 2019.', 'No link'), ('United Nations, ""Greenhouse Gas Inventory,""\xa0 accessed Feb. 13, 2020.', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/grounds-optimism-global-carbon-emissions-level-growing-economy/story?id=68906935'), ('PolitiFact, ""Are greenhouse gas emissions down under Trump, as EPA says?"", June 18, 2018.', 'No link'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2018,"" Nov. 14, 2019.', 'http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions'), ('EIA, World CO2 emissions, accessed Feb. 13, 2020.', 'No link'), ('EIA, ""EIA expects U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions to decrease annually through 2021,"" Jan. 17, 2020.', 'https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2019-co2-emissions.pdf'), ('Emails from John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Technology of Global Change, Feb. 14, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Email from Robert Brecha, professor at the School of Engineering Renewable and Clean Energy Program at the University of Dayton, Feb. 14, 2020.', 'https://di.unfccc.int/time_series'), ('Interview with Jamie Russell, director of the Appalachian Energy Center at Appalachian State University, Feb. 17, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Legislative Information System, HB395, SB7, HB1414, SB899, HB534, SB11, HB1526, SB851, 2020 Session.', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/24/todd-gilbert/contrary-todd-gilbert-us-isnt-reducing-carbon-emis/

Video of child giving Biden vial of blood to drink is doctored
","Social media users circulated a fake, doctored video that purported to show a child discreetly handing a vial of blood off to President Joe Biden. ""Boy passes Joe Biden a vial of fresh blood to drink on his way back to the White House,"" said a Dec. 16 tweet from a Twitter account that has since been suspended. The Biden-drinks-blood claim was repeated — and the video reposted — on Instagram. There, it collected thousands of views, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  But the claim is false, and the video it’s based on is edited to include the vial of blood.  A Dec. 16, 2021, Instagram post shared a doctored video of President Joe Biden. The original video, unedited and without the ominous soundtrack featured in the social media version, was captured live on July 21 by a local Fox-affiliate TV station serving the Cincinnati area, Snopes reported. The video shows Biden meeting with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and his family after landing at an airport near the Kentucky-Ohio border.  Around the 12:30 mark, the Fox19 video shows Biden slipping an unknown object to the young boy standing beside him, Beshear’s son Will, who then placed the object in his pocket. It doesn’t show a vial of blood, nor does it show Biden receiving anything from Beshear’s son in return.  Crystal Staley, Beshear’s communications director, said the social media claim about Beshear's son slipping Biden a vial of blood is ""completely false."" The claim about Biden harvesting blood to drink plays into a segment of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which holds that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles, including many high-profile Democrats.

Old Fauci comments about vaccine safety are being taken out of context
","A clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci that’s being shared on Facebook, divorced from its original context, makes it seem that he’s suggesting COVID-19 vaccines could actually make people sicker.  ""Dr. Fauci opens up the possibility that the COVID-19 vaccine could be making people more likely to be infected by the virus,"" a caption over the video says. It then quotes Fauci as saying, ""this would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse.""  But this video is from March 19, 2020, about a week after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and before vaccines for the virus were available. Fauci’s comments related to the need for thorough testing of any vaccine before distribution and he was posing a hypothetical. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The clip comes from a conversation between Fauci and Mark Zuckerberg, and it was livestreamed on Facebook. The part that’s pertinent to this fact-check starts around the 17:30 mark.  ""You mentioned a vaccine, there are conversations about other therapeutics,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Maybe talk about where are we in the vaccine development, you just announced a first trial for phase one to test the safety. What’s the timeframe for having something like that go through all the different trials, how would we expedite that and what should people expect on that?"" ""To give our viewers a perspective,"" Fauci replied, ""if this were 10, 15, 20 years ago and it was for any vaccine that we wanted to make, you would say a vaccine from the time you start, from the time it’s approved, to be safe and effective, is several years, five, six, seven years. That’s unacceptable for now. So what happened is that as soon as we got the sequence of the virus from the Chinese, we pulled it out from the public database and stuck the gene into a vaccine platform and worked on it literally within a day of when it came out. Sixty-five days later, namely two days ago, we gave the first injection to a normal volunteer for a phase one trial to see if it’s safe. That’s the fastest it’s ever been done. That’s the good news. The challenging news is that even at that rocket speed, it’s going to take a few months to show that the initial safety is okay. Then you go into a phase two trial, which instead of involving 45 people, which we have in the phase one trial, it involves hundreds if not thousands of people. That will take another six to eight months to even know if it works. So, at the fastest we can go, it’s going to take a year to a year and a half to even know if we have a vaccine that we can use. So apropos of the question you asked me a moment ago, that if we cycle to another season, that's when the vaccine is going to be very relevant."" Zuckerberg then asked why the government doesn’t ""push harder"" on rolling vaccines out more aggressively after the safety trials ""even if you don’t know how effective it is.""  ""What’s the public health rationale and thinking behind needing to prove that it’s extremely effective before rolling out something that you know is safe?"" he said. Fauci responded that the ""initial safety study is to see, if I inject it in the arm, does it have some idiosyncratic or bad reaction."" But, he said, ""there’s another element to safety, and that is if you vaccinate someone and they make an antibody response, and then they get exposed and infected, does the response that you induce actually enhance infection and make it worse, and the only way you’ll know that is if you do an extended study — not in a normal volunteer who has no risk of infection, but in people who are out there in a risk situation. This would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse."" He then gave some examples and said, ""You can’t just go out there and give it unless you feel that in the field, when someone is getting infected and exposed, being vaccinated doesn’t make them worse. That’s why you’ve got to do a trial.""  In short: Fauci wasn’t, in the present day, suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States could be making people more likely to be infected by the virus. He was talking nearly two years ago about the importance of safety trials and studies before approving the vaccines.  We reached out to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where Fauci is the director, about the Facebook post. The agency told PolitiFact in an email that there’s always a theoretical risk of unintended events with any new vaccine.  ""This is why the development of candidate vaccines proceeds in a stepwise fashion, starting with laboratory studies, then progressing to studies in animal models that mimic the human immune response, and finally to carefully controlled human clinical trials where participants are monitored closely for any adverse events,"" the institute said. ""After a candidate vaccine is authorized or approved by the FDA, rigorous post-marketing safety surveillance is conducted to identify even very rare safety concerns. This is precisely the process NIAID has followed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  To date, the agency said, the COVID-19 vaccines approved or authorized for use in the United States had been administered to more than 485 million people ""and have proved to be very safe and effective.""  We rate this post False. ","[('Facebook post, Dec. 13, 2021', 'https://archive.md/VMNTO'), ('Tweet, Dec. 13, 2021', 'No link'), ('Facebook livestream, March 19, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/WildRiteMystery/status/1470648560609751042'), ('Statement from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dec. 14, 2021', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/17/viral-image/old-fauci-comments-about-vaccine-safety-are-being-/

No, Microsoft and Bill Gates didn’t develop a video game called Omikron in 1999
","Ever since it was discovered, people have continued to use the new COVID-19 omicron variant to make false claims about the pandemic. Some claimed its name was evidence that the whole thing was planned, while others spread a photoshopped poster for a non-existent film called ""The Omicron Variant.""  Now, social media posts claim that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates created a video game named — you guessed it — ""Omikron"" back in 1999. ""DID YOU KNOW?"" text on a Facebook post graphic asks. ""Omikron was the name of a 1999 video game by Microsoft and Bill Gates about demons pretending to be humans and harvesting their souls."" One video circulating online fuels conspiracy theories further as it shows the game’s anti-government plot featuring a digitally illustrated David Bowie-like character.  The game is real and was available to play on Microsoft Windows computers in November 1999, but it wasn’t developed by Microsoft or Gates.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""Omikron: The Nomad Soul"" was created by Quantic Dream, a French developer based in Paris founded by a man named David Cage. Bowie made the music for the game, and the game features a character who shares Bowie’s voice and appearance. It was released on Sega’s home video game console Dreamcast in 2000, and it’s still available today on Steam, a video game digital distribution service. The adventure game follows players as their souls enter the futuristic city of Omikron, located in an alternate dimension. Players explore the world while fighting off demons who try to trap their souls. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told PolitiFact that the claims about Gates and the game are false, and a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that neither the company nor Gates developed the game.  Meanwhile, the new coronavirus variant’s name of omicron follows an established pattern of naming variants after letters in the Greek alphabet. The first four variants of concern identified by the World Health Organization —  alpha, beta, gamma and delta — are all Greek letters. ""These labels were chosen after wide consultation and review of many potential naming systems,"" the WHO said when it announced it would use the Greek alphabet to name variants. The organization said it convened ""an expert group of partners from around the world to do so, including experts who are part of existing naming systems, nomenclature and virus taxonomic experts, researchers and national authorities.""  It’s not unreasonable to see why writers would pick the word omicron for futuristic popular culture references as it’s been used by astronomers for years to name multiple stars, like Omicron Persei and Omicron Centauri. The aliens in the animated show ""Futurama,"" for example, are from a planet called Omicron Persei 8.  Social media posts claim Microsoft and Bill Gates created a 1999 video game called ""Omikron."" This is wrong. A real game called Omikron was available on Microsoft in 1999, but neither Gates nor Microsoft created it, and it had nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic, as these posts suggest. The term omicron is from the Greek alphabet, which has been used by health officials to name coronavirus variants. The word has also been used to name stars and appears in multiple popular culture references. We rate this False.","[('Facebook post, Dec. 4, 2021', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10222450635749261&set=a.1316651230929&type=3&theater'), ('Twitter post, Nov. 30,\xa0 2021\xa0', 'No link'), ('IGN, Omikron: the Nomad Soul, July 5, 2000\xa0', 'https://archive.md/bvhXZ'), ('Steam, Omikron, Accessed Dec. 16, 2021\xa0', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, The new coronavirus variant is named for a letter in the Greek alphabet, Nov. 30, 2021\xa0', 'https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/06/omikron-the-nomad-soul'), ('World Health Organization, WHO announces simple, easy-to-say labels for SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest and Concern, May 31, 2021', 'No link'), ('Omicron stars, Accessed Dec. 16, 2021', 'https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/243000/'), ('Email interview, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Dec. 16, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Microsoft media department, Dec. 16, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/30/viral-image/new-coronavirus-variant-named-letter-greek-alphabe/')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/17/facebook-posts/no-microsoft-and-bill-gates-didnt-develop-video-ga/

Context needed for Grassley comment about Medicare vote
","Democrats controlling the U.S. Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote came up with a plan earlier this month to circumvent the Senate’s 60-vote rule for raising the federal government’s debt ceiling: Combine in one bill a procedural vote saving Medicare from automatic funding cuts for 2022 with the unusual authorization of a one-time only Senate majority vote to raise the federal government’s debt limit. It’s a move journalist Lindsey McPherson called in a Dec. 13 Roll Call story ""an age-old Washington trick for must-pass legislation that requires bipartisan support: Pair the thing the minority hates with something they support and hope they feel the good outweighs the bad."" The legislation passed 59 to 35, with 10 Republicans voting yes and six senators not voting.  The ploy didn’t pass muster for Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, though, who voted against the legislation. Grassley said he opposed the part that authorized raising the debt ceiling without a 60-vote Senate approval. That brought a response from Democrat Abby Finkenauer, the former U.S. representative from Iowa running in 2022 for the seat Grassley holds. Finkenauer tweeted on Dec. 9: ""It’s not surprising that @ChuckGrassley would fight to preserve the filibuster while voting to slash Medicare, but it’s sure as heck not acceptable. D.C. hasn’t been working for DECADES and this guy is the problem."" It’s not surprising that @ChuckGrassley would fight to preserve the filibuster while voting to slash Medicare, but it’s sure as heck not acceptable. D.C. hasn’t been working for DECADES and this guy is the problem. https://t.co/ihieXtzF5g Michael Zona, former spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee and Grassley when Grassley led that committee, saw the tweet and responded:  ""Another day, another lie. Grassley explicitly stated he supported the Medicare policies. Honesty isn’t Abby’s strong suit. Abby accomplished nothing in the House and now she has opinions about how the Senate should operate. I’m gathering humility isn’t her strong suit either."" Finkenauer’s campaign staff called foul, saying Zona unfairly accused Finkenauer of lying. Zona told PolitiFact Iowa he was referring specifically to the assertion that Grassley voted to slash Medicare, so we looked at the record. Defining political opponents’ actions in ways that provoke negative emotion also is an age-old Washington trick, practiced in abundance in a town whose major industry is influencing others to take preferred actions on behalf of the public. With this approach, failing to vote yes on a bill that stops automatic Medicare funding cuts gets defined as a vote that allows Medicare cuts. Republicans voting no included Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. ""It’s a bad position to be in. I don’t like being put in this position,"" Ernst told Roll Call’s McPherson. ""But, you know, Medicare is important. Republicans voting no on this legislation thought they had something to gain: pinning the blame for raising the federal government’s debt ceiling but also high spending on Democrats, even though raising the ceiling authorizes the government to pay existing bills, not take on new spending. Grassley said in a prepared statement that he objected to authorizing a procedural vote without the Senate’s 60-vote requirement to increase the debt ceiling in an otherwise non-controversial bill.  ""I support the health care-specific provisions reflected in the Medicare extenders package, which the Senate will soon take up, that would prevent cuts and changes to Medicare providers,"" he said, referring to an upcoming procedural vote on extending legislation. ""In fact, I supported an amendment that would have provided for a clean Medicare extender package.""  Grassley had joined Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Ernst and 19 other senators on Dec. 8 in support of an amendment that would have eliminated the last portion from the legislation. That portion – Section 8 –  contained the language giving the Senate authority to expedite through Dec. 31 a vote on raising the debt limit a non-specified amount by using a joint resolution, which would allow a simple majority vote instead of a 60-vote majority to pass. The amendment failed. ""Had the bill not included the debt ceiling provision, Sen. Grassley would have supported it,"" Grassley’s communications director Taylor Foy wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. Foy sent a list of 16 legislative bills Grassley supports that provide Medicare access and health care benefits. Grassley sponsored some of them, including the Rural Health Clinic Protection Act that was part of legislation signed into law in April that also spared Medicare for nine months of automatic 2% spending cuts. The latest action stops cuts for three months. Medicare was headed for a 2% sequestration cut on Jan. 1 and a mid-January 4% cut in Medicare provider payments.  ""Sen. Grassley supports the 60 vote threshold to reach finality on legislation, which forces bipartisanship and collaboration on proposals being considered during the normal course of action in the Senate,"" Foy wrote. ""But, that wasn’t his chief concern regarding the process in this particular instance. His procedural concern here is that a supposed ‘one-time’ change of the Senate rules (whether related to vote thresholds or not) rarely results in a one-off event, and tactics to sidestep the Senate’s standing rules are often repeated once the precedent is set."" Christian Slater, Finkenauer’s campaign communications director, countered in a PolitiFact Iowa interview that Finkenauer was on solid ground and not lying about Grassley’s vote. The legislation before the Senate specifically protected Medicare funding from being cut, and Grassley voted against it, he said. ""It doesn’t matter what you theoretically support — you voted to cut Medicare,"" Slater said. Slater had a list, too, of votes Grassley took in 2012 and 2013 on proposals by then U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, to cut federal spending. The 2012 budget proposal, which failed 41 to 58, capped Medicare beneficiary payments for people under the age of 55 at 2012 levels, with annual, inflationary adjustments. Democrats said then that Republicans voted to end Medicare, earning PolitiFact’s 2011 Lie of the Year designation, although PolitiFact noted that Democrats’ assertion that the Republican plan would privatize Medicare was Mostly True. Slater cited that privatization attempt as a bid to cut Medicare funding. He cited Grassley votes to revisit the Ryan budget proposal in 2012 and also a 2013 Grassley vote on an involved budget amendment to bring down proposed fiscal 2014 spending, revise spending levels for fiscal 2013 and set federal budget levels through 2023.  That budget amendment was tied to a Ryan budget proposal to rein in the federal spending growth rate and included a Medicare policy that would have given seniors the option of using subsidies to buy private health insurance. The moves failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate. This time around, Grassley voted against legislation that, had his side prevailed, would have resulted in automatic cuts to Medicare funding unless further action were taken. Why? Because of budget sequestration, the method by which federal funding is cut automatically under the Budget Control Act of 2011 that allows spending caps if spending exceeds congressional appropriations. Zona countered by referring to the 2021 Medicare and debt ceiling legislation’s words. For Finkenauer’s assertion to be true, Zona said, the legislation would have had to state specifically that Medicare was being slashed. It does not use those words, he said. ""There was never a vote to cut Medicare funding, or to slash it,"" Zona, who is out of government now and spokesman and senior vice president at a public affairs company, Bullpen Strategy, told PolitiFact Iowa in an interview. He followed up in an email, writing that Grassley delivered as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee expanded Medicare benefits to ""tens of millions of Americans."" Finkenauer said Grassley’s vote against the combined Medicare extension and debt ceiling meant voting to slash Medicare. Is Finkenauer lying, as Zona tweeted? She is correct about Grassley declining to vote in this instance to stave off a pending Medicare funding cut and, for that matter, about wanting to preserve the Senate’s 60-vote rule. But the legislation did not specifically call for slashing Medicare funding — if a 2% cut fits the definition of slashing — or close the door on finding another way to avoid cutting Medicare funding. The exchange between Finkenauer and Grassley is just the latest example of the two parties forcing their opponents to vote on combinations of measures that force them to choose between voting for something they don’t like, or voting against something they do. If they pursue the latter course, it can be weaponized into campaign attacks. Both parties do this regularly. Figuring out how Congress works through various pieces of legislation and how debate is carried out in a political dispute like this benefits from having context. We rate Finkenauer’s statement to be Half True.","[('U.S. Congress, S.610 – Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act\xa0text\xa0and roll call\xa0vote', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/610/text'), ('Roll Call, ""Medicare cuts scare helps put debt limit bill on fast track,"" by Lindsey McPherson, Dec. 13, 2021', 'No link'), ('Joseph Zeballos-Roig\xa0tweet, Dec. 9, 2021', 'https://www.rollcall.com/2021/12/13/medicare-cuts-scare-helps-put-debt-limit-bill-on-fast-track/'), ('Abby Finkenauer\xa0tweet, Dec. 9, 2021', 'No link'), ('Michael Zona\xa0tweet, Dec. 9, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/josephzeballos/status/1468997056706531338'), ('Chuck Grassley\xa0statement\xa0on extending Medicare and the debt limit vote, Dec. 9, 2021', 'No link'), ('Phone interview and email exchanges with Christian Slater, Dec. 15, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/Abby4Iowa/status/1469050786168594434'), ('Phone interview and email exchanges with Michael Zona, Dec. 15, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email exchanges with Taylor Foy, Dec. 15, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/mjzona/status/1469057434081800192'), ('U.S. Department of Treasury\xa0debt limit description', 'No link'), ('The Hill, ""House approves bill to ease passage of debt limit hike,"" by Cristina Marcos and Mike Lillis, Dec. 7, 2021', 'https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-statement-on-procedural-vote-tying-debt-limit-to-medicare-extenders'), ('U.S. Congress,\xa0S.1844\xa0– Lowering Medicare Premiums and Prescription Drug Costs Act', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress,\xa0H.R.5099\xa0– Lowering Medicare Premiums and Prescription Drug Costs Act', 'https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit'), ('U.S. Congress,\xa0S.935\xa0– Rural Health Clinic Protection Act', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress, H.Con.Res.112 – Establishing the budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2013 and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2014 through 2022\xa0text\xa0and\xa0vote', 'https://thehill.com/homenews/house/584842-house-approves-bill-to-ease-passage-of-debt-limit-hike'), ('U.S. Congress,\xa0 S.Con.Res.44 – A concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2013 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2014 through 2022\xa0text\xa0and\xa0vote', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress, S.Amdt.433 to\xa0S.Con.Res.8\xa0— An original concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2014, revising the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year 2013, and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2015 through 2023,\xa0text\xa0and\xa0vote', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1844/actions'), ('U.S. Congress, S.Amdt.243 to S.Con.Res.8,\xa0text\xa0', 'No link'), ('U.S. Congress, H.R.1868 – To prevent across-the-board direct spending cuts, and for other purposes,\xa0text\xa0and\xa0vote', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5099?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22medicare%22%2C%22medicare%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=3'), ('U.S. House, ""Summary of the Budget Control Act of 2011,"" Aug. 3, 2011\xa0', 'No link'), ('Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; ""Senator Lee’s Budget Would Sharply Cut Social Security, Medicare, Other Programs While Making Tax System Less Progressive;"" by Paul N.

There’s no evidence of a huge spike in soft-tissue cancers
","The anecdotal claim is startling at first glance. An oncologist tells her nurse friend that she is seeing a huge increase in soft-tissue cancers. She then insinuates that it must be due to the COVID-19 vaccine. But there’s no evidence to support either claim. A Facebook post claims that one oncologist said that soft-tissue cancers have climbed ""through the roof"" in 2021, ""a 550% increase"" and that ""we know why it’s happening,"" which implies it’s related to the COVID vaccines that rolled out early this year. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In addition to the claim made in a screen grab of another person’s tweet, the poster wrote that ""Dr. Ryan Cole has found an increase in cancers since the COVID-19 inoculation rollout,"" and adds a link to a claim made by Dr. Cole that has been debunked by fact checkers at USA Today and others. Soft-tissue cancers, or sarcomas, are tumors that begin in tissues such as fat and muscle that support other parts of the body. There are more than 50 subtypes of the cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic. The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute estimate that in 2021 about 13,460 new soft-tissue sarcomas will be diagnosed in the United States. In 2020, the projected number of new cases was 13,130. If those numbers prove true, that would be a modest 2.5% increase this year. Ahmedin Jemal, the American Cancer Society’s senior vice president, Surveillance & Health Equity Science, said in a statement to PolitiFact that ""the incidence of soft-tissue cancer in the United States has been increasing gradually before the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic."" Jemal said that incidences increased from 2.5 cases per 100,000 people in 1992 to 3.6 cases per 100,000 people in 2014, before stabilizing. In 2018, the last year for which incidence data is available, there were 3.2 cases per 100,000 people, according to data from the National Cancer Institute. ""Therefore, any anecdotal evidence for the increase in soft-tissue cancer during the past two years is likely to be a continuation of past trends,"" Jemal said, adding that there can be decades of lag between exposure to risks and a cancer diagnosis.  He cited lung cancer as an example, saying most of those cases occur 40 to 50 years after the patients start smoking. In 2018, the last year data on all new cancer cases is available, the Center for Disease Control said there were 1,708,921 new cases of all forms of the disease. The American Cancer Society projected there would be about 1,899,160 new cases in 2021, after projecting about 1.8 million in 2020. A spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute said in an email that it has no evidence to support the claim made in the Facebook post, but that the NCI, and other organizations, are concerned that a drop in cancer screenings during the pandemic will have a negative effect on cancer diagnosis and treatment. The NCI spokesperson pointed to a June interview with its director, Ned Sharpless, published on the American Association for Cancer Research website. Sharpless said that the ""pandemic has affected cancer screening in a dramatic way,"" creating a massive screening deficit that ""is going to lead to cancers being diagnosed at later stages."" The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center says in a story on its website about vaccine myths that ""there is no truth to the myth that somehow the mRNA vaccine could inactivate the genes that suppress tumors."" A Facebook post implied that an anecdotal spike in soft-tissue cancers is due to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. However, there is no evidence to support that claim. There has been a gradual rise in new diagnoses of soft-tissue cancer over recent years, one expert said, and any actual rise this year would likely be due to those continued trends. There is also no evidence to support the claim from Cole that the COVID vaccines are responsible for overall increases in cancer or other illnesses. We rate this claim False.","[('American Cancer Society, email exchange with PolitiFact, Dec. 16, 2021', 'https://www.cancer.org/cancer/soft-tissue-sarcoma/about/key-statistics.html'), ('American Cancer Society, ""Key Statistics for Soft Tissue Sarcomas, 2021""\xa0', 'No link'), ('American Cancer Society, ""ACS Journals, cancer statistics, 2020""', 'https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21590'), ('American Cancer Society, ""Cancer Facts & Figures 2021""', 'No link'), ('American Cancer Society, ""Cancer Facts & Figures 2020""', 'https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2021.html'), ('American Association for Cancer Research, ""Q&A: Ned Sharpless on COVID-19 and Cancer Prevention,"" June 2021', 'No link'), ('CDC, ""Cancer Statistics at a Glance""', 'https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2020.html'), ('USA Today, ""Fact check: False claim that cancer has spiked as a result of COVID-19 vaccines,"" Sept. 27, 2021', 'No link'), ('Factcheck.org, ""Video: Idaho Doctor Makes Baseless Claims About Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines,"" Aug. 27, 2021', 'https://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/14/6/615'), ('Health Feedback, ""No scientific evidence for claim by pathologist Ryan Cole that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system,"" Sept. 27, 2021', 'No link'), ('Mayo Clinic, ""Soft Tissue Sarcoma""', 'https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/#/AtAGlance/'), ('Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, ""Fact check: 7 myths about Covid-19 vaccines,"" Dec. 9, 2021', 'No link'), ('National Cancer Institute, ""Cancer Stat Facts: Soft Tissue including Heart Cancer""', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/09/27/fact-check-false-claim-cancer-rise-since-vaccine-rollout/8348140002/'), ('National Cancer Institute, email exchange with PolitiFact, Dec. 15, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""No, getting the COVID-19 vaccine won’t weaken your immune system,"" Dec. 10, 2021', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2021/08/video-idaho-doctor-makes-baseless-claims-about-safety-of-covid-19-vaccines/'), ('Reuters, ""Fact Check-No evidence COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer,"" Nov. 12, 2021', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""A doctor called coronavirus vaccines ‘fake.’ Now he sits on an Idaho regional health board.""

Claim on Jesse Ventura show that COVID-19 pandemic was planned is Pants on Fire
","The headline on a spooky video made this allegation about COVID-19: ""They've planned this pandemic all along!"" The user who posted the video on Facebook commented: ""Jesse Ventura warned us since 2009!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post was published July 8, but was circulating widely in December. Like another Ventura video that made a different ""planned"" claim about COVID-19, which we rated Pants on Fire, this claim is false and ridiculous. The eight-minute video shows Ventura, the former professional wrestler and former Minnesota governor, conducting an interview on a 2009 episode of the truTV show ""Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.""  The episode opens with a narrator intoning ominously: ""Jesse Ventura’s investigation into the secret society that runs the world has led to this: a meeting at a remote airstrip with Dr. Rima Laibow. The physician fled the United States in fear of the Bilderbergs’ plan to use vaccines to kill off much of the world’s population."" The annual Bilderberg Meetings, named for a hotel where the first meeting took place, are attended by political leaders, government officials and experts from industry, finance, media and academia in Europe and North America. The private gatherings are often the target of conspiracy theories. Laibow, a New Jersey psychiatrist, says in the interview she left the U.S. because she didn’t feel safe. She then makes a series of baseless and disjointed allegations, including that the World Health Organization ""has decided that we have 90% too many people"" and that it has worked since 1974 on vaccines ""to create permanent sterility""; that the U.S. government ""will induce a pandemic"" using a nasal mist vaccine that is a ""live, attenuated virus"" that will spread the flu from one person to another; and that the government will respond by saying it doesn’t have enough vaccines and so it will add squalene to existing supplies.

The case is pending. We and other fact-checkers have repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic having been planned.  Scientists who have studied the coronavirus have generally concluded that it resembles naturally occurring viruses. They have considered the possibility that the virus somehow leaked from a lab, though there’s still no conclusive evidence of its exact source.

BBC reporting error is not proof the network was part of an ‘inside job’ on 9/11
","A longstanding conspiracy theory about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks has resurfaced on social media. A widely shared Instagram post claims that a video from British public broadcaster BBC shows that the network was part of a 9/11 conspiracy. The post says, ""An astounding video uncovered from the BBC archives showed that BBC reported the collapse of WTC Building 7 over 20 minutes before it fell at 5:20 p.m. on the afternoon of the 9/11 attacks. The incredible footage shows BBC reporter Jane Stanley talking about the collapse of the Salomon Brothers building while it remains standing in the live shot behind her. Shortly after this ‘reporting error,’ BBC cut the interview short."" The caption says, ""Many inconsistencies with the events which unfolded on 9/11. This was one of them!"" Hashtags include #911insidejob and #conspiracytheory. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) BBC did report the collapse of Building 7 before it actually occurred, but not because the network had inside information or was intentionally misleading the audience. BBC relied on an incorrect report from Reuters that said the building had collapsed, for which Reuters later issued a correction, according to a BBC story published on the 20-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. Because of persistent theories that the BBC was ""actively participating in some sort of attempt to manipulate the audience,"" BBC editor Richard Porter addressed the false theory in two 2007 blog posts. The scene on 9/11 was chaotic, and BBC staff ""were talking directly to the emergency services and monitoring local and national media… and there was a fairly consistent picture being painted of Building 7 in danger of collapse,"" Porter wrote. The 47-story office building was on fire for seven hours before collapsing at 5:20 p.m., according to an investigative report from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The fires were caused by debris from the collapse of 1 World Trade Center, the North Tower. Beginning around 4:15 p.m., CNN and other American networks were reporting that Building 7 had collapsed or was collapsing, according to Porter’s blog post. The reporter named in the Instagram post, Jane Standley — whose last name is misspelled in the post — ""doesn't remember minute-by-minute what she said or did — like everybody else that day she was trying to make sense of what she was seeing; what she was being told; and what was being told to her by colleagues in London who were monitoring feeds and wires services,"" BBC editor Porter wrote. Porter concluded, ""If we reported the building had collapsed before it had done so, it would have been an error — no more than that."" An Instagram post says a BBC video shows that the network was part of a 9/11 conspiracy. BBC reported the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 before it actually occurred.

A Florida county GOP says a Tampa Dem is a communist. That’s ‘completely false and indefensible’
","As Florida Republicans seek to redraw congressional boundaries to give them an advantage in 2022, they are targeting a Democrat in what could become a swing district by hammering her with the communist label. A billboard in Hillsborough County shows a photo of U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, and says: ""Communism: Tampa’s #1 Enemy."" It adds: ""Vote Republican."" The chairman of the county GOP group, Jim Waurishuk, told the Tampa Bay Times that it labeled Castor a communist because of her position on the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution that seeks to propose solutions to climate change. But that rationale doesn’t make sense. The Hillsborough County GOP, which brought former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to headline its annual fundraiser six years ago, has veered to the right. The group is now defined by its loyalty to Trump and some of his loudest supporters, such as U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. When the Tampa Bay times asked Waurishuk for the group’s rationale for calling Castor a communist, he noted Castor’s role as chair of the House Select Committee on Climate Crisis, which he said is ""the leading proponent for the Green New Deal"" which he called ""a Trojan Horse for Communism."" Waurishuk described the Green New Deal as legislation with an ""ultimate objective to give government total unprecedented power over people’s lives and our entire economy."" He said ""small business owners and entrepreneurs would be forever crushed under the enormous costs and bureaucratic inefficiencies and enforcement tactics of a Marxist styled economy."" (We contacted Waurishuk to ask if he had anything to add to his comments he sent to the Tampa Bay Times and we did not get a reply by our deadline.) That’s a distortion of both Castor’s record and the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is a resolution — a non-binding proposal — and not actual legislation. And Castor was not among the roughly 100 cosponsors of the resolution when U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced it in 2019 and in 2021. Senate Republicans killed the resolution in 2019, and it hasn’t moved forward this year. Castor has been a leader on proposing solutions to climate change. In late 2018, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, leader of the House Democrats, named Castor to serve as chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.  Castor told E&E News in December 2018 that Green New Deal advocates ""have some terrific ideas,"" however ""that's not going to be our sole focus.""   In June 2020, Castor’s committee released a 500-page report that shared some goals with the Green New Deal, such as cutting carbon dioxide emissions. It also called for improving the flood insurance program, helping farmers adapt to climate change and adding jobs.  But Castor’s work to address climate change doesn’t mean she is a communist, professors who are experts in political theory or taxation told PolitiFact. ""I will be blunt. The claim is just ridiculous,"" said Oxana Shevel, who teaches at Tufts University about the formerly Communist region surrounding Russia. ""Communism is a political system centered around one-party rule and state ownership of all economic resources. To assert that supporting any particular solutions to climate change — be it the Green New Deal or anything else for that matter — equals communism makes no sense whatsoever."" Ted Henken, who teaches sociology and Latin American studies at Baruch College, told us that ""regulating economic activity for the common good (as in environmental legislation that limits pollution) is actually beneficial for sustainable economic growth over the long term and completely different from the government takeover of the economy via state companies and the elimination of the market."" Communism is the elimination of the market and private property and their replacement by an all-powerful, bureaucratic plan, Henken said. Communism seeks to establish a system of collective control over the means of production and resources. ""Nothing in Castor’s record even remotely hints that she advocates this,"" Henken said. Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University, told us that calling Castor a communist based on her position on climate change is ""completely false and indefensible."" ""There is a broad scientific consensus that climate change is potentially disastrous and needs to be addressed,"" Shaviro said. ""To call this ‘communism’ is not only false and insane, but seems to imply, falsely, that only communists want to save humanity. It's like saying that the polio vaccine, or good nutrition and exercise, or trying to get a good night's sleep, or taking care of your children, are ‘communist’ ideas."" An advisor for Castor, Clay Phillips, sent us a statement in which Castor described herself as a ""progressive capitalist"" and a ""lifelong Democrat."" The statement pointed to efforts by Castor to protect the environment, including a bill to ban oil drilling in federal waters off Florida’s coast, and said the climate action plan would ""create millions of good-paying jobs in future years."" A billboard by the Hillsborough County GOP refers to Castor as a communist.  The billboard provides no explanation for its conclusion, but the group’s chair told the Tampa Bay Times that it used the label because Castor is a ""the leading proponent for the Green New Deal."" That’s wrong on many levels. First, Castor isn’t a leading proponent of the Green New Deal or even one of the roughly 100 House members who cosponsored the resolution in 2019 and 2021.  Second, communism refers to a system in which a government takes over private property and controls production. We haven’t seen any evidence that Castor has called for anything remotely resembling that type of political system. Castor’s work to propose solutions to combat climate change does not make her a communist.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Story about California store owner pricing items at $951 to prosecute thieves is satire
","A recent uptick of robberies in Los Angeles has some blaming the county’s zero-bail policy for lower-level offenses. The policy, enacted as a way to reduce jail crowding during the COVID-19 pandemic, has remained in effect in Los Angeles County even as California’s statewide emergency zero-bail order expired in 2020.  Meanwhile, under the state’s Proposition 47, which voters passed by referendum in 2014, theft and shoplifting crimes are classified as misdemeanors instead of felonies if the stolen property’s value does not exceed $950.

Joe Biden wrong that he was against Afghanistan war from the start
","President Joe Biden has been criticized for how he handled the U.S. military exit from Afghanistan in August. But Biden has said he remains convinced that it was the right thing to do. During a CBS News interview that was primarily about first lady Jill Biden, the president referenced his past stance on the Afghanistan war. ""I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning,"" the president told Rita Braver in a segment aired on CBS’ ""Sunday Morning"" on Dec. 12. ""We're spending $300 million a week in Afghanistan over 20 years."" A reader asked us to fact-check Biden’s stated position on the war, so we did. The record shows that Biden’s claim was wrong. Biden was called out for a similar assertion during the Democratic presidential primary in 2019. Biden told an editorial board meeting of New Hampshire’s Seacoast Media Group that ""I’m the guy that — as has been pointed out repeatedly — that thought we should not be going into Afghanistan."" At the time, CNN fact-checked Biden and found the assertion to be incomplete at best. The Biden campaign told CNN that Biden had been skeptical of the U.S. role in Afghanistan, including opposing then-President Barack Obama’s ""surge"" of additional troops in 2009, when Biden was Obama’s vice president. The New York Times reported that Biden argued against a surge in internal debates. However, as a senator in 2001, Biden did vote for the initial U.S. invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks. When the Authorization for Use of Military Force came up in the Senate three days after the attacks, it passed, 98-0, with Biden voting in favor. While it’s possible to parse Biden’s 2019 statement as being somewhat consistent with his 2001 vote, it’s impossible to do so for what he told Braver — that ""I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning."" The war began with that congressional vote, and Biden voted in favor of it. Over the next year, Biden worked from his perch as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman to provide humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, and he sometimes offered words of caution about the balance between military efforts and humanitarian assistance. For instance, he said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in October 2001 that unless the bombing of Afghanistan ends ""sooner rather than later,"" the U.S. risks looking like a ""high-tech bully."" Still, Biden did not flatly oppose a military response in Afghanistan.  ""America stands united behind our men and women in the military, who are putting themselves in harm's way,"" Biden said after the U.S. air assault began. ""I join all Americans in supporting President (George W.) Bush.""   And as late as May 2002, Biden issued a statement welcoming a U.N. Security Council vote to extend the international military force in Kabul and calling for the force’s mandate to be broadened. ""I'm glad that the U.N. has extended the mandate of the peacekeepers in Afghanistan — but if this unit is not greatly expanded in both size and scope, there may soon be no real peace left to keep,"" he said. ""Unless we provide the necessary diplomatic, military, and political support to extend (the force’s) mandate into other key cities and transit routes, we may well see Afghanistan fall back into the very sort of chaos and warlordism that spawned the Taliban in the first place."" Biden’s stance on the war in Iraq was similar. He voted for a resolution that authorized the use of force in Iraq, saying he supported the president. But he grew more critical as the years wore on. PolitiFact rated his 2019 claim that he opposed the war ""immediately, the moment it started,"" False.  The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Biden said, ""I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning."" The record tells a different story. Biden, along with every senator, voted to launch the war, three days after the 9/11 attacks. He opposed aspects of the war as vice president, particularly a troop surge 10 years later.

No, the COVID-19 vaccines do not cause AIDS
","Ever since the COVID-19 vaccines were introduced in late 2020, people have falsely claimed that they cause all sorts of health problems, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to autoimmune disorders. Claims circulating online recently add AIDS to that list. ""The AIDS hysteria of the 80s has been totally forgotten,"" one post shared on Facebook reads. ""It's been eclipsed by current C0\/lD insanity in which millions are running to inject themselves with an experimental product that causes AIDS (!!)"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post uses a misspelling of COVID, using numerals and slashes, a tactic social media users employ to circumvent tools that help detect COVID-related misinformation online. The AIDS claim is bogus. AIDS is an immune disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The COVID-19 shots do not introduce HIV into the body or cause AIDS.  HIV attacks the body’s immune system and can lead to AIDS if left untreated. AIDS is considered the most severe phase of HIV infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Data from clinical trials do not show that the COVID-19 vaccines create any increased risk for AIDS, nor is there evidence that those infected with HIV are more likely to develop AIDS after receiving one of the vaccines. Real world data from the billions of COVID-19 vaccinations around the world also haven’t shown that the vaccinated are more likely to get AIDS than the unvaccinated. Medical experts confirmed with PolitiFact that there is no relationship between the COVID-19 vaccines and AIDS. ""AIDS has only one cause, HIV,"" said Michael Imperiale, a professor in the microbiology and immunology department at the University of Michigan. ""This is because HIV replication destroys the immune system. This is why HIV-infected people are given antiviral drugs, to prevent them from getting AIDS."" Since the vaccines don’t contain HIV, there is ""no way"" any COVID-19 vaccine can cause HIV infection or AIDS, said Dr. David Wohl, an infectious disease expert and professor specializing in HIV research at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ""The COVID-19 vaccines do not cause immunosuppression — a decline in immune function leaving a person vulnerable to opportunistic infections,"" Wohl added. ""In fact, the COVID-19 vaccines spur immune function to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection."" Research from the CDC and others show that the vaccines boost the body’s immune response. For example, one Aug. 13 CDC report found that people who had been infected with COVID-19 in 2020 got a dramatic boost in virus-killing immune cells later because they were vaccinated. ""Vaccines stimulate the immune system,"" Imperiale said. ""They do not destroy it."" A Facebook post claims that the COVID-19 vaccines cause AIDS. There is no evidence to support this. Only HIV causes AIDS, and the vaccines don’t contain HIV. Medical experts say the vaccines do not make people more susceptible to HIV or AIDS and that the shots bolster the immune system.

","An article from an anti-vaccine website claims that thousands of fetuses died after their mothers were administered the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.  ""2,809 Dead Babies in VAERS Following COVID Shots as New Documents Prove Pfizer, the FDA, and the CDC Knew the Shots Were Not Safe for Pregnant Women,"" reads the headline from Health Impact News, which has spread misleading information about vaccines in the past.   The article was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article claims that a government database that collects information about negative health events that occur after people get vaccinations is proof that the COVID-19 vaccines are not safe for pregnant women, and that federal public health authorities knew this.  This is not accurate.  Health Impact News got its numbers through an anti-vaccine organization, the National Vaccine Information Center, which offers its own search tool for data from the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System, or VAERS. VAERS collects information from the public and health care providers about health conditions that occur after vaccination. Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. The reports become accessible to the public in VAERS, without the government verifying whether the vaccine was the cause of the event described in the report.   As PolitiFact  has reported, the database is a tool for researchers to detect patterns that warrant further study, but its data is frequently misused to spread misinformation.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which runs VAERS with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warns users of its search engine that the data alone cannot be used to establish a causal relationship between a vaccine and a particular adverse event, and that people who get vaccines may have health events or develop illnesses in ways that have nothing to do with the vaccines. People who use the NVIC’s search tool instead of the CDC’s, however, are shown a link that leads them to the government’s disclaimers and warnings about the data. But they are not required to read it or to check that they have read and understand these limitations before accessing the data, as is required of people who search the original federal database. As for the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women, the CDC and doctors who focus on maternal health and pediatrics recommend that pregnant women receive the vaccine.  The CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant people, and says that scientific evidence shows that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh any known or potential risk during pregnancy. The CDC cites studies that show that the vaccine is effective in pregnant people, and that there is no increased risk of harm to mothers or their babies.  The CDC also warns that pregnant and recently pregnant people who are infected with COVID-19 are at a greater risk for severe illness compared with nonpregnant people, though the overall risk is low. ""Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 are at increased risk for preterm birth and stillbirth and might be at increased risk for other pregnancy complications,"" according to the CDC.  The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that pregnant people be vaccinated, and said that a CDC registry of pregnant people who were vaccinated did not report any neonatal deaths. This finding is based on a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine of nearly 4,000 pregnant people who were vaccinated. ""There is no evidence of adverse maternal or fetal effects from vaccinating pregnant individuals with COVID-19 vaccine, and a growing body of data demonstrate the safety of such use,"" according to the ACOG.  The American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations of health care providers urged vaccination for pregnant women in a joint statement released in August: ""Maternal care experts want the best outcomes for their patients, and that means both a healthy parent and a healthy baby. Data from tens of thousands of reporting individuals have shown that the COVID-19 vaccine is both safe and effective when administered during pregnancy. The same data have been equally reassuring when it comes to infants born to vaccinated individuals.""  PolitiFact also found in August that claims about COVID-19 vaccines leading to miscarriages are not based in science.  A headline from Health Impact News says, ""2,809 Dead Babies in VAERS Following COVID Shots as New Documents Prove Pfizer, the FDA, and the CDC Knew the Shots Were Not Safe for Pregnant Women."" The claim is based on reports to the government’s VAERS database. Those reports are not verified, and they are often used to spread misinformation about vaccines. They do not prove that the shots are dangerous to babies or pregnant women. The CDC and health care providers who work with pregnant patients and infants recommend vaccination, based on scientific studies of people who have been vaccinated and the risks associated with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We rate this claim False.  RELATED LINK: Claim about 920 miscarriages caused by COVID-19 vaccination lacks evidence  ","[('Health Impact News, ""2,809 Dead Babies in VAERS Following COVID Shots as New Documents Prove Pfizer, the FDA, and the CDC Knew the Shots Were Not Safe for Pregnant Women,"" Dec. 4, 2021.

No, the military hasn’t been in charge since the 2020 presidential election
","A Facebook video that’s being shared and viewed widely makes outrageous and unfounded claims that don’t track with reality.  ""December fifth, the Nuremberg 2 trials have started against world leaders for crimes against humanity,"" someone can be heard saying.  Later: ""The military’s actually been in charge since November 3rd when troops, yes, they checked out the watermark ballots and they said that Trump had won over 80% of the vote.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is wrong.  President Joe Biden was elected in November 2020, and allegations that he stole the election from former President Donald Trump are unfounded.  In fact, an investigation published Dec. 14 by the Associated Press, which reviewed every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump, found fewer than 475 cases. They would not have changed the outcome of the election.  ""The cases could not throw the outcome into question even if all the potentially fraudulent votes were for Biden, which they were not, and even if those ballots were actually counted, which in most cases they were not,"" the AP reported. We aren’t sure what the video is referencing when it mentions ""watermarked ballots,"" but we previously looked into a claim that the Trump administration ""put secret watermarks on official ballots to trick cheating Democrats"" and found it baseless. There is also no evidence to support the claim that the military has been in charge since the presidential election.  It’s baseless.

Some migrants being tested for COVID at Southern border, but only if they’re sick
","The discovery of a new variant of COVID-19 -- dubbed Omicron -- has once again set the world on edge, with leaders scrambling to keep people safe amid questions about just how dangerous the new strain is. In the U.S., President Joe Biden responded by limiting travel from some affected countries, but that only prompted criticism about what the U.S. is not doing at the southern border. On Nov. 30, 2021, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, tweeted this about Biden: ""POTUS shut down travel from 8 countries in response to the Omicron variant, but he refuses to require a #COVID19 test for illegal immigrants crossing our Southern border.""  For the purpose of this fact-check, we’re going to look into both parts of Grothman’s claim -- Did Biden put restrictions on eight countries? And are the migrants coming into the U.S. via the southern border not being tested for COVID?  Is Grothman correct? Generally speaking, yes. But there is considerable information missing.  Let’s start with the first part of the claim. Did Biden block travel from eight countries upon the discovery of the Omicron variant?  According to a Nov. 26, 2021 proclamation, travelers from eight African countries were indeed blocked from entry into the U.S. to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those countries were  Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The travel restrictions do not apply to U.S. citizens, however.  In his proclamation, Biden says the travel advisory is necessary to protect the U.S., because African countries had not yet been able to conduct genomic sequencing on the variant to detect how much more transmissible it may be. So that part of the claim is on point. But what about the other part?  Report found that most migrants not tested for COVID after crossing borders Grothman said in a Dec. 3, 2021 interview that he learned the U.S Border Patrol wasn’t testing all immigrants entering the U.S. during a visit this year to a facility in Yuma, Arizona. He said he was told by agents that if a person declined a test, the agents weren’t able to press the issue any further.  When asked about the statement, Grothman’s office also sent over a list of other sources that noted that testing for COVID hasn’t been required at the border.  One was a Sept. 10, 2021 memo from the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Health Services, which said an inspection found that U.S. Customs and Border Control was not testing migrants, and was not required to do so, relying instead on local public health systems to test symptomatic individuals. The memo also noted that the DHS does not have the authority to enforce testing procedures at the border, either.  Grothman’s office also shared a link to an April 28, 2021 New York Times report that included similar information: U.S. authorities were failing to test migrants crossing into the U.S. via the southern border, creating situations ripe for new transmission of the virus.  The Times report said officials cited insufficient time and space to conduct more widespread testing – but it is from nearly nine months ago.  Meanwhile, in a more recent fact-check, from August 2021, PolitiFact National noted: ""COVID-19 testing protocols have existed at the border under both the present and former administrations. Testing is done via a patchwork of federal agencies, local governments, organizations and contractors at various stages of the immigration process.  ""In April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told PolitiFact that it works with state authorities, local authorities and non-governmental organizations to ensure that ‘100% of noncitizens’ are tested for COVID-19 ‘at some point during their immigration journey.’ The agency also has told PolitiFact that a negative coronavirus test is required by the federal government before entry to the U.S."" So, the picture on testing at the border is a difficult one to get a firm handle on. Even the most recent item cited by Grothman – the OIG memo on DHS and other agencies – noted that in many cases local governments are being relied upon for testing.
  Grothman claimed that Biden halted travel from eight countries due to the discovery of the Omicron variant, but was still allowing migrants crossing the Southern border to go untested.  Biden did halt travel from eight African countries following the discovery of the variant there, in hopes of slowing the spread into the U.S.  Meanwhile, at the southern border reports have shown there is no widespread testing by federal agencies there. Instead, to the degree testing is occurring, local governments are being relied upon to do it. So Grothman is a bit off the mark there. Our definition of Half True is a ""statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.","[('Glenn Grothman, Twitter, Nov. 30, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/RepGrothman/status/1465716205864505348'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('The White House, ""A Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus Disease 2019,"" Nov. 26, 2021', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('Phone conversation with Glenn Grothman, Dec. 3, 2021', 'https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2021-09/OIG-21-60-Sep21.pdf'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('Office of the Inspector General, ""DHS needs to enhance its COVID-19 response at the Southwest Border,"" Sept. 10, 2021', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/us/coronavirus-migrants-testing.html'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Covid on the Border: Migrants Aren’t Tested on Arrival in U.S."" April 28, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/13/ken-paxton/biden-administration-not-even-testing-migrants-rel/'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/14/glenn-grothman/some-migrants-being-tested-covid-southern-border-o/
