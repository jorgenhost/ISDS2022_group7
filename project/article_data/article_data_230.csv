Alan Grayson says state GOP smells worse than a rotting carcass
","When one of his challengers switched from being a Republican to the Tea Party, Orlando Democrat Alan Grayson issued a news release that included another memorable series of one-liners. Yes, he's the guy who compared former Vice President Dick Cheney to a vampire and called Sarah Palin a wild Alaskan dingbat.""I read (Peg) Dunmire’s announcement,"" Grayson said in a March 23, 2010, press release. ""I then forwarded it to the Guinness Book of World Records, for consideration under the category 'Most Consecutive Cliches.' This kind of right-wing drivel gave America $4-a-gallon gas and two endless wars, and drove us all to the brink of national bankruptcy. Was she living in a cave for eight years?""Grayson then explained why he thought Dunmire decided not to run as a Republican. ""Dunmire is not running as a Republican, because the Republican Party of Florida smells worse than a rotting carcass,"" he said. ""The stench reaches all the way to the Georgia state line. For goodness' sake, on the day that their state leader resigned in disgrace, a 'Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters.""At PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to thoroughly analyze Grayson's claim about the Guinness Book of World Records. But alas, there is no ""Most Consecutive Cliche"" category. (We checked).So we settled on Grayson's accusation that on the day former Republican Party of Florida chairman Jim Greer resigned, a ""Shred-It"" truck was spotted at the party headquarters.Greer, who was chosen by Gov. Charlie Crist, resigned under pressure from big GOP donors Jan. 5, 2010, after a series of stories documented troubled spending patterns of state party political donations. Greer suggested he was a victim of a witch hunt.On the day he resigned, reporters working in Tallahassee did notice a white ""Shred-It"" truck parked outside RPOF headquarters. Indeed, it was a mobile paper shredding company.Whitney Ray of the Capitol News Service filed the first report that day: ""It was a quiet and somber day outside the Republican Party of Florida headquarters, the only noise was traffic, and the sound of a paper shredding truck. ""The driver came out wheeling an empty cart and a blue bag, one hour before embattled chairman Jim Greer made this announcement, on a conference call with reporters."" A party spokeswoman said the timing of the Shred-It visit was just a coincidence. The mobile shredder comes monthly and just happened to coincide with the day Greer was announcing his resignation.But there was the image nevertheless.In mocking Republicans and his new Tea Party challenger, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said that on the day the state party chairman resigned, ""a 'Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters."" It did. We rate his statement True.Now about those Guinness world records ...",[<zip object at 0x000002809749F500>],/factchecks/2010/mar/30/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-florida-gop-rotting-carcass/

Crist says Reagan was a Democrat before converting to GOP
","Battling suggestions that he's waffling on Republican principles, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist reminded listeners in a televised debate Sunday that Ronald Reagan was once a Democrat.The line turned up in a three-way chatter between FOX News Sunday moderator Chris Wallace and the two Republican U.S. Senate candidates, in which Wallace asked the governor whether he would support rival Marco Rubio or run as an independent -- if he lost the GOP primary. For the record, Crist said he’d support the GOP nominee and that he wouldn’t run as an unaffiliated candidate.Here is an excerpt: WALLACE: Well, I'm going to get -- I'm going to -- I'll give you an opportunity for a final statement. I just want to say, though, you are saying you are going to run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. You will not run on the no party affiliation line.CRIST: That's right. That's right. That's what I'm saying. RUBIO: Chris, if I may, the governor likes to call himself a Reagan Republican. I don't ever recall Reagan being questioned about running as an independent. But Ronald Reagan asked a very important question--CRIST: Actually, Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.  We wanted to find out whether the late Republican icon Ronald Reagan was actually a registered Democrat, or whether he was an ideological one.We turned to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Library, in Simi Valley, Calif. The library's Web site notes Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, after stumping for Richard Nixon as a Democrat. It tells the story of Reagan making a speech at a Democrats for Nixon event and being interrupted and asked if he had registered as a Republican. He responded no. That's when ""down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared I'm a registrar and placed a registration card in front of him. In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party,'' according to Web site.Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at the Reagan library, explained more in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida.""Yes, this is true. He switched to Republican in 1962,'' Giller wrote, noting a quote in which Reagan complained, ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''Giller said Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as that of Nixon in 1960 ""while remaining a Democrat.""At the White House Web site, the biography of Reagan makes a brief reference to the ideological evolution in the fourth paragraph: ""As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over the issue of Communism in the film industry; his political views shifted from liberal to conservative."" And then Reagan, noted for his quips, said it himself in a Sept. 28, 1982, news conference exchange with ABC White House correspondent Sam Donaldson over whether the White House was to blame for the continuing U.S. recession.Donaldson: ""Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes in the past and you have blamed the Congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?"" Reagan: ""Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat.""White House press corps: (Laughter.)Historian Edward Yager, a government professor at Western Kentucky University and author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, said Reagan ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for FDR in 1932, when he was 21.""Yager said he’s never seen copies of the voter registration cards, but noted ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat and that ""he has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for FDR four times, then for Truman."" Reagan was a Democrat, added Yager, even when he voted for Dwight D. Eisenhower.Reagan had considered switching by 1960, said Yager, but there were some in the Nixon camp who ""thought he might be more effective (as a supporter) by maintaining his Democrat registration and affiliation and cutting into Democratic voters."" It may be among the great, forgotten flip-flops in political history that evolved into a laugh line for a man venerated for his ideological adherence to the principles of the Grand Ole Party. But Crist was correct when he invoked it. We find his claim to be True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809739EC40>],/factchecks/2010/mar/30/charlie-crist/crist-says-reagan-was-democrat-converting-gop/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Education', 'Health Care', 'Lindsey Graham']","
New bill doesn't alter interest rate
","Oddly enough, student loans have become part of the health care debate.Tucked into the package of health care ""fixes"" passed by Congress is a provision that would eliminate government subsidies to private lenders and expand federal lending to students.Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, aren't keen on the development. He says the government is effectively taking over the student loan process and that students will actually end up paying more for their loans as a result.""The average student will be spending $1,700 to $1,800 more during the life of their loan because of this surcharge,"" Graham said on the March 24, 2010, episode of On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. ""From the students' point of view, it's going to cost you $1,700 to $1,800 more to pay your student loan off, and all the money goes to the federal government.""Graham's statement deserves a little background on how students have been getting loans to pay for their education. At some schools, students go directly to the U.S. Department of Education for their loan. But at others, students go through a private lender to get the same assistance. For nearly 45 years, the government has been paying private lending services to administer loans granted through the Federal Family Education Loan program. But the package of fixes, which President Barack Obama has signed, eliminates those payments and expands direct federal lending to students through the Department of Education. According to the House Education and Labor Committee, the effort will save $61 billion over 10 years, with a good chunk of that savings being used to expand current federal student lending programs, including Pell Grants. Approximately $9 billion will be used to offset some of the health care bill's cost. Graham's reasoning has to do with interest rates. In the same interview, he said that the Education Department borrows money for the loans from the Treasury Department at an interest rate of 2.6 percent. But students will then have to pay 6.4 percent in interest on those loans. In fact, Graham is slightly off here; the government borrows money at a rate of 2.8 percent while students pay interest at a rate of 6.8 percent on unsubsidized government loans. (Subsidized loans have a lower interest rate.) Furthermore, the interest rate the Education Department pays on money it borrows from the Treasury varies, and can be larger in the long run. But regardless, Graham's underlying point is this: As a result of the health care bill, the government will be making more of a profit off the interest students pay on student loans than it did before.We called and e-mailed Graham's office repeatedly for sourcing on his claim, but our inquiries were unanswered. Apparently Graham's numbers come from an amendment offered by Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander during the Senate's debate over a package of fixes. His amendment would have forced the chamber to send the bill back to committee and amend it to reduce interest rates on student loans by 1.5 percent, from 6.8 percent to 5.3 percent. That interest rate reduction would have saved students in Tennessee upwards of $1,700 to $1,800 in interest over 10 years, according to Alexander. But those numbers were specific to Tennessee, and Alexander was making the point that lowering the interest rate on student loans could save students money in the long run. But beyond those two points, we take issue with the fact that Graham leaves out the important detail that the new bill does not change the interest rate students pay on their loans, according to the education policy experts we spoke with.""This bill does not change interest rates in any way shape or form,"" said Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation. ""They are already in law and they're going to stay that way.""So to say that students are somehow paying $1,700 or $1,800 more is wrong. Before Congress voted to eliminate subsidies for the Federal Family Education Loan, students paid 6.8 percent on their unsubsidized federal loans. Now that the bill is passed, students will still pay 6.8 percent interest on those loans. There is no ""surcharge"" in the bill, as Graham says. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BCE500>],/factchecks/2010/mar/30/lindsey-graham/new-bill-doesnt-alter-interest-rate/
"['LGBTQ', 'Texas', 'Liberty Institute']","
Liberty Institute says a 22-year-old gay man is more protected than an 8-year-old child under the hate crimes laws
","
Criticizing federal hate crimes law, the right-leaning Liberty Institute sniffs at extending additional legal protections to victims attacked because of their sexual orientation or gender. 
The group says online that a protected classes contradict equal protection under the law, adding that ""many see the expansion of hate crimes laws as a tool to silence opposition to homosexuality and eventually silence pastors from speaking Biblically on the subject."" 
""Hate crimes law put citizens in different classes of people and protect some more than others,"" the group says on its Web site. ""For example, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child. Liberty Institute believes that all crimes should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law without putting citizens in classes, attempting to protect some more than others, and attempting to punish people's thoughts."" 
Eight year olds, less protected than adults? 
Jonathan Saenz, the group's Austin-based director of legislative affairs, pointed to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal legal protections against violent acts motivated by sexual orientation, gender, and disability. 
""Hate crimes laws give more protection under law for members of the special classes of people,"" Saenz said. ""Age is not included as a protected class for victims, sexual orientation is included as a protected class. So, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child."" 
Some background: The 2009 act is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay college student who died after being kidnapped, pistol-whipped and tied to a Wyoming ranch fence in near-freezing temperatures, and James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged behind a car to his death the same year by three white men near Byrd's home in Jasper, Texas. 
The law lets the U.S. Department of Justice help states investigate and prosecute hate crimes. In the case of five states that don't have hate crime laws, federal prosecutors can prosecute the crimes independently. 
Congress earlier put in place a law directing government to create enhanced penalties for hate crimes — motivated by actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation — that occur on federal property. The combined effect of the Shepard Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, adopted in 1994, means that someone who attacks a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man because of his sexual orientation could be subject to a tougher sentence than someone who attacks an eight year old. 
But that's just considering those federal hate crime laws, not all the other applicable state and federal laws. 
Bill Allison, director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, rates the Liberty Institute's comparison as bogus because various state and federal laws provide harsher sentences for a wide range of groups. 
Allison said: ""We give extra protection and punishment to pregnant women, to police and firefighters to children under six... the list goes on and on."" 
The Texas Penal Code, for example, increases the sentence for someone who assaults anyone 14 or younger or, conversely, 65 and older. Criminals who harm a pregnant woman's unborn child could also face additional charges. 
And under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, a judge can require a convict to take a course in tolerance if arson, criminal mischief or reckless damage or destruction are proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been committed against someone because of that person's race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, gender or sexual preference. 
Another Texas law: The minimum term of imprisonment increases to 25 years if the criminal is convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a child younger than six. 
Why have special laws for people who are attacked because of their race, sexual orientation or gender? 
Trevor Thomas, deputy communications director at the Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, offers this explanation: ""Sentencing enhancements for hate crimes recognize that hate-crime perpetrators commit violent acts as a means of sending a message to society ... While a random act of violence is a tragic event that devastates, the enhancements reflect this understanding that hate crimes are unique in that they victimize an entire community of people."" 
Applying hate crimes law is complicated. If a straight man and a gay man get in a fight, it's not a hate crime unless the straight man attacked the gay man because he is homosexual, Allison said. 
In other words, a healthy 22-year-old man wouldn't be protected under the Shepard Act unless the prosecutor can prove that he was attacked because of his sexual orientation. 
George Dix, the chair of criminal law at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""Clearly the law does permit prosecutors, judges and juries to impose more severe penalties where the victims of crimes are in certain classes. Insofar as the severity of penalties reflects an effort to extend greater protections to victims, I suppose to could be said that the law is making greater effort to protect persons in the specific 'classes.'"" 
But the law does this for a great many classes, and not just those containing people, Dix said. Under a Texas theft statute, he said, someone who steals an exotic fowl could be more severely punished than if they steal a chicken. Or, stealing fuel from a gas station could be more prosecuted than stealing it from a car. So the station owner would be more protected than the owner of the affected car. 
""Our criminal laws are full of distinctions that result in part in extending more protections to certain classes of people. No reasonable person could argue that this is inherently inappropriate,"" said Dix. 
Dix helped us reason how someone who assaulted a gay, adult male — meaning the perpetrator intentionally and knowingly caused him bodily injury, but not serious bodily injury — might fare in court in contrast to how they'd fare if they assaulted an eight year old. 
Per the Texas Penal Code, the attack on the child would be a third-degree felony, Dix said, punishable by imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years or less than 2 years. The attack on the 22 year old would, generally, be a Class A misdemeanor, he said, normally punishable by a jail term of no more than a year. Generally, hate crimes law ""makes the offense punishable under the next highest category,"" he said. ""But for Class A misdemeanors, the effect seems to be to instead impose a minimum term of confinement of 180 days. 
Summing up: Lots of special classes have extra legal protections — many of which existed before protections were extended based on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation. 
The bottom line: Under the Shepard Act, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man could — not would, as the Liberty Institute states — be more protected than an attack on an 8-year-old. But it takes a contortion to reach that conclusion. The statement incorrectly intimates that hate crimes laws are the only ones on the books, ignoring the web of other state and federal criminal laws offering protections to vulnerable groups of people — including children.

Marco Rubio says Charlie Crist worked with ACORN to restore voting rights for felons
","In their first U.S. Senate primary debate broadcast on FOX News Sunday, former state House speaker Marco Rubio continued to bash Gov. Charlie Crist's conservative credentials.""In 2006, governor, I voted for you because I trusted you when you said you would be a Jeb Bush Republican,"" Rubio said during the March 28, 2010, debate moderated by FOX's Chris Wallace. ""Your record was something very different. You signed a budget that raised taxes. You tried to (propose) the cap and trade system in Florida. You appointed liberal supreme court justices to our supreme court.""In addition to that, you worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida.""We've already checked several claims from the Crist/Rubio showdown. In this item we wanted to explore Rubio's claim about felon voting rights, and Crist's alleged association with the community organizing group known as ACORN.First, on felon voter rights.Restoring voting rights for felons was a Crist campaign promise in 2006.And sure enough, in 2007 Crist and two state Cabinet members -- Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson, a Republican, and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democrat -- agreed to relax rules that kept felons from voting. Florida at the time was one of three states that required all felons to go through a cumbersome process requesting clemency, which dates back to 1868, to regain their civil rights -- which include the right to vote, serve on a jury, run for public office or apply for a professional license.Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican and the fourth member of the state clemency board, opposed the changes. The new rules automatically granted civil rights to an estimated 30,000 men and women whose clemency cases have been awaiting action, so long as they completed all terms of their sentences, including payment of restitution.""I believe in the appropriate punishment. I'm Chain Gang Charlie,"" Crist said, referencing a nickname he earned for proposing to restore chain gangs to Florida. ""But when someone pays their debt to society, it is paid in full.""The new rules didn't go as far as some wanted -- Maine and Vermont allow even incarcerated felons the right to vote -- but by June 2008 Crist said more than 115,000 ex-offenders had regained their civil rights.But what about the association with the big, bad wolf of social issue advocacy groups -- ACORN.ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, also faced questions -- mainly from conservatives -- about voter registration drives.The allegations caused an uproar across the country, and led Congress to cut off grant funding to the group. The group had three offices in Florida -- Margate in Broward County, Orlando and Miami.Crist has been tied to ACORN in the past. The Huffington Post reported that Crist partnered with ACORN in March 2008 for a ""Homeownership Promotes The Economy"" task force. Crist also met with ACORN leaders to discuss the foreclosure crisis, the St. Petersburg Times reported. And in October 2008, Crist downplayed concerns from the Republican National Committee that the integrity of Florida's voting system is at risk thanks to the registration efforts of ACORN.That was at least enough of a connection to prompt a letter in 2009 from then-underdog candidate Rubio.""The St. Petersburg Times also reported yesterday that your office may have partnered with ACORN in the past on several initiatives, including your 2007 effort to restore voting rights to convicted felons in Florida,"" Rubio wrote Crist on Sept. 17, 2009. ""I believe it is now in the best interest of all Floridians for your office to provide a thorough accounting of its relationship with ACORN and what, if any, influence ACORN may have had in any actions you have taken on behalf of the people of Florida.""In his letter, Rubio referenced a St. Petersburg Times report from Sept. 16, 2009. The only item discussing ACORN and Crist -- an online blog entry -- noted the Huffington Post item about Crist's choice not to attack ACORN ahead of the 2008 election. It also mentions that ACORN approved of Crist's effort to restore felon's rights, but it did not say he and the group worked together to do that. So we went to Stephanie Porta, ACORN's former Florida director. Porta said the Florida offices have been closed since December 2009.Porta laughed when she heard Rubio's claim. (She knows that ACORN is a pejorative in most Republican circles).""We've always been supportive of felon rights,"" Porta said. ""We help people get their rights restored. But we never worked with the Crist campaign or Crist to make it happen.""""We were just as shocked as everybody else that he did it,"" Porta said, noting that she ultimately hoped Crist would have gone further.In their first debate, Rubio tried to nick Crist's conservative credentials by claiming Crist worked with the beleaguered social advocacy group ACORN on a plan to restore felon voter rights in Florida. But we found no evidence that he did work with ACORN on felon voter rights and the Rubio campaign provided none itself. In fact, ACORN's top Florida executive said the group had nothing to do Crist's plan and was surprised he was considering it at all.

Bachmann claims New England Journal of Medicine survey found 30 percent of doctors would quit if health reform bill passed
","On CBS's Face the Nation on March 28, 2010, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said she will now work to repeal the health care reform bill recently signed by President Barack Obama. ""That's what I believe the American people want us to do,"" Bachmann said. ""Again the New England Journal of Medicine released a survey the week that President Obama signed Obamacare stating that over 30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession if the government took over health care. That's very serious going forward."" First things first, the survey Bachmann is referring to was not a survey by the NEJM, nor was it published in the highly respected, peer-reviewed medical journal. It was a survey conducted by the Medicus Firm, a physicians recruiting service, and initially reported in January 2010. The firm wrote an article about the survey results, which was first published on the firm's Web site. The article was later reprinted in Recruiting Physicians Today, an advertising newsletter put out on the NEJM's Career Center Web site. The Medicus Firm neither paid to have the article published, nor was it paid for the article. It was never published in the actual New England Journal of Medicine. But it's easy to see how someone might have been confused. Although the small print explains that the survey was done by the Medicus Firm, the article prominently states at the top, ""From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine"" and carries the NEJM seal. In mid March, people at the NEJM began to see Twitter messages citing the survey, and calling it an NEJM survey. Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for the New England Journal of Medicine, said NEJM sent out several Tweets explaining that it was not an NEJM survey. And on March 17, 2010, they put up a disclaimer on the NEJM Career Center Web site: ""Recruiting Physicians Today is a free advertiser newsletter published by the Worldwide Advertising Sales and Marketing Department in the publishing division of the Massachusetts Medical Society. Each issue of the newsletter features research and content produced by physician recruiting firms and other independent groups involved in physician employment. ""On December 17, 2009 The Medicus Firm, a national physician search firm based in Dallas and Atlanta, published the results of a survey they conducted with 1,000 physicians regarding their attitudes toward health reform. ""The opinions expressed in the article linked to above represent those of The Medicus Firm only. That article does not represent the opinions of the New England Journal of Medicine or the Massachusetts Medical Society."" Said Zeis: ""It seems that along the way, people thought this was NEJM content and it wasn't. It had nothing to do with the NEJM editorial side at all."" Dave Dziok, a spokesman for Bachmann, said any confusion is the fault of the New England Journal of Medicine, not Bachmann. ""I know they’re doing what they can to distance themselves from the survey done by Medicus, but the fact of the matter is the New England Journal of Medicine has leant both its name and crest to the newsletter in which it was published,"" Dziok said. ""Nowhere in their newsletter do they make the disclaimer that what’s contained within it has nothing to do with the New England Journal of Medicine,"" he said. ""In fact, quite the contrary seeing as how their name is all over it. The NEJM may not have conducted the research itself as they’re stating now after the fact, but it’s certainly misleading on their end to have their name all over a publication like the one that was released with the results and then distance themselves from everything contained within it afterwards. They can’t have it both ways."" We note that the NEJM disclaimer went up on the Web site 10 days before Bachmann made her statement on Face the Nation. And the same day the disclaimer was posted, the left-leaning Media Matters Web site explained the error, after it was reported on Fox News. Okay, so the survey was not conducted by or published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But Medicus spokeswoman Andrea Santiago said that while it was not a scientific survey, the results should not be dismissed either. The firm randomly e-mailed surveys to 2,250 physicians from their database of tens of thousands, and stopped sending them out when they had reached 1,195 responses. And contrary to the allegations of some critics, it is not a database entirely made up of doctors looking for work, Santiago said. It's a continuously updated database that originated eight years ago, she said, and includes lists of physicians purchased by the firm. The relevant question here was, ""How do you think the passage of health reform WITHOUT a public option would affect your professional/practice plans, if at all?"" A majority of physicians, 70 percent, responded, ""no change""; while 22 percent said they ""would try to retire early""; 8 percent said they ""would try to leave medical practice even if not near retirement age""; and 1 percent said they would go back into practicing medicine. ""We feel like it was in line with what we were hearing from physicians on the phone,"" Santiago said. Many doctors already feel like they are being pushed out of business by declining reimbursement rates and rising malpractice insurance premiums, she said, and ""the health care reform bill exacerbates the issue."" And it comes at a crucial time, she said, when the legislation will create a demand for many more doctors. However, she said, the results of the survey have been ""over-sensationalized"" by some as a warning that 30 percent of doctors will be leaving the profession immediately. ""Obviously that's not going to happen,"" she said, noting that the survey didn't ask point-blank if physicians were going to leave, but rather if they would ""try"" to leave. ""But I do think it's going to impact the workforce in a significant way. We thought the results were thought-provoking."" We haven't found a reliable, independent poll of physicians asking how many would leave the profession if the health care bill passed that we could compare to the Medicus survey. The findings are consistent with a survey conducted by Investor's Business Daily back in September 2009, but we looked at that survey in October after it was cited by Glenn Beck, and concluded the results were suspect due to a number of possible influences on results. We note that the New England Journal of Medicine's Health Reform Center did publish the results of a physician survey conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the Medicus poll did, but it did find that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, which is in sharp contrast to the findings of the Medicus survey. In our previous story, we noted several factors with that survey that gave us pause about that study, such as the fact that the poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform, that the authors belong to a physicians organization that supports a public option, and that they donated to the Obama campaign. Still, according to an NEJM spokeswoman, the survey underwent a rigorous editorial review process that included review by staff and associate editors. In other words, it got the NEJM stamp of approval, whereas the Medicus survey did not. In conclusion, surveys performed by or published in the New England Journal of Medicine carry the weight of the journal's reputation and rigorous editorial review. Citing them as the source of a survey, as Bachmann did, lends credibility. But it was not an NEJM survey. Nor was it published in the NEJM. It was published in a free advertising newsletter geared toward the physician recruitment industry. It was conducted by a physician recruiting service that has a horse in this race. And it was not a scientific survey. We can understand how Bachmann and others may have been confused about the source of the survey. The labeling of the article as ""From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine"" is easy to misconstrue. An NEJM spokesman said they are reviewing their policies to make sure this kind of confusion doesn't happen again. But on top of getting the source wrong, we think Bachmann sensationalizes the Medicus results, saying that ""30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession"" if the health care bill passed. The survey language was that they would ""try to leave"" or ""try to retire early"" if it passed. There's a difference. Altogether, we rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F5700>],/factchecks/2010/mar/29/michele-bachmann/bachmann-claims-new-england-journal-medicine-surve/

""Unfortunately, recent news accounts in Florida have come out that indicate, in fact, that Speaker Rubio views public service as a way to enhance his personal enrichment.""Crist said that Rubio had set up a $600,000 ""slush fund"" that he used for personal expenses rather than political purposes.""In fact, out of the $600,000 that were raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be elected to office. That's not what people want. They want people who are not there to enrich themselves but who are there to enrich the lives of their fellow Floridians.""Crist's statement is based on an investigation into Rubio's finances by the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times.Rubio, the former speaker of the Florida House, controlled two separate political committees, according to the report. In December 2002, Rubio created Floridians for Conservative Leadership, which raised $228,000 in donations. At the end of 2003, he created Floridians for Conservative Leadership in Government, which raised $386,000. Of those two committees, it's true that only $4,000 went to direct contributions to political candidates.Crist, meanwhile, conflates the two committees together to get to his $600,000 ""slush fund."" But there's an important distinction between the two: The purpose of the first fund was to ""support state and local candidates who espouse conservative government policies."" It was registered with the state of Florida and allowed to give contributions to political candidates. The $4,000 in direct campaign contributions came out of this fund of $228,000. The Herald/Times review of other legislators' committees showed that they typically contributed far more to other candidates and reported vastly fewer credit card payments. According to the Herald/Times report: ""Rubio spent the biggest chunk of the committee's money, $89,000, on political consultants, $14,000 in reimbursements to himself, and more than $51,000 in credit card expenses. Records show those expenses were for food, lodging and airfare but do not detail who was traveling or where expenses were incurred.""The second fund was to ""educate the public about conservative leadership in government."" It was a 527 fund, registered with the Internal Revenue Service, but not the state of Florida. Because it was not registered with the state, it was not allowed to donate money to political candidates, and indeed it did not. According to the Herald/Times report, most of the money, about $236,430, from this second fund went to pay for Republican poltiical consultants. Read more details about the expenses in the Herald/Times report.We contacted the Rubio campaign after the debate for a response to Crist's charges. Campaign spokesman Alberto Martinez reiterated that the committees' operations were entirely within the law, and that all the money was spent advancing conservative causes, even if it didn't go directly to other candidates. The second fund wasn't allowed to give contributions, anyway, he added. It was intended to help Rubio travel around the state to promote conservative ideas to the general public. Crist also said during the debate that of the $600,000, ""it's been shown lately it's been used to fix his minivan, get haircuts, employ family members, things of this nature that are not what a political committee is supposed to do."" But Crist here is mixing Rubio's two political groups with a separate issue: Rubio had access to a credit card for the Republican Party of Florida, and that's what he used to pay for the minivan and and hair bills. Rubio has said the minivan charge was for damage to his car that occurred at a political event, and the hair charges also included items for a silent auction event that he ended up paying for himself. Here, we're ruling on Crist's statement that ""out of the $600,000 that were raised, only $4,000 went to candidates to try to improve their chances to be elected to office."" He's right about the $4,000. But he arrives at the $600,000 number by conflating two separate funds, one of which was not permitted to give to candidate campaigns. So we rate Crist's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A45440>],/factchecks/2010/mar/29/charlie-crist/crist-attacks-rubio-campaign-contributions/

Kirk says health care bill will lead IRS to hire more than 16,000 new employees
","Immediately before and after President Barack Obama signed a landmark health care reform bill on March 23, 2010, critics -- mostly Republicans -- charged that the measure would lead to the hiring of more than 16,000 new Internal Revenue Service employees simply to enforce the bill's tax provisions, including the controversial requirement that almost all Americans secure health insurance or else face a tax penalty. One of at least a dozen lawmakers who made that point was Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who is a strong contender this fall to win the Senate seat once occupied by Obama himself. ""About the only jobs created by the (health care) legislation would be at the IRS,"" Kirk said in a floor speech on March 21, 2010, the day the measure passed the House. ""According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people -- over 700 just in Illinois -- to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill."" As we looked into the origin of this statistic, we found reasons to be cautious about its accuracy. Let's first look at what the Congressional Budget Office said. On Dec. 19, 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which ultimately became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. In its analysis, the CBO wrote that it had ""not completed an estimate of the discretionary costs that would be associated with the legislation,"" including the costs for the IRS and other ""federal agencies that would be responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation."" But CBO did offer an estimate of the costs to the IRS for ""implementing the eligibility determination, documentation, and verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits."" The IRS, the analysis said, ""would probably"" need to spend ""between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years."" However, CBO did not translate that dollar range into a possible number of new hires. Instead, that task was taken up by another group -- the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. On March 18, 2010, the House Ways and Means Republicans released a report titled, ""The Wrong Prescription: Democrats’ Health Overhaul Dangerously Expands IRS Authority."" That report is the source of the 16,000-plus figure. The Ways and Means Republicans' report acknowledged that it is ""impossible to know exactly how many new employees the IRS would have to hire to enforce the individual mandate and other provisions of the Democrats’ health care bill."" Still, the report uses IRS data and ""reasonable assumptions about costs and program responsibilities"" to suggest that as many as 16,500 additional ""examiners, agents, and other employees"" could be needed. Here's the report's explanation of the math, which is based on the high end of CBO's cost estimate of $10 billion over 10 years: ""First, assume that the IRS budget would grow by the $10 billion that CBO indicates could be necessary. While there might be some early-year start-up costs to prepare for the added workload, most of the costs would accrue in the last six years of CBO’s ten-year budget window, when the individual mandate and other provisions, which present the bulk of the new enforcement responsibilities, take effect. Thus, for this analysis, assume that $1 billion total will be spent by the IRS in the first four years to prepare for the mandate with the spending increasing to $1.5 billion per year in each of the last six years. ""Second, in the last year for which actual IRS data is available, fiscal year 2009, the IRS employed the equivalent of 92,577 people, nearly half of whom worked directly in examinations and collections. In total, the IRS had payroll and benefit expenses of $8.371 billion, implying that costs per worker were $90,427. If the $1.5 billion in annual funds are used for the payroll and benefits of a similar mix of employees, the IRS could add more than 16,500 additional agents, auditors, examiners, and administrative support personnel to enforce large portions of the nation’s health insurance system."" But even as it offered the 16,500 figure, the Ways and Means Republicans' report offered caveats as well. ""Some might argue that figure over-estimates the number of employees that would be hired, because it includes only payroll and benefit costs and does not include other costs that would be incurred, including office overhead,"" the report says. ""However, note that the IRS total budget in fiscal year 2009 was $11.708 billion, meaning that, when all costs are included, IRS total spending averaged $126,474 per employee. Thus, critics of the 16,500 figure might argue that any new employees should be assumed to cost as much as the average member of the existing workforce and that the $1.5 billion per year would 'only' support hiring slightly more than 11,800 new IRS employees."" In fact, in a footnote, the report said that ""it is likely the number would lie somewhere in between the two sets of figures. There would be some additional overhead costs for the new employees, such as computers and telephone services. But there could also be fixed costs that are not as affected by additional workers (e.g., the agency may already have extra office space so does not need to rent additional square footage for each additional worker)."" We contacted a half-dozen experts in federal human-resources issues to see if they could provide an independent critique of the report's math, but those who responded ultimately declined to either confirm or second-guess the Ways and Means Republicans' calculations, citing uncertainty about what kind of staffing would be needed. One key unknown is whether computer automation -- something in which the IRS has made a substantial investment in recent years -- could handle much of the work stemming from the health care bill, rather than employees. For the record, the IRS itself says that it has not sorted out the employment fallout yet. On March 25, 2010, IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman appeared at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. At one point, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., asked Shulman, ""You said that right now you are moving forward as far as calculations and costs and staffing needs the IRS has -- you haven't made any of those final determinations yet, have you?"" To that question, Shulman answered, ""That's correct."" Ultimately, we have several problems with the way that Kirk has used the 16,500 figure. • The attribution is misleading. Kirk is right that the 16,500 figure has a connection to CBO -- but only an indirect one. CBO offered a cost estimate, but suggested nothing about how many jobs that dollar figure would translate into. Calculating a jobs number was a task that the Ways and Means Republicans took upon themselves. The CBO is Congress' nonpartisan referee for budgetary questions, and as such maintains a high degree of credibility on both sides of the partisan divide. For Kirk to attribute the 16,500 figure to the CBO rather than to an entity of House Republicans -- who voted unanimously against the final health care bill -- in effect launders partisan fingerprints from the estimate. Even if the 16,500 estimate is ultimately proven accurate, it would have been more accurate to label the the estimate as one coming from a partisan, rather than a nonpartisan, entity. • It uses the high end of the CBO estimate. The CBO estimated a cost burden of between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. The Ways and Means Republicans' report made its calculations based only on the high end of that range. If it had used the $5 billion figure instead (or offered it side by side with the $10 billion figure) it would have worked out to 8,250 jobs. Yet Kirk failed to use a qualifier like ""as many as"" or ""up to"" 16,500 new IRS employees. • The Ways and Means Republicans themselves acknowledge that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Factoring overhead -- rather than just salaries and benefits -- into the equation would reduce the number from 16,500 new employees to 11,800. This isn't just an outside critique; this is something stated explicitly in the Ways and Means Republicans' own report. And if one uses the $5 billion CBO estimate rather than the $10 billion CBO estimate, that number could shrink to 5,900 new jobs -- substantially below the 16,500 figure used widely in the congressional debate. We think it's fair to assume that the IRS will need to hire new employees, perhaps thousands, to handle the caseload from the new health care bill. And for this item, we will assume that the Ways and Means' Republicans' methodology is credible, since we were not able to find any expert who argued otherwise. Finally, Kirk is hardly alone in ignoring the caveats to the 16,500 figure -- Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., to just cite one example, said in a March 25, 2010, floor speech that ""16,500 new IRS agents are going to be required to be hired because of the health care reform bill,"" which to us expresses an unwarranted degree of certainty. But in this item, we're focusing on Kirk's statement, and we believe it rates only a Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280F3E6FDC0>],/factchecks/2010/mar/29/mark-kirk/kirk-says-health-care-bill-will-lead-irs-hire-more/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist touts Cover Florida as cost-saving health care for Floridians
","In their first U.S Senate primary debate, Gov. Charlie Crist and former House Speaker Marco Rubio bragged about accomplishments and sparred over differences. Crist highlighted his work on Cover Florida Health Care, an effort to provide low-cost coverage to the state's nearly 4 million uninsured, as a way to criticize the health care law recently put on the books in Washington. ""The real problems with health care are access and affordability. And we have approached those in Florida,"" Crist said. ""We negotiated with the private sector. We reduced the cost to those who were uninsured. We were able to provide access. And the average cost for health insurance in Florida went from about $600 a month for an individual to about $150 a month. No tax dollars involved. No government mandates. I think Washington could learn a lot from Florida.""The program, which was started in 2008, allows individuals who have been without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. Each provider was chosen by the state through a competitive bidding process, and each offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. According to Cover Florida Health Care's Web site, individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 a month or as much as $800 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the six insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage.Amid the contentious health care debate, Cover Florida has been a go-to talking point for Crist. Already PolitiFact Florida has checked three claims on the plan.  Crist's current claim is nearly identical to the one we checked from his State of the State address. Again, he's more or less correct that some Florida residents can get coverage from Cover Florida for about $150 on average. But the $600 figure for average Floridians still isn't holding water, and an explanation from Crist spokeswoman Andrea Saul isn't all that convincing. First, we wondered if Crist was referring to some sort of Florida-specific average, as his statement in the debate implies. In an e-mail, Saul said he was not. Instead, she sent us an April 2008 press release about Crist's meeting with Floridians struggling to pay health care costs. One participant, Belinda Boncaro, said she paid $670 per month for her health insurance. ""The best information is of course from individuals sharing their stories,"" Saul wrote. In fact, it's likely that the cost of an individual plan is quite a bit lower. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average monthly cost per individual is actually about $400 a month. And a study by eHealth, which offers coverage to people on the individual market when they cannot get employer coverage, said the average monthly cost is $161. That number is lower than the employer-provided cost because the policies typically have higher deductibles or fewer benefits. Also, insurers in the individual market can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.Crist's overall point has some truth to it: You can get basic coverage from Cover Florida for $150. But he's once again done some artful cherry-picking.  There are two statewide Cover Florida plans that offer hospitalization -- Blue Cross Blue Shield with an average cost $148 for a single person, and United Healthcare, which averages $327. He chose the lowest figure and a very high number for the private market ($600, when studies show it would cost more in the range of $160-$400). So, in theory, the most expensive plan under the state's program isn't that much less expensive than the national average. Furthermore, his spokeswoman told us that the $600 figure is not a national or even state average. Rather, it's the rough estimate for the monthly cost of one person's health care. And that means it's not a reliable or significant number. Because Crist used two numbers to set up a false comparison that implies Cover Florida Health Care is much less expensive than other plans when it is not, we rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971AC380>],/factchecks/2010/mar/29/charlie-crist/crist-touts-cover-florida-cost-saving-health-care-/
"['Abortion', 'Health Care', 'Texas', 'John Carter']","
Rep. John Carter says health care law provides full federal funding for abortions, but that's not so
","U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, lambasted the Democratic-approved health care plan signed into law last week as a federal health care “takeover bill.” Among Carter’s concerns spelled out in a March 21 press release: “The bill also provides full federal funding for abortions…” Carter spoke after a clutch of anti-abortion House Democrats agreed to vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act after President Barack Obama said he’d issue an executive order referring to continuation of a ban -- begun in the late 1970s and annually reaffirmed by lawmakers -- on spending federal funds on abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of a woman. The law prohibits federal subsidy funds, intended to help people afford health coverage, from being used to pay for abortions except in those exceptional cases. Obama’s order includes a provision to ensure that insurers offering coverage through state-level insurance exchanges charge customers separate premiums to cover abortion services. Obama's order also revisits past decisions by Congress to bar community health centers from using federal funds to provide abortion services outside of the exceptional circumstances. His order directs federal officials to “ensure that program administrators and recipients of federal funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services.” We sought Carter's backup for his contention that the law provides full federal funding for abortions. John Stone, Carter’s spokesman, said several aspects of the law support his claim.Let's review them one by one. First, Stone noted that plans offered to patients in the state-level exchanges are permitted to cover abortion services. Unsaid: The law specifies that each exchange must have at least one plan that does not cover abortions and that plans offering abortion services must collect separate premiums from each patient to pay for the services, presumably preventing the expenditure of federal funds on abortions. Second, Stone said provisions promising billions of dollars for community health centers and health co-ops, one vehicle for providing health insurance, lack language that would prohibit spending those dollars on abortion. Others, including representatives of community health centers, have said the promised money isn’t likely to be spent on abortions considering the centers haven’t provided abortion services in their 45-year history. A Jan. 22 Politifact.com article concludes that worrying about the centers providing abortions is “more a political dart than a legitimate concern.” Insurance purchased through co-ops would be subject to the same restrictions on abortion funding as other plans likewise offered through the state exchanges.Of course, who can say whether a court might rule that without a specific prohibition, abortions could be permitted? You can't fault organizations like the National Right to Life Committee for raising concerns about possible loopholes.Third, Stone said, the law creates a federal program to administer two or more national insurance plans, with a directive that at least one plan not provide federally funded abortion services. Stone said the provision implies “that other federally administered plans could cover elective abortions, or perhaps even be required to do so by the federal administrator. This is a sharp break from longstanding federal policy.” Stone was referring to the fact that for decades, health insurance programs offered to federal employees have been forbidden to cover abortions except under the established special circumstances.Under the new law, however, the multi-state plans cited by Stone would be sold like other privately vended plans available through the exchanges--and the law directs that any funding for abortions under the plans come from patient premiums. Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, says the provision for two or more national plans is intended to broaden insurance offerings.Does the multi-state provision imply a federal administrator could require that the plans cover abortion services? No, Jost told us: That's like saying it ""implies that you have to cover euthanasia,"" Jost said. ""That's silly.""Fourth, Stone said, the law’s provision for separate premiums for participants in plans covering abortion services offered through the state-level exchanges could be problematic. “This requirement would apply to anyone who enrolls in a subsidized plan that covers elective abortions, which would surely include many people who would learn of the abortion surcharge only after enrolling,” Stone saidThe law states, though, that a plan offering abortion coverage shall notify patients of that feature when they enroll. Besides, the provision doesn’t mean that full federal funding would pay for abortions, as Carter claims.Trying to cover all the bases, we looked at each abortion reference in the 906-page law. This search yielded no language permitting federal funding of abortions outside the previously established special circumstances, though we did find several prohibitions on abortion spending as well as a bar on discriminating against insurers or physicians who don't fund or perform abortions.One section states the law doesn’t pre-empt state laws on abortion. Another states that nothing in the law should be construed to require insurers to offer abortion services. A third section states that school-based health centers can’t provide abortion services.Two independent observers of the health-care debate concur that the law doesn't intend full federal funding of abortions.In January, the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation said: “If a state does allow plans in the exchange to cover abortions, (the law) only permits federal subsidy dollars to be used to pay for abortions that are permitted under the federal law that is in place before the plan year begins … Coverage for other abortions would have to be paid for with non-federal funds.”Indeed, requiring insurers that offer abortion coverage through state-level exchanges to collect two separate payments from customers might reduce the availability of such coverage, according to the foundation's analysis.Some “legal scholars contend that given the size of the potential pool of women and their families that will be eligible for federal subsidies under the exchange and other complexities,"" the foundation writes. ""This (two-part payment mandate) might limit the development of insurance plans that offer either abortion coverage or a rider, and ultimately carry over to products offered in the employer market.”Kaiser’s punch line: “This complex combination of restrictions means that… many women who will obtain coverage under health reform either though Medicaid or an exchange would have to pay for an abortion out-of-pocket.”Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate with the independent non-partisan Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, echoed that view. Sonfield told us the new law bans federal funding of abortion coverage. He added: “In our analysis, the law’s requirements for enforcing this ban are so onerous and stigmatizing that we expect insurance companies to drop coverage of abortion altogether, even for consumers who receive no federal subsidies at all."" Last week, PolitiFact.com rated as True a House member’s statement that the new law doesn’t provide for publicly funded abortions.All told, this review leaves us agape at Carter's overreach. That is, the law does not provide full federal funding of abortions--and that's clear.Carter could have edited his blast. Instead, he makes an unsupported ridiculous claim. We rate his statement as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097046040>],/factchecks/2010/mar/29/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-health-care-law-provides-full/

Charlie Crist calls Marco Rubio's 2007 tax swap proposal a 'massive tax increase'
","Gov. Charlie Crist launched what amounts to a nuclear attack in Republican politics during his FOX News Sunday showdown with Marco Rubio.Crist labeled Rubio, the former House speaker, a tax raiser.In a back and forth about each other's record on tax issues, Crist singled out Rubio's failed 2007 plan that would have eliminated property taxes for many Floridians in exchange for an increase to the state sales tax.The tax swap ""would have been a massive tax increase,"" Crist said during the March 28, 2010, U.S. Senate debate. ""In all due respect to the speaker, you've just got to tell the truth to people. And that's really what this is all about.""Rubio contends that the tax swap would have been a huge, net tax cut. And that the plan was supported by former Gov. Jeb Bush.Would it have been a tax cut? Or a tax hike?Let's take a look.In his first months as speaker in early 2007, Rubio proposed a fundamental change in Florida's tax structure. The proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval.A House analysis originally said the swap would save taxpayers a total of $5.8 billion in the first year, which certainly is contrary to Crist's claim. But whether you saved money or spent more money at the end of the year likely depended on your individual circumstances. Back in 2007, the St. Petersburg Times ran calculations under Rubio's proposal for both homeowners and renters.  The homeownersA family of four with an annual income of $64,280. Home value: $241,100 CURRENTProperty tax bill in Tampa: $5,061.06Sales taxes paid: $951 PROPOSEDProperty tax bill in Tampa: $0Sales taxes paid: $1,290 Under Rubio's plan, these homeowners would have paid $4,722 less in state taxes, the Times found. Contrast that with renters: The rentersA family of two with an annual income of $46,914CURRENTRent: $851Sales taxes paid: $691PROPOSEDRent: $851Sales taxes paid: $937 Under Rubio's plan, these renters would pay an additional $246 a year in taxes. The rental property owners also would still have to pay property taxes, meaning rent wouldn't be affected.""He talked about it being a swap, and it would be a swap because those who owned their home wouldn't have to pay a tax anymore,"" Crist said during the debate. ""Forty percent of my fellow Floridians are renters. It would not have applied to them at all. All they would have enjoyed is his tax increase.""Rubio responded: ""The renters would have had an opportunity to buy now because the exorbitant taxes that we pay on property in Florida would not have gone up.""Conversely Rubio pointed out that the increased sales tax would bring more revenue into the state from non-resident visitors. If tourists contribute more, he said, Floridians contribute less.Rubio's proposal got the seal of approval from Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a Rubio supporter. In 2007, he wrote legislators saying Rubio's tax swap proposal amounted to a net tax cut.""Speaker Rubio’s proposal is a net tax cut, thus a vote for the proposal would not constitute a violation of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" Norquist wrote. ""All taxpayers of Florida would reap the benefits of a lower tax burden and significant spending restraint on the state as well as on the local level.""A later House study said the sales tax increase would generate $9.3 billion in exchange for eliminating $15.8 billion in property taxes. (Here's a House analysis of the swap, which was combined with other tax initiatives).""Only in Tallahassee could a bunch of politicians declare that a $7 billion net tax savings is a tax increase,"" Rep. Adam Hasner, R-Delray Beach, told the Palm Beach Post.Yet some did vote against the proposal saying it was a tax increase. The swap ultimately was killed by the state Senate.Crist spokeswoman Andrea Saul noted that Rubio himself said the tax swap was a tax increase during the March 28, 2010, debate. According to transcripts, Rubio said: ""Well, let me tell you about that supposed program to raise taxes that he keeps talking about. It was probably the largest tax increase in Florida's history. It would have eliminated property taxes for all sorts of people. And it was supported by (none other) than Jeb Bush.""A Rubio spokesman, Alberto Martinez, said Rubio mispoke. ""Not shocking they would try to distort that,"" Martinez said. Based on the statements that surround Rubio's ""largest tax increase"" line, it seems reasonable to us that he meant to say decrease. Back to Crist. He said Rubio's tax swap proposal ""would have been a massive tax increase."" At its most basic level, Rubio's proposal was a tax increase and a tax decrease. The state sales tax would go up, and the property taxes would go down. On the micro level, some people would pay more and others would pay less. At the macro level, two different studies said Floridians would have paid less -- between $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion. While generally we are leery about tax impact projections, there is no suggestion Rubio's plan would have resulted in a tax increase statewide and certainly not a ""massive"" one as Crist suggests. As such, we rate Crist's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4F7C80>],/factchecks/2010/mar/28/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-calls-marco-rubios-2007-tax-swap-pro/

Rubio says Florida has lost 211,000 jobs since Crist campaigned for the stimulus
","You knew it wouldn't take long for ""the hug"" to get some love during Sunday's debate between Republicans Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist. Minutes into the 40-minute ""Florida Senate Showdown,"" Rubio made a case that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't.""Everyone knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year ago you were campaigning for it,"" the former House speaker said, referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package.We've fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus. Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying he didn't endorse it. So it was a Rubio comment later in the program that drew our attention. FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Rubio, ""Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has 12 percent unemployment?""""Well ... if it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state,"" Rubio said. ""Let me tell you why the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs.""211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's facts.Conveniently, the state's Agency for Workforce Innovation released a report on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it, Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. The report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000 in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population.However, if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the job loss in a year's time is 211,500.It's the latter number that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed.Like any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot of jobs.

Rubio claims Social Security is upside down sooner than expected

","During the first primary debate between Gov. Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio, the former House speaker said that Social Security needs to be reformed or it will go bankrupt.""Social Security, whether we want it to or not, in its current form cannot survive and will not exist for us,"" he said during the March 28, 2010, showdown on FOX News Sunday. ""In fact, just this week we received the news that for the first time Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it's taking in. That was something that was supposed to happen in 2016. It's now happening in 2010.""Calls to reform Social Security are nothing new; many economic analysts say that the program is unsustainable. But privatizing the program has become a hallmark of the conservative agenda. Its latest proponent is Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who is the top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives' Budget Committee. His Roadmap for America's Future would reduce Social Security benefits for those who are 55 or younger in 2011 and supplement the reduction with private accounts.On March 24, that argument was put in the spotlight again, when the Congressional Budget Office, the independent number-crunching arm of Congress, issued some sobering news: This year, the Social Security Administration will take in less than it pays out, resulting in an approximately $29 billion shortfall. The projections are part of its yearly analysis of President Barack Obama's budget. In an interview with the New York Times, Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the SSA, explained the problem. He said that the recession has put people out of jobs and more people have applied for benefits sooner than expected. Simultaneously, fewer jobs means fewer paychecks are going out and that translates to less collected by the government in taxes. In the same interview, Gross pointed out that the SSA has a $2.5 trillion balance that will carry benefits for a while. So, Rubio's correct on the first part his claim.He's right on his second point as well. In its May 2009 annual report to Congress, the SSA projected that ""annual cost will exceed tax income starting in 2016."" As a result, we find Rubio's claim to be True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C7BF00>],/factchecks/2010/mar/28/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-social-security-upside-down-sooner-ex/

Barack Obama says fewer black, Latino young men participate in the labor force than young white men
","In a high-profile event at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, President Barack Obama unveiled a new effort called the My Brother’s Keeper Initiative, designed ""to help every boy and young man of color who is willing to do the hard work to get ahead."" Obama told the audience -- a mix of African American and Latino youth and such public figures as basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and former Secretary of State Colin Powell -- that he understood the challenges facing young people of color. ""The only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving,"" Obama said. ""So when I made a mistake, the consequences were not as severe. I had people who encouraged me, not just my mom and grandparents, but wonderful teachers and community leaders. … I firmly believe that every child deserves the same chances that I had. That's why we are here today, to do what we can in this year of action to give more young Americans the support they need to make good choices, and to be resilient and overcome obstacles and achieve their dreams."" A group of prominent foundations have pledged $200 million over five years to improve early childhood development, school readiness, parental engagement, literacy, educational opportunity and school discipline. As Obama explained the challenges facing young black and Latino men today, he offered this statistic: ""Fewer black and Latino men participate in the labor force, compared to young white men."" We wondered whether that was accurate, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official repository for employment data. We used as our yardstick the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of the civilian population that is either employed or unemployed. (""Unemployed"" refers to people who are not employed but who are actively looking for work.) In addition, we assumed that Obama was comparing youth labor force participation for black and Latino men to the rate for white youth, even though he didn’t explicitly say that. Given the context, this seemed to be the obvious interpretation. Finally, we had to determine a definition for ""young."" The most appropriate age ranges for which BLS offers data, we concluded, are 16 to 19 and 20 to 24. So we’ll look at the data for both of these ranges. Here’s a summary of what we found for January 2014, the most recent month for which data on the labor force participation rate is available.   16-19 years old 20-24 years old White men 35.1 percent 74.2 percent Black men 25.3 percent 66.2 percent Hispanic men 27.0 percent 77.1 percent   So for Americans age 16 to 19, Obama is correct that labor force participation among black and Hispanic men trails that of white men. But the data for men age 20 to 24 are more mixed. Labor force participation among whites does exceed that of blacks, but the rates for Latinos actually exceed those of whites. (Latinos also have a higher rate for men age 25-29.) So on this score, Obama is only half-right. We checked with economists to see if they had an explanation for higher labor force participation rates. A big reason appears to be what happens in college. ""Among the youngsters who complete high school, Latinos and non-Hispanic whites are now about equally likely to attend college, but a higher proportion of Hispanic youngsters drop out of high school before obtaining a diploma,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""In addition, Hispanic college enrollees are less likely to enroll in four-year colleges and less likely to be enrolled as full-time students. Generally, full-time students are less likely to work for pay or be looking for a job compared with non-students and part-time students."" What this means, Burtless said, is that more young Hispanics are free to become part of the labor force. Another possible factor, Burtless suggested: A higher percentage of Hispanic young adults are not legal residents, so they may be ineligible for the student assistance and public aid that would permit them to be students and remain outside the workforce. ""If you cannot legally obtain college aid or public assistance, or are afraid to ask for it, you are probably more likely to support yourself through work,"" he said. In the meantime, we also wondered whether having a higher labor force participation rate for those age 16 to 19, as whites do, is unquestionably a good thing, since it could reward high school dropouts who took low-wage jobs. ""Participating in the labor force at this age would not seem to be an unmitigated good,"" said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. ""Even at older ages, I wouldn't be against seeing more stay-at-home dads.""   Burtless said that among economists, the jury is still out on this question. ""Many students can combine paid employment with satisfactory progress toward a high school or college degree, but obviously this would be a challenge for some young people who need to apply themselves hard in school in order to complete a degree,"" he said, adding that his own research suggests that the earlier in life that Americans start to work, the more money they earn later on. What’s less clear is whether late entry into the job market causes lower earnings, or whether people who go on to earn a lot of money simply love to work and start doing so earlier in their lives. Our ruling Obama said that ""fewer black and Latino men participate in the labor force, compared to young white men."" That’s true for black men age 16-19 and 20-24 and for Hispanic men age 16-19, but it’s not correct for Hispanic men age 20-24.

David Jolly says 'Social Security is not guaranteed,' according to the Supreme Court
","Social Security has been a popular political football during the campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat, with both sides acknowledging the earned benefit program needs reform but differing on how it should be handled. During an untelevised debate in Clearwater on Feb. 25, candidates Alex Sink and David Jolly traded barbs over their platforms, with Sink attacking the Republican onstage by saying Jolly had declared that Social Security was not guaranteed. Jolly said that wasn’t his opinion, it’s actually what the highest court in the land had ruled. Jolly said it was up to elected officials to make sure seniors get their benefits. ""In 1960, the United States Supreme Court in the Flemming decision said Social Security is not guaranteed,"" he said. ""My fight is to make sure that is guaranteed."" Jolly’s claim made us curious about what the courts have said about Social Security, so we decided to open the law books. Flemming vs. Nestor The case to which Jolly was referring is Flemming vs. Nestor, a 1960 case about a Bulgarian immigrant named Ephram Nestor who was deported in 1956 for having been a member of the Communist Party between 1933 and 1939. Nestor was not a citizen but had lived in the United States since 1913. Nestor retired in 1955 after paying into the Social Security fund for 19 years, since the program was created in 1936. When he was deported, his benefits were terminated under amended provisions of the Social Security Act of 1935.  Nestor sued the federal government, claiming the benefits constituted a contract and that he deserved his payments after so many years of contributing to the system. (The other party in the case was Arthur S. Flemming, the secretary of health, education and welfare during Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency.)  In a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled there was no contractual obligation for the government to pay out Social Security benefits to Nestor. The ruling meant payments into the Social Security system could not be considered a person’s property rights if that person violated a rule set forth by Congress, UCLA law professor Katherine Stone told PolitiFact Florida. In Nestor's case, Congress made rules against belonging to the Communist Party, though it's worth pointing out the law didn't exist when Nestor actually was in the party. Still, the court said the after-the-fact prohibition was valid.  ""People who are denied (benefits) can’t say their property was taken from them, unless the change is arbitrary or lacks rational reasoning,"" Stone said, noting the denial couldn’t be punitive or violate a person’s right to due process. What could be considered unreasonable? ""Just ending the program suddenly could be an irrational measure, "" Stone suggested. ""Moving the money into tax cuts for the rich could, too."" Changing or suspending the program because of budget constraints, though, would likely pass muster with the courts. Jolly’s interpretation of that ruling is interesting, Stone said, because the case only deals with one specific category of beneficiary being denied payments for a specific reason. But beneficiaries could be denied benefits for any reason if Congress passed a law making it so, as long as the change wasn’t arbitrary. The court said Congress had the power to modify the rules, which it has done several times -- such as gradually raising the full retirement age over time. Political debates over Social Security payouts have been fueled by budget projections illustrating the widening chasm of the program paying out more than it is taking in. A 2005 Congressional Research Service report on Social Security reform pointed out that beneficiaries were not guaranteed ""full benefits in the case of a shortfall, unless Congress amends applicable laws."" Our ruling Jolly said the Supreme Court ruled ""Social Security is not guaranteed."" It’s a position he has repeated at debates and on the campaign trail. The 1960 Flemming vs. Nestor case Jolly cited indeed said citizens don’t have a right to Social Security benefits, no matter how long they paid into the system. Congress can change the rules how they see fit, as long as they follow due process. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF46C0>],/factchecks/2014/feb/28/david-jolly/david-jolly-says-social-security-not-guaranteed-ac/

Pryor ad warns 'every senior in Arkansas' will see increased Medicare costs from Cotton votes
","The main takeaway from a recent campaign ad from Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., aside from a prominently featured Apple logo, is that Republican challenger Rep. Tom Cotton is changing Medicare as we know it. A Feb. 5 Arkansas television ad features Courtney, a young woman who’s ""never been really political."" ""It says here Cotton voted in Congress to change Medicare into a voucher system that will increase out-of-pocket expenses for every senior in Arkansas,"" Courtney said, pointing to her laptop. ""Thousands of dollars every year. My grandma and grandpa can’t afford that, and neither can my parents."" Since Courtney is a self-professed politics noob, PolitiFact figured we’d jump in and see if she has her facts straight. We wanted to look at what changes to Medicare Cotton supported and how those changes would affect seniors. Cotton’s folks didn’t respond to our request for comment. What Cotton voted for We’ve previously fact-checked the Pryor campaign on whether or not Cotton voted to turn Medicare into a ""voucher system."" We rated that Mostly True. Republicans typically prefer the term ""premium support"" to ""voucher system,"" but the concept is the same. Cotton voted for the budget proposal, authored by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in March 2013. The plan, which didn’t become law, called for issuing flat payments to seniors. Seniors would then have the choice to either purchase traditional Medicare coverage or private insurance. The value of the payment would be either equal to the second-cheapest private plan available in a given area, or the cost of traditional Medicare -- whichever is cheaper. The reform wouldn’t affect anyone currently 55 or older. Over years, though, under Ryan’s plan, the age for Medicare eligibility would’ve increased from 65 to 67. Pryor’s campaign spokesman also pointed out that Cotton voted for an alternate House budget proposal from the Republican Study Committee. That proposal’s Medicare plan was similar to Ryan’s, but would affect all individuals under age 60, as opposed to 55. The change would’ve taken effect in 2019, five years sooner than Ryan’s. It’s up for debate among experts whether or not current seniors would ultimately see cost increases years down the road as vouchers roll out to future seniors. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report in 2012 about the economic impact of a potential Ryan voucher system, but didn’t offer a specific prediction about how costs would change, as our colleagues at FactCheck.org also noted. We should note that by supporting the Republican Study Committee’s budget, Cotton voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So had that proposal become law, seniors would lose benefits they get under Obamacare, like free preventative cancer screenings. But Pryor’s ad implies that the voucher system alone would affect costs like this for all seniors, rather than the Affordable Care Act. We also know repealing the health care law would re-open something called the ""doughnut hole"" that Obamacare is closing. Essentially, that would increase the cost of prescription drugs for seniors who qualify for Medicare Part D. Not all seniors are eligible for that program, though, so this change alone wouldn’t affect ""every senior."" Under either proposal, instituting a voucher system wouldn’t have directly changed coverage for current seniors on Medicare, who are age 65 and older. That’s a far cry from the ad’s claim that a voucher system would increase costs for ""every senior."" Our ruling Pryor’s campaign ad said, ""Cotton voted in Congress to change Medicare into a voucher system that will increase out-of-pocket expenses for every senior in Arkansas."" Cotton did vote for a voucher-like system under two different budget proposals. But it’s misleading to suggest that the plan would definitely increase expenses for every senior. The research isn’t conclusive, and we can’t predict the future. But even the voucher proposals go out of their way to leave current Medicare beneficiaries alone. It's not at all clear that every senior in Arkansas would see increases in out-of-pocket expenses, including people like Courtney’s grandparents. So we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708E080>],/factchecks/2014/feb/28/mark-pryor/pryor-ad-warns-every-senior-arkansas-will-see-incr/
"['Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says federal government reneged on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin
","One of Gov. Scott Walker’s explanations for rejecting a full expansion of Medicaid under the federal ""Obamacare"" health care law was this: The feds won’t be good for the money. And for more than a year, the Republican governor has cited a piece of recent state budget history as evidence. Most recently, Walker made his case to a national cable audience in a Fox News Sunday appearance on Feb. 23, 2014, telling interviewer Chris Wallace he doubted the federal law’s promise to cover 100 percent of the expansion for three years and no less than 90 percent thereafter starting in 2020. State taxpayers pick up the rest. ""That commitment is not going to be there and taxpayers all across America will be on the hook,"" Walker said. ""They are not going to be on the hook in Wisconsin."" That’s a prediction, but it was followed by this piece of evidence stated as fact: ""Even before the Medicaid expansion I had (provided) $600 million more to Medicaid. Almost 40 percent of that was to fill in the federal government reneging on commitments they've already made even before the Medicaid expansion."" In other words, they’ll break their promise because they’ve done it before. With Walker’s decisions on Obamacare and Medicaid poised to become 2014 campaign issues let’s look at this one. Did ""federal reneging"" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin pile approximately $240 million in extra costs onto the 2013-’15 state budget? How it works The biggest component of the broken promise, in Walker’s view, is a recent drop in the federal government’s share of what Wisconsin spends on Medicaid, which has covered children and parents with children under 19 in low-income households as well as people who are disabled or over 65 and impoverished."" The federal share was 60.21 percent in 2010, but by 2014 fell to 59.06 and is projected to drop further, to 58.27 percent, for the 2015 fiscal year. That has raised costs to Wisconsin taxpayers, but there’s a major problem in Walker’s contention. The federal share -- known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP -- fluctuates annually and varies from state to state based on a formula dating to Medicaid’s inception in 1965. That formula is ""designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per-capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per-capita incomes),"" a Congressional Research Service paper noted in 2013. In other words, the standard federal share of Medicaid costs is not promised or guaranteed to hold steady; it must only stay between the statutory minimum of 50 percent and maximum of 83 percent. It has gone up notably in some recent years as well. In fact, Wisconsin saw its federal rate rise from 2009 to 2010, and also got a big additional bump to more than 70 percent for almost three years under the federal stimulus law and a subsequent legislative action -- both of which applied nationally. Another major cost increase Walker has cited to back up his claim in the last year relates to hikes in the cost of premiums, deductibles and copayments that Medicaid pays for so-called ""dual eligibles"" who qualify for Medicare and Medicaid. No reversal Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said these and other cost increases are evidence of reneging by Washington. But neither the fluctuations in federal help or the dual-eligible cost changes are due to any changes in federal Medicaid law or policy, according to the independent, nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It made this note in a November 2013 memo to state Rep. Jon Richards (D-Milwaukee). The federal cost-sharing formula has not been changed to reduce matching rates since President Reagan and Congress enacted a temporary reduction for 1982-1984, said Edwin Park, a health-policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And the cost increases for ""dual eligibles"" are routine, reflecting rising health care costs, Park said. Finally, Walker cites new costs states will have to pick up under Obamacare. They are real, but two experts told us they do not represent a broken commitment. Conservative health economist Stephen Parente at the University of Minnesota shares Walker’s skepticism about future federal funding of the Medicaid expansion, especially given Obama’s pull-backs in putting the health-care law into full effect. And he said governors are rightly frustrated by swings in Medicaid payments from Washington. But Parente said it’s not accurate to call those swings ""reneging."" Jon Peacock, research director at the left-leaning Wisconsin Council on Children & Families, agreed. His view is Walker could have made the state less vulnerable to declines in federal help if he had taken the additional federal money available for the Medicaid expansion. ""If we took advantage of the Medicaid expansion funds,"" Peacock told us, ""we would get a much higher matching rate that is locked in (under the law.)"" Our rating Explaining his rejection of federal money to fully expand Medicaid coverage, Walker said on Fox News Sunday that ""federal government reneging"" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused more than $200 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget. But typical cost-sharing fluctuations, based mainly on a longstanding formula, explain the extra state burden -- not any reversal of course or pulling back on a commitment by Washington. We rate Walker’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2401C0>],/factchecks/2014/feb/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-federal-government-reneged-medic/
"['Georgia', 'Religion', 'Josh McKoon']","
‘Religious freedom’ bill targeted Obamacare, but was it on mark?
","Josh McKoon, a GOP state senator from Columbus, authored one of two bills that pulled Georgia into the national debate over religious freedom and discrimination. Critics say Senate Bill 377, McKoon’s legislation, and House Bill 1023, by Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, could open the door to private business owners declining on religious grounds to serve people they believe are gay, bisexual or transgender. McKoon and Teasley have said they did not intend to target the gay community, but their bills were pulled into the political firestorm over a religious freedom bill passed in Arizona and vetoed Wednesday by that state’s governor, Jan Brewer. Major corporations that lined up against the Arizona measure voiced similar concerns about the bills by McKoon and Teasley, both of which have been given slim chances of passage heading into the final days of the General Assembly session. McKoon was selling his bill, in part, by capitalizing on the backlash against the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. He told reporters Monday that SB 377 would be ""another tool in the tool kit of those who are fighting on the Obamacare front --- Catholic health institutions who are being asked to provide abortion services, that sort of thing."" Others dispute McKoon’s assessment. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a deeper look. McKoon said one of his intentions was to help Catholic institutions that, under the ACA, could be expected to provide services they normally find objectionable, such as making available abortion-inducing medications. ""At minimum, I would like for those institutions to have the potential to have the religious-liberty test that this law would give them,"" said McKoon, an attorney who has served in the General Assembly since 2011. Several experts we checked with said they can’t see McKoon’s bill having the stated effect. ""What I am given to understand is that state law that tries to alter federal law, such as the Affordable Care Act, is superseded by that federal law and ignored,"" said William S. Custer, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. Chad Brock, a staff attorney at ACLU Georgia, and Robert A. Schapiro, the dean of Emory University’s School of Law, generally agreed. ""How can an organization use state law to exempt itself from a federal mandate?"" Brock said. Custer said ""the ACA specifically states that federal subsidies do not pay for abortion services, so that’s a moot point."" On March 24, 2010, President Barack Obama signed an executive order declaring that federal funds would not be used for abortion services, except in the case of rape, incest or a woman’s life safety, in accordance with long-standing restrictions commonly known as the Hyde Amendment. That’s not slowed the rumors or their spins through the Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact has ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Some individuals may have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges, but they won’t be forced to buy it. Some states have passed laws banning abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on their state exchanges. Georgia has not. In an interview Wednesday, McKoon acknowledged that his religious freedoms bill, if challenged legally, might not be able to stave off ACA requirements. But he said the bill would address what he perceives is a bigger issue -- an attack on religious freedom. McKoon pointed out that the state Senate recently passed legislation to safeguard Christmas trees and holiday greetings such as ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Happy Hanukkah."" ""That speaks to the level of fear people have to speaking their faith,"" he said. People of faith currently carry the burden of having to justify their practices, McKoon said. He said he hopes his legislation would turn that on its head and require the government to show why a certain rule, regulation or policy is so important that it needs to supersede a person’s religious liberty. Thirty-one states have similar religious freedom laws on the books -- 18 passed by their legislatures, McKoon said. His bill did not make the Senate calendar for Monday, the last day for most bills to clear at least one chamber with a serious chance of passing this session. McKoon said he wants Georgia to become the latest state to have a religious freedom law on the books. But our fact check looked specifically at his comment that his bill would create a law that would serve as  ""another tool in the tool kit of those who are fighting on the Obamacare front --- Catholic health institutions who are being asked to provide abortion services, that sort of thing."" We don’t see that he has made that case. We rate his statement False.

Texas among top slice of states with women in poverty, though 14 states had a greater estimated share of women in poverty in 2012
","El Paso lawyer Maxey Scherr, who seeks the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, described the Obamacare law as vital to the health of millions of Texans in an interview with progressive Houston blogger Charles Kuffner. ""We have more women living in poverty in this state than almost anywhere else,"" Scherr said in the interview, which Kuffner recorded and placed online Feb. 4, 2014. We do? By email, Scherr campaign spokesman Victor Reyes told us Scherr based her conclusion on state rankings in ""Texas on the Brink,"" a March 2013 report by the Legislative Study Group, a Texas House caucus chaired by Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston. According to the report, Texas ranks fourth nationally in the percentage of women living in poverty, a conclusion attributed in a footnote to information sorted by the Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. We clicked online to the Kaiser information and came up with a chart indicating that in 2011-12, 23 percent of Texas women were living in poverty, tying the state with California and Arizona for the fourth-highest rate nationally. According to the chart (see below), 24 percent of women in Hawaii were living in poverty; 26 percent of women in Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico; and 27 percent in Mississippi. 
Source: Web page, ""Adult Poverty Rate by Gender,"" State Health Facts, the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation (accessed Feb. 13, 2014) A Kaiser explanatory note says the women-in-poverty percentages reflect the share of female adults aged 19-64 with incomes less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four in every state but Alaska and Hawaii, that poverty level was $22,350 in 2011 and $23,050 in 2012, according to the note. This information also can be sorted by the number of women in poverty in each state. By this metric, Texas--with nearly 1.8 million women in poverty--trailed only California, with 2.7 million women in poverty (see below). 
 Source: Web page, ""Adult Poverty Rate by Gender,"" State Health Facts, the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation (accessed Feb. 13, 2014) Next, we wondered if the presented rates and rankings were up to date. Nope: By email, Jennifer Lee, a researcher for the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving the poor, sent us a chart she built using the latest estimates from the American Community Survey for 2012 as overseen by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the 2012 estimates, 17.8 percent of Texas women aged 18-64 lived in poverty that year. Fourteen states had more women in poverty: Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arkansas, Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Oregon and Michigan, according to the chart. But rounding these percentages leaves Texas tied for fifth--with Ohio, Montana, Florida and Oklahoma--with 18 percent of women in poverty, the chart indicates. Mississippi, ranked No. 1, was alone with 25 percent of women in poverty. In raw numbers, California led the nation with 2 million women in poverty, according to the chart, followed by Texas (1.4 million) and Florida and New York (1 million each). Lee said: ""Poverty is consistently higher for females than for men across the country. There are a lot of causes of this, but one is that many women work in historically underpaid jobs.  Women who must raise children alone are especially vulnerable."" Our ruling Scherr said more women live in poverty in Texas than almost anywhere else. In raw numbers, California in 2012 had the most women in poverty followed by Texas. But poverty rate is a more reasonable yardstick to compare states. The rounded Texas rate--indicating about 18 percent of its women aged 18-64 lived in poverty in 2012--tied the state for fifth with some other states. Breaking out each state's rate to tenths of percentage points, though, shows 14 states with a greater share of women in poverty than Texas.

The pages all have different administrators but share some features. They allow those who have joined that group to advertise guns, rifles, ammunition and gun parts. People can also include posts seeking to buy. Telephone numbers are often provided, and actual transactions are handled privately. We called Dennis Cannon, a Prineville resident who is an administrator of a central Oregon Facebook gun page, and asked whether background checks are part of typical sales. ""It’s up to each individual to do a background check on the person they are selling to,"" Cannon said. ""You can do that free through the sheriff’s office and run whoever you want."" Asked whether the sites are appropriate, he said, ""We have the right to bear arms. Felons don’t. I see nothing wrong with the sites. That’s why we live in a free country."" Next we called Kevin Starrett, executive director of the pro-gun Oregon Firearms Federation. He hadn’t heard of the Facebook sites but didn’t see anything surprising. ""At my gun club, people put up notes with pictures when they want to sell a gun,"" he said. ""This is no different than it’s ever been."" He acknowledged that the explosion of social media sites such as Facebook makes it possible for many more people to gain access to gun-sale information, but added, ""As far as any transactions are concerned, all of the same rules still apply."" So can anyone go to one of the Facebook marketplaces, cut a deal and buy a gun? We wanted to know what legal gun transactions -- whether initiated on Facebook or anywhere else -- require. We called Patricia Whitfield, Oregon State Police criminal justice systems director. She pointed us to ORS 166.436, which addresses firearm transfers by people other than gun dealers. Private-party sales, it states, do not require background checks. Not seeking a check, however, could cause a seller to run afoul of a companion statute, ORS 166.470, which applies to a seller who ""knows or reasonably should know"" that the recipient is a minor, has been convicted of a felony or ""has any outstanding felony warrants for arrest."" So laws pertaining to gun sales originating on Facebook pages are the same as those that apply to any private sale. (Oregon Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, hopes to get a bill requiring background checks for private-party guns sales through this session of the Legislature. The bill is still alive, though with the session ebbing, chances of it passing this time around don’t look promising.) A Facebook representative who would not give his name passed along links addressing company policies on guns. Advertising that ""promotes the sale or use of weapons"" won’t be accepted, according to the policies, but the marketplace pages themselves haven’t been deemed improper. He confirmed that Facebook is ""in conversations"" with Moms Demand Action, but declined to say what, if any, effect the group’s pressure might have. Sarah Finger McDonald, leader of the Oregon chapter of Moms Demand Action, defended her group’s petition drive to change Facebook’s policy. ""These sites completely open the door to countless unregulated gun sales,"" she said. The Ruling Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has launched a campaign aimed at persuading Facebook to prohibit online gun ""marketplaces."" The group, providing a link to a news account, said at least one felon has obtained a weapon through a Facebook post. The group asserts that such sites enable ""ANYONE"" to ""broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon."" Transactions initiated on Facebook are no different from any other private-party gun sale in Oregon. While current laws don’t require background checks for private sales, it is still the legal responsibility of sellers not to peddle guns to felons and minors. Yet with at least 16 Facebook gun marketplaces now operating in Oregon, far more people than ever have access to an array of guns and rifles. And with the exception of felons and minors, ""anyone"" can seek out a Facebook gun page, broker a deal online and arrange a private transfer. The group’s statement is true but needs clarification to make clear that the same rules -- or lack thereof -- apply to Facebook transactions as to all other private-party gun sales. Though Facebook pages can advertise guns for sale to a broader audience, there’s nothing inherent about them that makes the actual purchase easier or harder. ""ANYONE"" is also sweeping. Clearly, Oregon laws -- though they’re sometimes violated -- set some limits on who can buy a gun. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Pat Toomey says Barack Obama previously nominated Debo Adegbile in 2011 for a judgeship
","President Barack Obama’s pick to head the Justice Department’s civil rights division has dredged up a decades old controversy surrounding Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black radical convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer. Obama nominated Debo Adegbile to be an assistant attorney general in November. Adegbile previously served as director of litigation at the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., co-authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal with Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams on Feb. 24 that said Adegbile was not fit for the post because he attempted to ""seize on (the Abu-Jamal) case and turn it into a political platform from which to launch an extreme attack on the justice system."" In 1982, Abu-Jamal was found guilty of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in a case that garnered national attention. The case went on for many years. In 2009, Adegbile was at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund when it filed an amicus brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Abu-Jamal’s sentence was invalid because the jury was racially biased. Later, Adegbile was one of several lawyers to represent Abu-Jamal when prosecutors tried to reinstate the death penalty. Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence without parole. But it was Toomey’s final salvo calling on Adegbile to withdraw his nomination that caught our attention. ""Only three years ago, Mr. Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration. That would be the best course here."" At PolitiFact, we won’t debate Adegbile’s credentials for this important position, nor weigh in on a decades-old controversy. But whether Adegbile was previously nominated by Obama for a position is something we can, and will, look at. Nominate vs. consider We perused through the record of presidential nominations. Adegbile’s name doesn’t appear prior to his most recent nomination to the Justice Department. So we then turned to Toomey’s office. They immediately conceded their error. ""We should have written that he was under consideration,"" said Elizabeth Anderson, a spokeswoman for Toomey’s office. ""He was not nominated."" Presidents consider nominees all the time. Some considerations are more public than others. Former United Nations ambassador Susan Rice, for example, was publicly ""considered"" to be the secretary of state by Obama, but her name was never formally submitted for nomination after Republicans lined up against her. In the case of Adegbile, the Washington Post reported in 2011 that Obama ""asked the American Bar Association to evaluate the credentials of Debo Patrick Adegbile, director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit."" More recently, the Los Angeles Times reported that ""Florida lawyer Ben Hill, who was chairman of the bar association committee, said in an interview that Adegbile's name was withdrawn before he was rated by the group."" Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee asked Adegbile this year why his name was withdrawn in 2011. Responding to a question submitted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Adegbile wrote: ""I withdrew myself from consideration for a nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit based upon my personal, professional and practical assessment that my family’s best interests were served by my decision to remain in my position at the NAACP LDF in New York at that time."" In his op-ed with Williams, Toomey said Adegbile’s nomination was ""abruptly withdrawn by the administration."" But Adegbile contends it was his own doing. A spokesman for the White House also said Adegbile took himself out of the running. Toomey’s office pointed to a Washington Post story (which is actually a wire version of the aforementioned L.A. Times article) where it was reported that ""the White House later withdrew his name."" Finally, it’s worth noting that Obama has had a tough time filling U.S. Court of Appeals seats in the D.C. Circuit. It’s widely considered a stepping stone to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Republicans have repeatedly blocked his nominees.   When the Senate Democrats invoked the so-called ""nuclear option"" to change Senate rules for confirming presidential appointments, it was to move ahead with three Obama appointees to the 12-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Adegbile’s confirmation for assistant attorney general now only needs a simple majority, which Democrats can arrange without help from Republicans. At the time he was being considered for the judgeship, Republicans could have forced a 60-vote threshold to confirm Adegbile’s nomination, if it reached that point. Our ruling Toomey, along with Williams, wrote that ""Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration."" Adegbile was never nominated, a point Toomey’s office conceded. He was considered for the job by Obama, but only briefly and not formally. Presidents considered many names before making an official nomination. The distinction is important, because having to pull a nomination after it's formally made is a less frequent occurrence and a more significant setback for an administration. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C155480>],/factchecks/2014/feb/27/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-barack-obama-previously-nominated-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Bobby Jindal']","
Bobby Jindal says Louisiana's growth has outpaced the nation's since the recession
","Louisiana’s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, attracted some media attention recently while attending an annual meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington. At a press event after meeting President Barack Obama with a bipartisan group of governors, Jindal said, ""The Obama economy is now the minimum wage economy. I think we can do better than that."" That prompted Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to come to the microphone and call it a breach of the traditional bipartisan decorum for such events. Jindal, a potential Republican presidential candidate, hit the airwaves again two days later when he was interviewed on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Panelist Mike Barnicle asked Jindal to defend his own economic record: ""The last time the Census Bureau checked the per capita income of Louisiana, you were 47th lowest in the United States, not all under your watch. What have you done, as governor, to bring in all these better paying jobs and boost your people's per capita income?"" Jindal responded, ""Well, the great thing is, we're doing exactly what the president has not. Cut taxes, reform debt, make some investment in workforce training, make it easier for businesses to create jobs. And here's the record. In Louisiana, we now have more people working, highest incomes in our state's history. Larger population than ever before. And the president can't say all those things about the country. Our economy has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession."" We wondered whether it’s correct that Louisiana has ""grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession."" When we asked Jindal’s office for more detail, they said he had been comparing the growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product for his state and the nation since 2007 -- a year he chose because it was the ""baseline"" year before he began his first term as governor. We looked at the numbers and found that Jindal actually understated the comparison. Between 2007 and 2012 (the last year for which data is available), inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 2.5 percent nationally, but by 6.4 percent in Louisiana. This definitely supports Jindal’s claim. However, we’ll note a caveat: While the timespan Jindal used certainly makes sense given his tenure as governor, it’s not the only way to define ""since the national recession"" -- the words he used in the MSNBC interview. The recession officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. So if you want to look at the period ""since the recession,"" one could just as easily use the range 2008-12, 2009-12 or 2010-12. So let’s look at how these date ranges stack up. For 2008-12, Jindal would also be correct. During that period, Louisiana growth (7.9 percent) easily outpaced United States growth (3.2 percent). But he’d be wrong for 2009-12, when United States growth (6.7 percent) exceeded Louisiana growth (4.6 percent). And he’d also be wrong for 2010-12, when the United States economy grew (4.1 percent) and the Louisiana economy actually shrank (by 1.2 percent). United States growth also exceeded Louisiana growth between 2011 and 2012 -- 2.5 percent to 1.5 percent. Perhaps an easier way to look at it is to compare the year-over-year growth in GDP for Louisiana and the United States. The more robust statistic for each year is listed in bold. 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 United States -0.7 -3.3 +2.4 +1.6 +2.5 Louisiana -1.4 +3.2 +5.8 -2.6 +1.5   If you look at it this way, the United States economy has grown faster (or shrunk less) in three of these years, compared to two years when the Louisiana economy did better, which undercuts Jindal’s claim. This doesn’t surprise John Francis, an economist at Louisiana Tech. ""Louisiana's economy is highly dependent on the energy sector which, no matter where in the business cycle we lie, is always in demand,"" he said. ""So, when the economy is in a recession, we tend to do better than average. When the economy is doing better, energy demand is somewhat higher, but not dramatically so. So when the economy is doing well, we lag behind the U.S. average. I suspect that we were doing better when the economy was in the heart of the Great Recession, but we have fallen behind as the overall economy has rebounded."" However, Jindal’s camp draws the following analogy: In a football game between the ""United States team"" and the ""Louisiana team,"" the winner would be the one who ended up with more points, not the one who won more quarters. ""By any objective analysis, Louisiana has outperformed the national economy since January 2008,"" said Michael Reed, a spokesman for Jindal. Our ruling Jindal said, ""Our economy (in Louisiana) has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession."" The time frame Jindal’s office said he used -- from 2007 to 2012 -- is a reasonable one, and using that period does make his claim accurate. However, it’s worth remembering that taking one crack at the numbers can tell an incomplete story. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A39A980>],/factchecks/2014/feb/27/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-says-louisianas-growth-has-outpaced-n/

Ted Nugent on CNN: 'I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers'
","Until last week, Ted Nugent was best known as a rock musician, a bow hunter, and an ardent supporter of gun rights. But his recent description of President Barack Obama as a ""subhuman mongrel"" eclipsed all of that, especially at a time when he has campaigned on behalf of a Texas Republican candidate for governor. Those words are rooted in Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda and the writings of white supremacists. The uproar drew a terse apology from the singer of hits such as ""Cat Scratch Fever."" But in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, he insisted that he had not drawn on the rhetoric of racist literature. At least for the word ""mongrel,"" Nugent said the word was used in his time in law enforcement. ""I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout. I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers and heroes of law enforcement. ""And we are re-arresting fugitive felons let out of their cages after murdering and raping and molesting children, carjacking. And we keep going after these guys. ""The adrenaline is something like you will never experience, I hope you never have to experience it, but when we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters. We call them mongrels. We call bad people who are destroying our neighborhoods mongrels."" Is Nugent a cop? Does he ""conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers?"" We wanted to know. 'I've been a cop in Lake County, Michigan, since 1982 thereabout' Lake County, Mich., is located about 90 miles north of Grand Rapids. It has about 11,500 residents and describes itself as ""an outdoor recreation paradise."" Nugent is a reservist for the county sheriff's office, Sheriff Robert Hilts told us. But, ""He’s never joined us for any raids. Fortunately, we don’t have those sorts of problems up here."" Hilts said Nugent has no authority or official responsibilities. The only activity involving Nugent that Hilts could recall was raising money on behalf of the department and for a local boy who has cystic fibrosis. ""We’re always searching the woods for a hunter that’s lost or hurt,"" Hilts said. ""He helped us buy a four-wheel drive offroad vehicle so we could reach people faster."" 'I conduct federal raids with the DEA and ATF and U.S. Marshals and the FBI and Texas Rangers' Nugent does not seem to be a cop in the way most people would understand that word. The picture was about the same for the federal agencies Nugent named. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) told us, ""We are not aware of him conducting any raids with us."" We asked the Texas Department of Public Safety on what occasions Nugent had joined Texas Rangers on raids. Press secretary Tom Vinger said, ""In regards to your question about the Texas Rangers, that did not occur."" Joe Moses, a 22-year veteran special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told us they have no record or recollection of Nugent participating in any of their operations. However, when there are special projects that involve many federal, state and local agencies, they wouldn’t necessarily know the name of everyone who showed up. At the same time, Moses said there are strict standards for who is involved in an actual raid. ""You would not have someone who didn’t hold the status of a police officer or federal agent participate in such an operation,"" Moses said. The process of arresting a person or collecting evidence must withstand challenge in a courtroom. It is not a place for the inexperienced, Moses told us. The FBI said it could neither confirm nor deny Nugent’s participation in a raid. When we reached out to Nugent, an assistant did not provide evidence that Nugent participated in raids with the FBI, the DEA or the ATF. Instead, Nugent’s assistant Linda Peterson wrote, ""Ted has been active in the following: U.S. Marshal Service FALCON fugitive task force arrest raids in Texas …"" That’s not quite what it sounds like, either. Nugent and a film crew ""went on a ride-along with a U.S. Marshals-led task force in Waco, Texas, in 2005,"" agency spokesman Dave Oney said. Oney believes they were shooting footage for Nugent’s television show Spirit of the Wild. With the U.S. Marshals, observers work under clear limits. ""They cannot go with us into private residences,"" Oney said. ""So, he would have had to remain in the vehicle or on the sidewalk or some other public area."" That ride-along took place about nine years ago. No law enforcement agency told us that Nugent has any current role in their efforts to apprehend felons. Other evidence While Nugent’s response to our questions was brief, we did find his description of being at an FBI handgun training facility built around video simulations. The article is undated, but in it Nugent wrote he had recently taken part in Operation FALCON with the U.S. Marshals. Nugent found the training experience very realistic. ""Let me tell you, when the room goes dark and the video begins to roll, you become so totally engulfed in the scenario that you are 100 percent psychologically living the event as if it is real life,"" he wrote. ""It is no longer a video as far as your mind tells you."" It is possible this may have shaped his recollections. Our ruling Nugent said he is and has been a cop in Michigan and that he conducts raids with several federal and state law enforcement agencies. He said ""we are re-arresting fugitive felons"" and painted a vivid picture of being with agents immediately afterward. ""When we are done with these kinds of raids, we get together and our hearts are broken that we have to face these monsters,"" Nugent said. The single piece of this narrative that Nugent confirmed is one ride-along with U.S. Marshals in 2005. He is not a cop in Michigan by any conventional meaning of the word. No agency said that he presently plays any role in any of their raids. Nugent may have been passionate but his words take him far beyond the facts.

Legislative gambit to continue government spending involved Lamar Smith proposal having nothing to do with Obamacare funding
","No Republican in Congress voted for the 2010 health-care overhaul known as the Obamacare law. But red-and-white ""Stop Lamar Smith"" signs that cropped up recently in Austin charge that Smith, a Republican U.S. House member from San Antonio, ""sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare."" The sign attributes the claim to the Texas Liberty PAC. Founder Dave Nalle of Manor told us the group is a newborn Republican-initiated super PAC focused on defeating Smith. The claim stood out to us because Smith voted against the Affordable Care Act, and he doesn’t serve on the House Appropriations Committee, where spending bills originate. And what was the basis of the anti-Smith sign? By email, Nalle said Smith ""introduced"" the 2014 Omnibus Spending Bill, or House Resolution 3547, which became law on Jan. 17, 2014, according to an online summary posted by Congress. The summary identifies Smith as the proposal’s sponsor. And, Nalle told us, the law ""was the primary vehicle through which programs passed in the Affordable Care Act were funded."" First, we’ll look at what was in that act, and then we’ll tackle Smith’s role. The spending plan funded the government through September 2014. It cleared the House by 359-67 with Smith voting in favor of it. In a Jan. 15, 2014, press release, Smith said that he supported the spending bill for reasons including defense spending, saying too that the measure did not provide ""additional funding"" for the Obamacare law. A news story posted Jan. 15, 2014, by the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, quoted Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., the Appropriations Committee chairman, as saying: ""We've made sure that this bill provides no new funding for Obamacare and have even cut existing Obamacare funds to the tune of over $1 billion."" The newspaper said Rogers was referring to a $1 billion cut to a preventive health care fund intended under the Obamacare law. So, the spending plan with Smith’s name attached had at least some funding of the Obamacare law — and it funded many other government initiatives as well. To gauge Smith’s listed sponsorship of the act, we queried experts including Donald Wolfensberger, a former longtime congressional staff member who directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. That’s when this claim began to grow, well, spacy. Wolfensberger told us by email and telephone that Smith’s involvement began when he sponsored an unrelated minor piece of legislation. That bill morphed into the vehicle chosen by congressional leaders to get the crucial spending package passed. Smith ""was a hapless victim in some way,"" Wolfensberger said. Let’s cut to the details. On Nov. 20, 2013, Smith introduced a one-page proposal extending the license application deadline for commercial space launch indemnity insurance, which then ""passed the House under suspension of the rules (a process for noncontroversial matters), and then the Senate with an amendment,"" Wolfensberger noted. These actions occurred Dec. 2 and Dec. 12, 2013, Congress says. A congressional website shows this December 2013 image of Smith’s Senate-amended proposal: After the Senate version of the proposal returned to the House, Wolfensberger said, ""Smith’s bill was used as the vehicle in which to stuff the 1,500-page, $1.012-trillion omnibus government funding bill,"" which then cleared the House and Senate to be signed into law by President Barack Obama on Jan. 17, 2014. It’s nearly 650 pages long, including the limited language of Smith’s original. There was a procedural rationale for changing Smith’s space proposal into the spending plan. Wolfensberger said because the original legislation had already been acted on by the Senate, the House-embraced appropriations swap-in removed an opportunity for Senate opponents to stall it. It all comes down to the parliamentary rules that govern Congress. ""It’s still possible to filibuster the meat of a matter from the House,"" he said, ""but there is no option to block proceeding to consideration of a House measure already amended by the Senate that’s coming back from the House."" Separately, Smith’s office emailed us an April 5, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirming this point and stating: ""The ability to take up a matter without debate can potentially make a difference in the Senate because the Senate then needs to end debate only on the main question (or questions)."" Stan Collender, who has written a guide to the federal budget, said by email that most of the Obamacare law’s provisions did not need funding through the appropriations act. ""Saying that"" Smith ""sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare is a gross misstatement,"" Collender said. Also by email, political scientist Roy Meyers of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said that while the omnibus act provided some funding to administer the Obamacare law, Smith’s original bill was for a different purpose. ""So it's really a classic dirty trick by the Texas Liberty PAC to not acknowledge that the House Rules Committee made this bill the vehicle for passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, amending the original bill to add all of the appropriations language,"" Meyers said. Smith’s office also sent us an email including Smith’s statement tracking with what we heard from the outside congressional observers. Jennifer Hing, a staff spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, further told us by email that Smith’s measure was the only Senate-approved House bill available at the time the appropriations act was rolled into it. We circled back to Nalle, who said the conversion of Smith’s proposal into the appropriations vehicle doesn’t take away from the fact that Smith sponsored the act funding the Obamacare law. ""To suggest that he is not responsible for the sponsorship of a bill which he did sponsor and which he voted to amend and to pass is disingenuous,"" Nalle emailed. ""His votes show that he clearly supported the bill just as much when it passed as when it was originally written. There was no point in the process in which he, as sponsor of the bill, did not cooperate with and support the process which produced the final bill."" Our ruling The PAC’s sign said Smith ""sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare."" To the contrary, legislative leaders amended a brief Smith proposal related to space ships to fold in the 2014 appropriations act, which included some Obamacare-tied expenditures. This claim distorts a leadership strategic maneuver to continue government spending to misrepresent Smith’s role and position on the Obamacare law. We rate it as False.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Legal Issues', 'Texas', 'Ken Paxton']","
Most lawyer jobs at AG’s office require three years’ experience
","Interviewed Jan. 24, 2014, on KFYO-AM in Lubbock, state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney claimed Barry Smitherman, an opponent in the race for Texas attorney general, ""doesn’t have enough legal experience to apply for most of the jobs at the attorney general’s office."" Smitherman, who chairs the state Railroad Commission, ""has only 15 months of total legal experience,"" said Paxton, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and a former House member, who said he has 22 years’ experience practicing law. That 15-month figure didn’t hold up, though Smitherman separately acknowledged that he has spent less than three years practicing law. The others bidding for attorney general in the March 4, 2014, primary elections are also lawyers. Republican state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, is a senior attorney and shareholder in corporate law firm Winstead PC; campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us by email Branch has practiced law for 30 years. The lone Democrat is Sam Houston, a Houston lawyer unrelated to the historical figure of the same name, who is nearing 27 years of private legal practice, as we noted in a 2013 fact-check. Traditionally, the state attorney general has been a lawyer, though according to the Secretary of State’s office, the Texas Constitution doesn’t require a law license or legal experience for the job, which was created in 1845, when legal qualifications were less formal. The attorney general does act as the state’s lawyer, often filing lawsuits at the request of a department or branch of state government, as well as litigating cases, defending state laws and providing legal advice; another duty is approving public bond issues. Asked for his response to Paxton’s claim, Smitherman told us by phone, ""Well, first of all, most of the jobs over there are non-judicial; they’re non-lawyer jobs. So that’s patently false."" Paxton spokeswoman Ashley Sewell told us via email that Paxton’s comment ""was obviously given in the context of legal qualifications and legal jobs which require a licensed attorney. … (T)he lack of Barry Smitherman’s legal experience keeps him from being qualified for more than half of those jobs."" Sewell emailed us information on employees in the attorney general’s office pulled from the Texas Tribune’s online data portal. She said that of 718 ""legal personnel,"" 515 were classed as assistant attorney general employment grade IV or above. That, she said, meant the 515 positions required three or more years’ legal experience; as backup, she sent two 2014 job postings -- one requiring three years for a level IV assistant attorney general opening and another requiring four years for a level V assistant attorney general job. On behalf of the AG’s office, spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by email that the agency has 4,073 employees, of whom 734 are lawyers, with 717 of those being categorized as assistant attorney general classifications I through VII. She said that the agency requires three years or more experience for classes IV and up; those categories account for 509 lawyer positions. Most of the remaining ""lawyer"" jobs are director positions and the post of first assistant attorney general; these don’t have a specific legal experience requirement attached. Rather, the job descriptions call for ""experience relevant to the assignment"" and possibly a law license in a specialty area. So 509 AAG positions at the agency require three or more years’ legal experience. That’s 70 percent of the total ""lawyer"" jobs on staff and 13 percent of all the agency’s jobs. Smitherman told us he practiced as a briefing attorney and municipal bond attorney from 1984 to 1985, earned a master’s degree in public administration and spent 16 years in investment banking, then began a second career as a prosecutor in the Harris County district attorney’s office and was there 15 months before Gov.

Facebook posts say Pelosi supports longer ER wait times
","It’d probably be big news if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly stated that she favors extending emergency room wait times. And many Facebook posts seem to suggest she does. They claim Pelosi wrote in defense of criticism to President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, ""Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!"" Some Affordable Care Act critics have predicted that Obamacare will cause emergency room wait times to go up. PolitiFact wanted to put this claim to rest after a skeptical reader wrote in asking us whether Pelosi actually said this. Our own searches for news clips came up empty. A spokesman from Pelosi’s office told us she didn’t say it. Sure enough, we traced the Pelosi quote in question back to a satire website. Duh Progressive likens itself to a right-leaning version of The Onion. Most of the site’s articles are politically charged takes on the news. Their article, which purports to be written by Pelosi herself, is meant to poke fun at the way Democrats defend the Affordable Care Act from critics. The fake first-person narrative reads:   ""Naysayers claim the ACA will turn our nation’s emergency rooms into those similar to Europe’s, where people can sit all day in understaffed hospitals as they wait to get their feverish illnesses addressed, or their broken limbs fixed, their convulsions stopped, that knife removed from their skulls, or their fingers reattached. I doubt such dire fears will ever come true here.   But for argument’s sake let us presume I am wrong (which I never am) and that '’Obamacare'’ will force Americans to wait in emergency rooms longer than they already do.  In that case, has it ever occurred to people the great new friends that can be made while waiting for hours in abject misery alongside others also in abject pain and misery?"" Pelosi, like most of her party, consistently supports Obamacare. And hey, she may also support making new friends. But there’s no evidence to suggest that she twisted potentially longer emergency room wait times into a good thing. Our ruling Facebook posts quoted Pelosi as saying, ""Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!"" We quickly traced back the claims to a satirical article. Pelosi never actually said this, or anything remotely similar.

"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Andy Brown']","
Travis County's tax rate ranks among the very highest among urban counties, but that's not new
","It’s not unusual for a candidate to bemoan taxes. Still, Andy Brown’s claim in a mailer stopped us short: ""Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas."" Brown, an Austin lawyer running for Travis County judge, aired his statement under an arrow suggesting county tax bills steadily escalated while his Democratic primary opponent, Sarah Eckhardt, served on the Travis County Commissioners Court. We’re focusing here on whether the county has the highest tax rate of the state’s urban counties. By email, Brown’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, told us the campaign compared the 2012 total tax rate for Travis County with the rate in other counties that are home to the state’s five largest cities. Wick included a chart indicating that in this subset, the Travis County rate of $0.5001 per $100 property valuation exceeded the rates in Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and El Paso counties. El Paso County, Brown’s chart indicates, had the next-highest rate, $0.40887 per $100 valuation. ""Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, we defined it as a county that has a ‘big city’ in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas,"" Wick wrote. By phone, he said: ""We were trying to compare apples to apples."" We took our own, broader look. Online, the Texas Association of Counties drew on data collected by the state comptroller’s office to create a chart listing the ""general fund property tax rates"" for every Texas county for 1996 through 2012. Among the 15 most populous counties, the chart and our own web research suggested that in 2012 and 2013, Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate--topped only by Hidalgo County, which is home to McAllen near the Texas-Mexico border. Hidalgo County’s rate of $0.59 per $100 valuation in 2012 and 2013 compared with Travis County’s respective rates of $0.5001 and $0.4946 per $100 valuation. Among these 15 counties, Travis-neighboring Williamson County had the third-highest 2013 rate, $0.49029 per $100 valuation. Travis County’s rates in 2012 and 2013 far outpaced the total rates in the state’s four more populous counties. In this subgroup, the next-closest 2013 rate--$0.40021 per $100 valuation--was levied by the most populous county, Harris. The other more populous counties and their total tax rates: Dallas ($0.2431 per $100 valuation); Tarrant ($0.2640 per $100 valuation); and Bexar ($0.296187 per $100 valuation). MOST POPULOUS TEXAS COUNTIES TOTAL PROPERTY TAX RATE in DOLLARS PER $100 VALUATION, 2012 TOTAL PROPERTY TAX RATE in DOLLARS PER $100 VALUATION, 2013 Harris 0.40021 0.40021 Dallas 0.2431 0.2431 Tarrant 0.264 0.264 Bexar 0.326866 0.296187 Travis 0.5001 0.4946 El Paso 0.40887 0.43 Collin 0.24 0.2375 Hidalgo 0.59 0.59 Denton 0.282867 0.284914 Fort Bend 0.48076 0.48476 Montgomery 0.4838 0.4838 Williamson 0.49029 0.49029 Cameron 0.384291 0.384291 Nueces 0.355259 0.340999 Brazoria 0.48586 0.43202

There wasn’t a change in this respect in Eckhardt’s time as a commissioner. According to the information compiled by the counties’ association, Travis County had the highest total rate among the five most populous counties every year from 1996 through 2012. Travis County’s total rate even exceeded the Hidalgo County rate from 1996 through 1999, the chart indicates, though Hidalgo has had a higher rate every year since. When we pointed this out, Wick told us the mailer’s use of ""now"" was intended to mean at ""this very moment."" Finally,  it’s worth noting that however the county’s tax rate compares to others, it would take more research to tell whether Austin-area residents pay more in property taxes than other Texans. Each local resident’s tab includes taxes collected by governmental entities including, perhaps, the city of Austin and a school district. Our ruling Brown said Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas. Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate of the state’s 15 most populous counties in 2012 and 2013, we found, also levying the highest rate of the state’s seven most populous counties. But in contrast to Brown’s message, Travis County's tip-top ranking isn't new. The county’s rate has exceeded the rates of more populous counties every year since 1996.

"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Mary Margaret Oliver']","
Opposition to gun bill slightly less than stated
","The Georgia House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would increase the types of places where guns could be allowed, but one lawmaker said most Georgians don’t support the changes. ""You are aware of the polling data that dictates the views of people in relation to this gun debate,"" Georgia state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said during a floor debate concerning House Bill 875. ""You are aware 80 percent-plus people don’t support these bills and these measures."" One House member who supported the legislation questioned Oliver’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Oliver had accurately portrayed the people’s sentiments about the bill, or was she stretching the truth to win lawmakers to her side to vote against the bill. HB 875, written and co-sponsored by several Republican lawmakers, would lift restrictions on guns in houses of worship and bars, and allow school board members to arm themselves. It would no longer be a crime for licensed gun owners carrying a firearm on a college campus, where they are banned, under the legislation. Instead, the penalty would be a $100 fine. The bill does includes some restrictions, such as the mentally ill cannot get a gun license. Despite Oliver’s protestations, the House overwhelmingly passed the bill by a 119-56 margin. Like many contentious bills, the vote went along party lines, with nearly all Republicans voting in favor of the legislation and virtually all Democrats against it.The legislation is now in the hands of the Georgia Senate. Oliver said in her speech before fellow lawmakers that she asked people in her district how they felt about legislation that would expand gun rights in such fashion. Only 10 said they supported it while 156 said they opposed it. That, however, was not a scientific survey. Since Oliver’s district covers only a portion of DeKalb County, we wanted to know what information she had to support her claim concerning how voters statewide felt about legislation like HB 875. Oliver sent us a January poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that found 72 percent of registered voters statewide oppose allowing firearms in houses of worship, while 26 percent said they favored the idea. The remaining 2 percent either did not answer or were not sure how they felt about the idea. The question offered some interesting findings. Sixty-three percent of Republicans opposed the idea, while more than 90 percent of Democrats opposed it. A higher percentage of voters older than 65 were against the idea than those between the ages of 18 and 39. More than four out of five women said they were against allowing firearms in churches, while about 60 percent of men opposed the idea. The poll also asked how did people feel about allowing people to carry firearms on college campuses and in dorms. Seventy-eight percent said they oppose the idea. Again, it showed a higher percentage of women were against the idea than men. Again, it showed a larger percentage of older voters were against the idea than younger voters. Seventy-one percent of Republicans polled said they were against allowing firearms on college campuses. More than 90 percent of Democrats opposed the idea. The AJC poll surveyed 802 adults statewide between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9 on what issues Georgians want their Legislature to tackle in 2014. The margin of error for each response is plus or minus 4 percentage points. It was conducted by Abt SRBI of New York by live operators and included respondents via cellphone and land line. Oliver also sent us data from a poll conducted by Georgians for Gun Safety in 2010. It showed 76 percent of the respondents felt the state ""definitely should not"" allow anyone with a gun permit to carry a firearm into a house of worship. An additional 10 percent said Georgia ""probably should not"" allow gun permit holder to carry in a house of worship. The Georgians for Gun Safety poll also asked for the public’s opinion about allowing people to carry firearms onto a college campus. Sixty-four percent responded ""definitely should not"" while an additional 12 percent answered ""probably should not."" In 2013, Atlanta’s NBC affiliate, 11 Alive, polled Georgians on the topic. It found 64 percent thought it should ""remain unlawful"" for firearms to be carried into churches. Twenty-six percent supported the idea. Sixty-five percent of those who responded to the poll said the law should be illegal to carry firearms on college campuses.   To sum up, Oliver said more than 80 percent of Georgians do not support measures like those proposed in House Bill 875. Most of the polling data we reviewed shows a majority of Georgians oppose firearms in houses of worship or on college campuses. But there’s not much data that we saw that surpasses the 80 percent mark. Oliver’s overall point that most Georgians oppose firearms in bars, on campus or in houses of worship is on the mark. But her specific percentage is too high, and she used the number to pursue a specific political point. We rate Oliver’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D92040>],/factchecks/2014/feb/26/mary-margaret-oliver/opposition-gun-bill-slightly-less-stated/
"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'PunditFact', 'Bloggers']","
Do 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for him in 2012? Nope
","For President Barack Obama’s opponents, word of his latest downfall was stunning and welcome. Headlines and tweets all said just about the same eyebrow-raising thing: ""Poll: 71% of Obama supporters 'regret' voting for his reelection."" (Those all link to different websites.) The purported statistic from a YouGov.com poll was the focus of a Washington Examiner post last week that spread quickly through conservative blogs, social media, radio and online forums. Tweets about the news by big guns like Fox & Friends and various accounts with smaller reach were hard to miss. But the news is wrong. PunditFact will explain why. The origins of the claim YouGov.com did not even mention the news about regretful Obama voters in its Feb. 17 writeup of a new poll. The story that accompanied the poll, headlined ""Mitt Romney’s phantom campaign,"" explored whether Romney is viewed more favorably ahead of the 2016 presidential election given more positive media buzz about a Netflix documentary about him. (The answer, based on their polling data, is not really.) YouGov polled about 1,000 voters over two days in early February, asking voters of Romney and Obama if they would make the same decision today that they did in November 2012. YouGov found 90 percent of Romney voters would vote for Romney again, while 79 percent of Obama voters said they would stick with Obama. Of the remaining 2012 Obama voters, 10 percent said they would not vote for him again, and 11 percent said they were unsure. The 10 percent who would not vote for him again got a follow-up question: Do you regret voting for Obama? Of 35 people in that group, 25 said yes. That's 71 percent. So of the people who voted for Obama, 396, 6 percent said they had regrets. In the eyes of YouGov assistant editor William Jordan, this was not worth mentioning in the original write-up. ""We did not think it surprising that the small number of voters who said they would no longer voted for Obama now regretted voting for him,"" he said. Breaking free from the facts This is where things get messy. The next day, Washington Examiner columnist Paul Bedard published a story (since updated) that picked up on the people who said they regret voting for Obama. Bedard wrote that 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for his re-election. ""Over seven in 10 Obama voters, and 55 percent of Democrats, regret voting for President Obama’s reelection in 2012, according to a new Economist/YouGov.com poll,"" he wrote. (The Economist has collaborated with YouGov in past polls, but not this one.) Those words sprung to life, appearing on news aggregator Drudge Report, spreading across Twitter, and landing on sites like TeaParty.org and World Net Daily. It seeped into partisan radio broadcasts, including on Rush Limbaugh’s show, and even a down-the-middle San Diego morning TV show. Conservative blog Hot Air was the exception. It urged its readers to ignore stories about the 71 percent statistic. Why? YouGov, while correctly reporting its sample sizes and percentages in its tables, left off an important disclaimer in describing who got question. No one realized it until someone asked about it the day after posting the results. The description about the ""regrets"" question should have said, ""Asked of those who reported voting for Barack Obama in 2012 but would not vote for him if the election was held again."" Instead it said, ""Asked of those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012."" That language suggests a sample size of 396 voters, not 35. ""The 71 percent who regretted voting for Obama, which was picked up by various media outlets, is of the 3.5 percent (35 of 999 respondents) of the sample who said they voted for Obama in 2012 and would not vote for him today,"" Jordan said. YouGov fixed its truncated filter. Bedard, at the Examiner, rewrote parts of his story and changed the headline to, ""Poll: Only 79% of Obama voters would vote for him again."" But there’s no recall button for bad information on the Web. This one spread like a bad chain email. Our ruling Reports on blogs, television, radio and Twitter said a YouGov.com poll showed 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for him. The number is wildly high, based on incomplete wording in a poll report and a less-than-perfect reading of that report by news organizations. Surveys require a great deal of attention from pollsters and reporters alike, especially ones with political overtones, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. As the sample size shrinks, the margin of error rate expands. Point being, while the overall YouGov poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, the question about regret would have a much higher margin of error.   ""You’ve got to be really careful when you’re looking at subsamples of subsamples of subsamples,"" Bowman said. In this case, that didn’t happen. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF1F80>],/factchecks/2014/feb/25/blog-posting/do-71-percent-obama-voters-regret-voting-him-2012-/

Barack Obama says Medicaid expansion has brought health care to 7 million who never had access before
","After the troubled launch of President Barack Obama’s health care law last fall, the numbers of health insurance sign-ups has increased -- and so has the spin. Speaking at a dinner with the Democratic Governors Association on Feb. 20, 2014, Obama said the law had brought health care to millions of people. He provided a breakdown: ""Right now, we’ve already got close to 4 million Americans who have signed up for exchanges. We’ve got 3 million Americans who were able to stay on their parents’ plan because of the law. We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion. So we’ve already got well over 10 million Americans just in the first few months, despite problems with healthcare.gov in the first month and a half, who suddenly have the financial security that in some cases they’ve never known before."" One of these numbers has attracted particular scrutiny -- the ""7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion."" This refers to an expansion under the law of the federal-state Medicaid program. Obama’s law lifted the income limits on who is eligible for Medicaid coverage, newly opening the program to those who had incomes that were very low but still too high to qualify. The federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the cost, with the federal share eventually dropping to 90 percent. In its landmark decision affirming most of the law, the Supreme Court made an exception for the Medicaid provision, saying that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion. So far, 25 states plus the District of Columbia have decided to expand their Medicaid program, and four more are still considering it. The remaining 21 -- mainly states with Republican political leadership -- have opted out. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama’s claim the worst rating on their scale -- Four Pinocchios. We thought we’d take a look, too. We asked the White House if it would like to explain Obama’s claim, but the press office did not offer any additional information. (The White House didn’t talk to the Post’s Fact Checker, either.) But we think we have a pretty good idea where the president got his number from -- a report released Jan. 22 by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, titled, ""Medicaid & CHIP: December Monthly Applications and Eligibility Determinations Report."" According to that report, the cumulative number of individuals determined eligible for Medicaid (or a related but separate State Children’s Health Insurance Program) by state agencies during October, November and December 2013 was a little more than 6.3 million. That’s not 7 million, but it’s approaching that number. However, the report notes some caveats about the 6.3 million figure. The number, according to the report, ""includes those newly eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those eligible under prior law and, for some states, renewals."" In other words, the number includes people who were already eligible under the old, pre-Obamacare Medicaid rules and ""came out of the woodwork,"" so to speak, during the last three months of 2013. This means they did not suddenly gain ""access to health care for the first time"" due to Obamacare, which was the standard Obama used in his speech to the governors’ group. The number also includes some people who simply renewed lapsed Medicaid coverage -- people who also wouldn’t be getting ""access to health care for the first time."" So how many people actually got health coverage due to the Medicaid expansion? That’s a tougher nut to crack, because the data is scattered among different states and different categories. Two private-sector efforts to estimate the number produced divergent figures. Charles Gaba, a website developer and blogger in Michigan, has been tracking enrollment figures at his ACASignups.net site. His most recent estimate from late February shows 2.6 million Medicaid sign-ups once you subtract those falling into three categories -- those who signed up in states that didn’t expand Medicaid, those who were previously eligible and who ""came out of the woodwork"" to sign up, and an estimate of the typical ""churn"" for Medicaid sign-ups in those states. Meanwhile, Avalere, a health-care consulting firm, concluded that over the three-month period, between 1.1 million and 1.8 million people newly enrolled for Medicaid due to Obamacare. Avalere developed its estimates in part by comparing the CMS data on new enrollments to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013. The idea is to see how much of a ""bump"" in enrollments materialized due to the Medicaid expansion. There’s a significant difference between 1.1 million and 2.6 million, but the important factor for our fact-check is that both numbers are well short of Obama’s 7 million figure (and CMS’ 6.3 million figure). Our ruling Obama said, ""We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion."" Obama’s 7 million figure was a stretch even compared to his own administration’s 6.3 million figure. But more problematic is a disconnect between what he said and what the administration data is showing. The administration’s 6.3 million figure includes a lot of the ""churn"" in Medicaid that has nothing to do with the new law’s Medicaid expansion, as well as new sign-ups of people who were previously eligible for Medicaid -- and thus were not granted ""access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion,"" in Obama’s words. The actual number is estimated to be between one-seventh and two-fifths of what Obama said it was.
