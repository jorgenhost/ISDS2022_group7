India requires voter ID, but its system still leaves some citizens disenfranchised
","As voting rights legislation has taken center stage in the United States, social media posts point to other countries that require voter identification as a model for the U.S. ""India has nearly 1.4 billion citizens. Nearly 800 million of them live in extreme poverty — less than $1.90 per day. Yet EVERY singly (sic) Indian citizen is required to have a valid form of ID to vote in national elections,"" says a Jan. 12 post on Facebook. It continues, ""What excuse does America have to not do the same?"" The claim came from Jovan Hutton Pulitzer, who pushed conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation  on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post implies that a country with a large population and high poverty can require voter identification without disenfranchising voters. But it gets a fact wrong, and leaves out important context about voting in India and the debate over voter ID in the U.S. The post significantly misstates how many people live in extreme poverty in India. An estimated 134 million live on less than $2 per day, not 800 million, according to Pew Research Center. In India, citizens are required to have a valid form of identification to vote in national elections, which can include a voter ID card or other documents issued by the government, such as a passport, driver’s license or birth certificate. But before they can vote, they must enroll as new voters and their names must appear on electoral lists, according to the Election Commission of India. Reports indicate that some citizens — mostly minorities and women — have not been able to get their names added to electoral lists or were removed from the lists, which means they cannot vote. Indian citizens become eligible to enroll as new voters when they turn 18. The only citizens who are not entitled to be included on electoral rolls are ""persons who are of unsound mind and have been declared so by a competent court or disqualified due to 'Corrupt Practices' or offences relating to elections,"" the government’s national portal says. In practice, though, people are not always added to the electoral rolls when they register, sometimes without explanation; others are removed from the rolls without explanation, Foreign Policy magazine reported in 2019, after the last national election.  
A polling official, right, checking the name of an Indian woman voter during the seventh and final phase of national elections in Dharmsala, India, May 19, 2019. (AP) ""India is often celebrated for its status as the world’s largest democracy, but relatively little attention is given to the fact that many citizens are denied the chance to vote,"" the magazine said. ""The founders of Missing Voters, a smartphone app to track disenfranchised voters in India, estimated that nearly 120 million citizens were missing from voter lists in last May’s national election."" Minorities and women make up a disproportionate number of the people missing from electoral rolls, the magazine reported.  Other researchers corroborated the report: ""​​We find enough evidence that shows various problems in electoral rolls have become stumbling blocks preventing citizens from exercising their right to vote,"" they wrote in The Print, an Indian publication, during the 2019 election. India had about 900 million eligible voters during the 2019 election, according to CNN. About 67% of those eligible cast a ballot in the 2019 national election, The Hindu newspaper reported, or around 603 million people.  The U.S. has no national-level ID requirement to vote, but 35 U.S. states have laws asking voters to show some form of identification at the polls, while the remaining states require other identifying information when voters cast ballots, such as a signature, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. What bothers some voting rights advocates is what’s in the mix of allowable options for acceptable IDs. In Texas and Tennessee, for example, gun permits are considered valid voter IDs, but student IDs are not. Critics say this makes it easy for gun owners, a heavily Republican group, to vote but harder for students, a predominantly Democratic group. Also, voters who lack government-issued IDs tend to be nonwhite. Proposed legislation backed by Democrats would expand the range of acceptable IDs and provide a workaround for voters who don’t have an ID. A Facebook post says, ""India has nearly 1.4 billion citizens. Nearly 800 million of them live in extreme poverty — less than $1.90 per day. Yet EVERY singly (sic) Indian citizen is required to have a valid form of ID to vote in national elections. What excuse does America have to not do the same?"" The claim implies that a country with a large population and extreme poverty was able to implement a voter identification law without disenfranchising voters. But it errs in a couple of ways. The post misstates how many people in India live in extreme poverty; the correct number is estimated at 134 million, not 800 million. India has a national voter ID requirement, but the post leaves out important context about voting in the U.S. and India. In India, before casting a vote, citizens must enroll as new voters and be included on electoral lists. Reports have indicated that people are not always added to the rolls when they register, and others are removed from the rolls without explanation. In the U.S., most states have an ID requirement for voting, and the rest require some type of identifying information. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. ",/factchecks/2022/jan/19/facebook-posts/india-requires-voter-id-its-system-still-leaves-so/

No evidence Donald Trump is fluent in Japanese
","A post on Facebook suggested that former President Donald Trump is fluent in Japanese, despite a significant lack of documentation of such a skill. ""Is Donald Trump a trained Quantum Physicist?

(PolitiFact reached out to the White House Historical Association and did not hear back.) It’s unknown whether Trump studied any foreign languages at the New York Military Academy, Fordham University or the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, because he has refused to publicly release his high school and college transcripts, The Washington Post reported. As president, Trump used translators when meeting with foreign dignitaries, including those from Japan. During his first visit with then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in February 2017, Trump did not wear a translator earpiece for the opening remarks, according to reporters’ tweets. In photos and videos of the event, Trump is seen nodding along as if he understood Abe’s speech, even though Trump could not hear the English translation. At the time, White House officials told reporters that Trump had previewed an English translation of the speech and had spoken with Abe about the topics extensively prior to the event. Trump wore an earpiece to hear translations after the opening remarks. In later visits with Abe and other Japanese officials — like this one in April 2019 — Trump also used an interpreter or a translation device. A Facebook post claimed that Trump is fluent in Japanese. There is no evidence that the former president is proficient in Japanese or any other foreign language. As president he required translation assistance.

Woman indicted in 1983 Capitol bombing is not a Black Lives Matter administrator
","The one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol reminded one social media user of an attack decades earlier: a late-night bomb blast near the Senate chambers. A Facebook post reads: ""Did you know that on November 7, 1983 the May 19th Communist Organization detonated a bomb in the senate in an attempt to kill Republicans? Susan Rosenberg was arrested for this. She was pardoned by Clinton. She is now an administrator for Black Lives Matters and now does fundraising and administrative work for BLM."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Nov. 7, 1983, a late-night bomb blast set off by a left-wing group caused extensive damange to a conference room near the Senate chambers. No one was injured in the attack, which caused about $1 million in damage, according to some reports. The May 19th Communist Organization is described by the FBI as ""a Marxist-Leninist organization which advocated the armed revolution and violent overthrow of the United States Government.""  It used several aliases, including the ""Armed Resistance Unit."" That was the name the group gave when it called the Capitol switchboard and the Washington Post shortly before the bombing. The group said its goal was to oppose U.S. military involvement in Grenada and Lebanon. Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate at the time, but the group stated in a letter to NPR taking credit for the attack that it was not attempting to kill anyone. It did suggest the possibility of deadly violence in the future. ""We purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling class and government. We did not choose to kill any of them this time. But their lives are not sacred …, "" the group wrote, according to the Washington Post. Rosenberg was one of the group’s earliest members, according to Smithsonian Magazine. She was one of seven members of the group indicted in 1988 in the Capitol bombing, as well as other building attacks around that time. Charges were dropped against Rosenberg and two others in a 1990 deal in which three others pleaded guilty, so she was never tried or convicted in the Capitol attack. Rosenberg at the time of the 1988 indictment was serving a 58-year sentence after she was caught bringing guns and more than 600 pounds of explosives to a New Jersey storage facility in 1984. After Rosenberg served 16 years in prison, President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence on his last day in office on Jan. 20, 2001. Rosenberg does not work for Black Lives Matter, but sat on the board of directors of an organization called Thousand Currents. PolitiFact has previously reported that Thousand Currents, a nonprofit that partners with grassroots groups and movements, partnered with the Black Lives Matter Global Network in a fiscal-sponsorship agreement.  The group provided ""administrative and back-office support, including finance, accounting, grants management, insurance, human resources, legal and compliance,"" a spokesperson for Thousand Currents told us in 2020. An archived web page from February 2021 said that the fiscal-sponsorship agreement with Black Lives Matter was in effect from 2016 to 2020. It said the group’s fiscal-sponsorships have sunset so that the organization can ""​​focus on its core grantmaking to grassroots groups and movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.""  An archived web page for Thousand Currents from June 16, 2020 lists Rosenberg as vice chair of its board of directors and describes her as a human and prisoner rights advocate. The board of directors page is no longer available and redirects to the group’s homepage.  That appears to be in response to what the group in a blog post on July 6, 2020 called ""hateful disinformation campaigns,"" that forced it to protect the privacy of staff that became ""targets of harassment."" The topic of Rosenberg and the charity’s connection to Black Lives Matter was the subject of numerous articles in conservative media that summer. It’s not clear how involved, if at all, Rosenberg was in the group’s work for Black Lives Matter. According to Thousand Currents most recent tax return filed in March of 2021, Rosenberg was listed as its vice chair of the board. The return shows Rosenberg did not receive any compensation from Thousand Currents and that she averaged about two hours of work per week.  We reached out by email to Thousand Currents to ask if Rosenberg is still affiliated with the group and whether her work directly involved the Black Lives Matter sponsorship, but have not heard back. A Facebook post claims that Susan Rosenberg is a Black Lives Matter administrator who was arrested in a 1983 bombing at the U.S. Capitol. Rosenberg is not an administrator for Black Lives Matter. She did serve on the board of directors for a nonprofit called Thousand Currents, which helped manage grants for the Black Lives Matter Global Network in a fiscal-sponsorship agreement. That partnership ended in 2020, and it’s not clear if Rosenberg’s work directly involved Black Lives Matter. Rosenberg was indicted in 1988 in the Capitol bombing, but the charges were dropped in 1990 while she was serving a lengthy prison sentence on separate charges of illegal possession of weapons and explosives.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/jan/19/facebook-posts/woman-indicted-1983-capitol-bombing-not-black-live/

Debunked claim about boneless chicken wings makes the rounds again
","It was Super Bowl season — prime time for feasting on chicken wings — when a baseless claim about the boneless delicacy first surfaced six years ago.

No, Joe Biden never said ‘dozens of police were killed’ during the U.S. Capitol attack
","A Facebook post made on the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6  attack on the U.S. Capitol is claiming to have fact-checked a statement made by President Joe Biden regarding the number of deaths during the attack. The post claims Biden said ""dozens of police were killed on Jan. 6,"" and features a photograph of the president appearing to give a speech. ""FACT CHECK,"" text below the image reads. ""According to the official FBI database for Jan. 6, 2021, exactly zero people died in DC on that day. We rate Joe Biden’s claim false."" The post, which we found on a Facebook page called ""Resist 46,"" was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photograph of Biden featured in the post was originally taken by an Agence France-Presse photographer during a speech the president gave on the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack. At no point in his speech did Biden say ""dozens of police were killed"" on Jan. 6. We also searched the internet, Nexis news archives and transcripts of Biden’s speeches and public remarks and found nothing that would substantiate the claim that Biden said this. However, the president did say in his Jan. 6, 2022, speech that more than 140 police officers were injured during the attack. He also specifically mentioned U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was pepper sprayed twice during the rioting and died a day later after suffering two strokes. Sicknick was determined to have died of natural causes, but Washington, D.C.’s chief medical examiner told The Washington Post ""all that transpired (in the attack) played a role in his condition."" The Facebook post makes reference to an ""official FBI database for Jan. 6, 2021"" that claims ""zero people died in D.C. on that day.""  The FBI does keep track of the number of law enforcement officers who were killed and assaulted in the line of duty through its Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The data is voluntarily submitted to the FBI from participating law enforcement agencies, and officers who died from natural causes, by suicide or from their own personal situations are not considered as line of duty deaths and assaults.  Because Sicknick died of natural causes, and the deaths of four other officers who responded to the attack were by suicide, they would not be counted.  While the Uniform Crime Reporting Program does track crime statistics, its data currently only goes up to 2020.  The agency also has a database pertaining to the Capitol attack — it’s a collection of photographs and videos the agency is using to help identify suspected rioters. The FBI did not immediately respond to our request for comment. A bipartisan Senate report released in June 2021 found that a total of seven people died in connection to the attack, three law enforcement officers including Sicknick and four people who attended the pro-Trump rally that turned into a violent assault on the Capitol. Both U.S. Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood and Washington Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith died by suicide in the days following the attack. Liebengood died on Jan. 9 while Smith died on Jan. 15. Two more officers who responded to the Capitol attack would subsequently die by suicide following the release of the Senate report. Metropolitan Police Officer Kyle DeFreytag was found dead on July 10 and Metropolitan Police Officer Gunther Hashida was found dead in his home on July 29. The four people who attended the pro-Trump rally were Ashli Babbitt, Rosanne Boyland, Kevin Greeson and Benjamin Phillips. Babbitt, 36, was an Air Force veteran and QAnon conspiracy theorist who was shot and killed on Jan. 6, 2021, by a Capitol police officer while attempting to climb through a barricade in the House of Representatives. Boyland, 34, was a Georgia resident and supporter of Trump and the QAnon conspiracy theory. It was initially believed Boyland died after being trampled by a mob of people attempting to enter the Capitol building, but it was later determined she passed away during the attack because of an accidental amphetamine overdose. Greeson, 55, was an Alabama native who died from a heart attack while attending the pro-Trump rally outside of the Capitol. Phillips, 50, organized a caravan of Trump supporters from his native Pennsylvania to attend the rally in Washington. He died of a stroke.   A Facebook post claims that Biden said ""dozens of police were killed"" during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The post goes on to say the FBI has no evidence that anyone died during the attack. We found no proof that Biden ever said those remarks and the deaths during the Capitol attack have been well documented by both government officials and the news media. Of the deaths connected to the attack, five were of law enforcement officers.  We rate the post’s claim as Pants on Fire.

No, putting a stop to COVID-19 testing won't make the pandemic disappear
","As the omicron variant of the coronavirus fueled a surge of COVID-19 cases around the United States, a Facebook post resurfaced the idea that testing for the virus is the reason why the pandemic has persisted. The Jan. 5 Facebook post is an image macro featuring a screenshot of Glinda the Good Witch from the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz."" ""If you stop testing it all goes away and people just have colds like before,"" reads text superimposed on the screenshot. The post, which we found on a Facebook page called ""Funny Clean Memes,"" was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post essentially makes the claim that the pandemic has only endured because of large-scale testing. But if testing for COVID-19 were to stop, the virus wouldn’t just go away. A halt in testing would eliminate data showing where and how the virus has spread — it would not mean that the virus would no longer exist, said Vickie Mays, a professor of psychology and health policy and management at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health. ""It’s the data that indicates that, not only does the problem exist, but it also tells you about the magnitude of the problem,"" she said. Mays said that widespread testing and vaccinations have changed what the pandemic looks like now. In the early days of the pandemic, before widespread testing and vaccinations, people who had COVID-19 developed serious symptoms. Because of the nature and severity of their symptoms, a test wasn’t strictly needed to tell if someone had COVID-19, Mays said. With a larger number of people vaccinated against the virus, those who test positive now may likely develop only mild symptoms, but they are still infectious. ""The milder response might look like it’s a cold,"" Mays said. ""But those colds are literally not just a cold. They may be indicators that a person might be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus."" The U.S. saw a daily average of 756,752 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks, with the average daily testing rate at 2.5 million, according to the New York Times’ coronavirus tracker. However, the numbers are likely an undercount because of a lack of access to testing and people who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms choosing to not get tested. One group of researchers found that, at one point in the pandemic, up to 60% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. went unreported. Testing is also used to screen for asymptomatic infected people, as they could unknowingly spread the virus to others. It’s particularly important when an asymptomatic person lives in a group environment, such as a nursing facility or multi-generational home, according to the National Institute on Aging. A Facebook post claims that, if people were to stop testing for COVID-19, the pandemic would go away and people will ""just have colds like before."" Testing does not cause the virus, and putting a stop to it wouldn't mean an end to the pandemic. Testing is important to track the spread and severity of the virus in a community. If testing does stop and people appear to just have colds, that could still mean they’re infected with COVID-19. A person who is vaccinated against the virus but still gets infected is more likely to develop mild symptoms that have the appearance of a cold. They could unknowingly spread the virus to other people. We rate the Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2022/jan/19/facebook-posts/no-putting-stop-covid-19-testing-wont-make-pandemi/

No, WHO has not said COVID-19 no worse than the flu
","Reiner Fuellmich, a German lawyer who has spread misinformation about the origins of COVID-19 and the accuracy of PCR tests, is in a video shared on Facebook in which he downplays the severity of the coronavirus. Fuellmich claimed that the World Health Organization has said that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the flu.    ""Even the WHO has conceded that the virus, regardless of whether it is fully or semi-artificial or natural, is no more dangerous than the common flu, with an infection fatality rate of 0.14%,"" he said in the video posted Dec. 30.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The World Health Organization said in an emailed statement that it never said that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the common flu.  The WHO said that it does not have a single global estimate for the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19, but that previous studies have estimated it at around 0.6%. Seasonal influenza has an infection fatality ratio of about 0.1%, subject to fluctuations. That’s about six times lower than the figure WHO pointed us to. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in April that the infection fatality rate for COVID-19 in the U.S. is 0.7%. The CDC included the figure in a report on the findings of an outside peer-reviewed study. The study had taken that figure from a meta-analysis of other studies, published in September 2020.   The infection fatality rate for the flu is much lower. In one particularly bad season, the IFR for symptomatic influenza A was .126%, according to a CDC report of deaths from the 2017-2018 flu season. That season was atypical, with more cases of severe flu for all ages. In the 2019-2020 season, the IFR for symptomatic cases was .058%. The COVID-19 infection fatality ratio, which estimates the proportion of deaths among all infected individuals, has varied widely across studies, as scientists use different data sources to evaluate how different populations are affected by the virus. The ratio also varies significantly by age, increasing in age groups above 60 years old, by underlying conditions, and by socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, the WHO said. To make these calculations, scientists use  data on the presence of antibodies among different populations, also known as serological surveys.  ""As data from serological surveys is compiled, this estimate will continue to evolve, including adjustments for new developments such as increasing numbers of people vaccinated,"" the WHO said in a statement emailed by a spokesperson. ""Irrespective of the precise estimate, COVID-19 remains a dangerous and deadly infectious disease, claiming thousands of lives each day."" The WHO referred us to two studies to support its statement. A study in Nature from November 2020 estimated that the COVID-19 infection rate ratio increased with age, ranging from .001% in children ages 5-9, to 8.29% in people age 80 and older. Authors said  there are ""key unanswered questions with regard to the consistency of mortality patterns across countries."" In a study in the Lancet, from June 2020, researchers estimated that the overall COVID-19 infection fatality ratio for China was 0.66%, which increased with age.  Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said overall infection fatality ratio for COVID-19 was around 0.6%, but it has fallen somewhat because of better treatments. However, that’s still higher than the seasonal flu which has been measured at around 0.1%.  ""Irrespective of the IFR, seasonal flu doesn’t kill 800,000 Americans or crush hospitals the way COVID did,"" Adalja said.  In an overview of six prior studies, Dr. John P. A. Ioannidis of Stanford University found the infection fatality rate, which is the probability of dying for a person who is infected, to be around  0.15%, though he warned that it varies widely around the world.  An investigation into the Diamond Princess Cruise outbreak published in May 2020 found that the case fatality rate, or the number of deaths per confirmed cases, was 0.5%, when adjusted for age. While warning that such assessments are premature, the authors in that study noted: ""A case fatality rate of 0.5% would still be 5 times the commonly cited case fatality rate of adult seasonal influenza."" Dr. Thomas A. Russo, an infectious disease researcher at the University at Buffalo and a practicing physician, said that an undercounting of people infected with COVID-19 and an undercounting of deaths makes reliable data on deaths per infection difficult to come by. He estimates that the true infection mortality rate is between 0.4% and 0.8%. While flu is a lethal disease, Russo said, he thinks Fuellmich underestimates the risk from COVID-19.  ""I think we can all agree, we never with influenza see the carnage that we’re seeing with COVID,"" Russo said. We reached out to Fuellmich for evidence to support his claims but did not hear back.  Other fact-checkers have also looked into these claims.  Correctiv, which is based in Germany and is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network, found in October 2020 that the WHO did not confirm that COVID-19 is less bad than the flu. The WHO told Correctiv that flu deaths vary every year, but that it estimated the infectious mortality rate for seasonal flu to be below 0.1%, which means the severity of the flu is ""much lower"" than of  COVID-19. In October 2020, Health Feedback found that this claim was based on a misinterpretation of a WHO estimate, and is inaccurate. PolitiFact found in October 2020 that by one estimate, COVID-19 is about 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.  Fuellmich said that the WHO has said that COVID-19 is no worse than the flu, and that the infection fatality rate is 0.14%.  In a statement to PolitiFact, the WHO said that it never said that COVID-19 is no worse than the flu. Estimates of the infection fatality ratio vary widely, and the WHO said prior estimates are 0.6% — far higher than the 0.14%  Fuellmich claimed. The CDC in April published findings from a paper showing that the infection fatality rate for COVID-19 in the U.S. is 0.7%. We found other estimates for the infection fatality ratio and rate to vary, and we noted one as low as 0.15%. But scientists warn that the infection fatality rate can be influenced by the availability of testing, the age of the population, socioeconomic conditions, and other factors.  Fuellmich was incorrect about the WHO making a favorable comparison between the coronavirus and the flu, and his infection fatality rate estimate was lower than those in many published studies. His statement suggests a level of certitude that the WHO has never conceded. We rate this claim False.   ",/factchecks/2022/jan/19/reiner-fuellmich/no-who-has-not-said-covid-19-no-worse-flu/

The ice loss added 1.5 millimeters to the average global sea level, which NASA said was enough to cover California with 4 feet of water. Still, satellite images taken by NASA that year show it looks nothing like the Facebook post. The image makes ""no sense,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""It seems to be showing the Greenland ice sheet present day (left) compared to some rendition of what the island would look like without an ice sheet,"" Serreze told PolitiFact.  Serreze said it would be ""many centuries"" at current warming rates before the Greenland ice sheet disappears. The ice sheet makes up 80% of Greenland and is the second-largest ice sheet in the world, behind the Antarctic ice sheet. The picture of the emaciated bear was not actually taken in 2019.  In 2015, a photographer named Kerstin Langenberger spotted the bear in the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean east of Greenland and took a photo of it, drawing the conclusion that the bear’s poor condition was due to climate change. Langenberger’s picture garnered media attention, including from the CBC in Canada.  But even a defender of polar bears wasn’t buying it. ""When you get claims that this picture of this particular bear is evidence of climate change then you’ve crossed a bridge too far,"" said Geoff York, Polar Bears International's senior director of conservation, in a CBC interview. Another expert pointed out that it’s unlikely that the images show the same polar bear. Andrew Derocher, professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada, said none of the 19 polar bear populations monitored in Alaska, Canada, Norway and Greenland have gone through such a shift in overall body condition within a 10-year period. The skinny bear’s grim condition could have been due to reasons other than climate change, like disease, advanced age and injury.  ""Yes, individuals undergo changes in condition, but an animal (in) such an advanced stage of malnutrition is an extreme situation and not what has been observed on a population level,"" Derocher said. Jennifer Francis, acting deputy director and senior scientist at the Woodell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts, said there are studies, like one published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, that indicate polar bears’ health is declining due to rapid sea ice loss. Polar bears use ice to capture sea lions.  But Serreze said there really isn’t a connection between the ice loss in Greenland and the distressed polar bear. ""The issue with polar bear habitat is loss of the Arctic Ocean's floating sea ice cover,"" he said.  A Facebook post claimed to show that within 10 years, climate change has gutted the Greenland ice sheet and caused a healthy polar bear to waste away. The post is exaggerated. Greenland did lose a record amount of ice in 2019, but the loss recorded in satellite images was not what the post suggested. It’s not clear where or how the ""after"" photo was generated. In addition, the picture of the emaciated bear was taken in 2015, not 2019. Experts point out that while polar bears have been affected by climate change, there are other factors that could have contributed to the bear’s poor health. We rate this 10-year challenge False.  ",/factchecks/2022/jan/19/facebook-posts/10-years-challenge-climate-change-exaggerates-impa/

Attack that calls GOP House member a socialist is wrong that a bill would create a tracking database
","The time-honored campaign tactic of tarnishing a candidate as a socialist is being deployed again early in the new year — but this time one of the targets is a Republican. Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida, who is running in 2022 for a second term, has been branded a socialist in several Facebook ads by the conservative America First Political Committee. The former Miami-Dade County mayor has a ""sorid (sic) socialist record,"" one of the ads states, and ""he wants a national database to track you and discriminate against you."" The ad cites Gimenez’s vote for H.R. 550, alleging the bill would ""greenlight the development of a federal vaccination registry, aka database."" We found no evidence it would do that. The House on Nov. 30 voted 294-130 to approve H.R. 550, the Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act. No action has been taken in the Senate. The bill would authorize $400 million in grants to state and local health departments to update their computer databases of immunization records — not create a database or registry.  It would direct the federal Health and Human Services Department to ""improve data sharing and other aspects of immunization information systems. These are confidential, population-based databases that maintain a record of vaccine administrations,"" according to a Congress.gov summary. Multiple experts said the post’s characterization of the bill is inaccurate. Sharona Hoffman, professor of law and bioethics and co-director of Case Western Reserve University’s Law-Medicine Center, said the aim is to improve the existing databases’ accuracy and ability to exchange information; support the administration of vaccines; and require a report that assesses immunization access in medically underserved, rural and frontier areas. Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, agreed that the bill would not create a federal database. The vaccine data systems at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""are weak, and this legislation would help upgrade the agency's collection and sharing of data,"" he added. Dr. Joseph Kannry, chair of the Public Policy Committee of the American Medical Informatics Association, said the bill ""would allow doctors to assess how much of the population is at risk during any pandemic, including potential future outbreaks. It could ensure equity of distribution of vaccines and other resources."" Asked for information to back its claim, the America First Political Committee sent us a statement from Dec. 7 that repeated its claim, among others about Gimenez. Gimenez’s House office and campaign did not reply to our requests for comment. Thomas Miller, a senior fellow in health care policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that the bill, ""in earlier times, would seem like the typical effort to facilitate better immunization-related health data — not an unusual objective, given its current limited state."" ""This legislation and reactions to it illustrate our more overheated and polarized reactions to many changes in national data reporting and development during the pandemic era. Much of this could be considered a necessary updating of poorly performing health data standards and processes, assuming one allows a limited amount of good faith presumptions on the part of federal health administrators and regulators.  ""Of course, if one mostly fears the worst, any change presents a threat."" So far in 2022, the ""socialist"" attack line has been leveled against Democrats in races in Georgia, Missouri, Minnesota and Kentucky. The ads were paid for by the campaigns of Republican Reps. Drew Ferguson of Georgia and Pete Stauber of Minnesota; and the campaign of GOP House candidate Kalena Bruce of Missouri; and by the Kentucky Freedom PAC against Charles Booker, a Democrat running for the seat held by Sen.

Bogus claims about Gavin Newsom being executed, cloned get picked up at Trump rally
","The live-stream of Donald Trump’s Arizona rally from Right Side Broadcasting, a right-wing website known for streaming Trump’s events, took a conspiratorial turn when one attendee insisted that California Gov. Gavin Newsom had been executed and replaced with a clone. ""Newsom’s a clone, OK? They just took him out,"" the rally goer told RSBN’s Brian Glenn before the Jan. 15 event in Florence, Arizona. ""The real Governor Newsom has had his military tribunal at Gitmo. He’s been executed. OK?"" The claim appeared to be a reference to recent articles on Real Raw News, a misinformation website that regularly publishes made-up stories alleging that various public figures have been arrested by the military, transported to Guantanamo Bay, tried and executed. Similar narratives have taken hold in the past among some supporters and promoters of the QAnon conspiracy theory. The website’s lead story from Jan. 3: ""Gavin Newsom Gets Death Penalty.""

Lawmaker's claim that mask mandates harm early childhood development falls short of scientific proof
","As the omicron variant of COVID-19 is surging across the United States, some states and municipalities are returning to mask mandates. In Milwaukee, the Common Council on Jan. 18, 2022, approved a change to the city's existing mask ordinance to require masks for anyone at least 3 years old in buildings open to the public.  All of that has led to a new round of pushback from critics. That could be seen in the response to a Nov. 29, 2021 announcement by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of a new universal masking policy for federally-funded Head Start education centers. That policy applies to everyone above the age of 2, including all staff, volunteers and contractors. Two Republican lawmakers – U.S. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota and U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan – introduced a bill to bar such a requirement, which also faces a host of legal challenges across the country. U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wisconsin, had this to say in a Dec. 21, 2021 Twitter post: ""Mask mandates on children lead to learning loss that harms early childhood development.""  Most of the concern about learning loss has been centered on virtual learning, instead of in-person classes. Is Fitzgerald right about mask mandates? When asked for supporting information, Fitzgerald’s office pointed us to a Dec. 21, 2021 letter crafted by McClain and sent to Dr. Bernadine Futrell, director of the Office of Head Start. Fitzgerald was among those who signed the letter, and he included a link to it in his tweet. ""We have grave concerns that your (Head Start Program Performance Standards) rule requiring universal masking for all individuals two years of age and older and universal masking and vaccinations for staff, certain contractors, and volunteers will further exacerbate the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic,"" the letter reads, in part.  The letter cited an Aug. 11, 2020 article that can be found online via the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) that states how important ""facial recognition and expressions are for learning among young children.""  Online sources describe NLM, operated by the National Institutes of Health, as the world’s largest medical library. The article in question was written by Manfred Spitzer, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Ulm in Germany.  The article notes that ""covering the lower half of the face reduces the ability to communicate, interpret, and mimic the expressions of those with whom we interact."" It goes on to say: ""positive emotions become less recognizable, and negative emotions are amplified. Emotional mimicry, contagion, and emotionality in general are reduced and (thereby) bonding between teachers and learners, group cohesion, and learning – of which emotions are a major driver. The benefits and burdens of face masks in schools should be seriously considered and made obvious and clear to teachers and students.""  But the Spitzer article is not based on scientific study. In fact, an ethical statement at the end of the piece notes that ""no data was collected for this opinion paper."" In a Dec. 6, 2021 Science brief, The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that limited available data indicates ""no clear evidence that masking impairs emotional or language development in children."" ""A study of 2-year-old children concluded that they were able to recognize familiar words presented without a mask and when hearing words through opaque masks,"" according to the brief. ""Among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), interventions including positive reinforcement and coaching caregivers to teach mask wearing have improved participants’ ability to wear a face mask. These findings suggest that even children who may have difficulty wearing a mask can do so effectively through targeted interventions."" 
  When asked about the issue, Wisconsin Department of Health Services communications specialist Jennifer Miller emphasized that the article referenced in Fitzgerald’s tweet ""is not a study, but an opinion paper published in August 2020, before a handful of actual studies on this topic were published.""  ""The Wisconsin Department of Health Services believes masks are one of the tools to effectively help stop the spread of COVID-19, but we also recognize that there may be reasons certain groups of people may find it difficult to wear a mask, including some children 2 years and older and people of any age with certain disabilities."" Miller said in an email. With regard to the potential impact of masks on language and emotional development, Miller reiterated the CDC position that ""available data indicate no clear evidence that masking impairs emotional or language development in children.""  Fitzgerald claimed that ""mask mandates on children lead to learning loss that harms early childhood development.""  But the article he and his colleagues cited is an opinion piece, not based on a study. In addition, it came out before other formal studies were completed that showed a different view.  The CDC says limited available data indicates ""no clear evidence that masking impairs emotional or language development in children."" For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.    ",/factchecks/2022/jan/19/scott-fitzgerald/lawmakers-claim-mask-mandates-harm-early-childhood/

Greg Abbott says 22 times Barack Obama said he couldn't shield immigrants, then said 'I changed law'
","After a federal judge in Texas ruled against President Barack Obama’s actions potentially shielding thousands of unauthorized residents from deportation, the Texan who led the court challenge described Obama as a key helper for the states challenging the Democratic president’s authority. Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who in 2014 launched the legal challenge joined by more than 20 other states when he was still the attorney general of Texas, told Sean Hannity of Fox News: ""I think we will win all the way for one simple reason, and that is: The man you just had on the screen, Barack Obama, is our star witness."" Abbott added in the Feb. 17, 2015, interview: ""22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’ Those words alone show that he violated the Constitution and violated federal law."" We learned of Abbott’s quotation of Obama and his ""22 times"" count from a Breitbart.com news story, which also noted the president’s exact wording had previously been, ""I just took an action to change the law,"" and that Obama made that comment five days after the adminstration’s action was announced, not the next day. We looked into Abbott’s count of 22 and his quotation, ultimately finding his statement close to completely so. But we started by revisiting recent history. Obama and Abbott announcements In November 2014, Obama declared the administration’s plans to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions, telling the American people: ""If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes — you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law."" Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president’s statement that his position hadn’t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a ""deferred action"" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. Fast-forward to Dec. 3, 2014; that’s when Abbott announced Texas and other states were challenging the latest Obama move in federal court. And what the state filed that day included a version of the Obama quotation we’re looking into: ""What you’re not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law."" Speaking to reporters, Abbott commented: ""The president’s job is to execute the laws, not de facto make law by suspending parts of laws that are passed by Congress."" We asked Abbott to elaborate on his claim to Fox News and didn’t hear back. But we recognized he’d echoed another Texan’s criticism. In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, drew a Mostly True from us after saying Obama had previously ""said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority"" to act as he did on immigration. McCaul had relied on a list of Obama quotations posted online by House Speaker John Boehner, which we found partly flawed, making McCaul’s count too high. In the end, still, we confirmed nearly 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 of Obama saying he couldn’t do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action. White House response Asked about McCaul's claim at the time, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded by email, pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president’s actions fit within the government’s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. It’s a challenge to characterize the president’s remarks. For instance, Abbott’s legal filing included Obama’s Sept. 28, 2011, response to a law student’s request that he do his part to enable students who immigrated to the U.S. with their parents to become legal residents.   As noted in the legal filing, Obama replied: ""I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We are doing everything we can administratively. But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce."" The legal filing ends the quotation there, yet Obama continued talking and said he retained enforcement discretion. ""Now, what we can do is to prioritize enforcement,"" the president said, ""since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we’re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who’s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status,"" if laws were changed. We counted 15 Obama quotations--not 22--in the Texas-led legal filing supportive of Abbott’s point, with nearly all of them previously tick-tocked in our check of McCaul. For more analysis of relevant details, see our rundown here. Did Obama say he personally ‘changed the law?’ Next, we searched the White House website and isolated what Obama said in a Chicago speech Nov. 25, 2014 after at least one audience member interrupted his remarks to urge a complete end to deportations. Here’s what Obama replied, according to the government transcript: ""I've heard you. But you’ve got to listen to me, too. All right? (Applause.) And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right? Now, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law.  (Applause.) So that's point, number one."" Obama went on: ""Point number two, the way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally. So not everybody qualifies for being able to sign up and register, but the change in priorities applies to everybody."" Our ruling Abbott said that 22 times, Obama ""said he did not have the authority to implement this type of"" anti-deportation ""measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’"" Like McCaul, Abbott overstates the number of confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn’t independently do more to prevent deportations. He also left out some of what Obama said about changing the law and was slightly off on the president’s timing. With these clarifications, though, Abbott’s statement is spot-on. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Federal prison population drops for first time in 3 decades, Eric Holder says
","Federal prisons recently hit a notable benchmark, outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week. In remarks at the National Press Club on Feb. 17, 2015, Holder made the case for sentencing reform and touted the Smart on Crime initiative on his watch. That program discourages federal prosecutors from pursuing harsh minimum sentences for low-level, non-violent drug criminals. ""This newly unveiled data shows we can confront over-incarceration at the same time that we continue to promote public safety,"" he said. ""Already, in fiscal year 2014, we saw the first reduction in the federal prison population in 32 years."" The federal prison population has swelled dramatically since the early 1980s, due in large part to the prosecution of drug-related crimes, so we thought we’d double-check Holder’s statistics. In 1980, the federal prison population was about 24,000. It had hovered around that number since the 1940s. By December 2013 (which came within the federal government’s 2014 fiscal year), federal prisons held about 216,000 inmates, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. That was down by nearly 2,000 inmates from a peak of roughly 218,000 than the year before. That’s a tiny decline -- less than 1 percent, after a nine-fold increase between 1980 and 2013 -- but it’s still the first time the federal prison population had dropped since 1980, the BJS reports. The solid red line in this Bureau of Justice Statistics graph shows the trend:    The drop may eventually grow larger. When he first announced this decline back in September, Holder said internal projections showed a drop of 10,000 federal inmates by fiscal year 2016. We’ll note a few minor quibbles. The decline is actually the first in 33 years not 32, as Holder said. And Holder refers fiscal years, but the best data we could get our hands on goes by calendar year. The reality is that the prison population fluctuates daily, so any figure used for the current period is going to vary a bit. So we won’t count these factors against Holder. Perhaps more interesting than the drop itself is the reason why. One possible factor is the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which sought to remove sentencing discrepancies between crack and powder cocaine-related crimes, and eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for crack possession. Experts said that a contributing factor to the projected future decline is the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s July 2014 decision to allow the possibility of retroactively reduced sentences for individuals incarcerated on drug charges. This potentially affects 50,000 federal inmates. Let’s also put the decline into context. In reality, the federal inmate decline isn’t putting a huge dent into the nation’s prison population. Federal prisoners made up just 12 percent of the nation’s prison population in 2013, according to the BJS report, with those in state prisons and local jails accounting for the other 88 percent. Indeed, the federal decline was actually wiped out -- and then some -- by an increase of 5,000 inmates in the state prison population. Still, the U.S. population as a whole grew faster than the inmate population, meaning that the country’s overall imprisonment rate declined in 2013. ""While the national prison population suggests a modest increase in the incarcerated population, the picture in some states is more drastic,"" said a report out of New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. A report by the Prison Policy Initiative agreed, saying, ""We can’t end our nation’s experiment with mass incarceration without grappling with the wide variety of state-level criminal justice policies, practices and trends."" Finally, we’ll note that, despite the decline, federal prisons remain overcrowded. Medium- and high-security facilities are operating at 40 percent and 50 percent above capacity, respectively, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Our ruling Holder said that last year, ""we saw the first reduction in the federal prison population in 32 years."" The statistics show that Holder is correct. While it’s worth noting that the state prison population wiped out that decline, Holder worded his claim carefully, and federal prisons are the only ones in his portfolio. So we rate it True. Correction, Feb. 24, 2015, 10:30 a.m.: An earlier version of this article said that a policy change that retroactively reduced sentences for certain prisoners convicted on drug charges played a role in the decline of the federal prison population in 2013. However, that policy change came in 2014 and is only going to affect populations in future years. The article has been updated to reflect this discrepancy. The change does not affect the ruling.",/factchecks/2015/feb/23/eric-holder/federal-prison-population-drops-first-time-3-decad/

R.I. Lung Association representative says cigarette butts poison babies and small children
","A bill before the General Assembly would prohibit smoking on public beaches; the Senate Judiciary Committee took testimony on the proposal Feb. 12. There were only two speakers. One was Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,’s Rhode Island chapter, who objected to the provision calling for violators being charged with a misdemeanor. The other was Karina Wood of the American Lung Association, who cited the health dangers of secondhand smoke. But she also talked about another aspect of the issue -- the environmental problems posed by beach butts (the cigarette kind, not the anatomical variety). ""Environmentally, cigarette butts are unsightly. They are the number one polluting litter on our beaches,"" she said. ""I've been involved in beach cleanups myself with my kids and you'll be amazed, or maybe you won't, at how many of those butts are littering our beaches. And they're dangerous to animals -- wildlife, birds."" ""And also they poison babies and small children because of the nicotine in them."" We've heard plenty of reports over the years that cigarette butts are the biggest source of beach pollution in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are really poisoning children, especially babies, whom we think of as not being able to get around on their own. It turns out that Wood was talking about the risks to children of eating discarded butts. When we contacted her to ask for some documentation, she sent us to a few pieces of research. We also sought our own information on the toxicity of nicotine. Common blends of tobacco contain roughly 15 to 25 milligrams per cigarette. The amount of nicotine in a cigarette butt could vary but just a milligram or two can be enough to produce poisoning symptoms in a child. Those symptoms include ""agitation, headache, sweating, dizziness, auditory and visual disturbances, confusion, weakness and lack of coordination,"" according to safety guide for various chemicals on the International Programme on Chemical Safety’s website. That database says the mean lethal dose for children who consume nicotine is about 10 milligrams, although we found another source that reported that the fatal dose was 40 mg to 60 mg for children. Nicotine, a neurotoxin, can kill by causing lung failure or by paralyzing the muscles that control breathing. How common is nicotine poisoning among babies or children? Wood pointed us to two studies. The first was published in the September 2009 edition of the journal Public Health by Jeffrey T. Quirk of the Erie County Department of Health in Pennsylvania. Using a national database covering about 100 U.S. hospitals, it estimated that there were 3,616 cases of cigarette poisonings and 756 cases of cigarette ingestion among children in the United States from 2002 to 2007. That's two a day, typically involving a child age 2 or younger.. Because Quirk only tallied injuries that received or required hospital treatment and didn't include children who might have been treated in homes or doctor's office, ""the actual number of children's cigarette-related injuries may be much greater,"" he concluded. Although they were mostly ""generally minor injuries, these events have the potential to induce serious complications,"" he said. The second study was done, coincidentally, in Rhode Island. For the 31-month period that began in January 1994, the state's Poison Control Center logged 146 cases in which children age 24 months or younger had ingested cigarettes or cigarette butts. Only one case occurred outside a residence -- in this instance it was a public park. In one third of the cases, the child vomited, often more than once. Two thirds of the children had no symptoms.There were no fatalities and the children generally recovered within 12 hours. Once again, that number probably underestimates the actual number of cases, the researchers said, because many parents might not have thought to call poison control. The youngest children in the study, age 6 to 12 months, accounted for 75 percent of the cases. Finally, we found a 2011 review article in Tobacco Control, a journal from the publishers of the British Medical Journal (now BMJ), which reports on 1,289 additional cases that appeared in the medical literature, 239 of which produced symptoms. ""We found that severe poisoning by cigarette butts among young children was rare but possible,"" the researcher said. ""It is clear that smokers must treat cigarette butts as toxic waste products and take more care in discarding them; children will mimic parental behaviour by putting these items into their mouths and sometime consume them in quantities sufficient to be toxic."" Finally, we asked Wood if she meant to include babies in her statement. After all, most babies -- before they become toddlers -- can only eat what people feed them. She pointed out that older babies find plenty of stuff on the floor when they're learning to crawl. ""By way of a personal anecdote, I observed my own daughter, when she was a baby of 11 or 12 months old and crawling, pick up a discarded cigarette butt on the beach and bring it to her mouth,"" Wood said. Dr. William Lewander, coauthor of the 1994 study and current director of pediatric emergency medicine at Hasbro Children's Hospital, said another child who picks up a butt might offer it to a baby and ""once they start crawling, if a cigarette butt is dropped on the floor it's possible"" for poisoning to occur. ""A toddler running around is probably most at risk,"" said Dr. Thomas Novotny, of San Diego State University, coauthor of the 2011 study. For younger children ""it's possible they would crawl around in the sand and put something in their mouth. If a 1 year old were to eat a few butts, they likely would have nicotine toxicity -- increased heart rate, irritability - and there have been some reports of seizures in the past."" In sum, the scientific literature shows that it's not a rare event for doctors and poison control centers to have to deal with young children -- who tend to put just about anything in their mouths -- who have consumed cigarettes or cigarette butts. It's seldom fatal, but it can qualify as a medical emergency, and it doesn't take much to give a child symptoms of poisoning. We rate the claim True.

Delta spokesman correct on federal law and jet fuel tax breaks
","A handful of state lawmakers are pushing legislation to end lucrative tax exemptions on jet fuel that have added tens of millions of dollars to Delta Air Lines’ bottom line for nearly a decade. They have introduced House Bill 175 to eliminate the exemptions first given to the hometown carrier in 2006. That was when Delta was headed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and needed all the help it could get. A similar measure was proposed late in the 2014 legislative session, but never pursued. Delta executives are fighting to stop this year’s bill. They argue it is a tax increase, likely passed onto consumers through higher air fares.  On Feb. 2, Trebor Banstetter, a Delta spokesman, said the bill, sponsored by state Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs, and others, ""violates.federal law and puts the state at risk of losing critical aviation funding from the Federal Aviation Administration."" Ehrhart’s bill would reinstate jet sales taxes on jet fuel used by Delta, sending the proceeds to the state general fund. Banstetter’s point: The FAA in law and policy has made clear that jet fuel tax revenues can only be spent on airports or aviation. Otherwise, FAA funding could be lost. Delta is one of the state’s largest and most influential employers, with $659 million in net income in 2014 and about 32,000 Georgia workers, most in metro Atlanta. PolitiFact decided to check the facts. First, a little background. Lawmakers -- including Ehrhart -- have voted repeatedly to extend the fuel tax exemptions first approved in 2005, saving Delta millions of dollars each years. They made them permanent in 2012. Recently, Ehrhart and the bill’s second sponsor, Rep. Howard Maxwell, R-Dallas, have criticized Delta executives for piping up on political issues. Some Paulding County officials said last year they resented Delta’s vocal opposition to plans to commercialize their tiny county airport. Maxwell said he told Delta officials ""to shut up and leave Paulding County alone."" Ehrhart this year voiced displeasure with Delta CEO Richard Anderson after hearing that Anderson said lawmakers should not be ""chicken"" about raising the state’s gasoline taxes for transportation. He also complained this month on the House floor that one of Delta’s 12 registered lobbyists was threatening co-sponsors of his bill, a charge airline executives deny. Two legislators have withdrawn as sponsors of the bill, according to the House Clerk’s Office. Ehrhart said HB 175 is about ""corporate welfare."" ""We helped them {Delta} when they were struggling and because they were one of the biggest employers in the state. But these things aren’t supposed to last forever. They need to get off the taxpayer dime."" Ehrhart said he expects a hearing on his bill Tuesday. Banstetter said Ehrhart’s bill would violate two federal laws, 49 U.S.C. 47107 and 47133, requiring that any state or local jet fuel taxes imposed after 1987 go to cover airport capital or operating costs. It also would change state law so the existing sales tax exemptions would apply to airlines with a tax liability of less than $15 million per year -- essentially singling out and cutting out Delta, he said. The bill would mean Delta would be subject to jet fuel taxes, including a statewide 1 percent sales tax and a 1-percent transportation special purpose local option sales tax (TSPLOST) in Columbus and Augusta, Banstetter said. Total jet fuel taxes exemptions currently add up to about $21 million a year, the lion’s share for fuel bought by Delta. Georgia received about $67 million in airport funding from the FAA in Fiscal Year 2014, according to the agency’s website. An FAA spokesperson said agency officials as general policy do not discuss pending legislation. The FAA issued a policy statement last November, with major implications for how airlines set up their jet fuel-purchasing operations and making clear that tax money collected on jet fuel could only be used for airport and aviation purposes. State and local governments were given no more than three years to adjust. The jet fuel tax isn’t a make-or-break proposition for the airlines, but a big deal nonetheless. In 2013, United Airlines and American Airlines came under scrutiny for setting up offices outside Chicago in order to make jet fuel purchases, ostensibly to  avoid paying Cook County's taxes, according to news reports. Just this week, a lobbyist for American Airlines told Charlotte N.C. leaders that a state tax break on jet fuel was his airlines’ top legislative priority of the year. Ehrhart told PolitiFact he’ll work to use the three-year window provided by the FAA to Georgia’s advantage. He said his strategy will be to have the fuel tax on Delta reinstated and have the proceeds go the general fund for at least a couple years and then for aviation uses as the FAA requires.  ""That could be $25 million to $45 million a year, real money,"" he said. ""I have a solid legal opinion that we can do that. Delta says we can’t? Tell them to bring their proof, and I’ll bring mine."" Gregory Walden, a former chief counsel at the FAA, was one of a handful of aviation experts we contacted who agreed to comment on the record. ""FAA policy gives states up to three years to come into compliance with its November 2014 policy that state fuel tax proceeds must be directed either to the airport where the fuel is provided or to state aviation programs, Thus, the state (Georgia) will not risk losing any current or future FAA grant funds if it complies with the FAA policy within the period set out in that policy,"" said Walden, an attorney with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld in Washington D.C., an aviation law professor at George Mason University and counsel to Propeller Airports. Propeller Airports has been fighting to expand commercial aviation in Paulding. Kenneth Quinn is an aviation attorney in the Washington law firm of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, whose clients include Delta. Quinn said the airline spokesman’s comments were addressing the legislation as filed, not ""potential revisions"" now being discussed. ""The bill now before the legislature imposes the taxes and permits non-aviation use of revenues indefinitely,"" Quinn said. ""It is difficult to assess the legality of proposed amendments without having the amended language under discussion."" But he questions what Ehrhart is suggesting. ""The three-year period was not a grace period for states or local municipalities to introduce new aviation fuel taxes with non-aviation revenue use,"" Quinn said. ""The bottom line is that Georgia cannot cure the problems in the bill by attempting to recharacterize this new new tax as old. No transition or grace period exists for imposition of this tax."" Our conclusion: Delta’s Banstetter said House Bill 175, sponsored by state Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs, ""violates federal law and puts the state at risk of losing critical aviation funding from the Federation Aviation Administration."" He bases that on federal laws stating that aviation fuel taxes must be used for airports or aviation purposes and an FAA policy statement last November, clarifying the agency’s position and giving governments no more than three years to adjust. We know this: Georgia lawmakers have been passing jet fuel tax exemptions for Delta since 2005, when the airlines was in dire financial trouble. Since Banstetter made his statement, Ehrhart has said he’s developing a plan that would allow the tax money to go to aviation uses by the FAA’s three-year deadline. But reading the bill you couldn’t know that. We rate Banstetter’s statement True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/23/trebor-banstetter/delta-spokesman-correct-federal-law-and-jet-fuel-t/
"['Energy', 'History', 'Virginia', 'Scott Surovell']","
Surovell says decline in coal started under George W. Bush
","Del. Scott Surovell has had it with Republicans blaming President Barack Obama of waging a ""War on Coal."" In a Feb. 4 floor speech, Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Republicans should take blame for the pain in coal country because they’ve taken steps to bolster natural gas, a key competitor to coal. ""When did the decline of coal start? It started when natural gas took off,"" Surovell said. ""That started to begin in President (George W.) Bush’s administration."" We drilled into Surovell’s claim to see if he was right about the timing and cause coal’s fall as well as his laying the blame on Bush. The relationship of coal and natural gas Among the documents Surovell sent us to back his statement was a 2012 report by the Energy Information Administration that examined the annual use of fossil fuels to generate power. It has a chart showing that the downward use of coal and the upward use of natural gas began during the mid 1990s -- before Bush’s presidency from 2001-2009. In the mid 90’s, about 75 percent of fossil power was generated by coal, 20 percent by natural gas and 5 percent by petroleum. In 2012, about 55 percent was fired by coal, 45 percent by natural gas and a negligible share from petroleum. The report cites several reasons why power companies began replacing coal with natural gas. In the mid 1990s, technology began cutting the cost of natural gas generation and an expansion of pipelines ""decreased uncertainties around natural gas availability."" The trend escalated in 2005 when fracking -- the process extracting natural gas from shale -- took off. Surovell also pointed to a 2012 report from the Analysis Group, an economic consulting firm, which said lower natural gas prices along with rising coal prices had contributed to coal company decisions to retire some of their older plants. Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the EIA, pointed us to figures showing that natural gas production started seeing strong growth in the mid-2000s and natural gas prices began a precipitous drop in 2008. The cost of coal, meanwhile, has been on the rise. Other EIA figures show coal consumption and production has generally trended downward since 2008. So the takeaway is that the recent surge in natural gas production and drop in natural gas prices started during the Bush administration and certainly impacted coal use. But to fully explore Surovell’s claim, we have to dig deeper. Did Bush policies cause the coal slide? There’s no doubt Surovell, in his speech, was holding Bush responsible for the rise of natural gas and the fall of coal. ""You want to know who started the war on coal? Take a long good hard look in the mirror folks,"" Surovell told GOP lawmakers. ""The leaders of the Republican Party in the mid 2000s they’re the ones that started this war on coal."" Fracking involves fracturing shale with hydraulically pressurized liquid made of water, sand, and chemicals. Surovell pointed us to the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which Bush signed, that provided exemptions to the Safe Water Drinking Act for chemicals used in fracking. Several energy analysts told us that law did boost shale oil production, but added there were many other factors that led to the boom.   Michael E. Webber, the deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said the ""shale boom"" evolved over many decades, propelled by research and development in fracking that began before the Bush II administration. ""As one of the presidents during that timespan, George W. Bush deserves partial credit,"" Webber emailed. ""However, taking the long view, the policy contributions from his administration are minimal compared to the policies of other presidents and compared with the role of market forces and technological disruptions."" Kenneth B. Medlock III, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, told us that recent presidential administrations shouldn’t lay claim to the natural gas production boom. ""The regulatory environment and laws governing mineral rights and property rights are responsible, and those tenets are more or less as old as the country,"" Medlock said. ""They set the stage for entrepreneurial leadership and risk taking that fosters innovation, hence the shale revolution."" On the coal side of the equation, Medlock said any ""demise"" of coal would have started about a decade ago as new environmental regulations discouraged construction of new coal plants. Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy said the roots of the recent low prices lie in deregulation of the natural gas industry under former President Jimmy Carter. ""It would be Carter who gets most of the credit for low gas prices today,"" said Burtraw, whose group is an energy think tank funded by government, non-profits and energy companies. Regarding coal, Burtraw sent us a chart showing that the number of coal jobs peaked in 1978 and has been falling steadily since, a trend he attributes partly to the emergence of natural gas, but mostly to technological changes in how coal is mined. Our ruling Surovell said the decline of coal ""started when natural gas took off … That started to begin in President (George W.) Bush’s administration."" No doubt, natural gas has been gaining ground on coal in generating electricity. The trend started in the 1990s but clearly gained speed during the Bush administration when the production of natural gas -- a competitor of coal -- picked up. But analysts give little credit or blame to Bush for that trend. They note that other factors, such as technological innovation, entrepreneurship and policies of previous administrations, had more to do with laying the groundwork for the natural gas boom. On balance, we rate Surovell’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/23/scott-surovell/surovell-says-decline-caol-started-under-george-w-/

R.I. AFL-CIO President George Nee says state is one of worst in U.S. for income inequality
","The growing income inequality in the United States -- the gap between rich and poor -- was one of the issues raised Feb. 5 when the House Committee on Labor listened to testimony on a proposal to raise the minimum to $10.10 per hour for most workers. George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, advocated for the increase, telling lawmakers, ""We have some real serious issues in this country with income equality, and Rhode Island, unfortunately, is one of the worst states in terms of the gap."" Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 in January, which would be the fourth increase in as many years, ""is another way of helping to close that,"" he said. We've seen a lot of rankings for Rhode Island, but we apparently missed this one. So we asked Nee for his source. Meanwhile, we went looking ourselves. But first, let's acknowledge that there's no specific definition of how bad Rhode Island would have to be to make it ""one of the ""worst."" Some might say being among the top five worst states would qualify. But we’ll draw the line at being in the top 10. We found a 2012 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C. It gauged the income gap in each state and found that the richest 20 percent of Rhode Island households had incomes that were 7.5 times higher than the poorest 20 percent. But that put Rhode Island in the middle of the income inequality pack, not at the top. So by that assessment, Nee was wrong. Two days later, Nee responded by sending us other analyses. One cited the Gini coefficient, which measures the concentration of wealth using a number ranging from 0 (where everyone has the same amount of wealth) to 1 (where all of the wealth is held by one person). It's based on U.S. Census data. According to the Wikipedia page cited by Nee, Rhode Island ranked 12th worst in income inequality in 2010. New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, California, Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Georgia had more income inequality than we did. That still missed the top 10. We found 2013 state data from the Census Bureau put us even further away from the worst. According to those numbers, Rhode Island has dropped to 13th. If you take the three-year and five-year averages, we're 17th out of 50. Nee also directed us to a Jan. 26, 2015 report and data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute, another Washington, D.C.-based liberal economic think tank. It compared each state's highest earners -- the top 1 percent -- with everyone else. The Institute reports in Table 2 that in 2012, the average income of Rhode Island's top 1% was $966,071.  That’s less than the $1.3 million U.S. average. The average income for the rest of Rhode Island was $44,563, a tad higher than the national average of $43,713. By that measure, Rhode Island had the 29th biggest gap between the top 1 percent and the rest of the state. Once again, if you think income inequality is bad, we're not even close to being the worst. (That report, by the way, concludes that your income needs to be at least $314,647 in Rhode Island to be in the top 1 percent.) Nee also cited a real estate blog that claims Rhode Island is 10th highest in terms of income inequality. That could make us one of the worst, but the blog item doesn't cite the sources of its data and uses a questionable statistical method -- creating four rankings and then averaging them to come up with a fifth ranking -- to reach that conclusion. Thus, we don't regard it as good evidence. Finally, Nee referred us to the ""Executive Pay Watch"" portion of the AFL.CIO's website. There, Rhode Island ranks 3rd when you compare CEO income to the minimum wage (before the minimum wage rose to $9 in January) and 2nd if you compare what those CEOs make compared to average workers' pay, the union says. Rhode Island certainly seems to deserve being called ""one of the worst"" by that measure. The problem: Rhode Island's ranking is based on the compensation for only 10 people -- the CEOs of 10 publicly-traded companies listed on the Russell 3000 index whose headquarters are based in Rhode Island. The growing gap between the pay of CEOs and the average worker may be indicative of income inequality, but this sample size is much too small to draw any useful comparisons between states. The rankings of Wyoming and New Mexico, to give an even better example, are based on the incomes of only one -- that's right, just one -- CEO. And when roughly 2,300 Rhode Island households report adjusted gross incomes of more than a half million each year -- or at least, that was the number for 2008 -- it's not clear that the pay of just 10 CEOs accurately represents all of Rhode Island's wealthy. Nee responded that he believes the data support his assertion. ""It is clear that, even with the increase in the minimum wage from $8 to $9 per hour,"" he wrote in an email, ""Rhode Island's lowest paid employees are falling further and further behind when compared to a sampling of Rhode Island's wealthiest. Rhode Island's minimum wage workers fare amongst the worst in the country in this regard."" Our ruling Rhode Island AFL-CIO President George Nee said Rhode Island is one of the worst states for the gap between rich and poor. His organization's comparison of CEO pay in the country's top public companies with what the average worker makes shows that Rhode Island is close to being THE worst, but that conclusion is based on the pay of only 10 CEOs. The Census Bureau's Gini index and the analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities offers a better assessment of the gap. Yet in neither case does Rhode Island rank as a top 10 state. Because Nee's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

VA secretary claims 900 firings, 60 related to wait times, since he took over
","When Robert McDonald took over as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in July 2014, the department was mired in a scandal over veterans’ health care, involving a whistleblower’s claims that VA employees had manipulated wait-time data. The controversy led to the ouster of McDonald’s predecessor, Eric Shinseki. So what has McDonald done to clean up the embattled department since he arrived? He offered some details during a Feb. 15 appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""We're making fundamental changes in the department in terms of leadership. We have held accountable about 900 employees who are no longer with us that were with us before I became secretary,"" McDonald said. Host Chuck Todd asked McDonald what he meant by ""held accountable."" ""Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary,"" he said. ""We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times."" That seems to be a pretty big house-cleaning. Did that many people really get fired? We decided to see whether 900 people were let go and whether 60 of them were ousted directly because of the scandal. ""Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary"" James Hutton, a VA spokesman, told PolitiFact that ""personnel from a wide range of locations, across the spectrum of pay grades, have been removed. Some of the reasons include poor performance, absenteeism, among several others."" Hutton provided a breakdown of the firings. There were 468 ""removals"" of regular employees. Most of these — 432 — were employees of the Veterans Health Administration, while 27 worked for the Veteran Benefits Administration and the rest worked in other, smaller offices. To get to 900, McDonald is also counting 487 ""probationary"" terminations. When most people go to work for the federal government, they first go through a one-year probationary period — a tryout, if you like. During that probationary period, it is much easier to let go of an employee who isn’t working out. After that, the rules covering firing are tilted more favorably toward the employee. This means that more than half of the firings under McDonald were terminations of probationary employees working at the department for less than one year. That’s important for a few reasons. Most importantly, this means that about half of the people let go under McDonald’s watch were employees who were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren’t even there when it was going on. Also, this makes it unlikely that all 900 terminated employees ""were with us before I became secretary,"" as McDonald put it in the interview. For that to be true, it would mean that not a single probationary hire under McDonald has been let go since he came on in July. Is it possible that Veterans Affairs, which has the second-largest federal workforce, did not fire a single probationary employee in the last seven months? We asked Veterans Affairs to elaborate but didn’t hear back on this point. It’s also worth noting that McDonald’s predecessor, Shinseki, fired 2,247 people during fiscal year 2013, according to multiple reports, including our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker, which awarded McDonald’s claim Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Meanwhile, McDonald is on pace to fire about 1,730 people during his first year, in a department with 325,000 full-time equivalent employees. We take no position on what is the ""right"" number of VA employees to fire. Still, these termination statistics undercut the notion that McDonald came in and cleaned house. The 900 people let go may well have been part of the normal employee churn of a large government agency. ""We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times"" If the first part of the claim has problems, the second part doesn’t appear to be true in the slightest. According to a Feb. 13, 2015, update on adverse employment actions since June 3, 2014, provided to PolitiFact by the House Veterans’ Affairs committees, 75 employees have received disciplinary, or ""adverse employment action,"" related to patient scheduling, record manipulation, appointment delays or patient deaths. Disciplinary action ranges from a written statement of censure, called a ""reprimand"" or ""admonishment,"" to suspension or dismissal. So far, 14 people were either removed, received probationary termination or resigned in lieu of removal. Another nine individuals have removals against them pending. The rest of the 75 individuals will have a written censure on their record (which can be removed after two or three years), were demoted, or will return to work after serving a suspension, the longest of which would be 60 days. McDonald also removed five directors and officers through new authority vested in him by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, a law passed in the aftermath of the scandal. Asked to explain the discrepancy, Hutton said the department has ""proposed disciplinary action related to data manipulation or patient care against more than 60 employees nationwide. This takes into account the full range of accountability actions including admonishments, demotions, reprimands, and termination."" In plain language: Sixty people weren’t fired as a result of the scandal; the secretary’s statement is incorrect. Our ruling McDonald said, ""Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary. We’ve got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times."" He also said that those 900 people ""were with us before I became secretary."" While the data shows that 900 people have been let go under McDonald, half those dismissals were probationary employees, meaning they were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren’t even there when it was going on. Looking at historical trends, the number of terminations looks pretty similar to ordinary personnel churn. More problematic is the claim that 60 people were fired in direct connection with the wait-time scandal. As of mid February, 14 employees had been ousted in one way or another due to the scandal, with another five directors or officers removed as well. Other employees were disciplined without being terminated. Still, the number of terminated employees is well below McDonald’s stated number. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/20/robert-mcdonald/va-secretary-claims-900-firings-60-related-wait-ti/

With Scott Walker's $300 million budget cut looming, UW-Madison says it doesn't have reserves to tap
","The $300 million Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""We can't handle this,"" UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. ""It's not good for the university. It's not good for the state. These are simply too big."" We’ve established that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker’s 2015-’17 state budget. There’s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent. But what about the effect on UW-Madison, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)? At a Feb. 12, 2015 public meeting on Walker’s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament. ""As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut,"" Blank said. ""So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down."" We’ll check both parts of Blank’s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison ""spent down reserves"" as it was told to, and now it has ""no more reserves to spend down."" The reserves backdrop Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in reserves. In fact-checking a claim by the system’s president at the time, we found the amount was roughly in line with some comparable university systems. Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged. The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so. ""Spend down"" The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama’s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so. There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves. But, in effect, there was. The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-’15 state budget. They responded swiftly, instituting a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets. The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other. The UW System’s most recent assessment of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier. Reserves left The second part of Blank’s claim is UW-Madison has ""no more reserves to spend down."" That’s an overstatement. Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as ""designated,"" ""planned"" or obligated"" -- that is, they are earmarked in some way.   But Blank herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school describes as discretionary reserves -- ""fund balances not already committed to payments."" In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That’s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget. On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker’s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn’t zero. Our rating Blank says UW-Madison ""spent down reserves"" as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has ""no more reserves to spend down."" With rhethoric and actions taken with the 2013-’15 state budget, Walker and the Legislature made it clear to UW-Madison and other UW System campuses that they needed to tap their reserves. And UW-Madison did. But Blank, objecting to even larger cuts in state aid now being proposed by Walker, goes too far in saying UW-Madison has no reserves, given that, at a minimum, $54 million in ""discretionary reserves"" are available.

As Florida Legislature weighs allowing guns on college campus, professor cites suicide statistic
","A shooting incident at Florida State University late last year has re-opened a debate in the Florida Legislature about whether to allow guns on college campuses. Gunman Myron May, a former FSU student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. In January, a Florida House panel voted to advance a bill that would allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their guns on campuses. Then, on Feb. 16, a Senate panel approved the bill. Both votes broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition. The bill in question would allow concealed carry permit holders, who must be 21, to carry their firearms into any college or university facility. About 1.3 million people have Florida concealed-carry permits, including about 250,000 between the ages of 21 to 35. During the Senate hearing, college professors and students were among those who testified -- and they came armed with loads of statistics. Marjorie Sanfilippo, an Eckerd College psychology professor who has researched youth access to firearms, expressed concern about allowing guns on campuses. One issue, she said, is that some college students have mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. In fact, college is sometimes the time of life when major illnesses, such as bipolar mood disorder and schizophrenia, first appear. (May, a 31-year-old lawyer who returned to the FSU campus with a gun, suffered from mental health problems.) ""What proponents of this bill won’t tell you is that 200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses -- an all too common event. Is it a stretch to speculate that more of these suicide attempts would be lethal if students had firearms?"" Are suicide attempts that widespread on college campuses? We took a closer look at the available statistics. Statistics on attempted suicide and colleges Sanfilippo told PolitiFact Florida that she took her data from an assessment by the American College Health Association, an advocacy organization for colleges and universities. The association has been collecting health data about college students since 2000. About 76,000 students at 157 colleges and universities took part in the spring of 2012. (The survey included Florida institutions but the association doesn’t release the names of those who participated.) The survey published in 2014 found that about 1.2 percent of college students reported attempting suicide within the past 12 months. There are approximately 20 million college and university students; doing the arithmetic, this translates into about 200,000 suicide attempts. (The association has found similar rates in other years.) Mary Hoban, who oversees the assessment, told PolitiFact Florida there are two caveats. First, the data is self-reported from studies, and second, the schools self-select to participate, ""so our data are not truly generalizable."" We searched for additional data on suicide attempts by college students. Researchers at the University of Texas found that 1 percent of undergraduates had attempted suicide within the past year. That data, from a paper published in 2009, came from a survey of students at 70 colleges and universities. Meanwhile, the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University released a study based on data from 140 colleges and universities and 100,000 students for the 2013-14 year. Unlike other studies which reflect the overall student body, the Penn State study is based on data provided by students when they receive mental health services. It also reflects students who have made a suicide attempt within their lifetime -- not just the past year. Over this longer period, the study found, 9 percent of students had made a suicide attempt. Because this survey looked at a specific population that has received mental-health care, the rates will naturally be higher, said Ben Locke, executive director for the center. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not collected data on suicide attempts by colleges students specifically. However it does have emergency-department data on nonfatal suicide attempts by age. The rate for 20- to 24-year-olds in 2010 was about 300 per 100,000, while the rate for 15- to 19-year-olds was 381 per 100,000. That rate is a lot lower than the one Sanfilippo relied on. However, the use of emergency department visits doesn’t capture people who attempted suicide but didn’t then go to the hospital. ""The actual number presented for care -- especially in an emergency department -- is going to be dramatically lower than people who self-disclose if they had an attempt in the last year,"" said Bill Schmitz, president of the American Association of Suicidology. For example, someone might have tried to overdose on Tylenol but then woke up without serious ill effects. Our ruling Sanfilippo said ""200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses."" That statistic is extrapolated from the American College Health Association’s most recent annual survey, which found that 1.2 percent of college and university students had attempted suicide within the past year. There are approximately 20 million students overall, which translates to about 200,000 suicide attempts. But the study’s author says there are two important caveats: their data is self-reported and the schools self-select to participate. In addition, a different type of survey conducted by the CDC -- one that looked at emergency data -- found a lower rate of suicide in similar age groups, but experts said that’s to be expected because emergency data doesn’t capture attempts that don’t lead to a hospital visit. On balance, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/20/marjorie-sanfilippo/florida-legislature-weighs-allowing-guns-college-c/

Greg Abbott says Texas shockingly has more state workers per capita than California, Illinois
","Before calling for state agencies to spend less, Gov. Greg Abbott delivered a barbed comparison. ""Now many of us in this room including myself have ridiculed states like California and Illinois as bastions of failed big government,"" Abbott said in his Feb. 17, 2015, State of the State address in the Texas House chamber. ""You’ll be as surprised as I was to learn that Texas has more full-time state employees per capita than California and Illinois."" ""That was shocking – and I think it must be changed,"" Abbott continued. Abbott’s office didn’t respond to our request for factual backup for his Texas-to-Californ’ois comparison, but R.J. DeSilva, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, pointed out a chart in the agency’s latest Fiscal Size-up report, published in 2014. The chart indicates that in 2011, Texas state government had 124 full-time equivalent positions for every 10,000 residents, the same ratio as Wisconsin, and also lower than the ratios for 42 states. Still, as Abbott declared, California, with 108 such positions per 10,000 residents, and Illinois, with 102, were among a few states with fewer full-time positions in state government for every 10,000 residents. Here's the whole list:        SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau as cited in Figure 75, ""Fiscal Size-up, 2014-15 Biennium,"" Legislative Budget Board, February 2014. More recent figures Seeking more up-to-date data, we emailed a U.S. Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, who  guided us to the bureau’s March 2013 survey of state government employment, its latest tally. To reach per-capita counts, Bernstein recommended we compare the figures to the agency’s July 2013 state-by-state population estimates, which he sent us. We focused on the bureau’s ""full-time employment"" counts for each state government, which reflected all agencies including institutions of higher education--though not part-time workers, who fill many roles in public colleges and universities, a bureau expert, Jesse Willhide, advised. Upshot: The figures suggest Texas in 2013 had 105 full-time state government workers per 10,000 residents; California had 85; Illinois 79. We also checked full-time equivalent comparisons for the states, which would fold in part-time employees. By this filter, Texas had 119 full-time equivalent workers per 10,000 residents; California 103; Illinois 99. Texas perspectives We ran these figures by Kate Johanns of the Texas Public Employees Association, which lobbies on behalf of Texas state employees and retirees, and Eva DeLuna Castro, a fiscal affairs expert for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income residents. Both pointed out the bureau’s state government employee counts might seem inflated because they roll in workers at public colleges and universities, which draw on income streams besides the state budget Abbott was talking about. Moreover, Castro suggested, comparisons of employee ratios between states don’t account for different ways different states deliver services. Knowing ""what’s a local responsibility in one state versus another is important, because it’s the combined effort that matters,"" Castro emailed. ""That’s why many analysts doing state-level comparisons use the State + Local FTE (full-time equivalent) count."" Her nudge led us to tap census bureau data for 2013 covering state and local full-time government employees; Texas had 5 for every 100 residents; Illinois 4.4; California 3.8. Another take Hoping for out-of-state insight, we reached Scott Moody, a New Hampshire-based senior fellow with the Illinois Policy Institute, a research group that says it generates policy ideas promoting personal freedom and prosperity in the Land of Lincoln. By phone and email, Moody agreed it makes more comparative sense to focus on state plus local government workers state by state, which he does in his research presenting ratios of government workers to every 100 workers in the private sector drawing on employee counts from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. The private-sector comparison is helpful, Moody said, because government agencies and the private sector ""both draw from the pool of labor. In the very short-term, hiring more government workers reduces the pool of labor for the private and vice-versa. This is an important dynamic that is lost in per-capita comparisons,"" he said. With Moody’s help, we downloaded a chart indicating that in 2013, Texas had more state/local full- and part-time government workers for every 100 workers in the private sector than California or Illinois:          Source: Website, ""Govt Workforce,"" Key Policy Data (accessed Feb. 19, 2015) Broadly, Moody told us, he sees value in comparing a state’s ratio to the national average. ""If you’ve above the national average,"" Moody said, ""that’s a good sign you’re out of whack."" In 2013, when Texas had 105 full-time state government workers per 10,000 residents, the national average was 117, according to the census bureau. Per Moody, six states in 2013 had fewer state employees per 100 private-sector workers than Texas: Pennsylvania, California, Nevada, New York, Florida and Illinois. And Texas, which had nearly 4 state employees per 100 private workers, ranked among 30 states with a lower ratio than the national average of nearly 6 state workers per 100 private employees, Moody found. Most recently, according to his research, the ratio of Texas state workers to private-sector workers declined from 2010 through 2013, the last year shown. Also, that year’s ratio of nearly 3.8 was down about 17 percent from the 4.6 state workers for every 100 private-sector counterparts--the highest mark since 1979--in 1994.  Source: Website, ""Govt Workforce,"" Key Policy Data (accessed Feb. 19, 2015) Our ruling Abbott said that to his shock, Texas has more full-time state employees per capita than California and Illinois. That's so. However, this claim lacked substantial context; Abbott cherry-picked two of a few states with lower per-capita state-employee rates than Texas, failing to note Texas ranks among states with the lowest proportion of state government workers. Notably too, its ratio in 2013 trailed the national average. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Did George Washington offer support for individual gun rights, as meme says?
","Would George Washington have been an ally to modern-day gun-rights groups? A social-media meme suggests that he would have. Around the time of Washington’s 282nd birthday, a reader sent us the meme, which includes a painting of Washington and a quote purportedly written or uttered by the nation’s first president: ""When government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern."" But are those really Washington’s words? We contacted Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia. He said ""there is no evidence that Washington ever wrote or said these words, or any like them."" Lengel cautioned that it’s impossible to prove a negative, but he added that he’s ""as certain as he can be"" that the quote did not originate from George Washington. This is not the first time a similar claim has popped onto our radar screen. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated False a claim made two days after the Newtown elementary school shooting. When U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, appeared on Fox News Sunday, he was asked why he believed ordinary Americans should be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for military use. Gohmert answered in part, ""For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government."" PolitiFact Texas contacted Gohmert’s office to seek details on the Washington quotation but didn’t hear back. The closest statement they could find was one Washington made in his first State of the Union address on Jan. 8, 1790: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined."" The academic consensus is that Washington was referring to a trained militia to defend the new nation, rather than anticipating citizens seeking to head off perceived governmental tyranny. Ron Chernow, whose Washington: A Life won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, told PolitiFact Texas that Washington was ""talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies."" Some post-Revolutionary lawmakers did expect citizens to own firearms, but Washington does not appear to have been among them, experts said. ""The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington,"" Lengel told PolitiFact Texas. ""Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians."" Indeed, during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, ""citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced,"" said Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon. Washington was ""concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government,"" and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- ""citizen-soldiers,"" she said, ""acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens."" Our ruling The meme said George Washington said that ""when government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern."" Experts say there’s no evidence that Washington ever said that -- and there are indications that Washington, if anything, favored the arming of trained militias rather than wide swaths of the population.

Human-jellyfish headline misleading, but spawned by real bill
","Let’s be honest. The headline looked like it belonged in Florida. ""Georgia lawmaker pushes bill banning creation of ‘glow in the dark’ human-jellyfish hybrids,"" it screamed over a photo of a contorted face adorned in fluorescent paint. Sure, back in 2010, the state Senate was roundly mocked for voting to oppose forcing microchips into people. (That measure died, maybe from embarrassment). So certainly Peach State lawmakers learned their lesson about drafting bills based on internet rumor and speculation. So PolitiFact Georgia set out to right this gross error, easy peasy. Except … Well, first the good news. The headline makes a giant leap based on a strict reading of House Bill 287. The bill makes no mention of jellyfish. The ""Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act"" would, however, ban human embryos with non-human cells injected into them as well as ... wait for it … any ""human-animal hybrid."" The specifics about the gelatinous sea creatures come from the website of the bill’s lead sponsor, state Rep. Tom Kirby, R-Loganville. The bill is one of his priorities, which his office webpage describes this way: ""The mixing of Human Embryos with Jellyfish cells to create a glow in the dark human, we say not in Georgia. "" What in the name of SpongeBob Squarepants is happening here? Kirby points to news articles, touting scientists’ latest successes in introducing jellyfish genes into various mammals who grow up to glow under a black light. Of particular concern to Kirby is a 2008 New York Times article that details researchers who successfully put the jellyfish’s fluorescent protein gene into a single-celled human embryo. That test-tube embryo was described as nonviable, which scientists said would never have resulted in a baby. Kirby – who once used his agricultural economics degree to implant cattle embryos to breed stronger cows – isn’t so sure. His proposal would be proactive, to draw an ethical line in the sand for such research in Georgia. ""I’m not trying to hurt good, valid research that helps people, but I don’t think we should create life like this, just for research,"" Kirby said. ""I don’t think Georgians want what they did, creating a human-jellyfish hybrid, here."" So maybe the bill is not explicit in its language. But the driving force is a concern about mixing humans with what makes jellyfish illuminate. There is no evidence of any abuse of this technology. Federal guidelines, not to mention the reputation of research facilities, would quash even the idea for the most part. Of course, injecting a fluorescent gene to make a designer glowing baby could be done in theory. And to an ethicist, that is enough to warrant at least discussion, no matter how silly. ""Could someone who is crazy enough, with enough money, say ‘I want a glow-in-the-dark baby?’ Sure,"" said Kevin FitzGerald, a professor of oncology at Georgetown University and chair of the Catholic Healthcare Ethics. ""You or I would consider that crazy. But there are some who would claim it as a right to free expression. That’s why there is value in discussing how protective the state needs to be."" Those debates about human-critter hybrids are all fun and games, until a centaur loses an eye. Or until scientists and researchers push back on the speculation. Experts helped kill a previous version of Kirby’s bill, House Bill 481 in the 2013-2014 legislative session, with testimony that it would harm their ability to save lives. Those objections remain, especially given what is a fundamental misunderstanding about the role of jellyfish in medical and scientific research. Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2008 for their work in finding jellies’ green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and developing it for research. It’s now commonly used to track genetic changes as cells divide, giving researchers insight into ways to treat genetic diseases. Explained that way, injecting some jellyfish into cells doesn’t seem so wacky. But fears about the ""what if"" abuses have created a proposal that could stymie other legitimate research, said Dr. Mark A. Kay, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at Stanford University. For example, the bill would allow a human embryo to be created only through fertilization from a sperm and egg. Scientists, though, are able to and often create them for research purposes (not viability) by using a cellular nucleus –where the genes live. Kirby’s bill would put an end to that, and halt approaches being tested to develop human organs for transplants and other efforts. ""This is an example where you’re trying to make a law to stop something quite ridiculous and end up limiting the legitimate efforts to understand genetic developments that can save people,"" Kay said. If that’s not enough for Georgia to be embarrassed, there’s more. The proposed bill does not stop animal genes from being introduced to human embryos. Kay describes genes as the equivalent of a sentence buried in an encyclopedia. Cells, which Kirby’s bill bans, are the equivalent of the house where those volumes sit on the shelf. ""It does not explicitly state you can’t transfer a gene into a human chromosome, so it doesn’t even stop the ridiculous idea it claims is the threat,"" Kay said. Why? Because the GFP, which can be created synthetically or extracted from a jellyfish, is a gene that would still be permitted. And wouldn’t that set the stage for Perimeter road rage incidents where people look like the Hulk, not just act like him? If it seems we’re getting silly, it’s only because we are. The headline about glow-in-the-dark Georgians overstates the bill itself. But it captures the intent of the proposal -- to ban human embryos with non-human cells injected into them as well as any ""human-animal hybrid."" And, weirdly, it captures some of actual discussion happening under the Gold Dome.

The truth about ISIS using Nutella, kittens and Emoji to 'lure' western women
","Find a goofy still frame of television, and people will propel it across the Internet. CNN got a taste of this law of social media on Wednesday after airing a silly-looking graphic about a serious topic: the Islamic State’s recruitment of female fighters. The anchor’s set-up of the segment did little to help viewers take it seriously. ""ISIS is talking online about jars of Nutella, pictures of kittens and emojis,"" CNN Newsroom host Carol Costello said in the Feb. 18, 2015, segment. ""These three images are in part helping ISIS recruiters lure westerners into their fight because they want people to believe their life on the battlefield isn't so different than yours. They actually eat Nutella, and I guess they have pet kittens."" As she spoke, a highly sharable graphic depicting a jar of the chocolate hazelnut spread, two orange tabby kittens and a silly face from the emoji keyboard appeared with script (a chyron in TV talk) that said ""ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA"". Costello went on to interview Nimmi Gowrinathan, an academic who studies women in crisis and a visiting professor at the Colin Powell Center for Civic and Global Leadership at City College, New York. The words ""Nutella,"" ""kittens"" or ""emoji"" were not part of their discussion. Instead Gowrinathan talked about how the discussion of female Islamic State fighters (also called ISIS or ISIL) should focus on the larger political suppression that pushes women to join these kind of movements rather than looking at what may have triggered one woman’s turning point to extremism. But her more nuanced discussion wasn’t the takeaway. Instead the blogosphere ranks of Jezebel, New York Magazine’s Daily Intel, and, most angrily, Vox dinged CNN for suggesting women could be easily ""lured"" into ISIS with guilty, silly pleasures. As fact-checkers, we felt beckoned to sort out the confusion. Was CNN’s segment just plain weird or onto something? CNN did not return emails and calls for comment. We went to experts who track jihadist groups, including ISIS, on social media. ""The way that the CNN story was framed was kind of funny and eyeroll-inducing,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, ""but it’s largely correct."" The online prowess of the Islamic State is a well-documented strength of the movement. From videos to online forums to journals to various social media websites, supporters disseminate propaganda messages (90,000 a day) that are more slickly produced and reach wider audiences than efforts from other terrorist groups (think of al-Qaida home videos showing Osama bin Laden speaking into the camera with little other detail). ISIS even has plans for a 24-hour propaganda network, said Daniel Cohen, a research fellow and coordinator of the cyber security program at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies. The videos or posts are often translated into multiple languages so that demographic groups can be more effectively targeted around the world. Some of the imagery depicts a fulfilling life in a dream state ruled by sharia law, where kids are cheerful and ISIS recruits offer humanitarian aid in war zones. And yes, the group’s supporters also speak in emojis, tweet pictures of themselves unwinding with Nutella and run Twitter accounts like @ISILCats showing jihadists cuddling with kittens and kittens cuddling with firearms. It’s all part of an effort to speak the same cultural language as potential recruits so that they don’t think life with the Islamic State is all beheadings and burnings, Cohen said. ""Most of the people sharing this content on social media came from Western culture,"" Cohen said. It makes them seem relatable and charismatic, said Gartenstein-Ross, adding that it’s nothing new for ISIS. Richard Brennan, a Middle East expert at the RAND Institute, said the ISIS campaign ""is much more sophisticated"" than what was portrayed on CNN. ""It’s targeting the young men and women who want to be part of something greater than themselves to accept this movement for the validity that they believe the Koran is teaching,"" he said. Obviously, not all of the tweets, videos and images are cheery (the beheadings of prisoners, for instance). Other viral memes are designed to show how ""disgusting"" their enemies are by showing dead children’s bodies from bombs or airstrikes. The point is, the use of familiar western imagery in social media messages is just one tool in the Islamic State’s vast marketing toolbox, and the real motivations for someone joining the fight run much deeper. Those motivations are connected to the pursuit of identity and purpose. Some of the women recruited by ISIS act as internal police within their territories to make sure people are adhering to sharia law and stopping women who are not dressed appropriately, Cohen said. They also play a big role in online recruitment efforts. In an August article for Foreign Affairs, Gowrinathan criticized experts for being so perplexed by the formation of all-women brigades within ISIS. Women in war zones, she wrote, typically don’t have a role in the politics of their society and are drawn to extremism when they cannot air their grievances in the open. Still, some are coerced into joining and do so for their own safety. The audience for the communications with kittens and Nutella is a slim component of the majority of Sunni Islamic women who are joining ISIS from countries around the region out of oppression in their home state, she said in an interview with PunditFact. And even for the westerners, a life promising time with cute kitties and tasty sweets ""won’t ever be enough of an effective recruitment tool for any group."" ""The kittens and emoticon thing is most damaging because it denies women any political agency,"" she said. ""It infantilizes them in a way that you would assume they would be drawn to this for the most superficial reasons."" For the record, Gowrinathan said she wasn’t brought on CNN to talk nutella and cats, nor was she pleased with the attention CNN producers brought to the popular hazelnut spread, winky faces and baby cats. ""All I tried to point out is we dismiss women’s politics all the time,"" Gowrinathan said. Costello eventually deleted a tweet (which we captured below) promoting the segment with a video of the interview.  And Gowrinathan tweeted that she did not, for the record, believe ""emoticons are relevant in recruitment of #women to #isis."" Our ruling This fact-check is a case study of what can go wrong when a news channel sacrifices nuance for an eye-catching graphic. On CNN, that graphic said, ""ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA."" There wasn’t much more to Costello’s introduction of the segment, but she did reference images of nutella, kittens and emojis that are used ""in part"" to recruit westerners. Costello’s words are technically accurate, but CNN’s click-baity graphic is incomplete and misleading. In reality, ISIS is using a vast array of tactics to persuade people to give up their lives for their fight. No expert would say that someone would join ISIS for the reasons isolated on CNN. To boil down ISIS’ recruitment strategy of women to nutella, emojis and kittens is a vast oversimplification that borders on the absurd. There is a shred of truth to this claim but not much beyond that. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/19/cnn/truth-about-isis-using-nutella-kittens-and-emoji-l/

Joe Biden and his Somali cab driver friends
","In the latest of a series of perceived gaffes that have punctuated his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden set eyerolls rolling when he said he had an extensive friendship with the Somali community in his hometown of Wilmington, Del. At a White House summit on violent extremism on Feb. 17, 2015, Biden said, ""Somalis have made my city of Wilmington, Del. (their home) on a smaller scale. There is a very identifiable Somali community. I might add if you come to the train station with me you’ll notice I have great relationships with them because there’s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real. I’m not being solicitous. I’m being serious."" In short order, CNN interviewed some Wilmington cab drivers who said they know of drivers from some African countries such as Ghana and Liberia, but none from Somalia. ""I don't think I've seen any (Somalis) in Delaware,"" Anthony Eber, a taxi company owner who emigrated from Sierra Leone, told CNN. Did Biden know something no one else seems to know? Apparently not. The Census Bureau’s latest American Community Survey did find some Delaware residents with Somali ancestry -- it estimated that there were a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware. That’s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state’s population. If that’s ""very identifiable,"" it would help to have a microscope. Compare that with Minnesota, which has the United States’ largest Somali population, at more than 35,000. Meanwhile, Biden’s home-away-from-home, the Washington, D.C., metro area, ranks in the top five for Somali populations. Refugees from the east African country started coming to the United States en masse in the 1990s, after a civil war broke out. Today, al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida affiliate Islamic terrorist group, is a major source of instability in Somalia and a reason why refugees continue to flee to the United States. All told, roughly 90,000 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States since 2000, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. However, Delaware has not received any of them, according data from the same office. Jewish Family Services of Delaware is the state’s largest refugee resettlement organization. On their website, there’s a list of nearly 40 countries from which refugees have been resettled. About half of those are African countries, but Somalia is not one of them. Wilmington is part of the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, which has one of the higher rates of foreign-born residents from Africa, according to the American Community Survey. But even in this expanded geographical area, the vast majority are from African countries other than Somalia. Of Delaware’s foreign-born population, only 9.5 percent are from the African continent -- about 8,000 people in all -- and most of those are from West Africa, according to the survey report. And of those 8,000, just 4 percent work in ""transportation and warehousing, and utilities,"" the category that includes taxi drivers. Biden’s office did not respond to a query. His office also didn’t reply by publication time to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker, which gave Biden their worst rating -- Four Pinocchios -- for this claim.

Does the Islamic State post 90,000 social media messages each day?
","The Islamic State group, or ISIS, has fused two things that until now were separated by centuries  -- medieval brutality and the hyperactive use of social media. And while tweeted images of beheadings and immolations draw the biggest headlines, the pro-ISIS propaganda stream is much broader, full of visions of a resurgent Islam seeking soldiers in its cause. Former National Security Council staffer Hillary Mann Leverett focused on this part of the ISIS recruiting machine during a Feb. 17, 2015, interview on CNN’s New Day. Leverett said American military operations since the Iraq War have given ISIS plenty of material to exploit. ""This is what the Islamic State, and al-Qaida before it, has been able to use in their rhetoric,"" Leverett said. ""There are 90,000 social messages a day. All they have to do is put real footage of what the United States has done in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya."" The huge use of social media by ISIS is not in question. We were curious though about the source of the 90,000 figure. That seems like a lot of tweets and Facebook posts for a single organization to crank out. Leverett pointed to us a New York Times article about the expansion of the State Department’s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications to thwart the Islamic State message machine. ""With the Islamic State and its supporters producing as many as 90,000 tweets and other social media responses every day, American officials acknowledge they have a tough job ahead to blunt the group’s digital momentum,"" the reporters wrote. That doesn’t exactly say where the number originated, but other news organizations certainly have repeated the stat in the past few days. The earliest use we could find was in a report from the British House of Commons Defence Committee on Feb. 5, 2015. In a section focused on the threat of ISIS in Iraq, the report said, ""They have proved themselves adept in the use of social media, sending 90,000 messages a day."" (We asked the Defence Committee where it got that number, but Parliament is in recess and key staff are on vacation. We will update this item if we hear from them.) Independently, we discovered two separate research groups that track the social media activity of the Islamic State. J.M. Berger is a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution who recently testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives about terrorists’ use of social media. With funding from Google, Berger and his technologist colleague Jonathon Morgan set up a system to capture the scope of pro-ISIS messaging. They found that in the fall of 2014, there were at least 45,000 Twitter accounts used by ISIS supporters. With that as a starting point, Berger told PunditFact that 90,000 messages a day is likely a conservative number. ""My best estimate is something over 200,000 a day, including retweets, but that comes with a lot of caveats,"" Berger said. Berger said the figure includes supporters as well as actual members of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ""It is not entirely possible to break down members vs. fanboys and the bulk of accounts don't visibly differentiate,"" Berger said. ""But a plurality of the accounts we examined for the study appeared to be based in Iraq and Syria."" Berger offered two other cautionary notes: • The numbers are driven by a small number of high over-performers, probably fewer than 2,000 accounts that often tweet in bursts of 50 or more tweets per day as part of a deliberate strategy. • There are also deceptive techniques such as the use of bots and purchased retweets to inflate these numbers. Berger said his analysis took steps to eliminate as much of this noise as possible but very probably didn't get it all. Voices from the Blogs, a research service based in Milan, Italy, tracks tweets written in Arabic. This is  a subset of the total number of tweets related to the Islamic State, since tweets are sent in many different languages. One of the lead researchers is Luigi Curini, an associate professor of political science at the University of Milan. Curini told PunditFact that while he and his colleagues Stefano Iacus and Andrea Ceron saw between 100,000 and 150,000 Arabic language tweets each day from October to January, many were judged to take no clear stance on ISIS and of the remainder, only about 20 to 25 percent favored the extremist group. After taking those factors into account, the high-end estimate of pro-ISIS Arabic language tweets averaged about 38,000 per day. Daily events will shape the Twitter traffic. Curini was struck by the impact of the murders of the Charlie Hebdo journalists. ""The sentiment pro-ISIS actually decreased soon after the Paris attack, especially in the European community writing in Arabic language,"" Curini said. ""But this drop lasted just a few days."" Still, right after the violence in Paris, two media groups with ties to ISIS, Al-Battar and Al-Ghuraba, launched a campaign to inspire copycat killings. According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, a private media surveillance firm, they fired off tweets and circulated images like these for others to share.  Berger’s analysis included all languages and, like Curini’s work, tallied only the pro-ISIS messages. The efforts of both groups show a high volume of tweeting, although some significant fraction of that comes from fans of ISIS, rather than the group itself. Nevertheless, regardless of the source, whether insider, fan, or computer-generated, Berger said these messages reach a shared audience for whom the source might be irrelevant. This makes targeting a counter message very difficult. Our ruling Leverett said the Islamic State group sends out 90,000 social media messages each day. While the exact source of that figure is a bit unclear, one independent researcher has data that point to much a higher number. There could be as many as 200,000 pro-ISIS tweets a day. That includes re-tweets and some generated by computer programs. A lower figure from an Italian-based group looked only at Arabic language tweets. However, while it is difficult to know for sure, a large share of these messages come from outside the ISIS organization itself. To that extent, the data undercut the idea that the Islamic State group dictates the precise propaganda message in all of the social media posts. With that caveat in mind, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/19/hillary-mann-leverett/cnn-expert-islamic-state-posts-90000-social-media-/

Republican lawmaker claims Congress has never set limits on a commander-in-chief
","Months after the Islamic State emerged as a threat in the Middle East, President Barack Obama has asked Congress for authorization to use military force against the radical Islamist group. An administration proposal now before Congress would limit the use of force to three years. The legislation also says it is not authorizing the use of ""armed forces in enduring offensive ground operations."" In something of an odd-bedfellows pairing, some hawkish Republicans prefer giving the president even wider leeway to go after the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS or ISIL. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is among those who say Congress should ease restrictions from the proposal, known as an authorization for the use of military force. ""This would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief,"" Kinzinger said on the Feb. 15, 2015, edition of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. ""We don't own his limited strategy. The president has to make that decision, which is why I think he needs the broad power to do what the commander-in-chief does."" Republicans wanting to give Obama more power? That caught us by surprise. So we took a closer look at Kinzinger’s statement. Congress, the presidency and war: A brief history Military historians we spoke with took umbrage with Kinzinger’s statement, noting a longstanding tension between the legislative and the executive branches over military powers. In fact, the conflict goes back as far as the Founding Fathers. In the Constitution, Congress was granted the power to declare war and raise and maintain an army and a navy. At the same time, the president was deemed commander-in-chief. Those two roles have competed for centuries. The issue prompted a 1800 Supreme Court case, Bas vs. Tingy, in which the court distinguished between a declared war — a status that the court ruled grants sweeping powers to the president — and military action authorized by other legislative methods. Essentially, the decision said that ""in a declared war, the president's actions are unrestricted, except as restricted by the laws of war,"" said Anthony Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. By contrast, ""in a war declared by other statutory means, Congress can set limits."" The last time Congress declared war was World War II. Since then, military operations have been conducted through authorizations for the use of military force (and, in some instances, without congressional approval). Congress used those opportunities to impose limits on how the president could use force. For example, the 1983 resolution that provided authority for President Ronald Reagan to send American troops to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon set a time limit of 18 months. Then, in 1991, Congress authorized the use military force to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But the agreement stipulated that President George H.W. Bush first had to show congressional leaders that he had used ""all appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with the United Nations Security Council."" And congressional intervention into the president’s powers as commander-in-chief doesn’t begin or end with authorizations. Other types of legislation have played a role as well. In the 1930s, the Neutrality Acts limited President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ability to aid allied nations fighting in World War II. In 1973, Congress passed a law to block any future military operations Southeast Asia unless Congress approved them, essentially ending the United States’ engagement in the Vietnam War. Later, Congress rebuked President Gerald Ford’s request for military aid to Vietnam. The most significant and lasting Vietnam-era congressional response came in 1973, when Congress overrode President Richard Nixon’s veto of the War Powers Resolution. The act required presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending troops into harm's way and mandated authorization from Congress if military force is to be used beyond 60 days. The Supreme Court has never weighed in on the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, but every president since it passed ""has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by Congress on the president’s authority as commander in chief,"" the Congressional Research Service has written. Despite this, presidents have tended to abide by key aspects of the law for pragmatic reasons, hoping to appease Congress and present a united front before utilizing military force. Finally, Congress can use (and has used) the power of the purse to restrict the president’s use of military force. For example, in 1993, Congress prohibited funding for a continuous presence of U.S. forces in Somalia. Kinzinger’s response When we took this to Kinzinger’s office, spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood said the congressman ""was talking in the context of fighting terrorism and radical jihadism. In the current war, Congress has never taken a position to limit the president’s ability to fight terrorism, so to do so in his fight against ISIS would be a change in policy."" The far more general nature of the statement suggests to us that this is an after-the-fact reinterpretation of his words. But even if we take it at face value, it’s not clear to us that Kinzinger is accurate. He has a point that the 2001 joint resolution that authorized the use of force against al-Qaida was quite broad. In fact, it didn’t even name al-Qaida as the target, but rather gave the president the power to use force against ""nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons."" That’s pretty open-ended. Still, even that resolution restricted the efforts to terrorist groups or countries directly or tangentially involved in the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks. This limitation has at least forced debates on whether Obama needs authorization to continue military action in Syria against the Islamic State. ""It is a bit of a stretch to say (the 2001 authorization) covered ISIS, but you could make a case for that,"" said Richard Stoll, an expert on international conflict at Rice University. ""It is better if we’re going to use military force to say, ‘I, as president, may have the power to do this, but it is better if Congress approves it, because it tells the world we stand together.’ "" And it is not as though Congress has been absent from the debate on anti-terrorism strategy. For example, President George W. Bush in 2006 signed legislation passed by Congress to outlaw use of torture against terrorism suspects who were sent to Guantanamo Bay. ""A lot of the action, when you think about congressional checks on war powers, happens behind closed doors,"" said William Howell, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago and author of While Dangers Gather: Congressional Checks on Presidential War Powers. ""There are things Obama and Bush might very well like to do that neither of them followed up on, assuming Congress would intervene and make life difficult for them. When you think about Congress as a player on debates on war, it’s not just resolutions and legislation; a lot of this stuff is anticipatory."" Our ruling Kinzinger said that the authorization for use of military force now pending in Congress would represent ""the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief."" A plain reading of that statement finds it problematic. Time and time again, Congress has intervened to rein in presidents from taking certain types of actions or continuing combat longer than lawmakers want. To do this, Congress simply has to use the power it is granted in the Constitution, authority that has been affirmed and reaffirmed by courts for centuries. Even the narrower interpretation of the statement that Kinzinger’s office stands by — that it only refers to the war on terrorism  — doesn’t hold up. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/19/adam-kinzinger/republican-lawmaker-claims-congress-has-never-set-/

Rubio falsely claims that ISIS is the 'predominant' group in Benghazi
","Sen. Marco Rubio hasn’t declared himself a presidential candidate yet, but that didn’t stop him from visiting Iowa a little early. Rubio, R-Fla., fashioned himself as a foreign policy wonk during a Feb. 13, 2015, radio appearance, discussing at length the extremist group Islamic State’s goals and strength across Africa and Asia. He then invoked the name of a city many Americans likely would remember. ""ISIS has now set up a very significant hub in Libya,"" Rubio said. ""They are now the predominant Islamist group in Benghazi."" Two days after Rubio’s remarks, ISIS released a video showing black-clad extremists beheading 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt on a Libyan beach. Egypt responded to the executions by bombing the coastal city of Derna, considered an ISIS stronghold. Rubio’s comments highlighted the state of disarray in Libya, but we wondered if he was right in saying Islamic State militants were the major force in Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city. First, we need a brief lesson in recent history. The Libyan crisis Libya has largely been in chaos since revolutionaries -- with NATO help -- deposed and killed dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011. An interim, Islamist-filled government was elected to help Libya make the transition to a democracy, but refused to give up power after its term was up. Gen. Khalifa Haftar (at right), who served in the army during the Gaddafi regime and fought against the dictator during the 2011 coup, was instrumental in replacing the interim government so a new parliament could be elected in 2014. Control of the country is now split between an Islamist government based in Tripoli in the west and an internationally recognized government led by Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani in Tobruk in the east. Haftar now commands forces fighting Islamist extremists to support the Tobruk government. The country is dotted with militias, clans and terror groups, many of whom fight among each other for territory and almost indiscernible goals. ISIS became one of these groups in 2014, taking control of the eastern city of Derna with fighters from Syria and Iraq and uniting other militant Islamic factions under their banner. The port of Benghazi is to the west of Derna (shown on the map below as Darnah) along the Mediterranean Sea.  So who is in charge in Benghazi? As for Rubio’s specific claim, ISIS isn’t the predominate ""Islamist group in Benghazi,"" experts told us. That distinction would go to a terror group known as Ansar al-Sharia, or the Partisans of Islamic Law. Most Americans would know them as the group considered responsible for the Sept. 12, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed two diplomats and two former Navy SEALs working as security personnel (a charge they have denied in the past). Relatively small factions across the the region, in places like Tunisia and Yemen, all use the name Ansar al-Sharia, although their aims and origins may differ. Ansar al-Sharia Libya has a significant presence in Derna, as well, although that group is not exactly the same as the one in Benghazi, where the picture gets a little murkier. Several reports (including one from the United Nations) have said Ansar al-Sharia Derna pledged allegiance to ISIS in October 2014, but it seems Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi leadership has not endorsed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Anonymous jihadists groups are the Libyans who have pledged loyalty to ISIS. Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute and creator of Jihadology.net, told PolitiFact Florida that Ansar al-Sharia members have defected to ISIS, but they are not allies. It’s Ansar al-Sharia that is most visible in Benghazi and not ISIS, Zelin said. Other experts we talked to agreed, though they noted Ansar al-Sharia may be in decline in the city. UCLA history professor James Gelvin said Ansar al-Sharia do share a goal with ISIS -- imposing Sharia law where it is possible. Rubio may have been trying to use Benghazi as a buzzword people would recognize, but he is not correct to say ISIS is ""the predominant Islamist group"" there. While ISIS has a presence in many cities, they only truly have a foothold in Derna, Gelvin said. ""I think what Rubio is doing is conflating Ansar al-Sharia with Islamic State,"" Gelvin said. ""They (Ansar al-Sharia) have not been absorbed. … They still maintain their integrity as a group."" We reached out to Rubio’s office but didn’t hear back. For the record, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that either Ansar al-Sharia or ISIS is in charge in Benghazi; Haftar’s forces have been retaking large portions of the city, including the airport and a military installation. As of this writing, the city is still contested, but analysts see Ansar al-Sharia’s clout diminishing. So if neither government, Haftar’s army or any militant group run Benghazi, who controls the city? ""No one does,"" Gelvin said. Our ruling Rubio said ISIS is ""now the predominant Islamist group in Benghazi."" While there are myriad militias, radical militants, armed groups and even multiple governments in Libya, Islamic State’s footprint is still relatively small. Besides some activity in pockets across the country, the group holds sway in Derna, but not so much in Benghazi, experts say. There, the Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia has been most visible among radicalized factions. Some reports say the group has formed an alliance with ISIS, but researchers dispute that, though some Ansar al-Sharia members almost certainly have defected. Experts also say the situation is fluid, which provides Rubio some additional, albeit small, amount of cover. His statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/19/marco-rubio/isis-holds-sway-benghazi-rubio-says/
