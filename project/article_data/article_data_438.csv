No, the Vatican doesn’t own a telescope called Lucifer
","An old rumor about the Vatican and the devil has resurfaced on social media. Shared by a Facebook page called ""Exposing the elite agenda,"" a post that displays images of snakes and statues claims that the Vatican insidiously has a telescope named ""Lucifer."" ""The Vatican owns a telescope called L.U.C.I.F.E.R. But that’s none of your business,"" the Nov. 21 post said.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is wrong. The Vatican, which has its own observatory, does not have a telescope called ""Lucifer.""  The Vatican Observatory has a research center at the University of Arizona’s Steward Observatory, where it shares space with other organizations and groups. One of those groups installed a telescope there and nicknamed an instrument that attached to it ""Lucifer.""  The Vatican Observatory was founded in 1891 and is based at the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, outside Rome. We reached out to the observatory but didn’t immediately hear back. The institution’s dependent research center, the Vatican Observatory Research Group, is hosted by the University of Arizona. The group operates the Alice P. Lennon Telescope with its Thomas J. Bannan Astrophysics Facility, known together as the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, located at the Mount Graham International Observatory in southeastern Arizona, according to the organization’s website. Since 2002, the Mount Graham facility has also housed the Large Binocular Telescope, one of the largest optical telescopes in the world, which is owned and operated by several institutions in the U.S. and around the world. The Vatican Observatory is not one of them. Astronomers mount various instruments on telescopes for research, and the name of the one designed for the Large Binocular Telescope was a mouthful: ""Large Binocular Telescope Near-infrared Spectroscopic Utility with Camera and Integral Field Unit for Extragalactic Research."" Scientists often come up with catchy or silly names for telescopes and other equipment and were reaching to find an acronym for the instrument. Somewhere in that unwieldy name, they found the initials L.U.C.I.F.E.R. But the nickname didn’t last. After people noticed that the instrument was on a site shared with the Vatican’s telescope, and began falsely linking it to the Vatican, it was renamed ""LUCI"" in 2012. Facebook posts are recirculating an old rumor that the Vatican owns a telescope called ""Lucifer."" The Vatican has an observatory with an outpost in Arizona. But it doesn’t own or operate any telescope or instrument named Lucifer. That nickname was briefly given to a piece of equipment that attached to a telescope at the same observatory site that’s owned and operated by several institutions. The Vatican Observatory is not one of them. We rate this False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9AC300>],/factchecks/2021/nov/22/facebook-posts/no-vatican-doesnt-own-telescope-called-lucifer/

No, President Biden won’t slap a 95% tax on prescription drugs
","A viral Facebook post claimed that President Joe Biden will impose a 95% tax on prescription drugs as a way to lower health care costs in the United States. The post was made in late October and features an image of Biden with $100 bills floating in the background. ""Say no to Biden's 95% tax on your prescriptions,"" the image reads. A caption with the post goes on to claim that ""only in Washington can you promise to 'control healthcare costs' by slapping a 95% tax on prescription drugs."" The account behind the post, the Center for a Free Economy, describes itself as a conservative nonprofit organization that advances ""the cause of free market public policy reforms."" We reached out to the organization about its Facebook post but did not immediately hear back.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden’s plan to lower health costs does not include a 95% tax on prescription drugs. It includes an excise tax on drug companies — not consumers — if they don’t sell drugs at prices that have been negotiated with Medicare. Health care was one of Biden’s major platforms during the 2020 presidential election where he promised to lower the overall cost of health care in the country. Biden pledged to lower the cost of prescription drugs by as much as 60% during a Nov. 2, 2020, campaign speech. Biden then laid out how he’d lower the cost of prescription drugs through the Build Back Better agenda — by allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies on pricing. Negotiations would apply to drugs seniors receive through Medicare Part D and drugs administered in a doctor’s office through Medicare Part B, according to a White House statement. Biden said this would also lead to lower drug prices for people with private health insurance, not just for Medicare beneficiaries. His plan would require drug companies to sell their products to people on employer-based plans at the same prices as they sell it to someone on Medicare or face a financial penalty. ""It means drug companies would have to sell their drugs to all distributors at the Medicare price or face up to a 95% excise tax,"" the president said in August. The tax would be levied directly on a company’s drug sales, not consumers. The Build Back Better bill was passed in the House on Nov. 19, with the ability for Medicare to negotiate drug prices intact, and is awaiting approval by the Senate. A Facebook post claims Biden would lower health care costs by implementing a 95% tax on prescription drugs. Biden has proposed a plan that would allow Medicare to negotiate the price of certain prescription medications with drug companies, which he said would lead to lower drug prices for both Medicare beneficiaries and people on private insurance. If drug companies do not negotiate with Medicare, they could face up to a 95% excise tax, according to his proposal. Prescription drugs would not be taxed. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC952E80>],/factchecks/2021/nov/22/facebook-posts/no-president-biden-wont-slap-95-tax-prescription-d/

Tweet claiming Hinson and Miller-Meeks denied Iowans broadband needs context
","The day the Infrastructure Investment Act spending bill was passed in the U.S. House, former U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, posted a tweet saying Republican Reps. Ashley Hinson and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, both of Iowa, denied rural Iowans broadband by voting no on the bill: ""The NO votes cast by Hinson and Miller-Meeks on the infrastructure bill (13 Republicans voted yes) is a powerful reason to replace them in ‘22. Denying rural Iowans broadband alone shows how terribly partisan these two are."" In an interview with The Daily Iowan on Nov. 19, Loebsack said he brought up broadband specifically as much of the money funding broadband in the bill will come from the Energy and Commerce Committee on which he served while in the House.  ""I didn’t stay long enough, obviously, to see the fruits of my own labor. But I have some personal interest in this but it’s also incredibly important for Iowans,"" Loebsack said.  But did voting no, along with Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, on the infrastructure mean Hinson and Miller-Meeks wanted to deny Iowans broadband, as the comment implies? The answer requires context and explanation. Of the $1.2 trillion defined in the bill, Hinson said in a statement, she supports the $650 billion of existing spending that would be reauthorized. If it was this spending alone, she said Iowans an herself would support the bill. Hinson does not support the $550 billion in new spending and said that this bill adds too much additional spending for items aside from the physical infrastructure Iowans care most about, without fully paying for them. ""That’s not how you get things done for the American people. You do not create a legislative ultimatum by tossing trillions of hardworking Americans’ money up in the air like Monopoly money. That’s Washington gamesmanship at its absolute worst and the very definition of chaos and dysfunction that Iowans sent me here to fight against,"" Hinson said in the statement. Of the entire $1.2 trillion package, $100 million will be allocated to each state for broadband. According to The New York Times, the bill is being paid for by repurposing jobless benefit money and using untouched small business loan funds and other pandemic relief funds. In a press release following the vote, Miller-Meeks said she has been calling for a fully funded bipartisan bill that would improve bridges, roads, broadband, locks, dams and the electric grid. She listed broadband as a priority twice in her press release, despite her eventual vote.  Miller-Meeks said in the press release that she did not support the Infrastructure bill because it was tied to the Build Back Better Act, which she said had no Republican input. The House took separate votes on the two measures, passing the infrastructure bill on Nov. 8 and the social spending package on Nov. 19 Loebsack said the reasons Miller-Meek and Hinson gave for voting no did not make sense to him. He said voting against the bill meant opposing all aspects of it. He said he singled out Miller-Meeks and Hinson, rather than Feenstra, because they are the representatives from the areas he is most familiar with in Iowa.  ""That was a standalone vote. There were 13 Republicans who voted for that bill who had the courage to vote for that bill. But Miller-Meeks and Hinson are not among those 13 Republicans. And that’s what’s unfortunate,"" Loebsack said.  Miller-Meeks, who succeeded Loebsack in Iowa’s Second Congressional District seat in January, had said she supported the original Infrastructure spending bill that the Senate passed in October.  ""We could have passed a clean infrastructure package already on a bipartisan basis like the Senate did and found reasonable ways to pay for it. Instead, the majority decided to play politics and hold good ideas hostage to push through their agenda in a partisan manner,"" Miller-Meeks said in her press release.  Broadband was only one aspect of the Senate and House-approved infrastructure bill. Also included were funds for roads, bridges, water, public transportation, airports, cyber security and tackling climate change.  Added context comes from 2019 when Hinson and Miller-Meeks were in the Iowa Legislature — Hinson in the House and Miller-Meeks in the Senate. Hinson and Miller-Meeks voted yes on a nonpartisan Empower Rural Iowa Act, which Feenstra managed as a state senator at that time, that created incentives for broadband providers in Iowa to improve service and developed a fund to administer broadband grants for service providers who bring broadband to rural areas.  Empower Rural Iowa was an initiative through the Iowa Economic Development Authority to invest in rural towns in the state.  Dave Loebsack wrote on his existing Twitter account that Hinson and Miller-Meeks denied rural Iowans broadband by voting no on the infrastructure bill. That happened in this instance. And, while Miller-Meeks said she supported the original Senate-passed infrastructure bill, she still cast her no vote on the bill before her. But both congresswomen voted when members of the Iowa House in 2019 in favor of an Iowa bill to increase rural broadband funding. With more than just broadband in the infrastructure package, and given Miller-Meeks’ and Hinson’s previous records in the Iowa Legislature supporting rural broadband funding, we rate this statement to be Half True. CORRECTION, Nov. 22, 2021: An earlier version of this fact-check said that comments from Hinson expressed her opinions on the infrastructure bill. But Hinson’s campaign said her comments were about on a motion to add Build Back Better to the consideration. We have corrected the fact-check to reflect her views.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB69C40>],/factchecks/2021/nov/22/dave-loebsack/tweet-claiming-hinson-and-miller-meeks-denied-iowa/

No, the FBI isn’t adding ‘threat tags’ for parents who protest school boards
","At the end of September, the National School Boards Association requested federal assistance to address concerns about the safety of public school employees and school board members.  U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI to work with state and local officials to address threats. But Garland’s Oct. 4 memo caused a stir — and misinformation linked to the memo continues to spread.  ""House Republicans have obtained whistleblower documents showing that the FBI is using its counterterrorism division to investigate and add ‘threat tags’ to parents who are protesting school boards,"" reads a Nov. 16 post on Facebook.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Did the FBI create a ""threat tag"" to use on parents who protest school boards? Here’s what we know.  Misinformation about Garland’s memo popped up quickly, with some parents claiming they were being unfairly targeted for voicing their opinion. (PolitiFact debunked one claim that parents who ""challenge school curriculums"" were being labeled ""domestic terrorists,"" for example.) By late October, backlash to the National School Boards Association’s initial letter prompted the organization to backtrack.   ""We regret and apologize for the letter,"" it said in a statement. The organization reiterated its commitment to ensuring school officials’ and students’ safety, but said that ""there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter."" It did not specify what language it was referencing. The saga didn’t end there. On Nov. 16, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, made public a letter he addressed to Garland. In it, Jordan said he was in possession of ""a protected disclosure from a (Justice) Department whistleblower."" He said the information obtained showed that ""the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division is compiling and categorizing threat assessments related to parents.""  With the letter, Jordan also released a copy of an email with the subject line, ""Guidance: Threat to violence against School Administrators.""  ""The Counterterrorism and Criminal Divisions created a threat tag, EDUOFFICIALS, to track instances of related threats,"" reads the email. ""We ask that your offices apply the threat tag to investigations and assessments of threats specifically directed against school board administrators, board members, teachers and staff."" There is no evidence to suggest that FBI personnel were instructed to use the EDUOFFICIALS threat tag on investigations of any parents for simply protesting against a school board.  In an email to PolitiFact, an FBI spokesperson said the agency is concerned with protecting First Amendment rights to peaceful protest and free speech. ""The FBI has never been in the business of investigating parents who speak out or policing speech at school board meetings, and we are not going to start now,"" the FBI said in a statement. ""The FBI’s focus is on violence and threats of violence that potentially violate federal law."" The statement also said that the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division and the Counterterrorism Division ""share responsibility for violent threats,"" but noted that ""before either division can open an investigation there must be information indicating the potential use of force or violence and a potential violation of federal law."" The FBI also said that it uses tags as a tool to track information. ""The creation of a threat tag in no way changes the long-standing requirements for opening an investigation, nor does it represent a shift in how the FBI prioritizes threats,"" the statement said. ""The FBI has used tags to track everything from drug trafficking to human trafficking."" A Facebook post claimed that ""the FBI is using its counterterrorism division to investigate and add ‘threat tags’ to parents who are protesting school boards.""  Following guidance from the attorney general, the FBI created a threat tag to track threats of violence directed at school officials. When releasing information about the threat tag, Jordan said it was evidence of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division compiling ""​​threat assessments related to parents."" But the FBI memo he released to support the claim only showed that the FBI has asked its offices to apply the tag to investigations involving threats against school board members, educators and school employees. There is no evidence it would be used on parents for simply protesting school board decisions.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB7F400>],/factchecks/2021/nov/19/facebook-posts/no-fbi-isnt-adding-threat-tags-parents-who-protest/

Kevin McCarthy misleads about Build Back Better legislation and IRS audits
","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy attacked the Build Back Better legislation in an overnight speech that included a critique of efforts to use the IRS to catch tax cheats. McCarthy spoke for more than eight hours prior to the bill’s final Nov. 19 vote. The version that passed the House, which may be changed in the Senate, would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years on clean energy initiatives, child care subsidies, extended child tax credits, paid family leave and hearing aids for Medicare beneficiaries. It would be partially paid for through additional taxes primarily aimed at wealthy taxpayers. ""If I sound angry, I am,"" McCarthy said. One thing he was angry about is what he says the legislation will mean for IRS audits. ""If you or your family spends $28 a day — prepare to be under constant audit by the IRS,"" said McCarthy, of California. He also said that the IRS will ""spy"" on these Americans, a claim he has made before. We found that the bill does not include the provisions McCarthy warned Americans about. The Treasury Department has put out a proposal aimed at wealthy tax evaders, but even if it were adopted, it wouldn’t have nearly as broad a reach as McCarthy said. The bill includes about $79 billion over a decade for the IRS to strengthen tax enforcement and expand audits. The legislation states that ""no use of these funds is intended to increase taxes on any taxpayer with taxable income below $400,000."" Michael Kaercher, a senior attorney advisor at the Tax Law Center at NYU Law, pointed to that language in the bill as well as other administration documents showing that the goal of the administration is to target the rich.  The Treasury Department wrote in May that Biden’s ""compliance proposals are designed to ameliorate existing inequities by focusing on high-end evasion. Audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for those with less than $400,000 in actual income."" ""This funding will likely increase audit rates, but those increases will be directed to large corporations and high-income filers,"" Kaercher said.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that adding IRS staff would put audit rates back to where they were 10 years ago. Compared with the low rates today, ""the rate would rise for all taxpayers, but higher-income taxpayers would face the largest increase,"" the CBO said. The overall examination rate for individuals in fiscal year 2019 was 0.4%, a drop from 1.1% in 2010, according to a January 2021 report from the Congressional Research Service. The examination rate for individuals with $1 million or more in income fell from 8.4% in 2010 to 2.4% in 2019. CRS found that a hiring freeze from 2011 to 2018 kept the IRS from bringing in new employees, and 45% of current employees are eligible for retirement over the next two years. The Treasury Department said that the ""tax gap"" — the difference between taxes that are owed and collected — totals around $600 billion annually. In October, McCarthy’s office criticized the administration’s plan to spot money that goes unreported to the IRS. The approach hinged on new monitoring of bank accounts. The Treasury Department said that banks would need to report the total amount deposited and the total amount withdrawn from any given account in the course of a year. The threshold for reporting would be $10,000. ""When you break down the $10,000 reporting threshold, all it means is that if you, on average, spend about $200/week, or to break it down even further, $28/day, President Biden and Democrats think that they deserve to snoop into your checking account,"" McCarthy said Oct. 23. The first issue with McCarthy’s claim is that the proposal he objects to is not in the bill. Erin Hatch, spokesperson for the House Ways and Means Committee told us, ""the bank reporting proposal was never a part of the House’s Build Back Better legislation, so it certainly wasn’t in the version that passed this morning."" Plus, Hatch said that new reporting requirements need to be passed by law. If the House didn’t include them in the Build Back Better bill, the IRS wouldn’t have the leeway to implement them on its own later on. To be sure, McCarthy was responding to an actual plan put out by the Treasury Department. The House vote didn’t advance it, but it does exist as a concept. Still, McCarthy’s claim is wrong. He said everyone who spends over $28 a day would be under ""constant audit by the IRS."" Casey Schwab, professor of accounting at the University of North Texas, noted that there's a big difference between monitoring by the IRS and being audited. ""Most people think of an audit as hearing from the IRS, maybe getting a letter saying they owe money, or being told to come in for a meeting,"" Schwab said. ""Information being reported to the IRS doesn’t imply that you will be audited."" As a practical matter, Schwab said, audits are labor intensive and it would take more than simply spending $28 a day to trigger one. The Congressional Budget Office said that an audit of ""medium complexity"" takes about two years. Under any scenario, the agency has to be selective. McCarthy’s statement also skips over the people the IRS would screen out. The Treasury Department said that in order to focus on income that might go unreported, it would filter out people whose income is reported through their employer, as well as recipients of government benefits. ""For American workers and retirees, the IRS already has information on wage and salary income and the federal benefits they receive,"" the department said Oct. 19. The Treasury Department press office told PolitiFact that a taxpayer would be flagged only if the outflow from an account was at least $10,000 more than the person’s income. So, in McCarthy’s terms, that would mean someone who spends $28 a day above what they earn in a day. And, they’d have to do that every day, not just the occasional splurge. Some people might do that, but it would not equal everyone who spends $28 a day. That said, about 27 million independent contractors and self-employed workers wouldn’t be covered under this approach. McCarthy said, ""If you or your family spends $28 a day — prepare to be under constant audit by the IRS.""  What McCarthy is suggesting isn’t in Build Back Better. McCarthy is criticizing a different proposal, but he leaves out many key details. Such a plan would require new legislation to move forward. MCarthy’s claim ignores that the proposal aims to filter out people who get paid through an employer, or through a government program like Social Security. He treats audits as if they were the same as monitoring by the IRS, and they are different.  The claim is not accurate. We rate it False.

Old photos of ‘bricks’ resurface in days leading up to Kyle Rittenhouse trial verdict
","As the jurors in Kyle Rittenhouse’s closely watched trial deliberated over a verdict, social media users circulated a compilation of old, out-of-context photos that they claimed showed piles and pallets of bricks placed near the courthouse in Kenosha, Wis. Similar rumors featuring some of the same photos appeared online following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, as social media users alleged that left-wing groups had strategically stashed stacks of bricks in cities like Dallas, San Francisco, Kansas City, Denver and Detroit in preparation for violent protests. ""Bricks in Kenosha? Again?"" said the headline on one Nov. 17 blog post on Substack, which spread widely on Facebook and featured the misleading compilation of brick photos. ""A Kenosha officer checked a local alleyway and verified there are ‘bricks everywhere,’"" said another Facebook post shared the same day. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Rittenhouse, 18, faced five criminal charges related to his fatal shooting of two unarmed men and shooting of a third, armed man, during an August 2020 protest in Kenosha. He was found not guilty on all charges on the jury’s fourth day of deliberations.  But the viral image compilation shared across Facebook, Twitter and other platforms showed only photos and video screen grabs from cities other than Kenosha. The photos and videos were not snapped during the Rittenhouse trial, but were instead taken in 2020, as racial justice protests flared across the nation following Floyd’s murder. And they showed brick piles that were linked to nearby construction, rather than planned violence.  ""The report of bricks being dropped off in our community is fake news,"" said Sgt. David Wright, public information officer for the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department, in an email to PolitiFact on Nov. 19. ""We have not found anything of the sort here in Kenosha."" The Kenosha Police Department did not respond to a phone call, but the department tweeted that it ""is aware of numerous attempts by malicious actors to spread disinformation on various social media platforms. To date, there is no credible threat to public safety."" From left to right and top to bottom, here's what the images in the compilation really show: The first and fourth images originally circulated in June 2020, reverse image searches show. NBC News traced the photos to a location near a construction site in Dallas, based in part on the Tom Thumb supermarket seen in the background of the photo. The second and sixth images came from a May 2020 video, BBC News reported at the time. The photos show bricks beside a cobblestone street that pavers were restoring in Fayetteville, N.C. BBC News found video showing the bricks there before Floyd’s death. The third image was circulating as early as May 2020, BuzzFeed News reported at the time. The photo shows bricks in Fort Myers, Fla., that were set up before any protests and were there temporarily to install a fiber optic cable, NBC2 News reported. The fifth image came from a May 2020 video uploaded to Instagram, BuzzFeed News reported. The photo shows bricks in Dallas. BuzzFeed News reported that government records and other evidence showed road work happening at the location. A screenshot of the video was included in a May 2020 blog post that PolitiFact rated Mostly False. The seventh image came from a May 2020 video showing protesters in New York City, BuzzFeed News reported. Citing Google Maps, Snopes reported that the area captured in the video was under construction as early as June 2019.

Dozens of prominent athletes did not die of heart attacks after COVID-19 vaccination
","A news article makes the case that dozens of prominent athletes had heart attacks and died following vaccination against COVID-19, and it cites a German news story as proof — even though the story did not say any such thing. The article appeared with the headline, ""German News Agency Tracks 75 Prominent Athletes Suddenly Dead Of Heart Attacks After COVID Vax."" It was shared on Facebook in a post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline and article in the post misrepresent the text of the German article that they claim to be based on. The German story did not report that all of the athletes had died, did not say they all had heart attacks and included the disclaimer that not all of the people included on the list became ill because of vaccination. Some of the athletes listed in the German news story are alive, and some were not vaccinated against COVID-19. And some who died had a history of heart problems or a family history of death by heart attack. COVID-19 vaccines have been associated with inflammation of the heart muscle, called myocarditis, with teenage boys and young men most likely to be affected. But the risk is very low, and most cases are mild with a quick recovery. Doctors say the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of myocarditis. The article in the Facebook post, from a site called Mic Drop Politics, gave a brief introduction mentioning 75 deaths, then presents a partial list of the people included in the German news story. The first person named, Italian soccer player Giuseppe Perrino, died of a heart attack June 2 while playing in a soccer game honoring his brother who had died of a heart attack while cycling in 2018. A headline on a news story about Perrino’s death reads, ""Heart attack kills Giuseppe Perrino like brother Rocco."" Stories about his death do not mention COVID-19 vaccination. The second person on the list, Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen, is alive. Eriksen collapsed June 12 during a soccer game after a cardiac arrest. Misinformation quickly circulated that Eriksen had received the COVID-19 vaccine a few weeks before his collapse, but the director of his professional team debunked the rumor. Eriksen had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, PolitiFact and other outlets reported. Speed skater Kjeld Nuis is listed third, and he is also alive. He experienced inflammation of the sac surrounding his heart in July following COVID-19 vaccination, but he ""recovered well"" and joined a training camp two weeks later, Netherland News Live reported. Farther down the list is French former soccer player Franck Berrier, who died of a heart attack in August while playing tennis — two years after retiring from soccer because of heart problems. Stories about his death do not mention any link to COVID-19 vaccination. Despite the headline identifying the athletes as ""prominent,"" the list includes a Belgian handball player and a 17-year-old high school student. A translation of the German news story says the list includes not only those who died after cardiac events, but also people who survived. The Mic Drop Politics article, however, does not make that distinction. The German news story also says it is ""not claiming that all of these people fell ill and died because of the vaccination."" A Facebook post included an article with the headline, ""German News Agency Tracks 75 Prominent Athletes Suddenly Dead Of Heart Attacks After COVID Vax."" The article cites a German news story that did not report that information. The athletes listed in the German news story did not all die, nor did they all have heart attacks.

Among large states, NY has lowest imprisonment rate
","To save money, New York state has announced a plan to close six prisons.  In a press release from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision about the plan to close prisons, the department included a claim that New York has ""the lowest imprisonment rate of any large state.""  Criminal justice issues promise to be hot-button topics in the New York governor and attorney general elections next year, so we wondered if this claim is correct.  We reached out to the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, which oversees prisons and parole, for evidence of its claim. Spokeswoman Rachel Connors directed us to data from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. Connors said her department defines a ""large state"" as one whose population is more than 10 million people.   Using the department’s definition, the large states are California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Rates of imprisonment are published by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. In data released in October 2020, ""Prisoners in 2019,"" researchers found that New York had an imprisonment rate of 224 people per 100,000 U.S. residents, lower than the other large states. And it’s lower by quite a bit compared with some of the other large states. The rates in Texas and Georgia were 529 and 507, respectively. The large state whose rate came closest to New York is Illinois, where 302 people are incarcerated for every 100,000 residents. The rates include all sentenced prisoners, regardless of sex or age, under jurisdiction of state or federal correctional authorities. New York, however, does not have the lowest imprisonment rate across the country. Because the claim only concerns large states, that fact is not under consideration for our ruling here. States including Massachusetts, Maine, and Minnesota had lower imprisonment rates than New York.  The federal data set referenced by the state Department of Corrections is used by advocacy organizations and others to study differences in state jail populations.  The Vera Institute of Justice, which also tracks imprisonment rates, collected imprisonment data from 2020 and early 2021. In its report published in June, imprisonment rates in spring 2021 were lowest in New York out of the nine largest states. A report published in September by the Prison Policy Institute also ranked New York lowest out of the nine largest states. That analysis used data on local jails, state prisons, federal prisons, and other confinement facilities.  The department responsible for state prisons and parole supervision claimed New York’s imprisonment rate was the lowest of any large state.  Federal data supports this claim, when ""large state"" is defined by having a population of more than 10 million people.  We rate this claim True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB54DC0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/19/nys-department-corrections-and-community-supervisi/among-large-states-ny-has-lowest-imprisonment-rate/

No, COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain luciferase
","In early November, Newsmax reporter Emerald Robinson tweeted a false claim: that ""the vaccines contain a bioluminescent marker called LUCIFERASE so that you can be tracked.""  Her account was subsequently suspended and Newsmax itself called the claim false.  ""We have seen no evidence to suggest luciferase or luciferin are present in any vaccines or that they are used as any sort of bioluminescent marker,"" said Elliot Jacobson, executive vice president and chief content officer for the network.   But misinformation about luciferase has continued to spread online, including in a blog post by Robinson that some people are sharing. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Luciferase is an enzyme that interacts with a protein called luciferin to release light, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This bioluminescence is what fireflies use to attract potential mates.  COVID-19 vaccine ingredients vary by manufacturer but none of the vaccines approved for use in the United States — from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson — contain luciferase. The ingredients for each vaccine are published on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The ingredient list for Pfizer’s vaccine, for example, shows mRNA, lipids, salts and sugar. In a Nov. 4 blog post, Robinson pointed to a page on Moderna’s website that shows patents ""relevant to our mRNA-1273 vaccine against COVID-19.""  One of the patents mentions ""luciferase"" four times. Moderna did not respond to PolitiFact’s emails about this patent but, as Health Feedback notes in its detailed analysis of Robinson’s blog post, the patent doesn’t mention COVID-19, the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 and is not evidence that Moderna or other COVID-19 vaccines contain luciferase.  Luciferase was used in some COVID-19 research. In 2020, for example, scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston used it to ""develop faster and more accurate diagnostic tests for COVID-19 as well as to analyze potential therapies and gain a clearer understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.""  But it’s not in the vaccines.  We rate that claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCD0300>],/factchecks/2021/nov/19/blog-posting/no-covid-19-vaccines-dont-contain-luciferase/

Biden nominee explores idea of eliminating private accounts, does not demand it
","A claim spreading across social media is that one of President Joe Biden’s nominees is demanding an end to all private bank accounts. ""Biden’s banking nominee demands all ‘private bank accounts’ be eliminated,"" reads a headline from Neon Nettle, an online news site that has spread misinformation in the past. Versions of this claim have been repeated on other sites.  The story claims that Biden's nominee for comptroller of the currency, Saule Omarova, ""vowed to eliminate all private bank accounts and deposits"" during a virtual conference in March this year. The comptroller of the currency regulates the federal banking system, including big Wall Street banks.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Omarova did write a lengthy paper exploring the idea of deposit accounts being provided through the Federal Reserve rather than private banks with the advent of digital currency. But claims that she ""demanded"" or ""vowed"" to do so go too far. Omarova’s nomination has faced strong opposition from Republicans, who have questioned her work and childhood in Kazakhstan, when it was part of the former Soviet Union. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., called Omarova’s ideas ""radical"" and ""socialist."" The Neon Nettle story includes an embedded YouTube video of the virtual conference, called ""Law & Political Economy: Democracy Beyond Neoliberalism."" It was recorded on Jan. 28 and posted in March. Omarova was nominated in September. During her presentation, Omarova, a professor at Cornell Law School, talked about a paper she wrote, and described it as a way to try to re-design the current financial system to connect it more directly to the macro economy, and to make the connection more effective and equitable for everyone. She said the purpose for her proposal was to change the public-private power balance in finance. She called the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet the ""crucial lever"" in achieving this. Her re-design is a work in progress, she said, and called it ""a complex project.""  The Fed can indirectly induce private banks to increase their lending, but cannot force them to do so, she said. Her vision was for the Fed to expand its role, to be a central bank for the people, to have the Fed be at the center of the economy and have it work in a most public interest-oriented way, she said. She said her paper pushed the idea of ""Fed accounts,"" or digital dollar deposit accounts for everyone, ""to the limit, and to imagine what would it be like if instead of being just a public option for deposit banking, this would be actually the full transition, in other words, there would be no more private bank deposit accounts, and all of the deposit accounts will be held directly at the Fed."" She called her idea a ""thought experiment.""  Later in the conference she said she doesn’t ""have complete answers for everything,"" and again calls her work a ""thought experiment.""       An introduction to her paper said that her work ""envisions the complete migration of demand deposit accounts to the Fed’s balance sheet.""   She was asked about her paper during a Nov. 18 Senate confirmation hearing, and said that she did not want to end banking as it’s known today, and that she was grappling, as an academic, with what it would look like if there were digital currency. She said that she never said that Fed accounts were the only solution, or the best solution, that Congress should take, but that it is one option that Congress should consider. She has also said that changing the way the Fed operates is not under the jurisdiction of the comptroller of the currency.  We reached out to a spokesperson for Omarova but did not receive a response.  In testimony posted on the Senate Banking Committee website, Omarova said that if confirmed, she would work to make sure that there is a ""fair and competitive market"" for small and mid-sized banks.  Social media posts claim that Omarova, a Biden administration nominee for comptroller of the currency, is demanding that private bank accounts be eliminated.  During a January 2021 conference, Omarova said that she wrote a paper exploring what would happen if the Federal Reserve system offered deposit accounts, and private banks did not. She called her paper a thought experiment. She did not demand that this happen. The conference occurred more than six months before she was nominated.  The headline and story use words like ""demand,"" and ""vowed,"" to give the impression that she said that she would eliminate private bank accounts in her position as comptroller of the currency. She has not done that.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC7FFC0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/19/blog-posting/biden-nominee-explores-idea-eliminating-private-ac/

In marathon speech, Kevin McCarthy makes dubious claims about Build Back Better bill
","During his marathon floor speech before House passage of the Build Back Better bill, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., criticized the Democratic-backed measure as profligate and harmful to the economy. Starting on Nov. 18, McCarthy spoke for more than eight hours prior to the final vote on the bill. The version that passed the House, which may be changed in the Senate, would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years on clean energy initiatives, child care subsidies, extended child tax credits, paid family leave and hearing aids for Medicare beneficiaries. It would be partially paid for through additional taxes primarily aimed at wealthy taxpayers and by letting the government negotiate certain drug prices. At one point in his speech, McCarthy said, ""Never in American history has so much been spent at one time. Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending."" It seemed unlikely that a bill that raises historic levels of taxes to pay for its spending would also require historic levels of borrowing. So we decided to take a closer look at McCarthy’s assessment.  It turns out McCarthy was wrong on all three elements. (His office did not provide support for his remarks to PolitiFact.) Two recent measures signed into law spent more at one time, one signed by then-President Donald Trump and the other signed by President Joe Biden. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (or CARES) Act was passed with bipartisan support and signed by Trump in March 2020, as the scope of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming clear.  The measure provided a $1,200-per-adult and $500-per-child direct cash payment, expanded unemployment benefits, a government-funded business lending plan, and expenditures to support hospitals, schools, and state and local governments.  In all, the expenditures in the CARES Act totaled $2.3 trillion, which is well above the price tag of the Build Back Better bill, and the money in the CARES Act was designed to be infused into the economy more quickly. Another bill signed by Biden in March 2021 also exceeded the cost of the Build Back Better Act. This measure, the American Rescue Plan, was supported only by Democrats in both chambers. The $1.9 trillion measure provided means-tested $1,400 direct cash payments, an increase in the child tax credit, an extension of enhanced unemployment payments, rental assistance, and funding for state and local governments, as well as schools, transit, restaurants, child care, and the airline industry. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Congress that examines the spending and tax impacts of legislation, found that the Build Back Better bill would raise taxes by roughly $1.27 trillion over 10 years. The CBO has previously estimated the size of the nation’s gross domestic product over the next decade at just under $288 trillion. So over the 10-year period, the tax increases from the Build Back Better bill would represent about 0.44% of cumulative GDP. That’s not trivial, but it’s also not close to a record. Just since 1968, at least five tax bills enacted tax increases larger than 0.44% of GDP: • Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09% • Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: 0.8% • Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: 0.5% • Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993: 0.5% • Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990: 0.49% In addition, 10 other bills before and during World War II also increased taxes by a larger percentage of GDP, according to the Treasury Department. This may be the most off-base assertion of the three. The CBO analysis of the Build Back Better bill found that the deficit would increase over 10 years by between $160 billion and $367 billion. (The lower figure reflects increased tax collections from additional IRS audit capacity, which the CBO’s rules don’t officially consider.) Those increases are a small fraction of the other two coronavirus relief bills mentioned earlier. According to the CBO, the CARES Act would raise deficits by $1.7 trillion, and the American Rescue Plan would raise deficits by about $1.8 trillion. ""It seems like there’s a bit of short-term memory loss"" with McCarthy’s statement, said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. He added that ""it’s just bad math to think that so much spending and so much revenue in Build Back Better wouldn’t largely cancel each other out (even if not entirely), so as not to add that much to the deficit."" McCarthy said, ""Never in American history has so much been spent at one time. Never in American history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for this reckless spending."" He’s wrong on all three counts. Two bills, including the bipartisan CARES Act, spent more money at one time. As a share of gross domestic product, the tax increases in the Build Back Better bill only rank sixth since 1968 and 16th since World War II. And the CARES Act was one of two bills that added far more to the debt than the Build Better Back bill would.

There’s no evidence linking Bill Gates to vials labeled ‘smallpox’ found in lab freezer
","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates participated in an interview earlier this month with former British health secretary Jeremy Hunt for the think tank Policy Exchange, where Gates urged more funding for a global research effort to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic. During the wide-ranging interview, Gates spoke of the need for a World Health Organization task force that could run what he called ""germ games,"" where countries could prepare for bioterror attacks, citing as an example: ""What if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports."" That interview, coupled with the recent news that vials labeled ""smallpox"" were found in a Pennsylvania lab several days later, has sparked numerous social media claims suggesting the two are linked. One Facebook user wrote, ""​​Today ... and a week ago... … Smell that?"" with a side-by-side image showing headlines about the vial discovery and about Gates’ warning. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence of a connection. The vials labeled ""smallpox"" were found at a Merck lab in Montgomery County, outside Philadelphia, according to NBC Philadelphia.  The CDC said the government was notified Nov. 15 that several frozen vials labeled ""smallpox"" were found by a lab worker while cleaning out a freezer in a vaccine research lab in Pennsylvania. No one was exposed to the contents of the vials.  Laboratory testing at the CDC later showed the vials contained vaccinia, the virus used in the smallpox vaccine, not variola virus, the cause of smallpox. ""CDC is in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization about these findings,"" the agency said.     The CDC says on its website that there have been no cases of smallpox in the United States since 1949 and that it was declared eradicated by the World Health Assembly in 1980. However, it says research continues in the U.S. on the variola virus to prepare for a potential bioterror attack. The research is overseen by the WHO, and the only two sites where the variola virus can be stored and used for research are the CDC’s site in Atlanta and a site in Russia. There is no indication that the Gates interview and the finding of the vials a week later are linked, and the post offers no evidence. The Facebook post uses a headline from an article in the The Independent that reads ""Bill Gates warns of smallpox terror attacks as he seeks research funds.""  The headline doesn’t capture the context of Gates' comments. Gates did not warn specifically of a smallpox attack in the interview, a long clip of which can be seen on YouTube (the portion discussing pandemic preparations begins at the 26:50 mark). He did suggest that governments fund more research in a worldwide effort to prepare for the next pandemic, which he said could come from bioterror attacks, citing a smallpox attack at airports as a possible example. Gates and his philanthropic foundation have been leaders in promoting vaccine research and distribution programs worldwide. They have also been frequent targets of misinformation since the pandemic began. PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous false claims about Gates and vaccines.  Last month, we debunked a claim that Gates said he wanted to use vaccines to control the population. In August, we rated  False another claim that Gates called for the ""withdrawal of all COVID-19 vaccines."" In March, we debunked a claim that the COVID-19 vaccine was merely an operating device used by Gates to program humans. A Facebook post suggests there’s a link between a Bill Gates interview where he mentions possible smallpox attacks and the discovery of vials labeled ""smallpox"" in a lab freezer in Pennsylvania a week later. There is no evidence linking the two, and the Gates interview was taken out of context in the headline used in the post. Gates did not warn of a smallpox attack. He simply said there was a need to prepare for the next pandemic, which could happen from a bioterror attack, using a smallpox attack at airports as one example.

Mitt Romney has maintained consistent stance on same-sex marriage
","
With President Barack Obama's change of position on gay marriage -- which earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter -- we thought it was a good time to take a fresh look at Mitt Romney's position on the same issue.

Shortly after Obama’s announcement, Romney was pressed about his own stance on same-sex marriage. In each case, he offered similar answers.

At a campaign event in Oklahoma City, reporters asked Romney to clarify his position. ""My view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman. That’s my own preference, and I know other people have differing views. This is a very tender and sensitive topic,"" he said. Romney added that he believes states should be able to decide whether to offer certain legal rights to same-sex couples, according to the Associated Press.

Later, Romney told KETV-TV in Omaha that,""as a society, I think we’re better off if we encourage the establishment of homes with a mother and a father."" Same-sex marriage, he said, isn’t ""appropriate and needed for a strong society.""

Meanwhile, in an interview with KDVR-TV in Denver, Romney said, ""I don't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name. My view is that domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but the others are not.""

Finally, in a commencement address at Liberty University on May 12, Romney said that American values, ""may become topics of democratic debate from time to time. So it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman.""

We wondered whether the opposition to same-sex marriage that Romney offered in the wake of Obama’s announcement represented a change in views. So we put it to the Flip-O-Meter.

We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.

As we wrote in 2007, Romney took a relatively liberal approach on gay rights during his 1994 Senate race against liberal Democratic icon Edward M. Kennedy.

During his Senate race, Romney wrote a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, which read in part, ""I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent."" He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military, a policy that was ultimately approved 16 years later.

A lengthy interview with Romney in Bay Windows, a Boston-area gay newspaper, was headlined, ""Romney: I'll be better than Ted for gay rights.""

But despite making policy overtures to gay voters, Romney consistently drew the line at gay marriage, even as far back as 1994.

When Romney was asked by Bay Windows, ""Would you support legalized marriage for gay men and lesbians?"" Romney responded, ""I line up with (moderate Massachusetts Republican Gov. William) Weld on that, and it's a state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction. My understanding is that he has looked at the issue and concluded that certain benefits and privileges should be offered to gay couples and lesbian couples. But he does not feel at this time that he wishes to extend legalized marriage on a same-sex basis, and I support his position.""

Then, in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court opened the doors to same-sex marriage in the state, Romney supported a constitutional amendment that would have banned the practice.

Romney maintained his opposition to same-sex marriage during the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, saying at one Iowa event that he’s fought same-sex marriage ""every way I have known how to, and the fight isn’t over,"" according to the New York Times.

Our ruling

In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, ""I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage."" We have found nothing to contradict this view. While Romney in 1994 offered relatively liberal views on some policies of importance to gay voters, he never went so far as to support same-sex marriage. In fact, he spoke out against the idea -- and took actions to stem it while governor. Romney has been consistent on this.

U.S. Chamber tells seniors that 20 million could lose coverage under the health care law
","
An ad from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claims seniors could lose coverage thanks to ""Obamacare."" It pins the blame on Florida Sen. Bill Nelson.

The ad intercuts its own commentary with video footage of Nelson speaking on the Senate floor.

U.S. Chamber: ""Obamacare will be a nightmare for Florida seniors. Did Bill Nelson consider the consequences when he cast a deciding vote for Obamacare?""

Nelson: ""This legislation is gonna let folks that are happy with their insurance keep it …""

U.S. Chamber: ""Wrong. 20 million people could lose their current coverage.""

Nelson: ""... including our senior citizens who are on Medicare.""

U.S. Chamber: ""But Senator, seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare. Call Bill Nelson. Tell him to support the repeal of Obamacare.""

Here, we’re checking whether ""20 million people could lose their current coverage,"" and whether those people are older Americans on Medicare as the ad strongly suggests.

For evidence, the ad’s fine print cites a March report from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that provides economic and budgetary analysis to Congress.

We should note that PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions. However, we do fact-check whether ads accurately portray predictions made by others, particularly ones that carry a great deal of credibility, like CBO. So that’s what we’ll do here.

We read the report, which analyzes the health care law of 2010, also known as the Affordable Care Act. We quickly realized the ad was mixing apples and oranges.

The ad makes it sound like 20 million seniors will be losing coverage. The report’s estimate has to do with people who get health insurance through work, which the CBO calls employer-provided insurance. But most seniors don’t get their insurance through work; they get their health insurance through Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for older Americans. The ad blurs these distinctions in a way that’s highly misleading.

Even if the ad had provided proper context of employer-provided insurance, it’s still not exactly the case that 20 million people will lose coverage under the health insurance law.

First, that estimate is the highest number of several estimates and scenarios that the CBO examined. Second, some portion of that number are people voluntarily switching to other, better coverage -- not being forced out of coverage against their will. Third, these numbers ignore estimates that say 9 million people who didn't have employer coverage will get it because of the law.

For more details on the report, read our fact-check of Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said that ""as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare."" We rated his statement Half True. Unlike the chamber ad, Preibus put the number in the more appropriate context of health insurance through work.

The CBO report does not make any mention of Medicare beneficiaries losing coverage. And in fact, in our many reports on Medicare, we’ve never seen that claim that seniors would lose Medicare coverage because of the health care law. Yet it seems like that’s the reasonable interpretation of the ad.

We contacted the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that works with Medicare beneficiaries to educate them on the program and help them get access to care. We asked executive director Judith Stein if there was any scenario in which seniors would lose coverage under the new health care law.

""If they’re stating that 20 million people would lose Medicare because of the Affordable Care Act, that is simply not true. In fact, the health care law strengthens Medicare coverage,"" Stein said.

Our ruling

The ad from the U.S. Chamber makes it sound like 20 million older Americans will lose coverage under the health care law. We found no evidence that Medicare beneficiaries will lose coverage under the health care law, and the ad’s evidence points to one cherry-picked statistic that applies to employer-provided insurance, not Medicare.

Chamber says Bill Nelson voted to cut Medicare $500 billion
","
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is going after Sen. Bill Nelson’s vote in favor of the federal health care law, saying in a new television ad that the law will ""be a nightmare for Florida seniors.""

The ad includes a statement from Nelson supporting the health care law but interrupts Nelson to suggest his statement is inaccurate. (Watch it here.)

The narrator in the ad, among other things, says that ""seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare.""

That’s what we’re fact-checking here -- and have fact-checked many times before.

By way of introduction, Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up about 12 percent of the federal budget. Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation.
   
Some of the changes included in the health care law increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, said Tricia Neuman, who is vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation -- a trusted independent source. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap for enrollees purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program (sometimes called the doughnut hole).

Other changes reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help pay for coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation, Neuman said. And yet other provisions are designed to improve the delivery and quality of care. (Neuman explains the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.)
   
The key to this claim is the fact that the health care law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending increases over the next 10 years.
   
In fact, Medicare spending will still increase.
   
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of projected spending increases in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare.

Put simpler, Medicare’s budget will continue to grow -- just at a smaller rate than had originally been projected.

The chamber is correct on one point, however: The spending reductions to Medicare are intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the new health care law.

On May 14, 2012, lawyers for Nelson wrote to Florida TV stations asking them not to air the ad because of the Medicare claim.

""Just last Friday, FactCheck.org, a non-partisan, non-profit consumer advocate project with the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, examined this ad and reported: ‘Chamber Continues To Mislead On Healthcare Law.’ In addition, the Pulitzer Prize-winning,  independent non-profit organization PolitiFact has reported a number of times that the claim is ‘false’,"" lawyers Kendall Coffey and Abigail Parent wrote.

In the past, we’ve rated claims about the $500 billion in ""cuts"" to Medicare anywhere from Half True to Mostly False to False, depending on how they were worded.

The U.S. Chamber said that ""seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare."" That’s largely incorrect. Medicare spending is still set to increase, just not at as high a rate as originally anticipated. The difference, about $500 billion, is being used to help fund other provisions in the new health care law.  That’s the small kernel of truth in this claim, which we rate Mostly False.

Anti- transportation tax group: Light rail doubles commute time
","
Metro Atlanta needs to fix its traffic problems, but it doesn’t need rail, a group opposed to a plan to raise taxes to overhaul the region’s transportation system said.

The Transportation Leadership Coalition operates the www.traffictruth.net website, which lists reasons to vote against the 1-cent sales tax July 31.  

One of the top ones is that it won’t help you in a traffic jam. Even research by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, which helps create regional transportation policy, found that light rail could make your commute far worse,  the website said.  

""GRTA concluded that light rail in Cobb County would more than double commute time and would therefore be unsuccessful in alleviating traffic congestion,"" it read.

More than double commute time? Then why would anyone in his right mind want light rail?

We took a close look at the claim.

The referendum is known as the Transportation Special Local Option Sales Tax. It would raise taxes by 1 cent in the metro area over the next 10 years to build or upgrade roads, highways and mass transit.  

Even if the referendum passes, it won’t fund rail for Cobb County. Local leaders who developed a slate of projects that the tax would fund struck it from the list.

It will pay for other rail projects, such as one in the Clifton Road corridor near Emory University and streetcars in and around downtown Atlanta. Transportation tax foes repeatedly use this fact as a reason to oppose it.

To find out more about the GRTA claim, we called volunteers for the Transportation Leadership Coalition. They told us they got their information during meetings for the Northwest Connectivity Study, a years-long effort in the early 2000s. The GRTA’s aim was to find out what kind of mass transit system would help locals best cope with their commutes.

The study recommended bus service that would use HOV lanes to take them closer to the city’s core instead of light rail or other types of transit, according to news accounts and GRTA study documents.  

(The bus service never launched. It morphed into a project to build special ""reversible lanes"" that switch their direction of travel depending on the time of day. Drivers will pay a toll to use them to get around traffic jams.)

The study estimated commute times for some of these mass transit options.

The HOV lane bus service would take 36 minutes to travel from the Busbee Park and Ride lot in the Kennesaw area to Midtown, according to study documents. Light rail would take an estimated 53 minutes, or 17 minutes more.

But it did not compare mass transit trip times to car commutes, GRTA spokesman William Mecke told PolitiFact Georgia. It didn’t look into how these mass transit projects would affect traffic congestion, either.

""Therefore, GRTA drew no conclusions as to how much these transit options would impact commute times or alleviate traffic congestion,"" Mecke told us in an email. Project documents outlining the scope of the study back up this statement.

Mecke cautioned that the study’s estimates are old.

""That was eight years and another economy ago,"" Mecke said.

Transportation Leadership Coalition volunteer Ron Sifen recalls the Northwest Corridor effort differently. Sifen, who said he supports mass transit, said he was a supporter of light rail until he saw a GRTA presentation in the early 2000s.

The presentation compared trip times for car commuters with those of light-rail riders. Sifen said car trips were so much shorter, and light rail was so much more expensive than other options, he decided light rail was a bad idea.

We wanted to give Sifen and others from the anti-transportation tax group another chance, so we checked our newspaper archives and other resources for any suggestion that light rail would double Northwest Corridor commute times. We found nothing.

We also looked at the GRTA’s yearly Transportation MAP Report, which shows commute times for certain freeway segments. We hoped we could do a back-of-the-envelope calculation for the length of a car commute and compare it with the light-rail time.

We couldn’t. It doesn’t show how long it takes a car commuter to drive from the Busbee Park and Ride to Midtown.

It’s possible that car commutes could be shorter than prospective light-rail commutes. Trains make regularly scheduled stops.

But even if data collected as part of the Northwest Connectivity study, or any other transportation studies in the early part of the past decade, did confirm that this were true, that data would be very old.  

To sum up:

The Transportation Leadership Coalition said that the GRTA ""concluded that light rail in Cobb County would more than double commute time and would therefore be unsuccessful in alleviating traffic congestion.""

The GRTA denied it made this conclusion, and we found no evidence it did, either.

Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher says Marcy Kaptur opposed a ban on gender abortions
","
Almost 40 years after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion under most circumstances, abortion remains a political hot button. 
Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher, the Republican congressional candidate in Ohio's 9th District, demonstrates that in a news release, video and series of Twitter tweets aimed at Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur.

""I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur has the same belief system as someone in the Chinese politburo or that she thinks it's OK to kill unborn babies. And I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur believes in gendercide,"" he says in the campaign video.

""But Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl.""

That's an emotional pitch.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Wurzlbacher’s campaign said the vote was on H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012, or ""PRENDA.""

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, would have made it a federal crime with a five-year prison sentence to perform or force a woman to undergo a gender-selection abortion -- a practice that is most common in some Asian countries where families that want sons abort female fetuses.

Under the bill, doctors, nurses and medical personnel who do not report suspected gender-related abortions would also face prison and a fine. The male partner and parents of the woman having the abortion would be able to sue for damages. The woman would be exempt from prosecution or civil suit.

Republicans said in debate that gender-selection abortion amounts to ""gendercide"" and a ""war on women"" because it is female fetuses that are most often targeted -- rhetoric that effectively turned the tables on Democrats who previously knocked Republicans for their stances on the Violence Against Women Act and who are pushing legislation requiring equal pay for men and women.

The bill's backers supported their charge of ""gendercide,"" the Christian Science Monitor reported, by citing a study showing that an analysis of the third child born to Chinese, Indian, and Korean parents in the U.S. ""strongly suggest[s]"" prenatal sex selection.

But a review of the legislation by the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and rights, argues that such practices are not widespread in the United States and that the studies to support the bill cannot prove that gender-selection abortions are a significant problem, even in particular immigrant communities.

""What is conclusively known,"" wrote Guttmacher's Sneha Barot, ""is that the U.S. sex ratio at birth in 2005 stood at 105 boys to 100 girls, squarely within biologically normal parameters.""

In a vote on May 31, the House bill won a majority of representatives -- 246 votes in favor and 168 against -- but failed because it was considered under a suspension of House rules. That procedure, normally used for non-controversial measures, limits debate and requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass.

Franks said in a news interview before the vote that he expected the measure to fail, but that it was a strategic goal to force Democrats to vote against it.

""I think we’re doing the right thing strategically,"" he told The Washington Post, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if GOP candidates and conservative groups used the vote to attack Democratic opponents.

Franks was correct on that point. In one subsequent statement, Wurzelbacher described Kaptur as ""supporting abortions based on gender and skin color.""

We contacted Kaptur's campaign. Spokesman Steve Fought said the congresswoman opposed the bill because of privacy issues it raised and its potential consequences.

""How do you prove someone had a gender-based abortion?"" he asked, asserting that the proof would involve medical personnel knowing a woman's reason for an abortion and whether and when she knew the sex of a fetus.

Knowing  the gender of  a fetus would involve sonograms, he said. Medical personnel fearing the possibility of prosecution could reduce the use of sonograms, against the health interest of fetuses, children and mothers -- particularly in the Asian and immigrant communities  the bill targets.

""It was an eminently bad piece of legislation that was introduced strictly for political posturing, under suspension of the rules and not through committee,"" Fought said. ""The video proves that point. It was a show bill. They wanted to get people on the record voting against it so they can demagogue it.""

Where does that leave us?

Wurzelbacher’s statement is accurate. Kaptur did vote against PRENDA. The bill would ban gender-selection abortions.

But additional information is needed for clarification. Kaptur's record on abortion has been consistent. In a story about this vote, Roll Call, a Washington publication, described her as a  Democrat who opposes abortion. 
But in this case, her staff said, concerns about other effects and consequences of the legislation played a role in her vote. And, the bill’s leading sponsor acknowledged that political strategy drove the process under which it was considered.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Wurzelbacher's claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD36C00>],/factchecks/2012/jun/12/samuel-wurzelbacher/samuel-joe-plumber-wurzelbacher-says-marcy-kaptur-/

Obama ad says Romney opposes gay adoption
","
Within a day of President Barack Obama announcing his support for same-sex marriage, his campaign released an ad chiding Republican rival Mitt Romney for opposing it.

It’s true that Romney does not support gay marriage -- he reaffirmed that position the same day as Obama’s historic announcement. But the Obama campaign video claims that Romney would deny certain rights to gay partners, including the right to adopt children.

The ad shows short clips of both candidates talking about gay marriage -- Obama saying he supports it, Romney saying he doesn’t -- then the words ""What rights would Romney deny?"" appear onscreen.

""Health insurance for your partner and kids,"" it says on the screen, followed by ""adopting children together,"" and finally ""emergency medical decisions for partners."" The words are all stamped with ""DENIED"" in red letters.

We wondered about the adoption claim: Does Romney’s opposition to gay marriage go that far?

Obama campaign’s evidence

Asked for evidence to back up the ad, the Obama campaign pointed to Romney’s support for a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman. That bill, as proposed, would override any state laws, such as the one in Massachusetts, making marriage between people of the same gender legal. The amendment does not address adoption by gay couples. The day of Obama’s announcement, May 9, 2012, Romney said he also opposes civil unions ""if they are identical to marriage other than by name.""

But we found Romney has repeatedly expressed support for domestic partnership rights, on a state-by-state basis. The Obama campaign cited this ""states’ rights"" stance -- in which states would be empowered to allow or deny certain domestic partner benefits -- as evidence that Romney would deny the rights. But we find a flaw in that logic, because when Romney has argued that position, he has listed those rights in positive terms.

""My preference again would be to have a national standard, with one standard for the nation. Now that doesn’t mean that same-sex couples can’t enter into domestic partnerships, and the benefits associated with domestic partnerships could be, developed from, by enterprise, by the state, by the federal government,"" he told the Ames (Iowa) Tribune editorial board in 2011. ""So one could say for instance that in Iowa, a same-sex couple can come together, can adopt a child. And they can have hospital visitation rights and so forth. I mean you could decide what benefits, each state can decide the benefits associated with people who live in domestic partnerships.""

In other words, Romney didn’t frame the issue in terms of rights the states could deny gay couples. He listed adoption and hospital visitation as rights that states could grant.

More from Romney on the topic

Other statements from Romney do not offer resounding support for the rights of gay couples to adopt. His words are measured, and often accompany a statement about his opposition to gay marriage. But they make clear that, at least, Romney does not favor state laws prohibiting gay couples from adopting.

2006: In saying he planned to pursue a law in Massachusetts exempting religious groups from allowing adoption by gay parents, Romney was quoted in the Boston Globe, ""I know that there will be some gay couples who will say that this could be discriminatory against us, except that there are many, many other agencies that can meet the needs of those gay couples, and I recognize that they have a legitimate interest in being able to receive adoptive services.""

June 2007: ""There are other ways to raise kids that's fine: single moms, grandparents raising kids, gay couples raising kids. That's the American way, to have people have their freedom of choice,"" he said, according to the Associated Press.

July 2008: Wolf Blitzer, then on CNN, asked, ""If the states -- whatever state said, you know what, it's fine for gay couples to adopt kids, that would be OK with you?"" Romney answered, ""I didn't oppose that here in Massachusetts. My view was the best setting for a child to be raised is where there's a mom and a dad, but I did not say let's put in place a law that would prevent a court from deciding that a child, instead of being in an orphanage, should be with a same-sex couple or with a single mom or a single dad. You leave that up to the court and let them make the decision.""

Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told BuzzFeed in February 2012: ""Gov. Romney believes a family with one mother and one father is the ideal setting to raise a child. That doesn't mean adoption by other parents — whether they be single or same-sex — should be outlawed. States have to make decisions that are in the best interests of children, and where possible that should be in a home with one mother and one father.""

And the day after Obama’s announcement, Romney told Fox News host Neil Cavuto: ""I also know many gay couples are able to adopt children. That’s fine.""

He also said, ""If two people of the same gender want to live together, want to have a loving relationship, and even want to adopt a child -- in my state, individuals of the same sex were able to adopt children. In my view, that's something which people have the right to do. But to call that marriage, is, in my view, a departure from the real meaning of that word.""

Our ruling

Obama and Romney have starkly different positions on gay marriage, but Obama’s ad distorts Romney's position when it says he would deny gay couples the right to adopt children.

We found nothing in Romney’s past statements to support that claim. He is a clear opponent of gay marriage, and does not seem to favor civil unions if they afford all the same benefits as marriage. But he is on record as supporting domestic partnerships, with specific rights determined individually by states. The Obama campaign interprets this as Romney saying states would be allowed to deny gay couples the right to adopt. But when he has articulated his position, he has often mentioned adoption as one of the rights states could grant. And this year, Romney called adoption by same-sex couples ""something which people have the right to do.""

The claim in the Web ad is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC045680>],/factchecks/2012/may/14/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-opposes-gay-adoption/

Pro-Dewhurst political group says Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants
","
A TV ad aired by a political action committee favoring David Dewhurst for the U.S. Senate includes this claim about a former Dallas mayor likewise seeking the Republican Senate nomination: ""Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants.""

He did?

Broadly, the idea of sanctuaries for immigrants gained currency in some quarters in the 1980s as citizens of strife-torn countries in Central America sought refuge in the United States. Of late, in contrast, the ""sanctuary city"" label has been bandied to refer to communities that do not routinely identify and detain illegal immigrants.

For instance, a Sept. 19, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news story about Gov. Rick Perry’s unsuccessful calls on Texas lawmakers to ban sanctuary cities said a ""sanctuary city prohibits law enforcement from asking about the immigration status of the people they detain.""

In 2010, Perry and other foes of Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, formerly Houston’s mayor, said he had offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants in the Bayou City. They pointed to a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service listing Houston among 32 localities that had sanctuary policies.

We rated Perry’s claim False. Houston police did not ask people what their immigration status is during routine patrols, but the only immigration-related action by White that we found relevant was intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain. On White’s watch, Houston joined the federal Secure Communities program under which fingerprints of people detained by local law enforcement agencies are checked against those of criminal illegal immigrants kept by U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

And how did the Conservative Renewal PAC conclude that Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city?

In an April 27, 2012, letter defending its ad, two lawyers for the PAC said Leppert, who was mayor from mid-2007 into February 2011, signed an ACORN pledge while running for mayor that was tantamount to promising to make the city a sanctuary. ACORN, since folded, was a left-leaning voter registration and advocacy group.

According to the lawyers’ letter, the Leppert-signed pledge said: ""If elected, I will respect the fact that immigration policy is a federal issue and does not fall under the city's domain."" The lawyers’ letter offers as analysis: ""This is a pledge to refrain from undertaking to enforce immigration laws in Dallas. ... This is indisputably a pledge to uphold Dallas’s status as a ‘sanctuary city.’""

We failed to land a readable copy of the original pledge either from the PAC, which did not provide one, or Leppert. (An online video posted by a Dallas Morning News reporter in May 2011 appears to show Leppert attending an ACORN gathering; an immigration-related pledge, displayed on the wall, twice appears, partly viewable, in the background.)

Leppert’s campaign spokesman, Daniel Keylin, confirmed by telephone that Leppert signed a pledge stating that immigration law enforcement is a federal duty. However, he said, he's not 100 percent certain that it had the language cited in the TV ad.

Separately, our online search for news articles on any Leppert ""sanctuary"" pledge came up empty, although a July 8, 2007, editorial in the Dallas Morning News said Leppert had pledged to create a city office of immigrant affairs.

Asked for elaboration, Keylin noted a July 3, 2007, Morning News news article (likely the basis of the editorial) indicating that Leppert supported such an office, which activists were pushing. ""All I want is to make sure we have a clear direction,"" the article quotes Leppert as saying. ""Who does it serve and how are we going to measure its success?"" According to the article, the advocates envisioned it helping legal and illegal immigrants assimilate.

Keylin told us via email that one reason the office did not come to be is that Leppert did not want it to serve illegal immigrants.

Keylin reminded us, too, that most individuals arrested in Dallas are processed at the county jail where fingerprints are shared through the Secure Communities program, which the county joined while Leppert was mayor.

During Leppert’s time as mayor, Keylin said, the Dallas City Council did not take up or pass an ordinance to help out illegal immigrants.

Keylin noted, too, a Jan. 14, 2011, American-Statesman news article indicating that in Austin, Travis County and Houston, local policies barred law enforcement officers from stopping people to determine their immigration status or because they thought someone was in the country illegally.

Keylin insisted that is not the case in the City of Dallas, though the January 2011 Statesman story says that police and sheriff's officials in Austin, Dallas and Houston said they don't enforce immigration laws or ask people about their immigration status, in part to encourage people to report crimes and work with police. The story says Dallas County sheriff and Houston police policies note the role undocumented immigrants play in law enforcement. According to the story, Dallas County’s policy, put in place in 2010, says: ""Participation and involvement of the undocumented aliens' community in law enforcement activities will increase the Sheriff's Department's ability to protect and serve the entire community.""

The Statesman story, quoting a Dallas County sheriff’s detective, says that when an individual is booked into jail after being arrested, an officer fills out a booking sheet that asks place of birth. Those born outside the U.S. may be questioned further by a federal immigration officer stationed at the booking site, the detective, Raul Reyna, is quoted as saying.

We turned next to federal and municipal authorities. 
By email, ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa confirmed that the Secure Communities program was activated in Dallas and Dallas County in November 2008, which was more than a year into Leppert’s time as mayor.

Broadly, Tom Perkins, city attorney for the City of Dallas, told us in a telephone interview: ""There is no ordinance or City Council resolution that designates Dallas as a sanctuary city and there is no Dallas City Council ordinance or regulation that prohibits Dallas police officers from inquiring into (the) immigration status"" of individuals stopped for questioning.

He also mentioned the Dallas Police Department’s instruction to police officers, titled ""Illegal Immigrants."" Melinda Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for the Dallas Police Department, later sent us the latest version of General Order 315.04, which was revised Feb. 17, 2011, about a week before Leppert resigned as mayor.

The order, similar to a September 2008 version we found in a report by the Washington-based Police Foundation, opens: ""The U.S. Immigration Code denies us the authority to enforce its provisions; therefore, we do not enforce immigration laws. All other laws apply to illegal immigrants.""

The order continues: ""Officers will not stop or contact citizens for the sole purpose of determining immigration status."" Gutierrez, asked if this means officers ask into the immigration status of individuals in other instances, told us by telephone: ""It’s not something we generally do.""

Also from the order: ""Arrest reports will contain arrest elements only and not refer to immigration status.""

Federal immigration ""agents have the sole responsibility for determining the immigration status of incarcerated persons,"" the order says, and federal agents assigned to the Lew Sterrett Justice Center, where suspects are detained, ""review arrest reports submitted to the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office, and then decide which inmates to investigate for possible immigration violations."" Also, the order says, if immigration authorities advise that someone should be detained for an immigration violation, the person will be held by the police. Finally, the order says, city charges will be dropped on request of the immigration agency.

Gutierrez, asked how long the policy of not stopping individuals solely to check on their immigration status had been in place, sent us a May 1996 special order to department employees from Bennie R. Click, then the police chief. The memo said the department was revising procedures for handling criminal suspects who may also be illegal immigrants to eliminate duplication of the efforts of federal immigration officials and to clarify that Dallas officers not ""make investigative stops for the sole purpose of determining citizenship, nor make arrests for immigration law violations."" The full revised order regarding illegal immigrants, shown in the memo, is similar to the 2008 and 2011 versions.

So, for more than 15 years, the Dallas Police Department has had a policy advising police officers against inquiring into the immigration status of individuals, though it also says federal officials routinely review local arrest reports and decide which inmates to investigate for immigration violations.

in a telephone interview, Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, which supports police departments staying out of immigration law enforcement, said ""sanctuary city"" can be considered a ""glittering generality,"" implying a place where people illegally in the United States can go and nothing will happen to them. Still, he said, local police will arrest any individuals who break state or local laws. ""If you go to Dallas and you violate their laws, they’re going to lock you up,"" he said.

Our ruling

We were hampered by not being offered, or finding, the original described pledge. 
Still, Leppert''s camp confirmed that he at one time pledged respect for immigration enforcement being a federal issue. If so, our sense is that he acted in step with the police department’s decade-old policy of leaving immigration-related inquiries to Uncle Sam -- which alone can be taken as sufficient to support the ""sanctuary city"" label.

Then again, Leppert did not pledge to ""make"" Dallas into a sanctuary. His position was essentially status quo. Also, the county joined the Secure Communities program while he was mayor. This claim ignores these critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBE9B40>],/factchecks/2012/may/14/conservative-renewal-pac/pro-dewhurst-political-group-says-tom-leppert-pled/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'George LeMieux']","
George LeMieux says Connie Mack is a California resident
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack represents Florida in Washington and is married to U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack of California. One of Connie Mack’s Republican rivals in the U.S. Senate race, George LeMieux, is suggesting that Mack doesn’t log much time in Florida.

A Web ad released by the LeMieux campaign shows footage of a reporter asking Mack about the allegation that he doesn’t spend a lot of time in Florida:

Mack: ""You know, they’ll say that I’m never here. Well, the reality is I was in California last year maybe 11 days?""

The narrator says, ""Sources show Mack as a resident of California, living with his wife in Palm Springs. And they’ve been known to pop up on the red carpet. Then there is their place in Colorado. …. And court documents say Connie spent little time in the modest Florida condo. Even his ex-wife testified it was only purchased just to assist his political career. But Connie says his real home is in Florida. Do you believe him? …. Florida needs a full-time senator instead of a Half-Mack here half the time.""

The narrator calls for Mack to release his travel records to determine if he is really ""California Connie, Colorado Connie or just modest Condo Connie."" (There are two photos in the ad that viewers might assume are Mack at a ski resort or the inside of his Fort Myers condo. But a LeMieux campaign spokeswoman said they are stock art.)

Mack’s campaign fought back saying that LeMieux was avoiding the issues.

We can’t independently verify what percentage of Mack’s time is spent at his Florida condo. But we can put one LeMieux claim to the Truth-O-Meter: is Mack a resident of California living with his wife in Palm Springs?

Residency rule

It’s not uncommon for members of Congress to own or rent a residence in the Washington area. But the questions about Mack are a little different because he’s married to a member of Congress representing another state.

Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005. About two years later, Mack married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and Congressman Sonny Bono.

After he announced his U.S. Senate bid in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that Mack had been ""criticized for not spending enough time in Florida due to his wife. … Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend — the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state.""

LeMieux’s online video doesn’t suggest that Mack is violating the law, but it tries to create the perception that he isn’t spending much time in Florida.

The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected.

Florida’s election code doesn’t define residency, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections.

Florida courts ""have consistently construed legal residence to mean a permanent residence, domicile, or permanent abode, rather than a residence that is temporary,"" states the opinion. (The state elections’ division told us the opinion is still valid even though it is nearly 20 years old.)

Experts on election requirements told us that there is no ""bright line"" test to determine residency.

""The idea is that you are supposed to be related in a meaningful way to the state you represent, and you don’t just show up to run for office,"" said Frances Hill, who teaches election law at the University of Miami.

Mack addresses residency question

During a stop in Tallahassee on May 4, 2012, PolitiFact Florida asked Mack about his living situation. ""The question they (opponents) try to get to is, am I spending all of my time in California? And it's just not true. As many times as I've answered that ... last year I think I spent maybe 11 days in California,"" he said.

""What I'm saying is this, it's political fodder that my opponents like to spin. But to give you an example ... Monday I was in Miami. Tuesday morning in Miami, Tuesday afternoon in Fort Myers, Tuesday evening here in Tallahassee, then we went to Panama City, Pensacola, back here in Tallahassee, then we're going to go to Jacksonville, then we're going to Fort Lauderdale, then we go to Fort Myers, then we go to Orlando, then I go back to DC for votes.""

The example he gave is expected of a campaign, PolitiFact Florida noted. We asked him to elaborate on how he divides his time on a day-to-day basis.

""I just gave you every day. This is my home, this is where I live, and this is a cheap political shot by my opponents that other than the press and my opponent, no one asks. It's not on their mind. They're not concerned about it. They know that this is where I am.""

Homes owned by Mack or his wife

Here’s what we found when we looked for homes owned by Mack (whose legal name is Cornelius McGillicuddy IV) or his current wife Mary Bono Mack:

Fort Myers: Mack owns a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo at 15081 Tamarind Cay Court in Fort Myers, Lee County property records show. Mack and his first wife, Ann, bought the condo for $166,900 in October 2003. After her husband filed for divorce in 2005, Ann stated in a September 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to ""solely to assist his political career"" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign disputes Ann’s account.

After he won the election in 2004, the family moved to a 5-bedroom home in Alexandria, Va. Ann wrote that they spent very little time in the ""modest"" condo in Fort Myers. She argued during the divorce proceedings that he forced her and their two children to live in the ""small political stake in the sand"" in Fort Myers while he stayed in the home in Virginia. Mack later sold the Virginia home.

Mack has a homestead exemption on his Fort Myers condo. The Tampa Tribune raised questions about Mack’s exemption because his current wife has an exemption on her California home. Under Florida state law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren’t co-mingled with those of his wife.

Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: ""They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie’s name is not on Mary’s home in California, and Mary’s is not on Connie’s home in Fort Myers,"" James said. (James also sent us similar statements from Mack’s attorney,Craig Engle.)

Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson said in February that he would research the legality of Mack’s homestead but told the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times: ""I think they’ll be okay. That’s my gut feeling,"" Wilkinson said. ""But I now have an obligation to check this out."" Mack has until around mid September to submit evidence showing that their finances are separate.

The homestead controversy surfaced after Mack criticized Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for getting an agricultural exemption on a Brevard County property.

Palm Springs, Calif.: Mary Bono purchased an $875,000 three-bedroom home at 64505 Via Amante in Palm Springs in 1998. The home is 5,450 square feet and worth about $1.1 million, Riverside County records show.

Durango, Colo.: Mack’s 2011 financial disclosure states that he has a mortgage on a rental property in Durango, Colo., between $250,001 and $500,000 from October 2010. He also wrote that he was 16.67 percent owner in the property, which is owned by the company Mack and his wife formed, Westerfield Scotch LLC. La Plata, County records show that the two-bedroom two-bath unit is nearly 2,000-square feet and that they purchased the condo for $692,500 in October 2010. 
A warranty deed from October states that Mack and Bono Mack ""whose legal address is 64505 Via Amante, Palm Springs...."" A November 2010 warranty deed signed by Mack and Bono Mack states that ""Connie Mack and Mary Bono Mack of the county of Riverside, state of California, and Westerfield Scotch, a Colorado limited liability company, whose legal address is 64505 Via Amante, Palm Springs...""

The couple occasionally stays there for vacations and rent it out to others, Bono Mack’s spokesman Ken Johnson said. Her adult children are also owners.

Mack’s attorney Craig Engle told PolitiFact the ""document is mistaken"" when it states that Mack’s legal address is in Palm Springs and that it would be wrong to interpret that document to mean that Mack is a California resident. Engle stated that the documents had to list an address for mailing purposes, and that could be why it has Bono Mack’s Palm Springs address.

Arlington, Va.: Mary Bono purchased a two-bedroom condo at 3600 S. Glebe Road at the Eclipse at Center Park in Arlington, Va., for $549,313 in March 2007. She married Mack later that year. Connie Mack’s name doesn’t appear on that record, and a court land records clerk told us only Bono’s name is on the deed. The congresswoman had the condo under construction contract starting in 2005, her spokesman said. (The Web ad doesn’t mention this condo.)

Conclusion

LeMieux’s web ad states ""Sources show Mack as a resident of California, living with his wife in Palm Springs.""

It’s legitimate to raise the question of how much time Mack spends in various places. And we can’t independently verify how much time he spends in California compared to his Fort Myers condo or anywhere else.

But in this case, the ad’s ""sources"" are deeds for a Colorado condo owned by Mack and his wife that list their legal address as the Palm Springs home.

While it’s unusual to have a spouse who lives in another state, both Mack and his wife work in Washington. They also owned their own homes and had professional careers in their respective states before they married. Given that context, we don’t think the deed to a vacation home in Colorado is definitive proof that Mack is living in California.

One of our principles at PolitiFact is that campaigns have the burden to offer proof for what they say. In this case, the LeMieux campaign doesn’t have much. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB865680>],/factchecks/2012/may/14/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-says-connie-mack-california-residen/

Steve Rothman’s campaign edits attack ad to suggest Bill Pascrell admitted supporting tax cuts for the rich
","
The latest attack ad from U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman has all the makings of a well-crafted, political hit.

There’s the snarky narrator, a tuxedoed man winking at the camera -- and, of course, some editing to make Rothman’s opponent sound like he’s saying something that he’s not.

About a month before the two Democratic congressmen face off in the June 5 primary for a newly drawn congressional district, Rothman’s campaign on May 8 posted an ad on YouTube claiming that U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell ""wants more tax cuts for the rich.""

The ad goes one step further, suggesting that Pascrell admitted to supporting such tax cuts. Just after the narrator claims the congressman ""wants more tax cuts for the rich,"" the video cuts to a clip of Pascrell saying, ""Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Pascrell’s comments were in reference to reaching a bipartisan compromise on health care reform, not about providing tax cuts.

Let’s go through the ad.

The ad opens with a video of Rothman saying, ""I’m Steve Rothman and I approved this message."" Then we see archival footage of what appears to be wealthy people in tuxedos and cocktail dresses at a party.

""Who wants more tax cuts for the rich?"" the narrator intones. ""Mitt Romney, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Bill Pascrell."" A photo of each man is superimposed on the screen as the narrator says their names.

The ad immediately turns to a video of Pascrell talking.

In a clip from an interview on MSNBC’s ""Hardball with Chris Matthews,"" Pascrell says, ""Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas."" The ad abruptly turns to the winking, tuxedoed man as the narrator adds: ""Especially if you’re wealthy.""

The three-second clip featured in Rothman’s ad was pulled from a nearly eight-minute ""Hardball"" interview from Jan. 25, 2010. During that segment, Pascrell was discussing health care reform, not tax cuts.

In response to Matthews’ question about reaching a bipartisan deal on health care reform, here is Pascrell’s complete answer:

""I really believe that it can happen. And I believe that the president should try again to reach out to the other side. I know he tried to do (it) in the beginning. Mr. Boehner, who’s the leader (of the) Republicans in the House, he chose the path of saying, ‘Nah, our party’s not gonna support any of this.’ And it really puts the pressure on anybody on the other side who wants to think of some good (ideas). Republicans had great ideas. We had some bipartisan meetings...I liked some of their ideas, and they liked some of our ideas."" 
To read a transcript of the entire interview or watch it, go here.

So, Rothman is clearly wrong to suggest Pascrell was endorsing ""more tax cuts for the rich,"" when his statement was about Republicans’ ideas for health care reform.

Paul Swibinski, a senior adviser to the Rothman campaign, acknowledged in an e-mail that the clip was about health care, but argued it reinforces how ""Bill Pascrell has often caved in to Republicans and negotiated away what progressives stand for.""

Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy responded in an e-mail: ""Steve Rothman's claims to being a progressive fighter fly in the face of the facts and his constant negative attacks against Bill Pascrell have been consistently, directly contradicted by independent verifiers.""

Our ruling

In an attack ad from Rothman’s campaign, the narrator claims Pascrell ""wants more tax cuts for the rich."" Then the video suggests Pascrell admitted to supporting such tax cuts by showing a clip of him saying, ""Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas.""

But when Pascrell made those comments during a ""Hardball"" interview, the congressman was discussing efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise on health care reform. In fact, the phrase ""tax cuts"" was never mentioned during the entire interview.

Editing a political ad to distort the meaning behind an opponent’s comments is not just wrong, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Rob Portman says student loan money was used to cover health care reform
","
Americans have their reasons for liking or disliking health care reform and its mandate to purchase insurance. But Sen. Rob Portman mentioned one that was new to us during a conference call with reporters.

He was actually talking about student loans, but in answer to a question from WSPD radio in Toledo, Portman said:

""The truth is, by the way, you know part of the health care bill is paid for by the administration taking the difference of what (interest rate) they can borrow at, and what most students pay, and putting some of that money into the health care bill.""

He repeated that ""we took from students and paid for a new entitlement program we can't afford."" And he rephrased it by saying ""the health care bill was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system.""

Portman’s comments, made April 28, were in support of a Republican proposal to extend low-interest student loan rates (3.4 percent) for another year. Republican lawmakers would do that by taking money out of the 2010 health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the money would come from a  fund in the health bill that covers prevention and public health.

We’re not here to debate whether that’s good policy. But Portman, acknowledging Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander’s leadership role in the GOP proposal, suggested something fresh to our ears: the notion that Obamacare, as it is commonly called, used student loan money.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more.

Students once were considered a poor lending risk. To prime the pump and expand educational opportunities, the federal government in 1965 decided to guarantee student loans against default. The government also guaranteed a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. And the government paid additional fees to the banks for administration and collection of student loans.

This wound up providing a lucrative revenue stream for the banks, while putting millions of Americans through college.

But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, started looking at alternatives. What if the government cut out the middle man (the banks) and gave loans directly to students through their colleges’ financial aid offices? Those offices already helped process most loans anyway. By getting rid of the subsidies, the government could save billions and use the money for more financial aid for needy students, Democrats said.

Various pilot programs were tried. Some universities, including Ohio State, said they liked dealing directly with the government. But plenty of others liked the special attention private lenders gave them, and the private lenders spent millions lobbying Congress to keep the subsidy system.

This debate dragged on for years. Then in early 2010, Democrats found the opening they needed to permanently move away from subsidizing the lenders. It coincided with passage of the Affordable Care Act.

The Senate generally needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters and objections to legislation. Democrats lacked that number. So they decided to employ a seldom-used tactic involving budgets and government spending, known as ""reconciliation."" Reconciliation only requires 51 votes. That’s how Senate Democrats were able to pass a combined student loan-health care bill, the Reconciliation Act of 2010, on March 25, 2010, with 56 votes.

You might not have heard much about the student loan portion at the time, because health care, a monumental social initiative, consumed most of the oxygen in Washington. But the two were connected through the reconciliation bill, which is where we come back to Portman’s claim.

Did one component, student loans, help pay for health care? The answer is not as simple as it sounds.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government was going to save $58 billion from the student loan program, over a 10-year period, by eliminating the middle man. That would provide enough money to put an additional $36 billion into Pell grants and $3 billion more into several other programs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Even after these investments, the government would have $19 billion left, the CBO said.

So was this $19 billion going into Obamacare? That’s what Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, initially suggested when we first asked about Portman’s statement.

The problem with that assumption is that the CBO did not show it that way.

It showed the $19 billion as savings, or a net reduction in the federal deficit. And several budget experts we spoke with said that’s exactly where the $19 billion was going.

The CBO also showed $124 billion in additional savings from the health care portion of the reconciliation act, thanks to new revenue, taxes and projected savings on Medicare. Mangi was skeptical of this projection, as are other Republicans, saying the health care provisions are certain to cost much more than assumed in 2010, wiping out any savings. Where will the money come from then?

It’ll come in part from the money the government got by changing its student-loan program, she said. She also noted that some private lenders used to provide interest-rate reductions for borrowers, and new borrowers won’t have that option.  

That’s speculation, however, and such private-bank incentives to students became fewer after the 2008 financial crisis. Still, we sought out budget and education officials on this, and then we called Alexander’s office.

Alexander was secretary of education under President George H. W. Bush. His staff referred us to other CBO figures, but that just led to more dispute among budget experts over how to interpret the numbers. But then we found agreement -- from two key Senate offices on opposite sides of the aisle.

Alexander’s office drew our attention to a statement made by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a leader on education issues. On March 23, 2010, on the Senate floor Harkin said that by ending the subsidies to banks, the government would have more money for Pell grants and historically black colleges. He also said that $10 billion would go for debt reduction.

Notice that he said $10 billion? But wait -- wasn’t it supposed to be $19 billion, according to the CBO figures? So where did the other $9 billion go?

It went to pay for a portion of health care reform, Alexander’s staff insisted.

We turned to the staff of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Harkin chairs. And at last, there was common ground. Harkin indeed said $10 billion would go for debt reduction. The other $9 billion, said committee spokeswoman Justine Sessions, went to help pay for expansion of community health centers, prescription drug access, and consumer protections in insurance.

That’s $9 billion for health care out the student loan program.

With that, we return to Portman’s claim -- that health care reform ""was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system.""

Portman’s statement is partially accurate. The overall health care bill has hundreds of billions in features before revenue and tax offsets bring the costs down, if projections prove to be right. We’re not here to debate whether they will. Nine billion dollars is a tiny share. But Portman said ""in part,"" and that $9 billion is destined for health care, so he’s right there.

But he suggested this is at the expense of students. That’s a big leap, leaving out important detail and context. The combined student loan-health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow. It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid. What it reduced is the banks’ share.

""The money that was saved wasn't money that was going into education -- it was money that was subsidizing private banks,"" Sessions, of the education committee, said in an email. ""Period.""

On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD3D180>],/factchecks/2012/may/14/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-student-loan-money-was-used-cover/

Biden: Obama exerting more pressure against Iran
","
Vice President Joe Biden has been making a lot of news lately and his recent visit to the Atlanta area was no exception.

Biden came to Sandy Springs to give a speech at the national convention of the Rabbinical Assembly, an influential group of about 1,600 rabbis.

The Middle East, of course, was a main topic of the vice president’s speech. In particular, Iran, a perennial threat to stability in the region.

""When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran,"" Biden said. ""We were the problem.""

Some conservatives, who accuse the Obama administration of being apologists for America, responded quickly to Biden’s line that ""we were the problem"" -- an apparent shot at George W. Bush’s administration. One writer for the right-leaning National Review wrote an article arguing the vice president was wrong about the lack of international pressure on Iran prior to Democrat Barack Obama becoming president in 2009.

""[T]hroughout President Bush’s final year in office, diplomatic efforts generated new levels of pressure on Tehran,"" the Review article reported, referring to the Iranian capital.

So who’s right here?

Bush, a Republican, was worried about Iran, but his attention in the Middle East was primarily focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, countries where he ordered U.S. troops in military conflict. Obama has made ending combat in Afghanistan and Iraq among his top policies in the region. He’s also turned up the heat on Iran, which is said to be on the verge of developing nuclear weapons.

Since 2010, the United States and most of the world’s leading powers have approved several sanctions on Iran. Economic data on Iran is difficult to find, but there is consensus that United Nations sanctions and other forms of punishment are making an impact. The international pressure on Iran includes: 
According to U.S. Treasury and State Department officials, at least 80 major banks had committed not to finance exports to Iran or to process dollar transactions for Iranian banks. China and Russia, world powers who sometimes stray from the U.S.A.’s international game plan, have participated in varying degrees on pressuring Iran.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in late 2011 before Parliament that the current sanctions campaign was ""the heaviest economic onslaught on a nation in history.""

Okay, it appears the world is making life more difficult for the Iranian regime in the last two years. But what about Biden’s argument that the international community wasn’t as tough on Tehran before Obama took office.

Kyle Beardsley, an Emory University assistant professor with vast expertise on such matters, pointed out that as the National Review said, there were several United Nations resolutions against Iran during the latter years of the Bush administration.

The U.N. efforts during the Bush years included: 

He did add that the Obama administration has tried to apply more pressure on Iran because there is greater willingness on the part of Europe and other key states to implement tougher sanctions.

""It is true that multiple Security Council resolutions were passed during the Bush administration, but they only targeted specific individuals and companies involved in the Iranian nuclear program,"" Beardsley, whose research includes the influence of U.N. Security Council resolutions, told us via email. ""In contrast, U.N. Resolution 1929 (2010) imposes more general sanctions on Iranian arms, and the E.U. decided this year to impose an embargo on Iranian oil. A number of other countries have also increased their own bilateral sanctions against Iran in recent years.""

Biden would have had a strong case for high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he said what appeared to be his main point: the Obama administration has prodded the rest of the world to be tougher on Iran. But there is a disconnect with what the vice president actually said and U.N. resolutions passed against Iran during the Bush administration. The resolutions seem to be a little more than ""virtually no international pressure on Iran.""  We rate Biden’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC824C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/14/joe-biden/biden-obama-exerting-more-pressure-against-iran/

Email says rule change by Gov. Scott Walker ‘slashed’ salaries of best-educated public school teachers
","
Under Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 changes to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees, teachers and many other public workers are now paying more for pensions and health care.

But a chain email making the rounds alleges that Walker quietly -- and drastically -- cut salaries even more for the best-educated teachers in April 2012 with the stroke of a pen that changed an administrative rule.

The claim made the rounds after a highly confusing episode in which Walker reshaped a rule, thereby lowering by some 30 percent the inflation-based raises that public unions can negotiate under Act 10, which included Walker’s limits on unions.

The rule change would not use an individual's actual salary as a ""base salary"" to calculate raises and would exclude factors such as whether a teacher has a graduate degree, the Journal Sentinel reported on April 20, 2012.

Days later, the chain email began -- subject line: Scott Walker and Max teacher Pay -- making the rounds. It echoed allegations by a top labor leader, Marty Beil, that Walker’s rule went even further -- actually drastically cutting the base salaries in question.

Readers asked us to get to the bottom of the email, which began:

""I have some heart-stopping news that I believe has devastating
consequences for all active and retired public employees.""

The email said the rule would prohibit school districts from including add-on pay for advanced degrees in the wage scales written into any of its labor contracts. It claimed teachers would be hit the hardest, even providing an example -- Sarah Teacher.

""Let’s say Sarah Teacher has a Masters degree, 24 hours of college credit and 12 years experience. The most Sarah can be paid under her current contract is $52,927.

""Under the new rule, the maximum Sarah will be able to earn in future contracts is $38,167, the maximum for a teacher who has the minimum educational requirements but many years of experience.""

The email claimed Sarah Teacher's salary will be ""slashed by a third"" -- perhaps even more as cash-strapped districts squeeze staff even tighter.

What’s really going on?

Walker’s union legislation blocks school districts from including educational add-on pay in labor contracts. So it wasn’t the more recent rule change that did that.

In addition, there is no dispute the rule change limits the size of the pool for wage increases that school districts and unions will negotiate over.

So, in this item, we’ll focus on the heart of the email’s claim -- that Walker’s action mandated big pay cuts for teachers.

We talked to lawyers with the employment relations commission, which approved Walker’s modification of the rule. We also consulted with a labor lawyer and examined statements by labor officials.

They all agreed: The rule does not cut the current wages of teachers -- or require or direct that to happen.

The power to set salaries lies with local school districts, not Walker or the employment relations commission.

Some argue the rule makes it much easier for local districts to make big cuts.

This comes down to where the starting point is set for public employees. Act 10 prohibited bargaining over pay schedules -- those grids that award teachers additional pay based on higher education and seniority. It left intact bargaining over inflationary increases to base wages -- the salary level not including educational bonuses and other add-ons.

The first version of the rule -- before Walker’s changes -- made clear that a teacher’s current total salary would be the starting point.

Walker’s changes in the rule put that in doubt, with experts disagreeing on how this will play out.

Some say the new rule makes it easier for school officials to cut into existing salaries without any collective bargaining.

But they say districts also will be free -- outside of narrow labor talks on inflationary raises -- to give teachers additional pay for higher education outside any labor contract. That could make teachers ""whole"" if districts chose on their own, outside of labor talks, to honor previous pay for higher education.

The other camp says the new rule does not mean current salaries can be ignored when unions sit down with management to discuss wages.

Eventually, the employment relations commission or a court will likely have to settle that issue, which also affects technical college teachers.

Our conclusion

A chain email says an administrative rule modified by Gov. Scott Walker amounted to him slashing teacher salaries.

We can’t predict the future, so there is no way to know how individual districts will approach teacher pay in the years ahead under this rule and Act 10.

But it’s clear that the rule Walker reshaped does not give him authority over base pay, and does not mandate pay cuts for teachers.

We rate that claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC0DD80>],/factchecks/2012/may/13/chain-email/email-says-rule-change-gov-scott-walker-slashed-sa/

Barbara Buono blasts Chris Christie’s “New Jersey Comeback” with job statistics
","
A Democratic lawmaker armed with bleak job numbers panned Gov. Chris Christie for championing a ""New Jersey Comeback.""

""Comeback to what?"" state Sen. Barbara Buono -- who is often mentioned as a potential 2013 gubernatorial candidate -- asked during a May 7 radio interview.

""Right before he gave his State of the State address he released a YouTube trailer and he was talking about New Jersey's comeback has begun,"" Buono said on The Dom Giordano Show on 1210 WPHT-AM. ""Maybe I'm missing something but comeback to what? You know the most recent jobs report [shows] that New Jersey lost over 11,000 private-sector jobs in March. Comeback to being one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs. Being the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation. I don't know how that plays in a poll but I can tell you it doesn't sit right with New Jerseyans.""

Though Buono initially cited private-sector job loss, she said her comments referred to overall jobs.

Either way, she’s wrong to claim that New Jersey was ""one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs"" in March, PolitiFact New Jersey found. While New Jersey’s national ranking differs slightly in March between total jobs and private-sector jobs, the state fared poorly by both measures. But highlighting job loss in one month ignores a larger trend: the state has added jobs in the past year.

Buono’s office provided an April 20 blog post from the liberal New Jersey Policy Perspective to back her claims. The post said New Jersey ""was one of only eight states in the country to lose jobs in March."" That’s not true. New Jersey Policy Perspective corrected the post after we contacted them about it. New Jersey and 19 other states lost jobs in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The unemployment rate increased in eight states, but other factors -- such as the size of the labor force -- impact that measure. New Jersey’s unemployment rate remained at 9 percent in March.

So Buono’s wrong on that point. Her other claim isn't as straightforward.

In March, New Jersey lost 11,600 private-sector jobs, more than any other state.

But Buono said her comments referred to total jobs. Because of gains in government employment, the state’s total job loss was 8,600 in March. Only Ohio lost more jobs overall that month.

Since a state’s population can skew rankings of net figures, it’s also important to note percentage growth or loss when talking about jobs.

Wyoming and Maine fared worse than New Jersey by that measure for private-sector jobs and total jobs.

So New Jersey had the ""highest loss of jobs in the nation"" in one category, but not the one Buono said she was referring to. Still, the state’s job loss ranks among the worst in the nation in March by any measure.

Looking at the larger employment picture in New Jersey, Buono’s statement ignores the fact that the state has added 38,300 total jobs in the last year, from March 2011 to March 2012. The state posted job gains in nine of the last 12 months.

Buono said in an e-mail: ""Regarding your objection to drawing the inference discrediting the governor's claims of NJ ‘comeback’ let me say this. Job loss is one of the most important indicators of any economic recovery. The figures I used contrast with the governor's constant refrain of a ‘NJ Comeback.’""

Our ruling

While criticizing Christie, Buono said New Jersey was ""one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs"" and ""the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation.""

Though she preceded those comments by citing private-sector job loss in March, Buono said her statements referred to overall job loss in that month.

Either way, 20 states lost jobs in March, not eight.

New Jersey ranked, in both net and percentage terms, among the worst states for job loss in March. But in the last year the state added jobs.

On the Truth-O-Meter, this statement rates Mostly False.

Immigration enforcement advocate Terry Gorman says giving undocumented Rhode Island high school graduates a college tuition price break will still make them unemployable
","
As a result of a decision last year by the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, students who are in the state illegally who graduate from Rhode Island high schools are eligible for the in-state tuition rate if they decide to go to a state college or university. The ruling sparked a furor among advocates of strict enforcement of immigration laws.

Two bills -- one that would reverse the board’s decision and one that would make the policy state law -- were the subject of an April 24, 2012, hearing before the House Committee on Finance.

William T. ""Terry"" Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, argued for reversing the regents’ policy, saying the state would be subsidizing a college education for people who aren't employable because they are in the country illegally.

""Please keep in mind that these students, when they're attending high school, they're illegal aliens. When they graduate, they're illegal aliens. When they enter college, they're illegal aliens. Because of that status, they're not allowed to get a job to help pay their way through college. They're not allowed to get a driver's license to drive back and forth to college. And when we've provided them that four years of in-state tuition, they're not allowed to get a job,"" Gorman said. ""They can't get a job at Textron, they can't get a job at CVS, they can't get a job at Gilbane, they can't get a job at Dunkin’ Donuts, and they can't get a job at Burger King because of their status. And we provided them with four years of a college education.""

He again emphasized that point later in the hearing: ""When these students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job. How does that help the economy?""

One could argue that it's good to have the state's smartest students -- whether legal or illegal -- move into the Rhode Island work force.

But will those undocumented college grads really end up unemployed anyway?

We were particularly curious because three of the 12 states that have passed laws to provide in-state tuition for undocumented high school graduates -- California, New Mexico and Texas -- are places where the illegal immigration issue is particularly prominent, thanks to their borders with Mexico.

Are those states doing something different, allowing companies to tap the best-educated, motivated undocumented residents?

The answer is no, said Laura Vazquez, a legislative analyst for the National Council of La Raza, a Washington, D.C.-based Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. She said the situation is the same throughout the United States. ""When they graduate, we don't get the benefit of having this educated group of people who are eager and ready to contribute fully.""

They do find work. ""Some of them are working under the table"" under poor conditions. Some work for family. A number of students go to law school or enroll in Ph.D. programs, she said. But companies can't hire them because the government requires that all workers be checked for employment eligibility.

Graduates could seek employment overseas, but ""a lot of these kids feel American through and through and want to practice their skills here,"" Vazquez said. And if they were to leave the country to take an overseas job they won't be allowed back in for a long time. Immigration law says, in general, if you've been in the United States illegally for more than one year after reaching age 18, once you leave the country you are banned from reentering for 10 years.

In a few cases, undocumented people who have been scheduled for deportation have gotten a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security, which allows them to seek a work permit. But the DHS ""is very stingy with it,"" she said.

Other immigration experts told us the same thing: Gorman is essentially correct.

""It is true that undocumented college graduates are legally barred from working. The only exception is in rare cases they have been able to obtain contract work provided there is no employer/employee relationship,"" said Kent Wong, director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Gorman sent us a link to a Huffington Post story about Iliana Guadalupe Perez, a mathematician and undocumented immigrant, who has written a free online guide detailing how undocumented college graduates can find work. Her advice was also to seek work as an independent contractor where proof of citizenship isn't required.

When we asked Gorman what was going on in the border states, he suggested that graduates may be able to get jobs because enforcement was lax. He said a source in San Diego reported that immigration officials ""are not checking on hardly anything regarding illegal aliens here right now, least of all the status of recent college grads applying for jobs. She said the governor just authorized state scholarships for the illegal alien students.

""I also spoke with Jim Gilchrist from the Minuteman Project and he echoed basically the same sentiments. He did say there has been more employer audits by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] but not of the type that would be looking for illegal alien college grads,"" Gorman said in an e-mail. (The Minuteman Project pushes for stronger enforcement of immigration laws.)

""I also spoke with the Policy Director of The Center for Immigration Studies and she said she has never heard of any enforcement efforts in Texas or California regarding illegal alien college grads,"" said Gorman. The center is a research group that opposes illegal immigration and wants less legal immigration into the United States.

However, given the strictness of the law, a special effort to focus on college graduates may not be necessary.

Michael Olivas, director of the Institute of Higher Education Law & Governance at the University of Houston, said the why-give-them-a-tuition-break-when-they-can't-get-a-job argument is a diversion from the real problem: children brought to the United States, sometimes at a very young age, ""are left in this netherworld where they can neither work nor be licensed"" once they become adults.

And when their inability to find work is used to try to prevent them from being eligible for the same in-state educational opportunities as their peers, ""it’s the worst kind of misdirection. It's hiding the larger issue,"" said Olivas, a proponent of the federal DREAM Act, which would give such students a path to citizenship.

Our ruling

Terry Gorman, during testimony on the question of whether to let Rhode Island's undocumented high school graduates take advantage of in-state tuition rates, said, ""When these students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job.""

The experts we spoke with said he's generally correct, although they can, in a few cases, be hired as independent contractors.

Over all, we rate the claim as True.

Rick Scott talks up Florida's golfing creds ahead of Players Championship
","
Gov. Rick Scott considers himself Florida’s promoter-in-chief.

So it makes sense that he would use a TV interview on the opening day of the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach to show off just how important golf is to Florida.

""Golf is big for the state,"" Scott told Action News Jacksonville on May 10, 2012. ""1,200 golf courses. I think it’s 58 million rounds of golf played a year in Florida. … We’ve got 44 percent of all the travel golf in the country here. 5 million people come to Florida just for golf. It’s big business. It creates a lot of jobs.""

Look, we’re not all politics all the time. We like to unwind and embrace our Florida side, too. We decided some golf-related research was in order.

There’s no doubt the sport is huge for Florida. Experts we consulted agree it’s the No. 1 destination for golf in the world.

Scott received this information from a 2004 National Golf Foundation report, spokesman Lane Wright said. We tried to get a copy but couldn’t locate one.

Scott is mostly on the mark with his statements, but we found some rough patches that we’ll explain one by one.

1,200 golf courses: Scott is close. Play Florida, the state’s golf marketing program, puts the number of facilities a little lower, at 1,056.

Did you catch how we used ""facilities"" instead of ""courses""? That’s because one facility may have multiple courses. Take the Innisbrook Golf Resort in Palm Harbor, which has four courses but counts as one facility.

For that reason, the real number of courses is probably higher than 1,200, but ""that’s the number we use,"" said Gary Jones, who manages Play Florida.

58 million rounds played a year: The number of rounds played each year is the barometer of the popularity of golf, said Tom Stine, co-founder of Golf Datatech, which conducts market research for the industry.

It seems the governor caught wind of some expired talking points. The number of rounds was 59 million in 2000, according to a University of Florida study.

In 2011, the number of rounds was 41 million, Stine said. That’s a slight uptick from 2010, but it still trails the annual number of rounds before the recession set in, which is probably where Scott is drawing his number, he said.

Round counts are up for 2012 in Florida and the country, he said. The reason is lots of sunny weather nationwide -- good news for golf lovers but bad for people who prefer skis.

Florida gets 44 percent of all travel golf in the country: This is the hardest one to track down. Stine said he doesn’t know what Scott means here, and that he’s skeptical all the golf in California, the Carolinas, Georgia, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan (in the summer) comprises just 56 percent of ""travel golf.""

""It’s one of those numbers if you don’t attach the methodology for it, how in the heck do you know what that means?"" Stine said.

Jones also couldn’t be sure.

""I can tell you that it’s over 40 percent,"" he said, citing a university study he could not find by our deadline. 
If we get more information on this point, we'll update our report. 

5 million people come here just for golf: Scott is close here but misses a distinction between the two types of out-of-state golfers, Jones said.

On one hand, there are visitors who come to Florida just to play golf. There are about 1.5 million of these people, Jones said. They play an average of 5.2 rounds.

Then there are ""amenity golfers"" who come to Florida for reasons other than playing golf but fit it in anyway. Think of fathers making a break for it on an Orlando family vacation. Jones estimates there are 3.6 million of these golfers, which play an average of 1.2 rounds.

Combining these out-of-state golfers (1.5 million + 3.6 million) amounts to 5.1 million people. A chunk of these people, though, came to Florida for other reasons, which isn’t exactly what Scott said.

Our ruling

Golf is a big deal for the Sunshine State -- and now we know that more rays equal more rounds. Still, Scott needs to finesse his points before getting our hole-in-one rating. We rate his golf rundown Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA95A80>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/rick-scott/rick-scott-talks-floridas-golfing-creds-ahead-play/

Will Clackamas County taxpayers save $68,000 over four years if candidate declines PERS?
","
In a previous item, PolitiFact Oregon ruled True a statement by John Ludlow, a candidate for Clackamas County Commission chair, that he is the only person in the four-way race who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System. He faces Clackamas County Commission chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county commissioner Paul Savas and state Rep. Dave Hunt in Tuesday’s election.

Snubbing PERS is a nice symbolic pledge for someone running on a platform of limited government. It also won’t hurt Ludlow, who is 63 years old, as much as it would someone who is further away from retirement.

But the next part of Ludlow’s claim really caught our attention. In a Facebook post dated March 30, he wrote, ""I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $30,000 per year that would have been paid on my behalf."" (The post was changed Tuesday; we’ll explain below.)

That sounded like a lot of money saved, given that a county commissioner’s annual salary is $81,000. We checked it out. In doing so, Ludlow clarified to PolitiFact Oregon and on Facebook that by declining PERS, ""the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf.""

We asked Ludlow why he had claimed $30,000 in savings a year, and now $68,000 over four years. He said it’s hard getting solid numbers from the Public Employees Retirement System. ""I am now satisfied that the last numbers quoted by me are the correct numbers,"" he wrote us.

Hmmm. We don’t think politicians, aspiring or otherwise, should claim savings without evidence. That’s careless.

But let’s get back to how much county taxpayers will save should Ludlow decline retirement benefits. The county position pays $80,868 a year

This is how public retirement payments work: Every employer pays a ""contribution rate,"" depending on the type of employer and type of employee. The rates are set in advance. In the case of Clackamas County, the employer contribution rate is 11.99 percent for general service workers for the 2011-13 budget period.

The 11.99 percent includes 6.13 percent that the employer puts in for a member’s retirement, plus 5.86 percent to cover the system’s ""unfunded actuarial liability,"" or the money needed to pay for current and future retirees. In addition, the county pays -- or ""picks up"" -- the 6 percent the employee is required to contribute on his or her behalf.

That adds up to $14,500 a year. But David Crosley, a spokesman for PERS, said the actual amount of money saved -- or avoided -- should Ludlow decline is closer to $9,800 a year, or a little more than $39,000 over four years.

That’s because the county needs to kick in for unfunded actuarial liability anyway, regardless of whether Ludlow declines PERS for himself. ""That amount gets spread over fewer people,"" Crosley said. ""They’re not saving that in the long term.""

But let’s look at this from the county’s perspective, which is what Ludlow relies on. Marc Gonzales, the county’s finance director, confirmed the county budgets about $17,247 a year per commissioner for retirement-related costs.

Why is it higher? In part, because the county calculates the figure with longer-term employees in mind, and they have higher retirement costs. Tim Heider, a spokesman for Clackamas County, wrote in an email that ""the county would not incur any PERS cost for an employee who declines enrollment.""

So we’ve gone from $30,000 a year to roughly $17,000 a year to $9,800 a year. It’s undeniable that Ludlow will save taxpayers money by declining to join PERS, should he win. But he’s off on how much, and whether it would have been paid on his behalf.

It’s certainly not the $30,000 a year he originally claimed. It may be $17,000 as he now claims, but that’s because the county has budgeted generously. (Ludlow as a new member will not cost taxpayers as much as employees who have been in the system for a long time.) The Public Employees Retirement System estimates money that would have gone to him is closer to $10,000 a year.

Ludlow’s revised statement is partially true but missing information. We rate it Half True",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC75C300>],/factchecks/2012/may/11/john-ludlow/will-clackamas-county-taxpayers-save-68000-over-fo/
