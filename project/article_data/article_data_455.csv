A made-up quote goes global
","They have online names like fiberguy, dittoheadAZ and Hank the Tank. And they're among scores who have made blog postings and sent e-mails passing on a quote they attribute to Sen. Barack Obama: ""My friends, we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world. I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it."" The quote is almost always accompanied by a barb that asks why the candidate would want to change something that is so great.
 
It appears, however, that Obama never made the remark. It originated in a Jan. 28, 2008, blog post on The Corner, a blog at National Review Online. The poster was Mark Steyn, the Canadian columnist, author and conservative commentator, who was passing along a made-up, tongue-in-cheek stump speech crafted by a ""correspondent of mine."" Steyn, whose work appears in many newspapers and is a frequent guest on conservative radio and TV, has his own Web site.
 
Said Victoria Ayrsmith, an assistant editor at SteynOnline.com: ""The alleged quote is, in fact, a letter from one of Mark's readers, who devised a parodic all-purpose stump speech written in the aftermath of Iowa and New Hampshire when Senators McCain and Clinton were claiming to be 'agents of change.' There is no mention of Barack Obama anywhere in the item at all.""
 
If fact, it was attributed to no one, not even its intended targets, McCain and Clinton.
 
Ayrsmith continued: ""The letter was submitted to the Mailbox page at our Web site, but Mark thought it a funny enough joke to merit a stand-alone post at National Review. It is the inspired creation of one of his readers north of the border â€” John Gross, who lives in the Province of Quebec. Mr. Gross certainly deserves credit, if only because, with all the attention it's getting, it seems likely to be in the next edition of Bartlett's.""
 
Some of the confusion may have come from the headline Steyn placed on his original post, ""Barracking Barack.""
 
We contacted Obama's campaign. But on a week when his staff was consumed with fallout from Obama's ties to Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., they seemed unconcerned about the inquiry. A staffer who asked not to be named said, ""I don't think he said this but I'm not 100 percent sure.""
 
We conducted a thorough electronic search of all print stories as well as transcripts of television and radio programs, news conferences and press briefings. There is no record that Obama or any other candidate publicly uttered the words in question. More evidence: A Google search of the quote finds no mention of it before Steyn's Jan. 28 post.
 
Our fact-checking cousins at Snopes.com also looked into the quote and the claims that Obama said it. They found them false.
 
We'll second that. In fact, it's so false it's Pants on Fire wrong.

"['National', 'Religion', 'John McCain']","
Costumes, yes, but not Halloween
","Sen. John McCain's weeklong overseas trip to Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Britain and France in March 2008 was a bumpy one for accuracy. Thankfully, he had Sen. Joe Lieberman for a traveling companion.
 
During a visit to Israel, McCain was making a somber point about the strain of Hamas rocket attacks on Israel when he dropped in a bit of a cultural gaffe, likening the Jewish holiday of Purim to Halloween.
 
""Nine hundred rocket attacks in less than three months, an average of one every one to two hours,"" McCain said, during a news conference with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on March 19, 2008. ""Obviously this puts an enormous and hard to understand strain on the people here, especially the children. As they celebrate their version of Halloween here, they are somewhere close to a 15-second warning, which is the amount of time they have from the time the rocket is launched to get to safety. That's not a way for people to live obviously.""
 
When Lieberman had a chance to speak at the news conference, he took the fall for McCain's mistake.
 
""I had a brief exchange with one of the mothers whose children was in there in a costume for Purim,"" said Lieberman, who became the first Jewish candidate on the presidential ticket for a major American political party when he ran with Al Gore in 2000. ""And it's my fault that I said to Senator McCain that this is the Israeli version of Halloween. It is in the sense because the kids dress up and it's a very happy holiday and actually it is in the sense that the sweets are very important of both holidays.""
 
Purim is a minor Jewish holiday whose roots come from a story in the Book of Esther in the Bible. According to the story, Esther was a beauty pageant winner who became queen to King Ahasuerus of Persia, but kept her Jewishness a secret.
 
When the king's villainous minister, Haman, persuaded the king to wipe out all the Jews in the kingdom, Esther's uncle Mordecai persuaded Esther to reveal her Jewish identity to the king, and plead with him to spare her people. The king had Haman killed and elevated Mordecai to minister.
 
""It is a story that teaches about standing up for who you are and standing up for one's community,"" said Rabbi Michael Torop of Temple Beth-El in St. Petersburg, and president of the Pinellas County Board of Rabbis. ""It's also about standing up against hatred and injustice.""
 
During Purim, Jewish people often hold a costume parade and re-enact the story, Torop said. People sometimes dress up as kings, queens and villians from the story, but the custom has expanded into a wider variety of costumes as well (though it does not include ghouls, witches and other scary costumes commonly seen at Halloween). And friends often exchange a plate or basket of sweets, usually to include a specific pastry called hamantashen.
 
""The only way in which Purim is like Halloween is in the wearing of costumes,"" said Torop. ""At that point, the similarities end.""
 
Torop said he doesn't find McCain's comment offensive, but says it shows ""this is one person who doesn't get it. He doesn't really understand (Purim's) meaning and its message.""
 
Which would be fine, Torop said, but when someone decides to make a public comment about someone else's faith or religion, they ought to at least understand a bit about it.
 
Later, McCain tried to smooth things over, saying, ""Could I just say that I understand this is the holiday of Hadassah, otherwise known as Esther.""
 
Lieberman's wife is named Hadassah. That's the Hebrew name of Esther, Torop said, explaining the joke McCain appeared to be making.
 
On a Political Gaffe scale of 1 to 10, with a one being John Kerry referring to the Green Bay Packers' hallowed home as ""Lambert Field"" and Dan Quayle telling that poor 6th-grader to add an ""e"" to the end of potato being a 15, we'd rate McCain's as maybe a two.
 
He gets a bit of a pass because he apparently got bad info from his Jewish tour guide, Lieberman. And inasmuch as both holidays involve getting dressed up, it's somewhat understandable. But still, it's False.

Iran and al-Qaida don't agree on religion
","We're not trying to pile on Sen. John McCain over his misstatement on the link between Iran and al-Qaida. Maybe he was confused for a moment. He did correct himself quickly. Still, it's worth exploring why McCain's statement is wrong.
 
""It's common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al-Qaida is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran; that's well known. And it's unfortunate,"" McCain said during a news conference in Jordan.
 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who was also at the news conference, spoke softly in McCain's ear, and McCain corrected himself to say ""Islamic extremists"" were going into Iran.
 
Most experts do not believe Iran is helping al-Qaida because their respective religious affiliations are at odds with each other. Both sides are Muslim, but the Iranian government is Shiite while al-Qaida is Sunni. And al-Qaida adheres to a fundamentalist form of Sunni Islam that considers Shiites to be apostates. It's not likely the two groups would work together, certainly not ""common knowledge.""
 
In Iraq, both al-Qaida and Shiite extremists are commonly believed to be committing acts of violence. But it was al-Qaida that was behind the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, not Shiite extremists.
 
McCain is not the first elected official to get these differences wrong. In 2006, Silvestre Reyes, the new Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, couldn't correctly identify whether al-Qaida was Sunni or Shiite. He was asked about the issue by

Congressional Quarterly

columnist Jeff Stein.
 
Stein, who writes the SpyTalk column for CQ, said he began asking national security officials if they knew the difference between Sunnis and Shiites, and which countries were on which side, when he suspected they didn't know what they were talking about. Many gave wrong answers. Some claimed it was a ""gotcha"" question, but Stein disagreed, particularly mentioning the division between Iran and al-Qaida.
 
""It seems silly to have to argue that officials responsible for counterterrorism should be able to recognize opportunities for pitting these rivals against each other,"" Stein wrote in an opinion piece for the

New York Times

in 2005.
 
The difference between Sunnis and Shiites goes back 1,400 years, to the founding of the Islamic religion. After the death of the Prophet Mohammed, his followers split over who should be the next leader: a relative of the prophet or a nonrelated successor chosen on merit. Those who wanted a relative became Shiites, while those who chose the nonrelative eventually became Sunnis.
 
Today, Shiites represent about 15 percent of 1.3-billion Muslims worldwide. Iran is predominantly Shiite, while Iraq has a slight Shiite majority. There are also significant numbers of Shiites in Lebanon and Syria. (Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, is an extremist Shiite group.)
 
The rest of the Islamic world is mostly Sunni, though many Sunni countries have Shiite minorities. Saudi Arabia has an estimated 4-million Shiites out of a total population of 27-million, and Shiites there face discrimination. Under Saddam Hussein, Sunnis were the ruling class of Iraq, even though the country was majority Shiite. That division has hurt U.S. efforts to unify the country.
 
McCain recovered quickly, but we still rate his statement False for saying that everyone knows Iran and al-Qaida are working together.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Campaign to Defend America']","
No mandate, no universal care
","After attacking Sen. John McCain and President George W. Bush on

Iraq, taxes and energy,

an ad from the Campaign to Defend America finally turns to health care.
 
""Absolutely no plan for universal health care. McSame as Bush.""
 
Universal health care has been much debated in the Democratic primary campaign, but hardly mentioned on the Republican side. The consensus among health care experts is that to achieve universal health care â€” the intention to cover every person with no exceptions â€” there must be a legal requirement for care, such as

a mandate for individuals to buy insurance

. In the Democratic primary campaign,

Sen. Hillary Clinton supports an individual mandate, while Sen. Barack Obama opposes it

on the grounds that its implementation could penalize the working poor.
 
Bush does not support any sort of health care mandate, nor does McCain.
 
""On health care we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.,"" Bush said on March 13, 2008, at a Republican Congresional Committee dinner.
 
At a health care forum on Oct. 31, 2007, hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, McCain said he opposed mandates, even while discussing plans to improve access to health care.
 
""I don't think that there should be a mandate for every American to have health insurance. I think that one of our goals should be that every American own their own home. But I'm not going to mandate that every American own their own home,"" McCain said.
 
McCain does have a health care plan, but there's no clause for making it apply to everyone and therefore universal. So we find this claim to be True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Campaign to Defend America']","
Both millionaires; McCain supports Bush's cuts
","An ad goes after Sen. John McCain for being just like President George W. Bush, hitting McCain on

Iraq, oil companies and health care.

It also criticizes him on tax policy.
 
""A millionaire who's for tax cuts for millionaires. McSame as Bush,"" the ad states.
 
It's true that Bush and McCain are both millionaires, with McCain being somewhat wealthier. Bush's net worth in 2006 was between $7.6-million and $20.1-million, based on his personal financial disclosures required by law and analyzed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
 
McCain, meanwhile, is worth somewhere between $27.8-million and $45-million. (Sen. Hillary Clinton's net worth is between $10.4-million and $51-million, while Sen. Barack Obama's is between $456,012 and $1.1-million.) So McCain and Bush are both millionaires, and that part of the statement is correct.
 
We couldn't find any proposals John McCain supports that offer new tax cuts for millionaires, so we suspect this is a reference to McCain's support of the Bush tax cuts.
 
Bush's tax cuts lowered rates across the board for those who pay federal income taxes, so they benefited both millionaire and nonmillionaire taxpayers. But data compiled from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that millionaires saw the most sizable drops to their tax rates measured as a share of income. Those tax cuts will expire during the next presidential administration unless Congress acts to keep them in place.
 
McCain actually opposed the Bush tax cuts before changing his mind and supporting them now. He said the reason for his change of heart is that rescinding the tax cuts would be the equivalent of a tax increase after they had been in effect for so long. (Both Obama and Clinton want to roll back the Bush tax cuts for higher incomes.)
 
If you're trying to identify the candidate who supports the Bush tax cuts, McCain is your man. But we're concerned that the ad leaves the impression that McCain advocates new, additional tax cuts for millionaires rather than keeping the present situation in place. For that reason, we knock this claim down one peg on the Truth-O-Meter and find it Mostly True.

McCain voted against Bush's energy bill
","An ad from the Campaign to Defend America attacks Sen. John McCain as being the same as President George W. Bush on a number of issues, including

Iraq, taxes and health care

. It also bashes the two on energy policy.
 
""Oil companies, they get tax breaks while we pay at the pump. McSame as Bush,"" the ad states.
 
The Bush administration's signature energy initiative was the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a major piece of legislation that included subsidies and incentives for several sectors of the energy industry, including oil companies. It was the first national energy legislation in more than a decade, and the Bush administration worked for several years to get it passed. We ruled previously that

the bill contained significant measures to encourage clean energy

.
 
To be sure, the bill still had its detractors. Some people felt it included too many incentives for industry and too little to help consumers.
 
Those detractors included McCain.
 
""This bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country,"" he said in a statement his Senate office issued at the time. ""The handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for the people of Arizona. I cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency, security, and energy independence.""
 
The statement noted that McCain liked the plan's reliability standards and incentives for new refinery capacity, but concluded that the bad outweighed the good.
 
McCain also said he opposed it because it might make pump prices higher with its mandates for the increased use of ethanol.
 
On the final vote on the bill, McCain was one of 26 senators who voted against it. (

Hillary Clinton also opposed it while Barack Obama voted for it.

)
The McSame ad doesn't mention this legislation specifically, but it was a priority of the Bush administration and a notable source of tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. McCain opposed it. You can't call them the ""McSame"" for such a significant difference. For this reason, we find the statement False.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Campaign to Defend America']","
Bush and McCain agree on troops in Iraq
","An advertisement uses the refrain ""McSame as Bush"" to criticize Sen. John McCain for taking the same positions as President George W. Bush. It starts with Iraq and then goes on to

taxes, energy and health care.

 
On Iraq, the ad says, ""A trillion dollars in Iraq over the next 10 years.
McSame as Bush.""
 
We have a few issues with this statement, though it gets its larger point correct.
 
The Congressional Budget Office, at the request of Congress, came up with estimates for how much it would cost to keep troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan for the next 10 years. The CBO estimated it would cost from about $480-billion to just over $1-trillion, depending on the number of troops. The analysis makes clear that troop levels in Iraq drive the dollar amount higher. The higher estimate assumes troop levels of at least 75,000 through 2013, with the number decreasing through 2017.
 
But those are troop levels to which neither Bush nor McCain has publicly committed. McCain has said troops should stay as long as needed but that specific troop levels should be dictated by conditions on the ground and the advice of the military. Bush, meanwhile, has declined to speculate on future troop levels, saying it will be up to the next president and leaders of Iraq.
 
Still, Bush and McCain seem to be on the same page on Iraq about not withdrawing troops rapidly. McCain has said troops could remain in Iraq for many years, comparing the situation to continuing U.S. presence in South Korea or Japan. When Bush endorsed McCain, he said, ""The good news about our candidate is he'll be a new president, a man of character and courage, but he's not going to change when it comes to taking on the enemy.""
 
We find the ""McSame"" ad fudges the cost in Iraq by not taking into account that the $1-trillion CBO estimate includes future spending in Afghanistan as well. But the ad makes a larger point that Bush and McCain agree on their philosophy for handling the Iraq war and the withdrawal of troops. We find the statement to be Mostly True.

"['National', 'Israel', 'Tennessee Republican Party']","
Group not controversial
","A news release from the Tennessee Republican Party titled ""Anti-Semites for Obama"" seeks to cast doubt on Sen. Barack Obama's public pronouncements of support for Israel, in part, by noting Obama's role with the Woods Fund, a Chicago grantmaking foundation whose goal is to ""increase opportunities for disadvantaged people.""
 
The release says: ""The board of a nonprofit organization on which Obama served as a paid director ... granted funding to a controversial Arab group that mourns the establishment of Israel as a 'catastrophe.' ""
 
Deborah Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, said Obama was, in fact, a director from 1994 through 2001, when the board approved a $40,000 grant to the Arab American Action Network for ""community organizing.""
 
The source for the allegations can be traced to a Feb. 24, 2008, article written by Aaron Klein for WorldNetDaily, an Internet publication.
 
The story takes issue with the founder of AAAN, Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University professor who is ""a harsh critic of Israel and has made statements supportive of Palestinian terror."" The article also notes that the AAAN co-sponsored an art exhibit that featured ""works related to what some Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe' of Israel's founding in 1948"" (although the exhibit came years after Obama left the Woods Fund board).
 
Other blogs note that in a July 2006 interview, AAAN's executive director, Hatem Abudayyeh, referred to the ""Israeli government and its military killing machine.""
 
Abudayyeh has been bombarded with media calls from the likes of

Time

and

Newsweek.

In an interview with PolitiFact, he dismissed the WorldNet article and others that have parroted it as misguided attempts by ""marginal right wing, anti-Muslim"" Internet voices to try to discredit Obama.
 
The AAAN has no foreign policy agenda, Abudayyeh said. It is a nonprofit ""community-based organization working to improve the social, economic, and political conditions of Arab immigrants and Arab-Americans in the Chicago metropolitan area."" The AAAN provides Chicago-based adult education, social services, youth development programs, domestic violence prevention and ""community empowerment"" through community organizing, activism and leadership development, Abudayyeh said.
 
There are hundreds of organizations in the Chicago area that serve many different communities, he said, and ""individuals within those organizations have different political viewpoints on domestic and foreign policy."" But those viewpoints have no bearing on the services provided by the organization, he said.
 
Louise Cainkar, an associate professor of sociology at Marquette University, formerly served on the AAAN board and specifically remembers the 2001 grant from the Woods Fund.
 
""It was after the Sept. 11 attacks,"" said Cainkar. ""Many Arab-Americans were being victimized by hate crimes. It was a hostile environment. That was an essential grant to cope with what community members were facing.""
 
Money was used to educate Arab-Americans about their civil rights, how to report hate crimes to law enforcement and to organize the community.
 
Chicago has the country's largest Palestinian-American community, said Cainkar, who is writing a book about the Arab-American experience after 9/11. Many of them are critical of Israeli government policies, she said.
 
""Does the organization takes sides? No,"" she said. ""Do individuals? I'm sure they do.
 
""AAAN is a community organization and they are careful about not getting involved in anything with foreign policy.""
 
Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, called it ""pretty ridiculous"" to suggest the AAAN promotes anti-Israeli ideas.
 
The Woods Fund's goal is ""to increase opportunities for less advantaged people and communities in the metropolitan area, including the opportunity to shape decisions affecting them."" The foundation works with a diverse array of nonprofits ""engaging people in civic life, addressing the causes of poverty and other challenges facing the region, promoting more effective public policies, reducing racism and other barriers to equal opportunity, and building a sense of community and common ground.""
Among those who have gotten grants in recent years: Protestants for the Common Good, the Black Ensemble Theater Group, the Japanese American Service Committee and the International Latino Cultural Center of Chicago.
 
""It just seems like, why this one?'' Harrington said of singling out the grant to the AAAN. ""It's a witch hunt.""
 
So what do we have? Seven years ago, Obama was a director of the Woods Fund when the board approved a grant to the AAAN. And some of the leaders of AAAN have made statements that could be interpreted as anti-Israel. The release implies that Obama's public pro-Israel stance should be questioned based on the opinions of leaders from the AAAN. But there's no evidence the AAAN used any of the Woods Fund money to promote an anti-Israel foreign policy agenda. In fact, the AAAN's focus is on local initiatives, and has no foreign policy. We rate the claim Barely True.

Anti-Israel? Not even key advisers
","A news release from the Tennessee Republican Party titled ""Anti-Semites For Obama"" seeks to cast doubt on Sen. Barack Obama's public pronouncements of support for Israel, alleging that some of the Obama campaign's key Middle East advisers are anti-Israel.
 
Two names getting the most discussion are Zbigniew Brzezinski, a national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981, and Robert Malley, once a special assistant to President Bill Clinton for Arab-Israeli Affairs. These men ring alarm bells for some pro-Israel people who follow Israeli-Palestinian relations.
 
Whether either is anti-Israel as described is a matter of opinion. More important, the Obama campaign claims neither is a formal adviser.
 
The news release from the Tennessee Republican Party is direct.
 
""You don't have to go outside Obama's campaign to find advisers who are anti-Israel,"" states Bill Hobbs, communications director for the Tennessee Republican Party, in the release. ""Robert Malley, a principal foreign policy adviser to Obama, has advocated negotiating with the Iranian-funded radical terrorist group Hamas and urged that Hamas â€” which sends suicide bombers to kill innocent women and children â€” receive international assistance.""
 
The comments appear to parrot several articles written by Ed Lasky for the

American Thinker,

a conservative daily Internet publication. In a Jan. 16, 2008, article titled ""Barack Obama and Israel,"" he claims that Obama ""has assembled a body of foreign policy advisers who signal that a President Obama would likely have an approach towards Israel radically at odds with those of previous presidents (both Republican and Democrat).""
 
Lasky claims that ""Brzezinski is well known for his aggressive dislike of Israel"" and that he ""has been an ardent foe of Israel for over three decades.""
 
Marc Zell, co-chairman of Republicans Abroad in Israel, stated in an article in the

Jerusalem Post

that Brzezinski heads up Obama's ""problematic"" Middle East team. Brzezinski is faulted for advocating dialogue with Hamas prior to the November 2007 Middle East peace conference in Annapolis, Md.
 
In a meeting with Cleveland Jewish community leaders on Feb. 24, Obama stated that he does not share Brzezinski's views with respect to Israel. Moreover, Obama said, ""He's not one of my key advisers. I've had lunch with him once. I've exchanged e-mails with him maybe three times. He came to Iowa to introduce (me) ... for a speech on Iraq.""
 
Brzezinski, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, echoed that in an e-mail to the

St. Petersburg Times.

 
""I am a private supporter of Sen. Obama, and by not being part of the campaign as such I retain the right to continue advocating publicly my own views regarding policy issues â€” which I have done for years and on the record,"" Brzezinski wrote. ""My views have been supported by Israelis who desire peace and I have frequently consulted them. The McCarthy-like comments you cite emanate from the fanatical right which for years has opposed any serious effort to end the tragic Middle Eastern conflict.""
 
Malley's chief offense among many pro-Israel activists is a letter he penned to the

New York Times

in which he claimed all sides, including Israel and not just the Palestinians, were to blame for the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit.
 
The furor against Malley reached such a pitch that five former Middle East policy leaders (including Sandy Berger, former national security adviser, and Daniel Kurtzer, former ambassador to Israel) wrote a statement on Malley's behalf. In part, it read, ""Over the past several weeks, a series of vicious, personal attacks have been launched against one of our colleagues, Robert Malley. ... They claim that he harbors an anti-Israeli agenda and has sought to undermine Israel's security. These attacks are unfair, inappropriate and wrong. They are an effort to undermine the credibility of a talented public servant who has worked tirelessly over the years to promote Arab-Israeli peace and U.S. national interests. They must stop.""
 
Obama's campaign states that while Malley has offered advice and opinions on a couple occasions, he is not a formal adviser either.
 
""The truth is that Obama did ask for advice from some people who might be considered not the most enthusiastic pro-Israel policy wonks in Washington,"" said Shmuel Rosner, chief U.S. correspondent for

Haaretz,

a leading Israeli paper, who has written extensively about Obama's Middle East advisers. ""However, these people are not in any way formal advisers that help shape Obama's policy on Israel-related topics.""
 
The day-to-day Middle East policy advisers with Obama's campaign, as confirmed by U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, who co-chairs Obama's Florida campaign, and other campaign staffers, are: Dan Shapiro, a member of Bill Clinton's National Security Council; Eric Lynn, a former foreign policy adviser to Rep. Peter Deutsch; Tony Lake, a former national security adviser to Clinton; and Dennis McDonough, foreign policy adviser to former Sen. Tom Daschle.
 
These advisers are considered centrist Middle East policy wonks, Rosner said, and certainly not anti-Israel.
 
""I don't think their advice would be much different than what Hillary Clinton would get from her advisers, or that (John) McCain would get from his Middle East advisers,"" Rosner said.
 
Consider that in position papers and interviews, Obama has said he does not think the United States should be talking to Hamas.
 
""Either he (Obama) didn't ask Malley for his advice, or he did ask for his advice and didn't accept it,"" Rosner said.
 
While some would argue that it is problematic for Obama to even talk to people are who are not seen as pro-Israel, Rosner said, ""I think it's all a bit hysterical.""
 
The allegations that Obama has surrounded himself with advisers who are anti-Israel are largely based on two men who, according to Obama's campaign, are simply not key advisers to Obama. Those who do comprise the heart of Obama's Middle East advisory team are described by most as centrists and pro-Israel. We rate the claim from the Tennessee Republican Party news release False.

Yes, Clinton used the Bush administration line
","Asked about a new report that found no connection between al-Qaida and the old Iraqi government before the U.S. invasion, Sen. Barack Obama said it shows that Sen. Hillary Clinton had poor judgment in 2002 when she repeated claims from the Bush administration to support its plan to go to war. ""President Bush and Dick Cheney insisted there was a connection. Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate suggested that there was such a connection,"" Obama said in an interview on MSNBC's  Hardball  on March 11, 2008. ""I think it was part of a series of misjudgments that have not only cost us dearly in terms of lives lost and people who are injured, has distracted us from Afghanistan and our ability to pin down bin Laden and al-Qaida, but has also cost us hundreds of billions of dollars."" Clinton's support of the war is well-known, but we wondered if Obama was quoting her correctly about al-Qaida. So we checked the transcript of a speech she gave on Oct. 10, 2002, just hours before the Senate voted to approve the war resolution. In that speech, Clinton explained her reasoning for supporting the war resolution. She described Saddam Hussein as ""a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people"" and said that he blocked weapons inspections in 1998. ""In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001."" In their book  Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,  Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. note that Clinton was rare among Democrats in citing the al-Qaida link. The book quotes Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as saying the links were ""much exaggerated,"" while Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California described them as ""tenuous."" Gerth and Van Natta point out that Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut came closest to echoing Clinton's comments, but even he said ""the relationship between al-Qaida and Saddam's regime is a subject of intense debate within the intelligence community."" Clinton was asked to explain her al-Qaida remark during an appearance on  Meet the Press  on Sept. 23, 2007. She sidestepped the part about al-Qaida but said, ""Well, I cast a sincere vote based on my assessment at the time, and I take responsibility for that vote. I also said on the floor that day that this was not a vote for pre-emptive war. I thought it made sense to put inspectors back in. As you recall, Saddam had driven out the U.N. inspectors in 1998 and the situation in Iraq was opaque, hard to determine, and I thought that it made sense to put inspectors back in."" She put the blame on the Bush administration.

A boost, not an impediment, to clean energy
","
At a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., on March 11, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton once again took on Sen. Barack Obama for supporting a 2005 energy bill.
 
""In 2005, when we had a chance to say no to Dick Cheney and his energy bill, my opponent said yes and voted for it with all of those tax subsidies and giveaways that have been used by the oil companies and others to retard the development of clean, renewable energy,"" Clinton said. ""When it counted, I said no, he said yes.""
 
Clinton, along with 25 other senators, including 19 Democrats, voted against the bill, which generally reflected the Bush administration's priorities. Obama and 73 Senate colleagues, including a total of 25 Democrats, supported the bill.
 
Obama said the energy bill would help Illinois and promote greater energy independence by doubling ethanol use, spurring investment in hybrid and flexible-fuel vehicles and promoting clean-coal technology. But he said bolder action would have to be taken to rein in high energy costs.
 
""This bill, while far from a solution, is a first step toward decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil,"" Obama said at the time.
 
Clinton has made much of her opposition to the bill in her campaign â€” for example, characterizing the legislation during a Jan. 15, 2008, Democratic debate in Las Vegas as ""a big step backward on the path to clean, renewable energy.""

Our examination of that claim found it to be false.

 
This time, while Clinton rightly points out that the legislation included tax breaks for oil companies â€” $2.6-billion to be exact â€” those were largely wiped out by a $3-billion extension of taxes on crude oil to help offset costs associated with oil spills. The bulk of the $14.6-billion in tax incentives included in the legislation actually went to ""renewable"" sources of energy, to accelerate the development of wind, clean-coal and nuclear power, and hybrid vehicles. (Although there is debate over whether coal and nuclear power should be considered renewable.)
 
The bill also included a mandate to produce more alternative fuel, requiring 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol â€” instead of petroleum-derived methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE â€” to be blended into gasoline by 2012. The industry is on pace to meet that target ahead of schedule, despite Clinton's claims that oil industry tax breaks have been used to retard development of renewable energy.
 
Responding to a PolitiFact inquiry, the Clinton campaign referred to a speech she made on the Senate floor, citing her opposition to the bill because, in part, it ignored pressing energy challenges, including U.S. dependence on foreign oil. ""The bill includes billions in subsidies for mature energy industries, including oil and nuclear,"" Clinton said in her July 29, 2005, remarks.
 
However, this reasoning ignores the fact that tax breaks for oil and gas producers encourage domestic production, which helps reduce reliance on foreign oil.
 
Clinton is right that Obama voted for the bill and she didn't. But because she incorrectly depicts the 2005 energy bill as a setback to renewable energy and a sop to Big Oil, we find her statement to be Barely True.

A great speech, but what else?
","Pointing to her experience confronting a foreign giant on a diplomatically sensitive matter, Sen. Hillary Clinton takes credit for pressuring the Chinese government to recognize women's rights, and for taking the Beijing government to task for its overall human rights record.
 
In an interview on CNN's

American Morning

on March 5, 2008, Clinton said, ""I've been standing up against . . . the Chinese government over women's rights and standing up for human rights.""
 
Clinton has made similar claims in campaign speeches. In a foreign policy address at George Washington University in Washington on Feb. 25, she said, ""I went to Beijing in 1995 and spoke out for women's rights and human rights. The Chinese government wasn't happy; they pulled the plug on the broadcast of my speech. But I took that as a compliment. Because it was important for the United States both to be represented and to make absolutely clear that human rights is an integral part of our foreign policy and that women's rights is key to that. What we have learned is that where women are oppressed and denied their basic rights we are more likely to have regimes that are more adversarial to American interests and values.""
 
Clinton was referring in her February remarks to a 1995 speech she delivered at the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, in which she called on the world community to protect women against violence, improve their access to health services and education and generally give them more self-determination.
 
""It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights,"" Clinton said. ""It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls.""
 
Chinese state radio and television blacked out Clinton's speech. Reports at the time stated the official Chinese press was under instruction to ignore her address until an official reaction was crafted. China experts say such censorship is routine and reflects the government's desire to emphasize consensus and tamp down confrontation.
 
Though Clinton's comments detailed abuses that occurred around the world â€” for example, rape in war-torn Bosnia and the burning of Indian brides whose marriage dowries were deemed too small â€” they had particularly strong implications in China, which had been the object of global criticism for forcing women to have abortions or undergo sterilization as part of ""one-child-per-family"" population control efforts.
 
Clinton echoed her remarks and stressed the importance of promoting the economic empowerment of women at a separate gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women later in the trip. Clinton's campaign says her advocacy helped prompt many nations to make equality among the sexes a reality in the 21st century, and that she helped procure $140-million in small-enterprise loans and other credit to help poor women around the world.
 
Clinton was walking a fine line at the time of her Beijing address because her husband's administration was trying to engage China and tone down U.S. condemnations of human rights abuses. Human rights groups were concerned her participation in the conference would amount to an implicit endorsement of Chinese policies. Diplomats, meanwhile, were worried her presence would aggravate U.S.-Chinese relations. The

New York Times,

in an editorial, said the speech ""may have been her finest moment in public life.""
 
Experts on U.S.-China relations say Clinton's speech exemplified her ability to go to a foreign capital and deliver a forthright address, but said little about her readiness to confront a real foreign relations crisis. Nor did it have much of a lasting impact on China's legal and political system. Women remain underrepresented in the country's political and business leadership, and the country's population control policies remain in place.
 
""In no way was this (Clinton's speech) a major confrontation with the Chinese government, or did it in any way resemble a crisis,"" said Thomas Carothers, vice president for studies-international politics and governance at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It was a good speech that set out principles but didn't go outside the bounds of the relatively mild approach to China the U.S. was taking at the time. It was one of many pushes from the outside ... it couldn't be said to change the direction of China's legal reform.""
 
The Clinton campaign, responding to recent criticism that her speech was not important,

cites an Associated Press account

to claim that ""her speech at the conference â€” where she famously declared 'women's rights are human rights' spurred real action."" But that's a bit of sleight-of-hand. We checked the full text of that story, which cited policy changes that helped women in many countries, and found the story attributed those changes to the conference, not specifically to Clinton's speech.
 
Clinton's interest in women's issues in China again was apparent â€” albeit in a less confrontational way â€” three years later, when she and then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright traveled to a women's legal aid center affiliated with Beijing University's law school during a 1998 state visit by President Bill Clinton. The visit was intended to assess China's efforts to update its legal system. The Clinton administration made U.S. pledges of assistance in that effort a subject of the trip. The legal aid center dealt with a wide range of women's legal issues, including rape, job discrimination and family planning.
 
Yes, Clinton delivered a tough speech implying Chinese policies were unacceptable at a global gathering in that nation's capital city. But the Clinton campaign has failed to show she has been involved in the long-term commitment for improvements in China that her statement suggests. We find her claim to be Half True.

A small but significant role
","Asked what makes her qualified to deal with a 3 a.m. phone call about a foreign crisis, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been citing her work as first lady on issues involving Northern Ireland, China and Kosovo. In an interview on CNN's  American Morning  on March 5, 2008, Clinton said, ""I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland. I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo. I've been standing up against ... the Chinese government over women's rights and standing up for human rights."" We'll deal with the Kosovo and China claims separately. Here, we address Clinton's claim about Northern Ireland. Her involvement came when she was first lady. The Clinton administration got involved in the Northern Ireland peace process at the urging of a group of Irish-Americans who believed the United States could help settle the long dispute between Catholics and Protestants. The key U.S. player in the process was George Mitchell, a former U.S. senator from Maine who chaired the peace negotiations. While Mitchell and others handled the direct diplomacy of the peace talks, Clinton focused on women and community leaders in Northern Ireland, according to Mitchell and others involved. She made several trips to Ireland and met with women and community leaders and continued conversations with them after she returned to the United States. She is perhaps best known in Northern Ireland for an Oct. 31, 1997, speech at the University of Ulster in Belfast in which she brought back a teapot that had been given to her in a previous visit. ""I don't know whether a Catholic or a Protestant made this teapot. I don't know whether a Catholic or a Protestant sold this teapot. I only know that this teapot serves me very well,"" Clinton said. ""And this teapot stands for all those conversations around those thousands of kitchen tables where mothers and fathers look at one another with despair because they cannot imagine that the future will be any better for their children. But this teapot also is on the kitchen table where mothers and fathers look at one another and say, we have to do better. We cannot permit this to go on. We have to take a stand for our children."" But overall, how involved was she? Consider the evidence: â€¢ David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party in Northern Ireland who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for the settlement, last week told the  Daily Telegraph,  a British newspaper, that Clinton's claim was ""a wee bit silly."" He said, ""I don't want to rain on the thing for her, but being a cheerleader for something is slightly different from being a principal player."" â€¢ The Clinton campaign issued a statement quoting John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party who shared the Nobel with Trimble, saying ""she played a positive role for over a decade in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. ... She visited Northern Ireland, met with very many people and gave very decisive support to the peace. ... In private she made countless calls and contacts, speaking to leaders and opinionmakers on all sides, urging them to keep moving forward."" â€¢ Clinton didn't get much attention at the time. When Mitchell was interviewed on ABC's  This Week  shortly after the Good Friday Settlement in April 1998, he had effusive praise for President Clinton but did not mention Hillary Clinton. In his book  Making Peace,  Mitchell mentioned Hillary Clinton only in passing and he did not mention her in his speech when he was given a United Nations Peace Prize in 1998. Interviewed this week by PolitiFact, Mitchell said Hillary Clinton did not take part in the actual talks but that she was ""quite helpful in the process. ... She was quite active in encouraging women in Northern Ireland to get involved and stay involved in the peace process."" â€¢ Inez McCormack, an Irish labor leader, said Clinton played an important role building grass-roots support for the peace process. She said Clinton also was influential in making sure the peace accords included provisions guaranteeing equality based on gender, religion and sexual orientation. ""She understood that you had to tackle inequality if you were going to make the peace,"" McCormack said in an interview. Clinton raised the visibility for issues of equality, which helped them get more support, McCormack said. â€¢ Stephen Farry, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said it's important to put the Clinton administration's efforts in perspective. ""It is an exaggeration to say that the administration brokered the agreement. ... Most of the heavy lifting to reach the Good Friday Agreement was provided by the British and Irish governments,"" Farry said in an e-mail to PolitiFact. He said Hillary Clinton ""did not, to my knowledge, have any direct role with the key players in the negotiations. She did play a positive role in engaging with civil society in Northern Ireland, and building on work that was already in progress. This would have assisted with the general atmospherics."" * In her memoir  Living History,  Clinton recounts her teapot speech and several other anecdotes about her visits to Ireland and Northern Ireland, but there's little in the book to indicate that she played a key role. Clinton claimed that she ""helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland."" That's the kind of thing that Mitchell, Hume or Trimble could accurately say. But based on our interviews and research, it's a stretch for Clinton to say so. Although she played a role, especially with women in Northern Ireland, her statement leaves the impression that she was more involved than she was. We find her statement to be Half True.",/factchecks/2008/mar/10/hillary-clinton/a-small-but-significant-role/
"['Abortion', 'Women', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott: Defunding Planned Parenthood preceded drops in abortion, unintended pregnancy rates
","In a tweet, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott suggested a legislated end to government aid to clinics affiliated with abortion providers including Planned Parenthood fueled fewer pregnancies and abortions. ""After Texas defunded Planned Parenthood, both the Unintended Pregnancy & Abortion Rates Dropped,"" Abbott wrote on Twitter Aug. 25, 2015.  Abbottâ€™s tweet included a web link to a LifeNews.com post headlined: ""When Planned Parenthood is De-Funded, Abortion and Unintended Pregnancy Rates Drop."" The linked article, by Michael New, a visiting associate professor of economics at Ave Maria University in Florida, mentioned unintended pregnancies but it hinted at other indicators, stating that ""in Texas, both the birth rate and the abortion rate have declined since 2011."" Rewind: 2011 was the year the Republican-led Legislature voted to bar government aid covering womenâ€™s health services, including contraception and cancer screenings, from going to Texas clinics affiliated with abortion providers. That cut-off took full effect by January 2013 as the state directed funding to clinics lacking such affiliations.. So, did the legislative action, signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, hasten reductions in abortions and unintended pregnancies? Abbottâ€™s office didnâ€™t respond to our inquiry requesting his backup. Newâ€™s article laid out no data either. But New engaged by email, in part agreeing that in keeping with the 2011 action, state aid to clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood was cut off in 2013; litigation to stop the cutoffs, he noted, had failed in 2012. ""As such, I think comparing data from 2011 to 2013 is reasonable,"" New wrote. So, New said, state-collected figures suggest that in 2013, there were 81.1 pregnancies per 1,000 women in Texas aged 15 to 44, a decrease from the 82.9 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2011. (The 2013 rate also was down from the 2012 rate of 82.1 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.) Conversely, New said, abortions provided in Texas totaled 61,513 in 2013 compared with 69,431 in 2011; the 2013 abortion rate of 11.09 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 was down from the 2011 rate of 12.86. (The 2012 rate, the state says, was 12.0.) ""As a social scientist I always am interested in more data,"" New said. ""The more data we have, the more reliable the findings (usually). That said, the short-term data that we have from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates that excluding Planned Parenthood clinics from the state family planning program did not cause short-term public health problems (more abortions or more unintended pregnancies) than some predicted."" He also told us to keep in mind his article was an editorial (as in opinion piece). Of course, Abbottâ€™s tweet did not speak to whether the 2011 actions caused public health problems. We sought evidence that abortion and unintended pregnancy rates were driven down thanks to the statutory restrictions. Abortions down Mindful of how New reached his figures, we turned to Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for Texas State Health Services. By email, she provided a chart tallying abortions in the state each year from 2000 through 2013. Over the 14 years, the count crested at 82,056 in 2006 and decreased for five straight years starting in 2009 when the agency noted 77,850 abortions. In 2013, according to the chart, there were 63,849 Texas abortions. Over this span, annual percentage drops ranged from less than 1 percent (2009 to 2010) to 5 percent (from 2008 to 2009) to 7 percent (from 2010 to 2011 and 2012 to 2013). And in 2014, there may have been a greater plummet; Williams said the stateâ€™s abortion count for that year isnâ€™t final but the ""provisional"" count is 54,191 abortions. If that holds up, it would represent 9,658 fewer abortions than in 2013 â€” a 15 percent single-year decrease. Total Induced Abortions Reported in Texas by Year, 2000-2013 Year Abortions 2000 76,121 2001 77,537 2002 79,929 2003 79,166 2004 75,053 2005 77,374 2006 82,056 2007 81,079 2008 81,591 2009 77,850 2010 77,592 2011 72,470 2012 68,298 2013 63,849 Total 1,069,965 For national perspective, we turned to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. The institute tallies abortions by surveying abortion providers â€” and, we noticed, its Texas counts published for 2008, 2010 and 2011 exceeded by 700 to about 3,100 what the state tallied each of those years. Guttmacher said in a March 2014 article: ""For abortion counts, most but not all states conduct annual surveillance of abortions provided in the state and the number of abortions obtained by residents. However, abortions are almost always underreported to state surveillance systems."" By email, Guttmacher spokesman Joerg Dreweke said the Texas abortion rate declined in 2013 and previously declined from 2008 to 2011. Dreweke said the institute isnâ€™t aware of published evidence linking the 2013 decrease to the 2011 legislative actions. Texas pregnancies We didnâ€™t find primary evidence for unintended pregnancies going up or down due to the 2011 legislative action. New, responding to us, noted accurately that in 2013, there were 81.1 pregnancies in Texas per 1,000 women ages 15-44, down from 82.9 pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in 2011, the year lawmakers acted. That 2013 rate, state tallies suggest, was the lowest since at least 2004, which is as far back as we checked. On the other hand, the Texas pregnancy rate has declined every year starting in 2008, according to the state, when there were about 92 pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age compared to about 93 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-54 in 2007. Through 2013, that is, the pregnancy rate had decreased six straight years. Regardless, Abbottâ€™s tweet proclaimed a drop in ""unintended"" pregnancies after the defunding. But on that point, we found no timely data. By email, Williams of State Health Services told us the stateâ€™s latest estimates of unintended pregnancies cover 2011. Some 43 percent of Texas pregnancies in 2011 were unintended â€” with 34 percent of those ""mistimed,"" meaning the mother said she wanted to be pregnant later, and 9 percent of them unwanted, meaning the mother said she didnâ€™t want to be pregnant then or at any future time. These percentages appeared in the agencyâ€™s latest Texas Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System report (published in 2013) based on a survey of 1,316 women who gave birth in 2011 about their maternal attitudes and behaviors before, during and after pregnancy and conducted in partnership with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention â€” an annual survey effort that Texas joined in 2002. The CDC, the report said, defines an unintended pregnancy as one that is mistimed (wanted later) or unwanted at the time of conception. ""Unintended pregnancies occur primarily due to the lack of birth control,"" the report said, ""or because of incorrect or inconsistent use of birth control methods."" Guttmacher takes a broader look at unintended pregnancy rates by state by folding in pregnancies ended by abortion. By email, Dreweke told us its research shows unintended pregnancies decreasing by nearly 8 percent in Texas between 2002 and 2010 (before the actions touted by Abbott occurred). In 2010, according to a January 2015 institute report, there were 56 unintended Texas pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. That rate, the report said, was down from 58 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in Texas in 2008 and 61 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in 2006. In 2002, the report said, there were 60 unintended pregnancies in Texas per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. Dreweke also put us in touch with Guttmacher researcher Rachel Jones, who said it might be 2020 before data are available showing changes in unintended pregnancies for 2012 or later. We asked New whether itâ€™s reasonable to presume the unintended pregnancy rate decreased due to the cutoff of aid to clinics associated with abortion providers including Planned Parenthood. Reminding us that available figures suggest declining Texas abortion and birth rates, whether due to unintended pregnancies or not, New also said that based on available data, he couldnâ€™t tell us if defunding Planned Parenthood caused declines in the abortion rate and the unintended pregnancy rate. ""That would require more data from more years and (preferably) more states,"" he said. New also suggested Abbott did not say defunding Planned Parenthood caused the proclaimed declines. Thatâ€™s not how we read the governorâ€™s tweet. Our ruling Abbott said: ""After Texas defunded Planned Parenthood, both the Unintended Pregnancy & Abortion Rates Dropped."" Abortions were already declining before the described defunding while data directly gauging unintended pregnancy rates since the defunding donâ€™t yet exist. So, half this claim draws on cherry-picked statistics, the other half lacks factual backup and the full statement implies causation, which isÂ unproved. We rate this declaration Mostly False.

"['Rhode Island', 'Transparency', 'David Cicilline']","
Cicilline's mistake was in describing Hillary Clinton as unequivocal
","On WPRIâ€™s ""Newsmakers"" show on Sept. 4, co-hosts Ted Nesi and Tim White asked U.S. Rep. David Cicilline about Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a personal server for work-related email when she was secretary of state. Cicilline emphasized that Clinton herself acknowledged that she ""didnâ€™t handle this well."" He lamented that ""early on"" Clinton hadnâ€™t succeeded in an effort ""to put it to rest."" He suggested that the effect on Clintonâ€™s campaign has been ""unfortunate"" and ""regrettable."" ""The secretary has acknowledged that having a separate server was a bad idea,"" he said. Cicilline added: ""She has also said unequivocally that she didn't receive classified documents."" Voters tend to like politicians who are unequivocal about things. The Random House dictionary defines unequivocal as not equivocal, unambiguous, clear and having only one possible meaning or interpretation. It also means absolute, unqualified; not subject to conditions or exception. We wondered if Clinton has actually been ""unequivocal"" in her comments about not receiving classified documents on her personal server, so we gathered together some video clips. One of those clips was from early March -- just after The New York Times broke the news that the candidate had used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state and that her advisers had reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to provide to the State Department for record-keeping purposes. On March 10, Clinton took some questions from reporters on C-SPAN. One reporter asked her: ""Were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president?"" Her response was: ""I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material. So I certainly am well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material."" This was certainly unequivocal, especially the assertion that ""There is no classified material."" But later we found Clintonâ€™s statements veered from ""unambiguous, clear and having only one possible meaning or interpretation."" In footage that CNN posted online on July 28, Clinton said, ""First let me say that I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received."" ""At the time it was sent and received"" seems to us to be open to more than one possible meaning, especially when compared to her statement in March. Then, on Aug. 15, speaking at the Iowa State Fair, Clinton said: ""... The facts are the same as they have been from the very beginning of these questions being raised. Most importantly, I never sent classified material on my email. And I never received any that was marked classified."" In March, Clinton was saying there was no classified material, regardless of how it was marked. Now, she was allowing for the possibility that there might have been some material that was actually classified -- but just not ""marked"" that way. In stories parsing her August comments, in which she uses the phrase ""marked classified,"" Â The Wall Street said she had shifted her emphasis. The Boston Globe said she had qualified her position. We asked a spokesman for Clinton, Josh Schwerin, if the candidate agrees with Cicilline's statement, particularly his use of the word unequivocally.Â  ""We'll let her past statements on the matter speak for themselves,"" Schwerin said in an email. We also asked Cicillineâ€™s spokesman, Richard Luchette, to provide his evidence that Clinton has said ""unequivocally"" that she didnâ€™t receive classified documents. Luchette provided a series of quotes that reflect the same evolution weâ€™ve tracked. Itâ€™s a chain of quotes that begins with Clintonâ€™s quite unequivocal statement from March. It ends with the more recent statements, which are qualified, including this one: ""As has been confirmed repeatedly by the inspectors general, over and over, I did not send or receive any material marked classified."" Thereâ€™s that word ""marked"" again. Our ruling  Ten days ago, Cicilline said Hillary Clinton Â ""has also said unequivocally that she didn't receive classified documents."" Cicilline set a high bar for himself when he used the word ""unequivocally."" Certainly in March she was unequivocal. But the record also shows that since then she has hedged and qualified her remarks, as has been noted in the media. The problem for Cicilline is that the definition of unequivocal doesnâ€™t leave much, if any, wiggle room: Think ""clear and having only one possible meaning or interpretation."" Â  Because Cicillineâ€™s statement was accurate in regard to Clintonâ€™s quote from March, but failed to provide the context of Clintonâ€™s subsequent elaborations, the judges rate Cicillineâ€™s claim Half True.

Lloyd Doggett says opposition to Confederate flag limits delayed House action on spending measures
","A congressman told a Texas group that action on measures funding the government slowed this summer due to opposition to proposals banning Confederate flag sales. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat whose district runs south from Austin into San Antonio, stressed at a Sept. 3, 2015, Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce gathering that he hoped to help resurrect the U.S. Export-Import Bank. As it was in the Republican-majority House, Doggett said, up to six federal department budget bills had been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops. Is that so? We should note that what Doggett said on this topic wasnâ€™t directly quoted in the San Antonio Express-News news story where we saw his claim. Doggettâ€™s backup To our inquiry, including a request for his prepared text, Doggett spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale said by email she didnâ€™t have Doggettâ€™s precise words. Still, Tisdale said, ""Republicans fearful of a floor vote about the Confederate flag, pulled one appropriations bill from floor consideration and have declined to present any more."" She said Doggett ""did refer to any display of the â€˜Stars and Barsâ€™ at a federal facility of which one example is gift shops."" Tisdale followed up with an email including a document grouping July 2015 news stories recapping House Democratsâ€™ efforts to amend a 2016 spending bill to bar the display of a Confederate flag and to keep the National Park Service from working with vendors that sell such flags. She also excerpted floor remarks by Democrats including a July 9, 2015, statement by Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip: ""Three Democratic amendments were adopted earlier in the consideration of the Interior"" Department appropriations ""bill that would end the practice of displaying or selling Confederate battle flags and flag merchandise in national parks and National Park Service cemeteries. Those amendments were adopted by voice vote."" After that, Democrats complained, Republicans moved to take the amendments off. South Carolina and House action News stories and congressional transcripts confirm the flag amendments making it into the Interior spending measure for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2015, and also a Republican move to reverse course culminating in House consideration of the legislation stalling out. Mid-summer news stories, including several in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, described the flag impasse bubbling up just as South Carolina lawmakers agreed to take down the Confederate battle flag long displayed outside its Capitol. That takedown unspooled after a white man the month before opened fire in a historically black Charleston church, killing nine people. A July 10, 2015, story in The Hill said: ""House Republicans are hitting the brakes on consideration of spending bills after leaders yanked a measure from the floor this week over the display of the Confederate flag. The House was originally slated to consider the 2016 spending bill for Financial Services next week,"" the story said, ""but the odds are now low for it hitting the floor. Republicans are worried that Democrats could try to offer more amendments related to the display of the Confederate flag that could again tie the GOP into knots."" The story said Republican House leaders earlier ""yanked the annual spending bill for the Interior Department on Thursday,"" July 8, 2015, ""after an amendment from Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) that would ban the display of the Confederate flag in national cemeteries passed by voice vote earlier in the week."" Three flag amendments We pulled up each of the flag amendments that made it into the spending act. Huffmanâ€™s amendment, per the Congressional Record for July 7, 2015, forbade the park service from allowing ""a grave in any federal cemetery to be decorated with a Confederate flag."" Earlier that day, Huffman won adoption of an amendment barring funds from being spent with any entity ""that provides for the sale in any facility within a unit of the National Park System of an item with a Confederate flag as a stand-alone feature."" Huffman told House members the mandate was needed to follow up on a park service request that gift shops, bookstores and other concessionaires voluntarily end the sale of standalone items--such as flags, pins, and belt buckles--with imagery of the Confederate flag. Also, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., won approval of an amendment barring the park service from spending funds to display a Confederate flag except when the flags ""provide historical context."" Jeffries told colleagues: ""We have come a long way in America, but we still have a long way to Â go in our march toward a more perfect Union. The cancer of racial Â hatred continues to adversely impact our society, and people of good Â will must unite to eradicate it. Limiting the use of federal funds connected to the purchase or display of the Confederate flag is an important step in that direction."" The Republican move to repeal The Hill subsequently reported: ""Some Republicans, primarily representing Southern states, found out about the"" cemetery ""amendment after the fact and threatened to vote against the entire bill if it remained intact,"" the story said. And after it proved uncertain that Republicans could win enough votes to undo Huffmanâ€™s amendment. House GOP leaders pulled the Interior bill from the floor."" The Congressional Record for July 8, 2015, shows that Calvert offered an amendment peeling back the just-added prohibition on the park service displaying Confederate flags or decorating graves with them. In debate, Calvert said his move would codify existing park service policy ""with regard to the declaration of cemeteries and concession sales."" Objecting, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said: ""While in certain and very limited circumstances, it might be Â appropriate in a national park to display the image of the Confederate Â flag in a historical context--and I say that as a social studies Â teacher--the general display or sale of Confederate flag items is Â inappropriate and divisive."" She added that ""we should make Â sure that we uphold what this House stood for yesterday, which is to say no to racism, which is to say no to hate speech."" Next, a voice vote was declared as carrying Calvertâ€™s amendment to passage. McCollum reacted by calling for a record vote, which would show how each member stood on Calvertâ€™s amendment. The Houseâ€™s acting chair answered by saying further proceedings on the amendment ""will be postponed;"" the full measure also wasnâ€™t further considered. Post-debate comments A July 9, 2015, news story in The Hill quoted House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ill., telling reporters the Interior Department proposal had been pulled to avoid the flag issue from becoming a political football. ""That bill is going to sit in abeyance until we come to some resolution,"" Boehner said. The story said the action affecting the Interior proposal was the second time in the year that House Republicans had ""punted"" on the display of the Confederate flag. In early July 2015, the House voted to refer a measure to ban the display of the Confederate flag around the Capitol complex to committee for review, instead of immediately passing or rejecting it, the story said. A July 10, 2015, Associated Press news story quoted unidentified House Republican aides saying a bill covering general government operations tentatively set for consideration the next week wouldnâ€™t be considered after all. The story quoted Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the pivotal House Appropriations Committee, saying ""there's a number of options that are being considered"" for moving forward on the 2016 spending measures. By our count, thatâ€™s three appropriations proposals reportedly stalled in connection with anti-Confederate-flag proposals. Tisdale also pointed out a July 14, 2015, news blog post by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, stating Boehner that day had ""reportedly told Republicans during their weekly closed-door meeting there was a hold on all spending bills until they could figure something out on the Confederate flag."" The account quoted Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, saying: ""We know that every approps bill that we put forward theyâ€™re going to go back to trying to make some, you know â€” exploit for political reasons what happened in South Carolina. And so the speaker wants to work something out with Democrats so theyâ€™ll stop doing that so we can move forward,"" Fleming said. A July 21, 2015, New York Times news story said that weeks after House Republicans called for a bipartisan solution to the fight over the Confederate flag on federal property, there was no visible progress â€” and, the story said, ""the issue has unexpectedly paralyzed spending bills on the House floor."" The Times summarized what happened after the House accepted Huffmanâ€™s cemetery amendment: ""Rep. Ken Calvert, Republican of California, offered an amendment to permit displays of the flag in federal cemeteries on one day a year, Confederate Memorial Day, which is celebrated in nine states. Realizing they did not have the votes for that amendment â€” but also did not have the votes for their spending bill without it â€” Republicans pulled the underlying bill from the floor, effectively shutting down the House appropriations process."" The story said Boehnerâ€™s idea to focus on the flag issue through a bipartisan working group seemed to have gone nowhere. It quoted Boehner saying: ""I actually think itâ€™s time for some adults here in the Congress to actually sit down and have a conversation about how to address this issue."" Democrats more or less rejected the suggestion, saying that there was little to discuss and that the flags should simply be removed, the newspaper said. We reached out to Boehnerâ€™s office and the Republican side of the House appropriations panel. A Boehner spokesman didnâ€™t reply. We didnâ€™t field an on-the-record reply from a committee spokesperson. House yet to vote on six spending acts A July 14, 2015, press release led us to conclude that up to six annual spending bills were at least temporarily marooned. In the release, Chairman Rogers said the appropriations panel had completed its work that day by clearing its 12th and final government funding measure, ""marking the first time since 2009 that all Appropriations bills have been approved by the full committee."" Rogers said ""In addition,"" Rogers said then, ""six Appropriations bills have been approved by the full House."" His implication: Six hadnâ€™t been voted to the Senate. That was still so as of the second week of September 2015, a House website indicates, with the House yet to vote on fiscal 2016 spending proposals for agriculture; financial services; homeland security; the Department of Interior and the environment; labor, health and human services and education; and the State Department and foreign operations. In contrast, the House had sent the Senate appropriations proposals for commerce/justice/science; defense; energy and water; the legislative branch; military/veterans; and transportation/Housing and Urban Development. Other factors slowing action? Next, we looked into other possible factors for the stalled budget bills. There may be a few. The July 10 news story in The Hill hinted at factors, stating that whether the House advanced spending measures or not, the GOP-authored bills remained ""very unlikely to become law. Senate Democrats have promised to block all GOP funding measures until a new budget deal is reached to lift sequestration spending levels,"" the story said, closing: ""Congress may have to turn to a short-term spending bill when it returns from recess in September to avoid a government shutdown at the end"" of that month. Similarly, Donald Wolfensberger, long-time director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, replied to our query about Doggettâ€™s statement by suggesting itâ€™s not unusual for the House to slow action on spending measures that it knows wonâ€™t sail through the Senate. In past years, he said by email, it seemed fruitless for the House to advance more spending bills when senators had vowed not to take them up--as, he said, Senate Democrats have done this year until a more generous budget accord is reached. Moreover, Wolfensberger said, ""I cannot attest to the rumor that the threat of Confederate flag amendments would even be germane to all of the remaining bills."" Via the the Nexis database, we came across an Aug. 27, 2015, post on the Fox News ""Capitol Attitude"" blog suggesting multiple reasons the spending measures might stay bogged down. Congress must resolve whether to avoid a partial government shutdown by the start of the 2016 fiscal year Oct. 1, 2015, the post said, but the House and Senate to date had ""sent precisely zero of the 12 annual spending bills which fund the federal government to"" President Barack ""Obama to either sign or veto. If any of those 12 bills aren't signed by the president by Oct. 1, that portion of the government shuts down."" Trip wires that could touch off a partial shutdown, the post said, range from conservative pushes to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood or to reverse Obamaâ€™s initiatives on immigration, environmental policy or the Obamacare law. ""Don't forget,"" the post went on, ""liberals in the House brought the appropriations process to a standstill in July over the placement of Confederate flags at national cemeteries."" Our ruling Doggett said in San Antonio that House votes on up to six federal department budget bills had been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops. When he spoke, the House had yet to vote on six 2016 spending measures. During floor debate, a stand-off about Democratic amendments restricting displays and sales of the Confederate flag--including a proposal barring the park service from enlisting concessionaires selling the flags--evidently derailed the Interior appropriations act with expected House action on two other spending acts reportedly put off. Still, other factorsâ€”such as general reluctance among House leaders to send spending proposals to the potentially unfriendly Senateâ€”may figure into the bodyâ€™s inaction on the six measures.

Juan Williams: Clinton was 'the decider' on classified info at State
","The ultimate impact of Hillary Clintonâ€™s email woes is anyoneâ€™s guess, but a disclosure this week did the Democratic presidential candidate no favors. The New York Times reported that a second intelligence agency review found Top Secret material in emails Clinton received on her personal account. The majority view on Fox Newsâ€™ The Five was that this proved that Clinton played fast and loose with very classified information and broke the Obama administrationâ€™s rules. The lone dissenting voice was Juan Williams, who argued that Clinton had the right to exercise her own judgment about how sensitive the material was. ""When it comes to 'classified' at the State Department, sheâ€™s the decider,"" Williams said. This drew a chorus of you are so wrongs from the rest of the panel. We thought weâ€™d try to sort out whether the secretary of state is the ""decider,"" as Williams put it. Williamsâ€™ assertion is not as out-of-bounds as his fellow panelists on The Five let on. Clinton, as the head of the State Department, has the authority to classify information. The power is spelled out in President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive order on national security information. It reads: The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by: (1) Â the President and the Vice President; (2) Â agency heads and officials designated by the President; and (3) Â United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The executive order goes on to say that an agency head, such as Clinton, can designate a deputy to oversee the classification process. The State Departmentâ€™s Foreign Affairs Manual spells things out a little further, saying that ""those occupying various positions in the Department and at posts abroad have the authority to classify information originally as Top Secret. The positions include the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and some Executive Level IV officials and their deputies; Chiefs of Mission, Charges dâ€™affaires, and U.S. Representatives to various international organizations."" Long story short, Clinton formally had a role in the classification process. But practically, the responsibility to classify information was not, or ever, solely Clintonâ€™s. Daniel Metcalfe is professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justiceâ€™s Office of Information Policy. ""As a practical matter, 99 percent of the time, things that came to her would have been reviewed for classification and acted on by someone lower down,"" Metcalfe said. ""That doesnâ€™t preclude her from saying â€˜Oh my goodness, this should be classified,â€™ because she is the ultimate authority within the State Department. But it wasnâ€™t her role."" Nate Jones, an archivist at the National Security Archives based at George Washington University, drew attention to an additional complexity. Clinton might be the final word at the State Department, but only for material that her agency first produced. If another agency, such as the CIA, was the original author, then it had the right to slap a security label on it that the State Department would need to respect. ""While I believe the other agencies' claims may very likely be dubious -- like claiming that the fact that the United States kills people in Pakistan with drones is classified -- they are allowed to bureaucratically make them despite Clinton being the agency head,"" Jones told PunditFact. According to the New York Times article, some of the emails in question contained Top Secret material that originated from intelligence agencies. Clinton has said that emails on her private server contained no information that was marked classified. Williams did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Williams said that at the State Department, Clinton was ""the decider"" over what was and wasnâ€™t classified material. Formally speaking, there is some truth to the claim. But practically, itâ€™s a stretch. The responsibility is shared among many people, and while Clinton could play a role, it wouldnâ€™t typically be her primary or even secondary concern. Additionally, the secretary of state isnâ€™t the arbiter of information that originated from another agency. Williamsâ€™ claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

Donald Trump wants to replace Obamacare with a single-payer health care system, GOP congressman says
","As the Summer of Trump wore on, a quiet congressman from Wisconsin decided he'd had enough of his party's ostentatious presidential frontrunner. Reid Ribble, a Republican from the Green Bay area, went public not only to blast Donald Trump's name calling -- particularly Trumpâ€™s calling Fox News talk show host Megyn Kelly a ""bimbo"" -- but to call him out as not being a conservative. In one interview, Ribble made several claims about Trump's non-conservatism to Milwaukee conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. One was about a so-called single-payer health care system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens. ""The interesting this is, I'm not the guy who's saying we should have completely socialized medicine,"" Ribble said Sept. 8, 2015 on WTMJ-AM (620). ""I want to repeal Obamacare and replace it with (a) free-market system. He wants to replace it with a single-payer system. That's hardly a conservative posture."" Sometimes Trump's positions can seem to be a moving target; and whether they are conservative can be open to interpretation. But does Trump want to install a single-payer health care system? Twice in the past two months our colleagues have reviewed claims similar to Ribble's. So let's start there. First True In July 2015, conservative columnist Erick Erickson wrote that Trump ""has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system."" Our partners at PunditFact.com issued a rating of True. In 1999, during his short-lived 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump told CNN's Larry King: ""If you canâ€™t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, itâ€™s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare."" And in his 2000 book ""The America We Deserve,"" Trump made a strong pitch for universal health care. As to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. So, Trump has supported single payer in the past. Then Half True On Aug. 2, 2015, GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, said Trump is ""for single-payer"" -- essentially a present-tense version of the columnistâ€™s claim. Our colleagues found that earlier in 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotlandâ€™s health care system, which is single payer. But in another interview -- while stopping short of rejecting single payer -- he talked about offering private plans made through ""deals with hospitals"" that allow the government to help people ""at the lower levels."" A spokesperson for Trump insisted at the time that Trump has ""never supported socialized medicine,"" but is for ""a universal â€˜market-basedâ€™ plan that would offer a range of choices."" So as the 2016 campaign unfolded, Trump has said he admires single payer, but also suggested he prefers free-market models, as well. PolitiFact Nationalâ€™s rating of Perryâ€™s claim was Half True. The two fact checks were what Ribbleâ€™s office cited to us to back Ribbleâ€™s claim. (Trumpâ€™s campaign didnâ€™t reply to us.) But Trump has since had more to say on the subject. Then what? Two days after the more recent fact check, Trump was asked on MSNBCâ€™s ""Morning Joe"" talk show: ""Are you for single-payer health care?"" Trump replied: Â  ""No, but itâ€™s certainly something that in certain countries works. It actually works incredibly well in Scotland. Some people think it really works in Canada. But not here, I donâ€™t think it would work as well here. What has to happen -- I like the concept of private enterprise coming in â€¦.You have to create competition. And you have to go back to a system of private."" The no part of Trumpâ€™s answer, even as he repeated praise for single payer, seemed to indicate Trump does not favor it for the United States. But he has since been less clear. Two days later, at the first Republican presidential debate on April 6, 2015, Fox News host Bret Baier asked Trump: ""Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why arenâ€™t you for it now?"" Trump answered first by speaking about foreign policy, then said: ""As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age youâ€™re talking about here. ""What Iâ€™d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state â€¦..Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that canâ€™t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system."" Again, a mixed bag: praising single payer, but advocating, if vaguely, for a private system. More recently, Trump essentially gave no answer when conservative talk show host Sean Hannity asked him about single payer on Hannityâ€™s Sept. 1, 2015 radio program. After covering other topics, Trump replied by saying: ""As far as single-payer and all â€” thereâ€™s so many different things you could have. Honestly, Sean, to do, to have great health insurance. The one thing I do tell people, weâ€™re going to have something great. Weâ€™re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster."" Our rating Ribble said Trump ""wants to replace"" Obamacare ""with a single-payer system."" Trump continues to praise single payer -- a health care system in which the government pays for care for all citizens -- at least as it used in other countries. But he has spoken a number of times, if vaguely, about a private system and at one point said he does not support single payer in the United States. Since then, his responses have been less clear.

Are citations, and revenue, up in Atlanta?
","Anyone who has landed in a speed trap in some never-before-mentioned small town on I-75 in South Georgia understands the most basic example of policing for profit. A 2014 analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution of five years of traffic fines paid in every police jurisdiction in the state â€“ more than 500 in all â€“ exposed numerous departments raking in exorbitant fine amounts. Atlanta collected below the metro region average of $116 per capita in fines, but still netted $50.6 million, or $112.98 for every person in the city. A scathing U.S. Department of Justice Department report found a more troubling kind of policing for profit in Ferguson, Mo., saying the cityâ€™s court system worked in tandem with police to charge escalating fines for minor offenses such as traffic violations in order to raise revenue. A reader reached out via email, arguing Atlanta actually mirrored the troubled Missouri city under Mayor Kasim Reed, when looking at all citations, not just traffic tickets, all in the name of generating income. Had Atlanta issued an increasing number of citations â€“ and collected more money â€“ since Reed took office? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres said traffic citations play an important role in overall public safety. There are more citations now, she said, because Reed has put more cops on the street in a bid to make Atlanta safer. ""With hundreds of additional officers on patrol, and special tactical units assigned to traffic enforcement, the number of citations issued today versus 2009 will be significantly different, "" Torres said in an emailed statement. By the numbers The reader email claimed that the number of tickets and citations issued in Atlanta had grown 20 percent during Reedâ€™s tenure, from 337,697 in 2010 to 404,652 in 2014. Those numbers, he said, came from the Atlanta Policeâ€™s website, which includes data downloads, and a record request for the number of citations issued annually by PARK-atlanta, the name of the cityâ€™s outsourced parking enforcement. City leaders agreed in 2009 to a seven-year contract with Milwaukee-based Duncan Solutions to take charge of ticketing illegally parked vehicles and to install hundreds of parking meters across the city. Duncan agreed to pay the city $5.5 million a year under the PARK-atlanta program and keeps any additional money collected. That deal was problematic within days of beginning, with residents, business owners and patrons complaining that PARK-atlanta was too aggressive in its enforcement. Our reader attached a 2011 quote from Reed that he contends shows the reason for the complaints: a push for new revenue. ""I think that if we do it well that that is an area to generate approximately $10 million dollars or more in revenue. We are going to have robust traffic enforcement and the court needs to be prepared to handle those cases because that is how revenue is being lost,"" the quote read. ""We could ethically and appropriately, carrying out an essential government function, have a significant spike in revenue while protecting people,"" the quote continued. ""Revenue is being lost."" We were able to confirm the quote, part of Reedâ€™s response to whether the increased enforcement would pay for the judges necessary to oversee the court, not pad the city budget. More problematic was coming up with the actual numbers of citations issued in Atlanta every year. The reader provided us with data from PARK-atlanta showing the number of annual citations. City officials confirmed the numbers are: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 141,156 220,185 221,119 200,078 196,895 Thatâ€™s a 40 percent increase in citations in five years. But remember, the city collects a set amount - $5.5 million a year â€“ to hand over the enforcement to PARK-atlanta.So there is no reason for the city or Reed to encourage more citations. Itâ€™s a different story at the Atlanta Municipal Court, which handles the citations issued by Atlanta Police. The number cases handled each year are: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 260,982 288,820 309,529 261,704 269,257 The city court collected $19.33 million from all fines and other sources, including fines and fees such as those associated with controversial private probation in 2010. By 2014, that number had grown to $27.94 million â€“ a 45 percent increase in money that goes to the cityâ€™s general fund to pay for police, courts and other basic government needs. Torres said some increase would be expected, in part because Reed kept a campaign promise to grow the cityâ€™s police department. The department is constantly in flux but ended 2010 with 1,770 officers and ended 2014 with 1,936 (after briefly reaching Reedâ€™s long-sought goal of 2,000 officers in 2013). Even accounting for attrition, thatâ€™s a 9 percent increase in the number of police on patrol in Atlanta. And that growth came on the heels of furloughs that reduced manpower in the police department by as much as 10 percent in 2009 because of the cityâ€™s financial woes during the economic downturn. In the meantime, Reed canceled red light cameras, and that revenue, in 2014 and has said he isnâ€™t opposed to ending the deal with PARK-atlanta when it expires. That helps show the jump in tickets, and revenue, stems from the increased focus on public safety and is hardly a driver of the cityâ€™s budget, Torres added. Citations accounted for 3.5 percent of the cityâ€™s $552 million general operating fund in 2010 and about 5 percent of the $565 million operating fund last year. ""Itâ€™s not a money maker to just issue tickets,"" Torres said. ""The reason the city has a surplus today is because of pension reform, not revenue from traffic tickets. "" Beyond Atlanta That brings us back to places like Ferguson. Atlanta doesnâ€™t set policing policies in a vacuum. And given all of the problems cited in the Justice Department report, the cityâ€™s attitude about tickets is ""remarkable,"" said Karin Martin, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""I think you canâ€™t really divine motivation,"" Martin said. ""The language being used about increasing revenue is problem enough. Atlanta has its own socio-economic and racial divides, so who is subjected to this police force and is the proportion reflected by the population?"" In other words, is Atlanta over-policing specific segments of the community with its citations? We didnâ€™t get demographic details on citations, so that much is unknown. Given the cityâ€™s population grows by about half every workday, many of the citations are expected to be against people who live outside Atlanta but travel into it for jobs or special events. While research would support that an increase in police officers would increase citations, Martin said those studies generally focus on foot patrols and so-called community policing that assign officers to the narrow areas to build visibility and trust. If visitors turn out to be the bulk of those cited, it effectively makes the tickets a tourist tax, not the result of renewed enforcement in unsafe areas, Martin said. ""If people are afraid of having their purse snatched or to walk alone because of crime, you would have a reason to approach traffic enforcement as increased policing,"" she said. ""But that doesnâ€™t appear to be the explicit need here, which raises the speculation about motive."" Our ruling A reader reached out to PolitiFact Georgia, claiming Atlanta has issued an increasing number of misdemeanor citations since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010. The reason was money, the reader argued. We couldnâ€™t confirm the numbers the reader had calculated. But our research showed that tickets issued since Reed took office have increased, both when issued by city police and the cityâ€™s outsourced parking enforcer. Combined, the number of citations increased about 16 percent in that time â€“ and the revenue collected from them swelled a whopping 45 percent. City leaders have a point that some growth would be expected, given the private parking enforcement and the increase in officers in the city. Proving the motivation â€“ increased revenue, more focused policing or a combination of both â€“ is difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint. But even with the caveats, the statistics back up the claim about ticket and revenue growth. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/sep/11/reader-email/are-citations-and-revenue-atlanta/

Ted Cruz says deal will 'facilitate and accelerate' Iran getting a nuclear bomb
","Along with Donald Trump and the Tea Party Patriots, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke out harshly against a nuclear agreement with Iran at the U.S. Capitol. When the rally was over, Cruz followed up by tweeting out video clips of some of his comments. ""The #IranDeal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons,"" he said in a tweet on Sept. 9, 2015. His comment caught our attention. We wondered whether it was accurate that the agreement would actually make it easier -- not harder -- for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. What the deal will do First, letâ€™s recap what the deal would do. Broadly speaking, Iran would agree to accept strict curbs on nuclear technologies and intrusive access by nuclear-weapons inspectors for 10 to 25 years, with a pledge to abide by existing international treaties limiting its nuclear ambitions in perpetuity. In exchange, international economic sanctions against Iran would be lifted, as long as Iran doesnâ€™t cheat. If Iran did cheat, sanctions could be reimposed. Specifically, the deal requires Iran to give up 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium,Â as well as most of the centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium. In addition, Iran agrees to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years, and to cease production of plutonium, the other element that can be used to build a bomb. Known nuclear sites would be monitored for 15 years to confirm compliance, and inspectors would have the ability to enter undeclared sites suspected of nuclear use, though with possible delays of up to 24 days. If Iran were to abide by these rules for 10 years, scientists say it would take them at least 12 months to build a weapon. Cruz's case Cruzâ€™s staff did not respond to inquiries for this story, and we could find only one nuclear-policy expert who thought Cruzâ€™s claim may have some merit. Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it depends on whether and when Iran cheats on the deal.Â ""Thereâ€™s a some degree of assumption that Iran will cheat in this, which isnâ€™t entirely unreasonable given Iranâ€™s history,"" she said. ""Letâ€™s say Iran abides by the deal just long enough to have sanctions lifted and lucrative contracts signed, and then pulls out, you can make the case"" that Cruz does, she said. This might mean Iran sticking with the agreement for two years, then pulling out and pursuing a weapon, Dodge said. Still, even this scenario -- problematic though it would be geopolitically -- would enable two years of tight international scrutiny of Iranâ€™s nuclear program that would not otherwise exist without the agreement. And itâ€™s not as if todayâ€™s economic sanctions against Iran are expected to live on if the agreement fails to be enacted. Most observers assume that U.S. allies will begin loosening key sanctions whether or not the agreement is implemented. ""The European Union has alreadyÂ begun the processÂ of suspending its sanctions on Iran, and the U.N. Security CouncilÂ likewiseÂ wasted no time in passing a resolution for sanctions relief, though it delayed implementation for 90 days,"" Suzanne Nossel, a former deputy assistant secretary of state at the U.S. State Department, recentlyÂ wroteÂ in Foreign Policy. ""While congressional naysayers now trumpet the success of sanctions and demand that they remain in place, expertsÂ uniformlyÂ affirmÂ that their effectiveness depends on wide multilateral support."" Obstacles to an Iranian bomb All the otherÂ nuclear-policy experts we checked with said the dealÂ puts roadblocks in the way of Iran's effort to pursue a nuclear weapon -- roadblocks that wouldnâ€™t exist if the deal simply fell apart. They said that Cruz's statement went too far. ""The logic is astounding,"" said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. ""Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon."" Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School, agreed, calling Cruzâ€™s logic ""bizarre."" ""The terms of the deal require Iran to reduce its installed centrifuges by two-thirds, eliminate almost all of its stock of enriched uranium, modify its Arak reactor to drastically reduce its ability to produce plutonium, and to accept much broader inspections,"" Bunn said. ""Those actions would slow and impede any nuclear weapons effort, not facilitate and accelerate it."" This is not to say that there is no case to be made against the agreement. Opponents have argued that it simply delays by a decade or so Iranâ€™s eventual acquisition of a bomb, or that the United States and its allies should have negotiated stronger protections, or that by agreeing to the deal, the United States is giving its tacit approval to Iran moving toward a bomb after the dealâ€™s strongest provisions expire. But compared to letting the deal evaporate, itâ€™s hard to see how enactment of the deal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb. Our ruling Cruz said, ""The Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons."" The Iran deal may be less than perfect, but experts say itâ€™s hard to see how implementing the agreement -- rather than doing nothing at all -- would actually ""facilitate and accelerate"" an Iranian nuclear weapon. The worst-case scenario would be that the deal throws up a couple yearsâ€™ worth of roadblocks that would not exist otherwise. We rate the claim False. Correction: The Iran deal requires IranÂ to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 97 percent. A previous version of this fact-checkÂ described the reduction differently.",/factchecks/2015/sep/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-deal-will-facilitate-and-accelerate-/

Bush says Florida created more jobs than any other state while he was governor
","GOP presidential hopeful Jeb Bush implied in a new campaign ad that the jobs boom Florida enjoyed while he was governor can be a reality for the entire country if heâ€™s elected to the Oval Office. ""As governor, I cut taxes, cut spending, balanced budgets, and Florida led the nation in job creation,"" he said in a Sept. 8, 2015, commercial. We wanted to see if Bushâ€™s claim about job creation really put Florida in front of all 50 states. Tallahassee tally The time frame Bush is using here is key, because he is relying on a distinct slice of jobs data. His campaign said they are measuring total job growth for the period between January 2000 and January 2007, or Bushâ€™s last seven years as governor. Letâ€™s look at the way Bushâ€™s people have sampled it: Using Bureau of Labor Statistics data for seasonally adjusted, nonfarm jobs, Florida indeed led the nation in total job creation from 2000-07, with 1.1 million new jobs. Second in that time span was California, with 1 million. Bush took office on Jan. 5, 1999, however, so why leave off 1999? Because then the top two spots switch places. California created 1.48 million new jobs, while Florida made 1.33 million. Just looking at 2000 to 2007 leaves out context, though. First, the economyÂ began to falter a month before Bush left office, and the state started losing positions a couple of months after that. By the end of 2007 Florida had shed 106,000 jobs, many of which were from the construction and real estate industries that had expanded during the housing bubble. The state eventually lost about 1 million, or almost the entire total of job expansion from Bushâ€™s time as governor. And as economists have told PolitiFact Florida time and time and time (and time) again, governors have limited impact on jobs numbers in the first place. Officials often enjoy or suffer from economies beyond their direct control, and Bush was no different, said David Cooper, an analyst for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. And in this case, the end result isnâ€™t something Bush should be too happy about. ""Floridaâ€™s job losses in the recession were far worse than the national average and far worse than all of its neighbors,"" Cooper said. ""Iâ€™m not sure how much credit we should give to the governor for the stateâ€™s job growth during that time, and even if we could credit him, Iâ€™m not sure he should want it."" Also, the jobs during Bushâ€™s time werenâ€™t the greatest in the first place. Even the source Bush cites, a South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrap-up of Bushâ€™s two terms the Post reprinted, said as much: ""But while Florida led the nation in job creation, much of that was in low-paid service industry jobs that left many Floridians without health insurance and scrambling for affordable housing amid a real estate boom that helped fuel business-friendly tax breaks."" Former Sun-Sentinel reporter Linda Kleindienst, who now is editor of Tallahassee business magazine 850, told us she had used state numbers from the Office of Economic and Demographic Research. Her point was that while there were more jobs, many of them offered poor pay and often no benefits. And finally, using total job numbers to paint a picture of success isnâ€™t the best method to measure success. Florida is one of the largest states, so of course it would create a lot of jobs. ""Comparing totals completely lacks context â€” it doesnâ€™t really tell you anything unless youâ€™re comparing totals among states of roughly equally sized economies and labor markets,"" Cooper said. A better way would be to measure Floridaâ€™s rate of job growth, as a percentage of total jobs. When we measure that, whether we start in January 1999 or 2000, Florida comes in fifth: State Jan. 1999 - Jan. 2007 Jan. 2000 - Jan. 2007 Nevada 34.6 percent 24.8 percent Arizona 25.9 percent 20.7 percent Wyoming 23.7 percent 20 percent Idaho 22.6 percent 17.9 percent Florida 19.8 percent 15.8 percent Our ruling Bush said ""Florida led the nation in job creation"" while he was governor. This is true if you parse the numbers the way his campaign did, looking only at total job growth over the last seven years of his eight-year tenure. But there are plenty of caveats to the talking point, including the prevalence of low-paying jobs that Bush policies didnâ€™t necessarily create. Â Many of those jobs evaporated after the housing bubble burst. A more level way to measure jobs would have been to look at the growth rate, which put Florida fifth in the country while Bush was in office. There are many angles to explore in jobs data, and Bushâ€™s view only tells part of the story.

Matthew Dowd: Historic polling pattern points to Trump
","One big question in the 2016 race for the White House is when -- or if -- Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign will run out of gas. Trumpâ€™s poll numbers continue to climb even as he stumbles on questions about policy, recants his past liberal leanings, and makes comments that draw the ire of women and Hispanics. Given the conventional wisdom that Trump has so far defied some law of political gravity, eyebrows went up when ABC News analyst and GOP political consultant Matthew Dowd declared that Trump has the earmarks of a winner. ""I think Donald Trump, as of today, is the Republican nominee for president,"" Dowd said on ABCâ€™s This Week on Sept. 6, 2015. ""He leads nationally in every single poll for more than two months. He leads every single state, including favorite-son states like Florida, where he leads Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush is third. And any Republican that has led for two months and led every state has won the GOP nomination."" We wanted to check Dowdâ€™s history. Is it accurate that the Republican who has topped the polls nationally and in states that conduct polls this early goes on to win the nomination? Dowd told us that the numbers back him up, although he didnâ€™t share any hard data. He said he was thinking of every race since Ronald Reagan ran in 1980. Itâ€™s relatively simple to find national polls going back to the summer of 1979. Finding state polls is dicier. Limited Iowa and New Hampshire polls exist, and even those donâ€™t provide the two consecutive months in every election that Dowd said he had in mind. Dowd told us his list of states included ones such as South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. Early polling in those states is even spottier, especially during the older elections. But for the polls we could find, we found there were three years when the pattern Dowd identified roughly held up. Our sources include the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, Polling Report, Selzer and Company (the Iowa Poll firm), the Granite State Poll, the Odum Institute, 538.com, and political scientist Martin Cohen at James Madison University. To keep in step with where we are in the present election, we looked at polls in the spring and summer in years when no incumbent Republican was running.  Source: Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, Polling Report, Odum Institute, et al. Three candidates in three elections, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and George W. Bush, won the pre-September polling trifecta and went on to win the nomination. For the record, Trump has led the polls in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally for the past two months. Plus, heâ€™s in the lead in South Carolina, Florida and other states. These days, thereâ€™s more polling. But as you go back in time, you find gaps in the month-to-month record for all states. That lack of monthly state data weakens the support for Dowdâ€™s statement somewhat, but the general point holds up in the early primary states and nationally. A bevy of caveats The political scientists we reached donâ€™t put much stock in the predictive power of Dowdâ€™s observation. Martin Cohen co-authored The Party Decides, an assessment of the modern nomination process. Cohen, and others, see early polls as mainly driven by name recognition, a factor that plays itself out as time goes by. Cohen said the pattern Dowd spotted reflects forces that might be less obvious than polls. Cohen told us that endorsements by party leaders is much more telling. ""Most times the poll leader is the endorsement leader,"" Cohen said. ""In the few cases where the poll leader is not the endorsement leader, the poll leader fails. This occurred most notably in 2008 with Giuliani leading and 2012 when a number of candidates equaled or overtook Romney in the polls but didn't come close to his endorsement totals. I think 2016 will turn out this way with Trump losing to someone who has more elite support."" Political scientist Marc Meredith at the University of Pennsylvania discounts the significance of the polling pattern on statistical grounds. The claimâ€™s power rests on only three elections out of six. ""We just have a very little sample to draw upon, and no sample to draw on in this circumstance when we consider the fact that Trump never won a single election,"" Meredith said. ""So drawing on the experiences of Reagan, Dole, and George W. Bush may not be that useful."" Pollster and political scientist Andrew Smith at the University of New Hampshire Survey Center noted that while Trump might have the lead, his numbers are relatively modest. ""I'd be very cautious about claiming that Trump has any sort of â€˜leadâ€™ anywhere,"" Smith said. ""I'm not aware that he has even broken the 40 percent mark."" Lastly, Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University, said the number of Republican candidates in this cycle makes it harder to draw lessons from the past. ""The larger the field -- if the increased number includes realistic candidacies and not just actual or potential flashes in the pan -- the more difficult it is to predict a likely outcome,"" Goldford said. Our ruling Dowd said that any Republican who has led in the polls for two months running at both the state and national levels had gone on to win the nomination. Dowd did not provide the polling data he used, and the historical record is thin across all the states he had in mind. Going back to the 1980 election, there does not seem to be two consecutive months of polling in the spring and summer even in the states with the most polls, Iowa and New Hampshire. But the record does show the sort of early polling dominance leading to nomination success that Dowd described. Our principle is that itâ€™s up to the speaker to prove his claim. Thereâ€™s some substance to the statement, but not enough to fully back it up. We rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2015/sep/10/matthew-dowd/dowd-historic-polling-pattern-points-trump/

Facebook post claims Scott Walker wants to end Labor Day because unions have damaged the economy
","Weâ€™re marking two special days this week -- Labor Day and Patriot Day, the official name given to the day of mourning that marks the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The two days -- and Republican presidential contender Scott Walker -- converged in a meme going around Facebook that one of our readers saw and asked us to check out. In it, a picture of Walker is accompanied by this quote: ""Labor Unions donâ€™t deserve to have a national holiday. Theyâ€™ve done more damage to our economy than any recession ever did. Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11."" The meme indicates Walker said this on Sept. 5, 2015. Only he didnâ€™t. To be sure, Walker is no fan of organized labor, but there is no evidence he made such a statement. To the contrary, a closer look shows the meme was created by a group that mocks conservatives called ""Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off."" Dig even deeper and you find a disclaimer that says the site is meant to be satire. Theyâ€™re old pros at creating this kind of stuff -- and having readers unwittingly pass it around as if it is the truth. This Walker-focused meme has been shared some 2,800 times on Facebook. The ""Stop the World"" site is not new to PolitiFact readers. Our partners in other states have reviewed other fake statements involving GOP presidential contenders. Marco Rubio: PolitiFact Florida looked at a quote attributed to U.S. Sen.

Does the 8-hour day and the 40-hour week come from Henry Ford, or labor unions?
","On Labor Day weekend, itâ€™s not unusual to see claims about unions circulating on social media -- both favorable and unfavorable. A shareable graphic critical of organized labor caught the eye of a PolitiFact reader, who decided to forward it to us for a fact-check. The viral image said: Unions did not create: --Weekends --8-hour work days --A ""living wage"" (doubled worker's pay from $2.34/hr to $5/hr) --Five-day, 40-hour work weeks Henry Ford did in 1926 to attract better workers from his competitors for his automobile plant. Capitalism & competition creates higher wages & better working conditions. #HappyLaborDay. We wondered whether it was correct that Henry Ford, rather than unions, should get credit for creating the eight-hour work day and the 40-hour work week. A long struggle In the United States, a few limited eight-hour-day laws were on the books shortly after the Civil War. One, in Illinois, was passed in 1867, followed in 1868 by a law covering certain classes of federal workers. But neither law was well-enforced, and in most sectors, working hours of 10 to 12 hours were common. So a reduction in the work week became a leading issue for the nascent labor movement. The issue came to a head in 1884, after the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions -- a predecessor of todayâ€™s AFL-CIO -- called for all workers to have eight-hour days by May 1, 1886. When that deadline wasnâ€™t met, labor leaders upped the ante by calling for demonstrations. In Chicago, peaceful marches morphed into violence, with an explosion marring a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886, leaving seven police officers and four workers dead. Subsequent trials, executions and clemencies for the accused made the eight-hour week a top issue nationally and internationally. All of this occurred decades before Ford founded his company in 1903. Fordâ€™s move In 1914, at a time when most workers still lacked a guarantee of eight-hour days, the Ford Motor Co. attracted notice for instituting eight-hour shifts and raising wages in the manner the graphic indicates. (For many Ford workers, the work week remained six days.) The companyâ€™s move -- made a dozen years earlier than the graphic said -- was significant, labor historians say. But they add that itâ€™s worth noting some caveats. For instance, Fordâ€™s "" â€˜sociological departmentâ€™ had to inspect a workerâ€™s home to make sure they â€˜deservedâ€™ the $5 first,"" said Ileen A. DeVault, a professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell University. In addition, Fordâ€™s policy wasnâ€™t law, so it wasnâ€™t guaranteed to last indefinitely, even for those who qualified for it. ""It was a unilaterally provided benefit at the discretion of the employer and could be yanked away whenever the cost exceeded profits,"" said Robert Bruno, a professor with the University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations. Companies that operated this way, Bruno said, often revoked these policies when the Great Depression hit. The endgame Fordâ€™s initiative was not widely copied overnight. In 1916, the federal government passed an act to require an eight-hour day and overtime pay for railroad workers, but most workers still didnâ€™t have those protections, and working hours remained a hotly contested issue. ""Demands for the five-day week began to proliferate in 1919, a year in which 4 million AmericanÂ workers went out on strike,"" said Priscilla Murolo, a professor of history at Sarah Lawrence College. ""That was about 20 percent of the industrial labor force."" It took President Franklin D. Rooseveltâ€™s signing of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 for all workers to see limits on working hours -- initially 44 hours a week, then phased to 42 and eventually 40 by 1940. ""When the FLSA was passed in 1938, Saturday working hours were still common,"" DeVault said. ""Saturday noon was the most frequent â€˜paydayâ€™ time."" Given this history, Ford is best described as an early adopter of todayâ€™s familiar working hours, experts said. ""That happened more than 60 years after workers, through their unions, began organizing for an eight-hour day in the 1860s,"" said David Bensman, a professor at Rutgers University's School of Management and Labor Relations. ""When Ford adopted the eight-hour day for his factory, he was responding to a working force that had been demanding the eight-hour day for a long time."" Other experts agreed that labor unions, rather than Ford, deserve the primary credit for todayâ€™s working-hour schedule -- including Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Mich. ""Henry Ford was an early proponent of the five-day week, but the American Federation of Labor fought for it to be adopted more widely via contract negotiations,"" Anderson said. ""Unions absolutely deserve much credit for the reform."" Our ruling A viral image said that Henry Ford, not unions, created the eight-hour work day and the five-day work week. Ford does deserve credit for adopting shorter working shifts, but he was hardly the first employer to do this, and the now-standard working schedule did not become federal law -- and thus a right for all workers -- until almost a quarter-century after Fordâ€™s move. Meanwhile, experts said, unions do deserve credit for keeping the working-hours issue alive, at significant personal sacrifice, for 70 years. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/09/viral-image/does-8-hour-day-and-40-hour-come-henry-ford-or-lab/

Scott Walker rejected bill to make student loan payments tax deductible, Hillary Clinton says
","Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign will make its first stop in the Badger State on Sept. 10, 2015. The visit, with a private fundraiser and a public event at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, comes one month to the day after Clinton proposed a 10-year, $350 billion college affordability plan. That plan aims to reduce the cost of four-year public schools, make two-year community colleges tuition-free and cut student loan interest rates. Speaking about the plan the next day, Aug. 11, 2015, the Democratic frontrunner took a swipe at the Republican White House contenders and singled out Gov. Scott Walker. ""I think this is a major challenge and I want us to address it. Not one word from the other side,"" Clinton said during a campaign appearance in New Hampshire. ""And you take somebody like Governor Walker of Wisconsin, who seems to be delighting in slashing the investment in higher education in his state."" She added: ""And most surprisingly to me, rejecting legislation that would have made it tax deductible for you, on your income tax, to deduct the amount of your loan payments. I don't know why he wants to raise taxes on students. But that's the result when you donâ€™t look for ways to help people who are not sitting around asking for something, who are actually working hard every day to get ahead."" Some of the national press coverage of her speech focused on the claim. Politicoâ€™s headline was: ""Hillary accuses Walker of raising taxes on students."" The response of Walkerâ€™s campaign at the time wasnâ€™t a denial, but rather an emphasis on how he had frozen tuition in Wisconsin for four consecutive years. So, did Walker reject a bill to make college loan payments tax deductible, and in doing so did he raise taxes on students? The legislation Clintonâ€™s campaign didnâ€™t respond to our requests for information to back her statement. But a bill introduced by Democrats in the Wisconsin Legislature in 2013, and two similar measures introduced in 2015, proposed creating a state authority to refinance student loans and allow Wisconsin student loan borrowers to deduct student loan payments from their state income tax. The maximum benefit for the tax deduction was estimated at $531 a year for single filers in top tax brackets and $1,062 for married couples. The 2013 bill was introduced in the GOP-controlled state Senate but died in February 2014 without a vote. Democrats have since tried twice to push the measure forward. In May 2015, as an amendment to the state budget, the measure failed on a party-line vote in the Legislatureâ€™s Joint Finance Committee. Separate legislation mirroring the 2013 bill also was introduced in June 2015. The bill has been referred to a Senate committee, but no further action has been taken. The state Department of Revenue estimates the deduction would reduce tax revenue to the state by $79.5 million per year. So, a tax deduction measure has never made it to Walkerâ€™s desk. Walkerâ€™s position As for Walkerâ€™s position on the deduction, we addressed that in October 2014 when the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee stated that Walker ""opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans."" The reference was to the Democratsâ€™ 2013 legislation, which included the tax deduction. We rated the claim False. The group contended that since Walker didnâ€™t speak, or take action, in favor of the measure, he opposed it. But as we noted, no votes were ever taken by a committee or the full Legislature, so the bill never reached Walkerâ€™s desk. And while Walker didnâ€™t move to advance the bill, we found no evidence that he expressed opposition to it. We also noted that Walker had been quoted as saying he would be willing to look at measures like the Democratsâ€™ refinancing bill, but that he questioned whether the proposal was ""more than just politics."" ""If it was a good idea, Iâ€™m sure they would have passed it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly and the Senate and the governorship,"" Walker said at the time, referring to 2010, when Democrats controlled state government. One of the backers of the legislation, state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, told us that although Walker has never been asked to approve or reject the measure, his opposition to it is apparent. ""Itâ€™s pretty clear, if he wants a piece of legislation, it comes to his desk,"" Larson said. Perhaps. But it's unknown what action Walker might have taken had the bill made it to him. As for the rest of Clintonâ€™s claim, itâ€™s clear that because the tax deduction measure didnâ€™t become law, student loan borrowers didnâ€™t get the benefit of a deduction. But that didnâ€™t mean their taxes were raised as a result, which is what Clinton claimed. Rather, the status quo remained in effect. Inaction means nothing changed, positively or negatively. Our rating Clinton said Walker rejected legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible and the result was ""to raise taxes on students."" The Republican governor hasnâ€™t stated support for Democratic-sponsored measures that would have provided the tax deduction, but he has never rejected such legislation, either. Since Walker has been in office, the measures have never been approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature and therefore have never been sent to the governorâ€™s desk. Â  Moreover, failing to pass legislation that would have provided a tax deduction doesnâ€™t mean that taxes on student loan borrowers were increased. We rate Clintonâ€™s statement False.",/factchecks/2015/sep/09/hillary-clinton/scott-walker-rejected-bill-make-student-loan-payme/

Bobby Jindal, whoâ€™s No. 2 in spending cuts according to the chart but No. 14 in the polls, begged to differ and tweeted at Bush with a different chart that shows the former Florida governor was actually the top spender in the field. (Jindal has used this chart to tout his own conservative bonafides before.) .@JebBush may claim to have cut government spending, but FLâ€™s budget grew 52% under his watch https://t.co/BFGM4URs0a pic.twitter.com/VG5NUc6e7t We were curious about Bushâ€™s claim that heâ€™s the top spending cutter. We found that neither Bushâ€™s chart nor Jindalâ€™s chart is a perfect way to compare state budgets â€” but Jindalâ€™s chart is less perfect. Bushâ€™s chart The Bush campaign told us his source was a Fox News fact-check that compared the track records of the GOP governors in the race. It looked at changes in state spending, expressed as a percentage change in each stateâ€™s budget. Hereâ€™s the original chart from Fox:  ""The chart above shows that Bush cut spending the most. Though he's criticized by conservatives as â€˜too moderate,â€™ the former Florida governor cut spending by an average of 1.39 percent each year he was in office. Most cuts came from â€˜public assistance,â€™ higher education, and state discretionary spending,"" the fact-check reads. Foxâ€™s data comes from a National Association of State Budget Officers report, which breaks up state spending into four spending pools: general fund (the main fund and typically most flexible), federal funds, other state funds (which includes targeted revenue, such as gasoline taxes for transportation spending), and bonds. According to Brian Sigritz, the associationâ€™s director of state fiscal studies, Fox tallied up two of the pools â€” general fund and other state funds â€” and adjusted the numbers for inflation and population. We ran Foxâ€™s analysis by a few experts who told us that while itâ€™s a fair analysis, itâ€™s not flawless. (Weâ€™ll get to its imperfections later.) On the positive side, taking the different population sizes of different states into consideration is a good start, according to Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. Â  Itâ€™s also fair to leave out federal funds and bonds. David Crane, who researches state fiscal policy at Stanford University, told us he also excludes those categories when crunching the numbers in Californiaâ€™s state budget. ""If the goal is to learn if a governor cut spending, why would you include funds provided by a third party?"" he said. ""(Bonds) are generally issued for infrastructure, not operating costs."" Overall, the analysis created a way to measure spending that is mainly under the control of state officials. ""It is pretty close to a concept of â€˜tax supported spending,â€™ but still imperfect,"" said Don Boyd, who analyzes state and local fiscal issues at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. ""Overall, based on what Fox said they did, I think they did a pretty good job."" Jindalâ€™s chart What about Jindalâ€™s retort? According to his chart, Bush was the top spender out of the eight governors in the 2016 race, and his budget increased by an average of 6.08 percent every year. We noted in a recent fact-check that itâ€™s a more simplistic, and thus more imperfect, way to look at the state budget picture. For one, the analysis does not adjust for inflation. Thatâ€™s not an issue if youâ€™re comparing the same years for everybody, but the numbers may be distorted when comparing different time periods. (Bush was governor from 1999 to 2007, while Jindal took office in 2008.) ""If you're looking at different time periods, inflation surely would have been different and it can't possibly be an accurate reflection of the consequences of policy choices,"" Boyd said. For another, Jindalâ€™s numbers only consider the general fund. Given that some governors may spend more out of other state funds, just looking at one pool of money makes it more difficult to compare across states, according to Boyd. Limitations all around Experts, however, emphasized that thereâ€™s no one way or perfect way to compare budgets across states. ""There is not one single measure of state fiscal conditions that we recommend using,"" said Sigritz of the state budget officersâ€™ association. ""There are pluses and minuses with using each indicator."" Then there are limitations with the data itself. The associationâ€™s numbers are self-reported by the budget offices of each state, which Boyd said may affect the quality of the data. Moreover, the numbers also reflect spending thatâ€™s not supported by taxes, such as higher education spending supported by tuition. And because the governors all served at different times, itâ€™s unfair to compare them because they were working with different economic conditions. Bush, for example, governed during an economic boom, and Jindal held office during aÂ recession. Â  ""The Bush claim has some merit, but there are additional things one would want to control for â€” like economic conditions in Florida relative to other states â€” to get a better picture,"" said Auerbach. ""And, of course, what any governor does depends on the state legislature to a reasonable extent."" He and Sigritz both noted that economic downturns have significant impacts on state budgets, and spending usually decreases during recessions. To its credit, Fox tried to address the disparity by comparing each candidate to his contemporaries (i.e. Bush to other governors of the 2000s and Jindal to sitting governors). By that measure, Bush was still the top cutter. Beyond the question of who cut the most spending, experts said we shouldnâ€™t ignore how they did it. ""If, for example, a governor cut spending by underpaying pension contributions, or by deferring maintenance on roads and bridges, then look out below,"" said Boyd. As Fox notes, Bushâ€™s cuts came from public assistance, higher education and state discretionary spending. Much of the reduction under Jindal, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is ""explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid."" Our ruling Bush tweeted, ""I cut state spending more than anybody."" He cited a chart by Fox News that experts told us was a valid way of looking at budget reductions. Itâ€™s not perfect nor is it the only way to measure spending cuts. Bushâ€™s claim is partially true but leaves out context.

Georgia gas taxes up, despite pump price fall
","Anyone who took a road trip over Labor Day â€“ or paid attention to headlines over the holiday â€“ couldnâ€™t help but notice prices at the pump. The national average of regular gasoline hovered at $2.40 a gallon over the weekend and dipped another penny to $2.39 a gallon by Tuesday, according to AAA. Georgia matched that average, and Atlanta even fared better, with metro drivers paying an average of $2.34 a gallon. Thatâ€™s the lowest price since 2004 â€“ despite a change in the state gasoline tax over the summer that critics warned was a tax hike for Georgia drivers. PolitiFact Georgia already ruled claims about a tax hike as Mostly True. The chairman of Berry Collegeâ€™s economics department, writing for the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, suggested that media reports were ""surprising"" given the change would not and did not mean higher gas prices. ""Contrary to media reports, Georgiaâ€™s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump,"" according to the piece by economics professor E. Frank Stephenson and student Clay G. Collins. ""There may well be some good reasons to criticize the transportation bill, but hiking gas taxes isnâ€™t one of them."" Did we miss something in our earlier assessment of Georgiaâ€™s gas taxes? We decided to revisit the issue and, sadly, the math. The history As a reminder, lawmakers changed how drivers pay gas taxes as of July 1, as part of a larger transportation funding bill. Switching from a 7.5 cent per gallon and excise tax and a 4 percent state sales tax per gallon to a single 26 cent excise tax on gasoline is projected to raise nearly $670 million this year. In our previous fact-check, we noted that the effective rate then would jump from 17 cents per gallon to 26 cents, or 9 cents before local sales taxes are included. However, analysts at the right-leaning Tax Foundation pointed out that the price of gas would play a role in the final price. In short, prices werenâ€™t expected to jump 9 cents overnight. But the amount motorists paid would increase over time, as gas prices and inflation increased. The Berry College analysis Stephenson did something similar in his analysis. He and Collins (a student who did not return requests for comment) used AAA and gasbuddy.com to find monthly gas prices in Georgia and the surrounding states for June and July â€“ before and after the change took place here. In June, the research showed Georgians paid an average of $2.71 per gallon of gas. They paid about $2.63 a gallon in July â€“ a drop of 8 cents after the change in how taxes are paid. Stephenson and Collins used prices in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee as the control for market factors such as crude oil prices. They found the neighboring statesâ€™ average price per gallon was $2.59 in June and $2.51 in July. In other words, Georgia saw the same drop in gas prices as its neighbors, even though it alone changed how it taxed gasoline. In an email, Stephenson rejected the idea that change created a net tax increase, given those final prices. ""Market prices indicate otherwise because Georgiaâ€™s gas prices changed in line with neighboring states,"" Stephenson wrote. Â ""Your suggestion is that prices in neighboring states should have decreased 8-9 cents more than prices in Georgia but that just didnâ€™t happen."" Math matters The figures Stephenson uses in his analysis are easily, and readily verifiable. But does the price at the pump really mean taxes didnâ€™t go up? Not if you do the math, which PolitiFact Georgia did with the help of a second economist, Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State professor who specialties include public sector taxation. Using Stephensonâ€™s own figures, we first looked at what would have happened if, in June, the new tax system was in effect. That requires taking the $2.71 pump price, and subtracting the then-existing 7.5-cent excise tax to get to $2.62 and dividing by the state and local sales taxes of 7 percent. That leaves us with a $2.46 per gallon price, without taxes. Under the new tax structure of a 26 cent excise tax and 3 percent local sales tax on every gallon, the price would have been $2.79. In other words, there would have been about an 8 cent increase in the price if the new system was in place in June. And in July? Applying similar math, the $2.63 pump price would have been $2.45 without any taxes. And under the previous tax system, the pump price would have been $2.54 per gallon â€“ meaning motorists would have paid about 9 cents less had the tax structure not changed. Seaman said while it was an interesting point that Georgiaâ€™s change in prices was similar to neighboring states, the data likely exaggerates the point that the tax increase is just not immediately evident. ""My dilemma is he concludes that Georgia did not experience a net tax increase, even though when holding market forces constant, the math suggests there was,"" Seaman said. ""I have to admit, as Iâ€™m sitting here right now, I donâ€™t have a great explanation for why, even over one month, we benefitted more in the market than other states from the decline in refinery gas prices,"" Seaman added. ""But that doesnâ€™t change the math, that there is a net tax increase."" Stephenson did not respond to specific questions about the math but said the argument that the market is camouflaging the tax increase ""relies on having some price decrease that was specific to Georgia, was the same magnitude as the putative tax increase, and was at the same time as the would-be tax increase."" An 18-month review of gas prices show that Georgiaâ€™s prices have increased relative to neighboring states but did not during the tax change, Stephenson added. But Seaman said even that data had anomalies that ""are not inconsistent with Georgia having bigger price reductions, without the tax change, and lower prices than other states."" Our ruling In Atlantaâ€™s car-centric world, gas prices are nearly as hot a topic as bad drivers. So Berry College economist E. Frank Stephenson caught our attention with his piece that the change how Georgia taxes gasoline was ""much ado about nothing"" because an analysis of prices before and after the change show rather than increasing taxes, pump prices went down this summer. ""Georgiaâ€™s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump,"" Stephenson wrote in dismissing warnings of a tax increase. Stephenson is correct that average gas prices dropped this summer in Georgia, where we plunged to an 11-year low during the recent Labor Day weekend. He used neighboring states to show that Georgia prices dropped the same as states that did not alter their gas taxes this summer. That analysis, however, doesnâ€™t indicate what sorts of market forces could depress pump prices, even as a growing share of that cost is taxes. And, the math shows just what was predicted when Georgia switched to a higher statewide excise tax on July 1: motorists paying several cents more per gallon than they would have under the former system. If not for the tax change, Georgia motorists would be paying even less at the pump now. Stephenson uses accurate numbers but leaves out critical facts that provide that important context.

"['Environment', 'Florida', 'Ron Bergeron']","
No human has been attacked by a Florida panther in state history, wildlife official says
","A state wildlife official opposed plans to alter protections for the Florida panther, saying there was no pressing reason to fear the big cats. On Sept. 2, 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered a policy proposal that critics said would have undercut efforts to expand the population. Opponents said the proposal favored ranchers, who have complained about panthers eating livestock and potentially threatening family members. Commissioner ""Alligator"" Ron Bergeron said heâ€™d never had reason to be afraid of a panther. ""Iâ€™ve been within three yards of panthers, multiple times,"" said Bergeron, a Broward County paving contractor who has been a commissioner since 2007. ""There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida."" (Watch his comments here, at the 3:10 mark.) The commission voted 4-1 to approve the proposal, with Bergeron casting the lone vote against it. The group agreed to change the plan the next day, adding language Bergeron wanted to clarify the state would continue working with the federal government using ""available staff and budgetary resources."" The overall proposal still said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and not the state, will take the lead on efforts to grow the panther population in central and north Florida. We got to wondering, was he right about the felines never attacking a person? Well, none that anyone can prove. Panther primer Florida panthers are a subspecies of cougar that once roamed across the state. A male panther requires about 200 miles of open territory to thrive, so human expansion and development in Florida devastated the cat population. Since panthers historically prey on white-tailed deer and other animals, livestock often are a substitute. Ranchers would routinely shoot the cats until the animals became protected from hunting in 1958. The federal government declared panthers an endangered species in 1967, and the state did the same in 1973. By then there were as few as 20 to 30 panthers left. Theyâ€™ve rebounded since then to between 100 and 180, but that doesnâ€™t mean everything is great. A record 30 cats were killed in 2014, most by cars in Collier and Hendry counties. The panthers also had killed a record number of livestock and pets that year. While farm animals fare poorly when panthers are about, the cats usually give humans a wide berth. A Conservation Commission spokeswoman backed up Bergeron, confirming to PolitiFact Florida that in modern times, there had never been a verified panther attack on a human in the state. Thatâ€™s the wide consensus, and is a part of the agencyâ€™s website and literature â€” even in a handout that says what to do to if a panther attacks. We should note there have been cougar (or puma, or mountain lion, or whatever you want to call them) attacks on people in other parts of the country. For example, a 35-year-old man was killed by a mountain lion while working on his bicycle in a wilderness park in Orange County, Calif., in 2004. The same cat attacked and injured a 30-year-old woman biking in the same area later that day. In 2008, a mountain lion killed a 55-year-old man close to his home near Pinos Altos, N.M. University of Florida wildlife ecology professor Madan Oli had not heard of any panther ever attacking anyone in Florida. ""I am not aware of any documented/verified case of a Florida panther attacking humans,"" Oli said in an email. ""I think one can safely say that such an attack has not happened in this century, but I cannot say when the last attack â€“ if it ever happened â€“ took place."" The part about verifying an attack is what makes the claim tricky. Even an attack near Lake Kissimmee in 2014 couldnâ€™t be verified, because the alleged victim waited three weeks to report it. Gary Mormino, professor emeritus at the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg Florida Studies program, said word of panther attacks used to routinely fill the newspapers. One particularly harrowing account from 1899 said a man named F.D. Biggs was on a picnic with his wife and 2-year-old when a ""big catamount,"" a common alternative description for panthers, attacked the child. ""The cat bit Mr. Smith terribly on the arm, and, fastening its claws in his clothing, tore his coat and shirt almost completely from his body,"" the article read. Biggs allegedly choked the animal to death and displayed its body in his Thonotosassa store. Morminoâ€™s research showed that accounts of attacks appeared in the media up through the 1960s, in local papers and the New York Times. Whether they are reliable is a different question. ""I am struck as to how many late 19th- and early 20th-century century stories involve panther attacks and humans,"" Mormino told PolitiFact Florida. ""And I am sure these figures from the past who claimed to have been attacked by panthers were speaking the truth, for them. As to the scientific truth, I simply do not know and yield to the experts."" Our ruling Bergeron said, ""There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida."" While thatâ€™s the official stance of the stateâ€™s fish and wildlife agency, saying ""never"" is perhaps overstating the case a bit. There historically have been accounts of people tangling with the big cats. But many of those stories come from newspaper articles that date back a century or more. Wildlife experts agree that in modern times, there have been no verified panther attacks on a person in Florida. Bergeron would have been better served if he had used the words ""verified panther attack.""

Ramos: 40% of undocumented immigrants come by air
","Depending on which poll you believe, between 40 and 50 percent of Americans support building a wall or fence along the border with Mexico. Jorge Ramos, a news anchor on Univision and Fusion, makes no secret of his disdain for the idea. A few days after attracting widespread notice after being thrown out of a Donald Trump press conference while asking a question on immigration policy (he was later allowed back in), Ramos accepted an invitation to appear on Fox Newsâ€™ The Oâ€™Reilly Factor on Sept. 2, 2015. Host Bill Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s first question pressed him on the issue of a border wall. Oâ€™Reilly:Â ""You donâ€™t want a border wall. You donâ€™t want that. Why not?"" Ramos:Â ""Itâ€™s a completely absurd idea. Why would you want to build a 1,900-mile wall between Mexico and the United States if almost 40 percent of all immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas?"" Ramos is far from the first person to deploy the statistic that 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants come into the country under a legal visa and then stay beyond its expiration date. Two Republican presidential candidates, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have said the same thing. When we checked Rubioâ€™s claim, we rated it Mostly True. However, Ramosâ€™Â statement adds the wrinkle that these people typically arrive by plane to rebut the notion that a wall would stop unauthorized immigration.Â As it turns out, it's hard to prove how they travel. Actually, 40 percent might be too low The key research on ""overstays"" -- the working term for this group of unauthorized immigrants Ramos had in mind -- was undertaken in 1997 by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS estimated that overstays accounted for 41 percent of the undocumented. Here weâ€™ll add a bit of complexity.Â Immigration researchersÂ divide the undocumented into two groups -- overstays and ""entries without inspection."" The first group might have a student, temporary work or tourist visa. The second group never went through any review.Â  Robert Warren -- who helped with that work at the INS and now is a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, a research group founded by Catholic missionaries -- told PunditFact that not only does the balance between the two still hold, it has likely tilted toward the overstays. ""Since 2000, arrivals from Mexico, who are about 85-90 percent 'entries without inspection,' have plummeted, while overstays have increased, or stayed at about their historical levels,"" Warren said. Warren said the shift likely stems from U.S. efforts that have made it harder to enter by land. He sent us this graph from his latest research at the center.  Source: Center for Migration Studies Analysts with two other organizations, the Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute, largely back Warrenâ€™s overall estimates. ""It is likely that the 40 percent figure is still valid and, if anything, the share of unauthorized immigrants who are visa overstayers is probably higher than 40 percent,"" said Jeffrey Passel at Pew. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said his group uses a wider range for overstays of one-third to one-half. While heâ€™s comfortable with that, he noted it ultimately goes back to data collected by Pew in 2006. ""Itâ€™s widely cited and generally accepted as accurate, but it should be taken with a grain of salt because the estimate is old and characterized by some uncertainty,"" he said. Rosenblum said the Department of Homeland Security has developed a way to count overstays who arrive by air or sea, but so far, the department doesnâ€™t seem to have settled on an approach for people who enter at a land port of entry, such as the southern border. We reached out to a couple of agencies within the department, but did not get any information. Guesstimating the fliers If the 40 percent stat is defensible, the point that all those people arrive by air is much less so. In fact, the limited data we have suggests that whatever fraction flies into the country, it is less than 40 percent. When we asked Ramos for his source, he pointed us to a 2006 report by Pew. However, while that assessment provides the 40 percent figure, it gives no details on the fraction that arrived in an airplane. All of the experts we asked said they could only provide a gut assessment on this question. ""I have no information"" on the form of transportation used by overstayers at the time of their entry, Pewâ€™s Passel said, ""but I suspect that most of them do arrive by plane."" But Rosenblum noted that overstays represent about 16 percent of unauthorized Mexican immigrants, about 27 percent of unauthorized Central Americans, and about 91 percent of all other unauthorized immigrants. Using his groupâ€™s estimates of the unauthorized population, that translates into about a third of all overstays coming from Mexico and Central America, and about two-thirds coming from the rest of the world. ""Many, but not all, of the Mexican and Central American overstayers likely arrived legally by land,"" Rosenblum said. ""Almost all of the other overstayers likely arrived by air."" So letâ€™s assume that none of the Mexican and Central American arrivals came by air, but all of the other arrivals did fly in. Since two-thirds of the overstays come from places other than Mexico and Central America, that would mean that two-thirds of the overstay population (the 40 percent figure) came by air, or about 27 percent. Thatâ€™s not far from the result Warren got using a slightly different approach. He estimated that at least one-third of the undocumented population arrives by air. Ramos acknowledged the lack of hard data behind his statement. ""The important fact is that around 40 percent came legally and then overstayed their visas,"" he said. ""How they got here is another matter.""Â  A final note: The rationale for building a wall between the United States and Mexico is strongly linked to the idea that illegal immigration is fundamentally a problem of a porous southern border. Ramos, Rubio and Bush use the 40 percent figure to highlight that a large portion of the problem lies elsewhere. However, Rosenblum noted that does not make the two groups equivalent. ""One difference between overstayers and those who enter unlawfully is that overstayers have been screened and found admissible at least once, while those who enter another way Â -- mostly by crossing the border, or passing illegally through a port of entry -- could include people who would be inadmissible, because they have committed serious crimes or are on a security watchlist,"" Rosenblum said. ""This is a legitimate reason to be more focused on illegal entries than overstayers."" Our ruling Ramos said that about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants fly into the country and overstay their visas. While there is some evidence that overstays represent about 40 percent of the unauthorized population, and perhaps more, the best estimates of those flying in -- which are admittedly a bit shaky -- could be as low as one-quarter or somewhat more than one-third. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. Editor's note:Â Shortly after we published this fact-check, we added the word ""undocumented"" in parenthesis to our ruling statementÂ to clarify the context of Ramos' remarks, specifically that he was speaking of undocumented immigrants, not all immigrants. The rating remains the same.Â ",/factchecks/2015/sep/08/jorge-ramos/ramos-40-undocumented-immigrants-come-air/

Anti-abortion leader says Texas funding women's health services at historically high levels
","At a Texas Capitol rally, an anti-abortion advocate suggested Texas has hit a record pace in funding womenâ€™s health. Video of the July 2015 rally shows Joe Pojman of the Texas Alliance for Life initially saluting Republican leaders for launching investigations in reaction to stealth videos showing Planned Parenthood employees talking rather casually about donations of fetal tissue. The videos had been circulated by the California-based Center for Medical Progress, which describes itself as a group of citizen-journalists dedicated to monitoring and reporting on medical ethics. Next, Pojman told the crowd, to cheers and applause: ""I just wanted to emphasize, the state of Texas is doing its part... The state of Texas is funding â€¦ womenâ€™s health services at historically high levels; they just increased that level another $50 million for the next two years."" Pojman noted that none of the $50 million would go to Planned Parenthood. ""Texas takes care of our people and Planned Parenthood is not part of that picture,"" he said. Legislative cuts and changes, 2011-2013 Pojmanâ€™s declaration caught our attention in part because actions set in motion by the 2011 Legislature drove down family planning spending in the state budget by more than $70 million (from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million) in 2012-13. Also in 2011, lawmakers voted to bar state family planning aid from going to health care providers affiliated with organizations that perform or promote abortions such as Planned Parenthood, whose clinics had been the Texas programâ€™s biggest provider of contraceptive care and cancer screening, serving more than 40,000 women a year. Two years later, the state's ruling Republicans passed into law a bar on most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and mandated facilities providing abortions meet tougher health and safety standards, a move under court challenge that has caused providers to predict a substantial reduction in clinics statewide. After the 2011 actions, the federal government moved to cut off what had been a 9-to-1 match of federal to state dollars paying to provide contraceptive care for women who otherwise would qualify for Medicaid if they were to become pregnant. State health officials said the affected initiative, launched in 2005, had saved the state moneyâ€”$21.4 million in 2008, for instanceâ€”by reducing Medicaid-financed births. Federal aid accounted for $65 million of the money spent on the program in 2010-11. Reacting to the pending cutoff, then-Gov. Rick Perry announced state officials would assure such services were delivered through clinics not affiliated with abortion providers. The promised transition fully played out starting in 2013. So, given all this, could it be the state has set a record for expenditures on womenâ€™s health? Pojmanâ€™s backup cites state budgets We asked Pojman, executive director of the alliance, which says it opposes the advocacy and practice of abortion (except to preserve the pregnant womanâ€™s life), how he reached his ""historically high"" conclusion. By email, Pojman responded with a chart, which he sourced to state budgets, indicating that nearly $285 million in state and federal funds budgeted by the 2015 Legislature for several womenâ€™s health efforts in 2016-17 would exceed such spending in each of the nine previous two-year state budgets, dating to 1998-99â€”with the previous record being $240.1 million for such programs in 2014-15. The previous low, per the chart, was $128.8 million in 2012-13. Pojmanâ€™s chart attributed the touted $50 million in fresh spending to a provision in the 2016-17 budget stating the money should ""increase access to women's health and family planning services."" In his email, Pojman told us that at the rally, he was referring to total legislatively appropriated state and federal funding, not per-person funding, on four programs providing family planning or female-specific health care such as breast and cervical cancer screenings. Conversely, he said, he wasnâ€™t including funding for perinatal care, including childbirth. ""Planned Parenthood,"" he said, ""provides virtually no services for pregnant women, certainly not support for childbirth, except elective abortion."" Four state-overseen efforts In his email, Pojman said a February 2014 Texas Health and Human Services Commission presentation amounted to a good summary of how the state spends money on womenâ€™s health. From that, we pulled these thumbnails: The Texas Womenâ€™s Health Program was put in place by the state starting in 2013 to provide services previously available through the defunct, federally supported Medicaid Womenâ€™s Health Program. The successor program, serving women living at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level, ""retains the same program objectives and client eligibility previously provided by WHP and has expanded program benefits to include treatment of certain sexually transmitted infections."" Services offered in annual appointments include pelvic examinations and STD, diabetes, HIV, cholesterol, blood pressure and breast and cervical cancer screenings plus Pap tests, a clinical breast exam, contraceptives and family planning counseling. Family planning services, available to women of childbearing age and men living at 250 percent of the poverty level or less, offering the tests offered in the womenâ€™s health program plus sterilizations. Expanded Primary Health Care, a new program, offered to women 18 and older living at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, covering the services offered in the other programs plus immunizations, mammograms, diagnostic services for women with abnormal breast or cervical cancer test results, cervical dysplasia treatment, individualized case management and option prenatal medical and dental services. Breast and Cervical Cancer Services, open to women living at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, with breast screenings for women aged 50 to 64 and cervical screenings for women aged 21 to 64. In addition to services covered by the Expanded Primary Health Care program, BCCS assists clients needing to apply to Medicaidâ€™s Breast and Cervical Cancer program. In addition, a chart in the presentation included spending figures that mostly aligned with what Pojman had offered to us for fiscal 2010 through 2015--including the legislated decrease in 2012-13 and a rebound in spending budgeted for 2014-15 (which ran through August 2015):  SOURCE: ""Presentation to Senate Committee on Health and Human Services: Texas Womenâ€™s Health and Family Planning Programs,"" Feb. 20, 2014 (received by email from Joe Pojman, Aug. 6, 2015) Other analyses support claim Next, we asked the commission and outside experts about Pojmanâ€™s rally statement. The consensus was that spending budgeted by lawmakers for 2016-17 would set a record, though some advocates cautioned this didnâ€™t mean all needs would be met and others said that not all the described programs focus only on services typically provided by family planning clinics. To our inquiry, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission emailed a more detailed chart basically lining up with Pojmanâ€™s recap. From the commissionâ€™s figures, it looked to us like the appropriated 2016-17 funds for womenâ€™s health services exceeded previous two-year expenditures by $40 million or more. At the the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income residents, analyst Stacey Pogue said Pojman was on solid ground, though itâ€™s complicated. For instance, Pogue said, the 2015 Legislature called for three womenâ€™s health programs to be reorganized in 2016 into two offerings overseen by the commission and precise spending results remain to be seen. By email, Pogue pointed out a two-page summary of the 2016-17 state budget prepared by the Texas Womenâ€™s Healthcare Coalition, which says it promotes access to preventive health care for all Texas women ""working toward the vision of a state where every woman has access to the preventive and preconception care that will help her stay healthy and prepare for healthy, planned pregnancies."" According to this June 2015 summary, $260.9 million in spending on womenâ€™s health care budgeted by lawmakers for 2016-17 reflected an increase of $46.5 million, or 22 percent, from what was budgeted for 2014-15. We confirmed the latest figures in the 2016-17 appropriations act approved by a Texas House-Senate conference committee; it shows $130,321,510 in budgeted spending on womenâ€™s health services in the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2015, and $130,548,682 for the subsequent year, totaling $260,870,192 in the biennium. As noted by Pojman, the act also says that each year, on approval of the budget board, the commission shall allocate $50 million ""providing primary health care services to women"" including but not limited to preventive ""health screenings such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension and STD-HIV screenings; family planning services including contraception; perinatal services; and dental services."" Due to such spending, the act estimates that annually, 65,000 adults and adolescents would receive family planning services. Itâ€™s that additional spending, the coalition summary indicates, that makes the budgeted spending higher despite legislated reductions in spending for family planning (a cut of $1.5 million, or nearly 4 percent) and the Texas Womenâ€™s Health program (a cut of $2 million, or 3 percent). Alabama analyst Also to our inquiry, Heather Busby of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, which says it focuses on guaranteeing Texans the right to make personal reproductive health decisions including contraception and safe abortions, suggested we query Kari White, a University of Alabama at Birmingham professor and expert on womenâ€™s health issues whoâ€™s been part of a Texas-based team studying effects of the Texas decision barring aid to clinics affiliated with abortion providers. By phone and email, White agreed the state has allocated what looks like a record level of money to the efforts singled out by Pojman though she speculated by email the spending bump might be less dramatic than available figures suggest. ""The focus on funding allocated for the four programs on Pojmanâ€™s list,"" White said, ""does not entirely capture how some of the womenâ€™s health services historically have been paid for. For example, primary care services for women that are now covered by EPHC were previously paid for using other state-administered and federal programs (not included on Pojmanâ€™s list). By not factoring these programs into funding totals in previous years, the recent increase may seem larger than it actually is."" Spending per woman ""Also,"" White wrote, ""funding allocations do not reflect how effectively these programs are serving women. Â In other words, there may be more total dollars set aside for services, but since quite a bit of this new funding has been going to organizations that do not have a lot of experience with family planning, the state is spending more but not necessarily serving more women."" White suggested we consider research by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. In 2013, more than 1.7 million Texas women ""were in need of publicly supported contraceptive services and supplies,"" according to a July 2015 institute report that started from U.S. Census Bureau survey results. That year, the report said, publicly supported health centers provided contraceptive care to 281,170 women in Texas plus 47,390 teens. ""These totals amount to substantial proportionsâ€“but not nearly allâ€“of the women in need of publicly supported contraception,"" the report said. For our part, we asked the commission for help estimating the number of Texas women eligible for the health services. Could it be that even with spending up, less money is available per potential beneficiary? By email, spokesman Bryan Black provided a chart, drawing on U.S. Census Bureau surveys, estimating the number of female U.S. citizens aged 15-44 living in Texas at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level from 2010 through 2017--in other words, the women who most likely would qualify for the health services. Next, we calculated that some $109 per potential beneficiary was spent in 2010-11 and 2012-13; this was exceeded by the $205 per potential beneficiary appropriated by lawmakers for such programs in 2014-15 and the $236 per potential beneficiary appropriated for 2016-17. Our ruling Pojman said the state of Texas ""is funding â€¦ womenâ€™s health services at historically high levels; they just increased their level another $50 million for the next two years."" Texas lawmakers this year voted to appropriate more for womenâ€™s health services than before--including the $50 million bump. This includes funding for general health services such as diabetes and cholesterol screenings. It also may be meaningful that programs are under reorganization. Too, lawmakers started putting more money on the table after their actions led the federal government to cut off tens of millions of dollars for reproductive services. We rate this claim True.
