Has Pennsylvania added thousands of manufacturing jobs since Trump took office?
","The day before he toured a chemical company in southwestern Pennsylvania, Vice President Mike Pence touted the jobs growth that had taken place across the state since President Donald Trump took office.  As a candidate, Trump vowed to revive manufacturing, and a July 29 email from the Office of the Vice President says:  ""The Trump administration’s pro-growth policies added over 209,000 jobs, including 16,000 new manufacturing jobs, to Pennsylvania the last three years."" We wondered whether the Trump administration had created as many jobs as it claimed.  Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows slow, steady growth in jobs across Pennsylvania since January 2017 when Trump took office. But the growth hasn’t been as robust as Pence made it seem.  A spokesperson for Pence confirmed his office was talking referring to BLS data in its email.  There were 6,105,806 jobs in Pennsylvania the month Trump was inaugurated, the data show, compared to 6,249,391 jobs in February of 2020 — just before the coronavirus pandemic sent the economy into a tailspin. That’s an increase of roughly 145,000  jobs, or just over 2%.  But those gains have evaporated — and then some.  The number of jobs recorded in June — the most recent month for when data was available when Pence’s office made the statement — shows a net loss of almost 600,000 since Trump took office.  Pre-pandemic, jobs within Pennsylvania’s manufacturing sector grew at a similar rate, climbing from 561,000 positions in January 2017 to roughly 577,000 by February, an increase of 16,000 jobs — just like Pence said.  But 20,000 of those manufacturing jobs have disappeared since the virus started to spread. That means overall, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania are down almost 4% since Trump took office.  The pandemic has stifled the economy so thoroughly that it’s no surprise that Pence wants to focus on Trump’s record before the crisis began.  Earlier this year, when The Inquirer analyzed the health of Pennsylvania’s manufacturing sector, that record looked far weaker than it does today. BLS data at the time showed that after an early surge under Trump, Pennsylvania shed 7,400 manufacturing jobs from October 2018 through the end of 2019.  How could the data tell such a different story then compared to now?  It’s because the BLS routinely updates its jobs data as companies report new information on their work forces, and one type of annual update, known as ""benchmarking,"" can cause significant shifts in data at the state and job sector level.  In this case, the latest data shows that Pennsylvania only lost 1,000 manufacturing jobs between October 2018 and December 2019. The BLS did not respond to questions about what specifically caused the swing. Pence said the Trump administration ""added over 209,000 jobs, including 16,000 new manufacturing jobs"" in Pennsylvania.  It’s true that the number of jobs in Pennsylvania grew between Trump’s inauguration and February of this year. We can’t say who deserves credit for that growth. Regardless, Pence is talking about jobs figures prior to the pandemic. He doesn’t just get to stop the clock in February because it provides a more favorable picture. Using the most recent data, Pennsylvania has 600,000 fewer jobs than when Trump took office; manufacturing jobs are down as well. Pence could have clarified his timeframe to provide a more realistic assessment. But he didn’t.  We rate his claim False.

Attack ad right about Cunningham's 2001 budget vote
","A new ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacks the voting record of North Carolina’s Democratic Senate candidate. Incumbent Republican Thom Tillis hopes to fend off a challenge from Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state legislator. The new NRSC ad references Cunningham’s time at the legislature in Raleigh. ""Cunningham voted for over $1 billion in new taxes,"" the narrator says, adding that the higher taxes were applied to ""sales, healthcare, alcohol and more."" In an email to PolitiFact, the NRSC cited several news stories from 2001. That year, North Carolina’s legislature and Gov. Mike Easley approved a state budget that raised taxes and fees to generate $1 billion over two years, according to clips from the Charlotte Observer and News & Observer. At the time, North Carolina was the only state to raise personal income tax rates, a budget analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures told the News & Observer for a Sept. 22, 2001 article. The budget included a half-cent sales tax increase, bumping the rate from 4% to 4.5%. It also raised the tax on telecommunications services from 4.5% to 6%, and applied a 6% sales tax on liquor. It also included a half-percentage-point increase in income tax on the wealthy for tax years 2001 and 2003, the N&O reported. Cunningham has defended the vote, saying it helped North Carolina preserve its financial standing during uncertain times. Campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson said Cunningham’s efforts helped save jobs. ""In the face of an $800 million budget shortfall, Cal voted to increase teacher pay, establish pre-K, and reduce class sizes, while also helping families by providing a larger tax credit per child,"" Simpson said. In an Aug. 10 interview with WLOS, Cunningham said ""I think that was the right budget for North Carolina."" We asked local think tanks what they thought of the 2001 budget decisions. As you might expect, the liberal North Carolina Justice Center and the conservative Civitas Institute offered different views. Brian Balfour, executive vice president at Civitas, agreed that North Carolina’s credit rating ""likely would have been threatened"" if lawmakers hadn’t balanced the budget. ""The consequence of a credit downgrade would mean that it would be more expensive for the state to borrow money. The effect would be higher debt service payments, meaning that budget writers would either have to find places to cut spending or raise revenue to account for the higher debt payments,"" Balfour said. Civitas would prefer lawmakers cut spending.  Old news clips provided by the Justice Center show they believed lawmakers were wise to raise taxes to generate funding instead of using ""one-time fixes"" like draining the state’s rainy day fund. The Justice Center also estimated that most taxpayers, on average, would face state and local tax increases of less than 2.25% of their incomes. But both the Justice Center and Civitas agreed that the budget included what they referred to as ""regressive"" taxes, meaning they disproportionately hurt the lower class. They listed the statewide half-cent sales tax as an example. Balfour estimated that the sales tax cost North Carolinians $645 million over the biennium --  $246.3 million in the first year and $398.7 million in the second.  ""Compare this to the new tax bracket imposed on married filers above $200k, which was estimated to collect $228.4 million over the biennium,"" he said.  The NRSC ad says ""Cunningham voted for over $1 billion in new taxes."" Cunningham did support a state budget that raised taxes and fees to generate $1 billion in new revenues. Cunningham has defended the move, saying it was necessary at the time to preserve North Carolina’s financial standing. The statement is accurate. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A24C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/13/national-republican-senatorial-committee/attack-ad-right-about-cunninghams-2001-budget-vote/

No, receiving multiple ballot applications doesn’t let you vote more than once
","A common misconception going around social media is that people who receive multiple mail ballot applications can, in turn, vote multiple times, and no one would know. It’s the kind of situation floated by opponents of voting by mail to warn of possible abuse. A Facebook page called ""Just the Facts"" shared an image that shows five envelopes marked as Official Election Mail from the Fayette County Clerk & Recorder’s Office, which is in Illinois. The caption says the applications were sent to five different people at one address. The post claims that the Illinois couple who received them could easily use the applications to get multiple ballots and cast multiple votes. The post reads: ""A husband and wife received 5 ‘vote by mail’ ballots request. They were unsolicited. All this couple has to do is fill them out, and mail them in. They will be sent 5 ballots. Two people will be able to cast 5 votes with no one the wiser."" This is wrong. Election officials are required to conduct a verification process on ballot applications that makes it highly unlikely that such a scheme would work. It’s also illegal, and anyone who tried to do this would be guilty of a felony, and likely get caught. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  RELATED: Trump draws false distinction between absentee ballots, voting by mail Vote-by-mail ballot applications, like the ones in the photo, come from the county clerk and are specific to the voter to whom they are addressed. Voters must sign and return the application to receive a ballot. But before election officials can mail out a ballot to a voter, they check that the signature on the ballot application matches the signature on record. ""In this case, if a voter were to sign applications other than his own, he would be committing voter fraud,"" Matt Dietrich, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections, told PolitiFact. ""That’s a felony, and an easy one to catch since these applications are intended for the specific voters to whom they are addressed."" An Illinois special election law signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker in June requires local election authorities to send a vote-by-mail application to any registered voter who participated in the 2018 general, 2019 consolidated or 2020 primary election, by Aug. 1. The law requires that the applications be mailed ""to the elector's registered address and any other mailing address the election authority may have on file, including a mailing address to which a prior vote-by-mail ballot was mailed."" ""So it’s likely that some voters may be sent more than one application,"" Dietrich said. ""However, they will only receive one ballot no matter how many applications they return. Applications and ballots are mailed and tracked by a voter’s unique voter ID number. Once a voter’s application is received, any subsequent applications will be rejected."" Jessica Barker, the clerk for Fayette County, told PolitiFact the post is wrong. She said the county clerks of Illinois were required under the law to mail applications to eligible registered voters, and that it’s the voters’ responsibility to keep their information current with local election officials. The application-then-ballot process is common for mail-in voting, but not universal. In May, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, ordered all counties to proactively send out mail-in ballots to all registered voters, citing health concerns amid COVID-19. Vermont, Nevada and Montana have passed similar measures. But states have put safeguards in place to deter voter fraud and ensure each ballot is tallied correctly. In California, for example, when election officials receive a vote-by-mail ballot, the voter's signature on the return envelope is compared with the voter's registration card to ensure they match. The ballot is also separated from the envelope before it's tallied to ensure anonymity. Election experts across the country have said that fraudulent mail-in voting is exceedingly rare. For example, the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and public policy institute, found that Oregon – a state that votes primarily by mail – has sent out more than 100 million mail-in ballots since 2000, but has documented only about a dozen cases of proven fraud. A Facebook post says an Illinois couple received five vote-by-mail applications and will be able use them to receive multiple ballots and cast multiple votes.  This is inaccurate. Anyone who attempts to do this is committing fraud, and before election officials mail out a ballot to a voter, the signature on the application must match the signature on record. Each voter has a unique voter ID number that’s tied to a single ballot, so once a voter’s application is received, any subsequent applications will be rejected. We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE488C0>],/factchecks/2020/aug/13/facebook-posts/no-receiving-multiple-ballot-applications-doesnt-l/

Kamala Harris’ flawed Social Security, Medicare attack on Donald Trump
","A couple of days before she became Joe Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., jabbed President Donald Trump for threatening two pillars of America’s social safety net. ""Trump just promised that if he wins reelection, he’ll gut Social Security and Medicare,"" Harris posted Aug. 9 on Instagram. Harris was talking about what Trump said when he unilaterally gave workers a four-month break on the payroll tax that helps fund Social Security. Trump’s action, via an executive memorandum, said nothing about Medicare payroll taxes. The meaning of Trump’s words at the signing event were unclear, and spurred legitimate confusion. But Harris exaggerated what was known even then. And more is known now. Each paycheck, employees see 6.2% of their wages go to Washington — a part of the payroll tax — to help fund Social Security. At an Aug. 8 event at Trump’s Bedminster, N.J., golf resort, Trump signed a memorandum that ordered Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to defer those payments for four months, from September through the end of the year. That means someone making the median weekly wage of about $1,000 could see an extra $62 in their paycheck. (We say ""could"" because the memo says employers don’t need to send the money to Washington. It doesn’t say they must give it to their workers.) Deferring taxes means they would be due at some point. At the event, Trump made two comments to reassure the people who saw a little extra money. ""If I’m victorious on Nov. 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,"" Trump said. ""So I’m going to make them all permanent."" A bit later, he said, ""If I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I’ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax."" This triggered a debate over what Trump had in mind for the future.  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow later said Trump was talking solely about letting workers keep the tax holiday money.  But the Biden-Harris campaign took away a different meaning. Spokesman Michael Gwin told us that when Trump said he would ""make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,"" that meant eliminating the employee side of the tax completely. That was a possible interpretation, even if Trump lacked the power to make it happen. Trump’s temporary deferral on payroll taxes costs somewhere between $80 billion and $100 billion.  Trump said he doesn’t want workers to pay it back. His memo tells the Treasury secretary to ""explore avenues, including legislation, to eliminate the obligation to pay the taxes deferred."" If workers aren’t on the hook, then there are two options. The money either comes out of Social Security’s trust funds, or general revenues. The last trim on payroll taxes came as the country was climbing out of the Great Recession. The Obama administration and Congress dropped the tax by two percentage points in 2011-12. The total cost was $224 billion, and the law that made it happen said Congress would backfill the trust fund money from general revenues. The Biden-Harris campaign told us that if Trump had that in mind, he could have said so, or included it in the memo. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that the money would be made up with dollars from the general fund. The administration can’t promise that on its own. Congress, which controls federal spending, would need to pass a bill to make it happen. (That could be the ""legislation"" mentioned in the memo.) If Congress doesn’t backfill the money, Social Security runs out of money a bit sooner. Today, the combined Social Security trust funds are projected to be depleted as of 2035.  William Hoagland with the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates the cost of the payroll tax deferral at $80 billion. ""A hit of $80 billion not replenished would not gut the program,"" Hoagland said. ""It would only impact the date of depletion, possibly a year or two earlier than expected."" A final note about statements that came after Harris' post: On Aug. 12, Trump said that he hoped to forgive the deferred payroll tax payments, backfill those payments from the general fund, and eliminate the payroll tax for Social Security going forward. He also promised to find another way to fund the program.   The next day, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said, ""What he was meaning yesterday is that he wants permanent forgiveness of the deferral."" Harris said Trump ""promised that if he wins reelection, he’ll gut Social Security and Medicare."" Trump did not make that statement, and his payroll tax deferral does not affect the funding for Medicare.  The element of truth is that Trump offered no clear plan to replenish the loss to the Social Security trust fund, which could undermine Social Security. In the scheme of things, a $100 billion loss would advance the trust fund depletion date from 15 years from now to 13 or 14 years from now.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB85D300>],/factchecks/2020/aug/13/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-flawed-social-security-medicare-atta/

Johnson's claim that some earn more on unemployment than working is on the money
","A central part of the stalemate between the White House and Democrats in Congress over a new coronavirus relief bill is what to do about enhanced federal unemployment benefits. Democrats want to extend the $600 weekly payment, which expired at the end of July. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would create a new $400 payment – but only if states set up a new system and kick in a quarter of the cost. And some Republican lawmakers are balking at extending the benefit at all. That includes U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who in an Aug. 2, 2020 interview on WISN-TV’s ""UPFRONT"" program characterized the $600 in federal bonus money as a ""perverse incentive to keep people out of the economy.""  ""Depending on which study you look at,"" he said, ""either 68% or 5 out of 6 individuals according to (the Congressional Budget Office) are making more on unemployment than they did on the job.""  Is Johnson right about the stats?  And what about the underlying point, that the benefit is disincentivizing people from going back to work? When asked to back up the claim, Johnson’s office cited a May 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit that does economic research, for the 68% statistic and a June 2020 letter from the Congressional Budget Office’s director to U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the Senate Finance Committee chair. The National Bureau of Economic Research study indicates 68% of unemployed workers eligible for unemployment payments received benefits that exceed lost earnings, with 20% able to receive benefits that are double lost earnings.  The study noted that the $600 benefit, when combined with state unemployment, is meant to replace the mean U.S. wage. Most U.S. workers have weekly earnings below the national average. In contrast, most states base unemployment benefits on a percentage of previous earnings, rather than a fixed amount, the study noted. Meanwhile, the CBO letter to Grassley said ""roughly five of every six recipients would receive benefits that exceeded the weekly amounts they would expect to earn from work during those six months."" So, Johnson is on the mark with the numbers in his claim. Now, let’s look at the disincentive question, which is the essence of his point. Let’s start with the same CBO letter Johnson cited. It indicated the nation’s economic output would be higher in the short term with the $600 benefit.   That’s because in the near term, Americans on unemployment would spend the additional money, increasing consumer demand. To meet that higher demand, suppliers would increase production and hire more people – or call them back to work – to do so. So, extending the $600 could boost employment, at least to a degree. But the letter also noted ""the effects from reduced incentives to work would be larger than the boost to employment from increased overall demand for goods and services."" But other reports tie people not looking for work more closely to the availability of jobs, not to the extra money through the benefit. A July 14, 2020 Yale University study on the effect of the $600 benefit found that – when it went into effect – workers who received bigger increases in overall payments were not less likely to leave unemployment and find a job. Yale also found that workers with expanded benefits returned to their previous jobs at similar rates than those who did not get the extra money. Moreover, a June 2020 analysis by the Chicago Federal Reserve says those who receive unemployment benefits are more likely to look for another job more intensively than those who have used up their unemployment benefits. Indeed, researchers found in this analysis once unemployed individuals exhaust their benefits, their search effort decreases. The analysis noted that, before the COVID enhancements, unemployment insurance – on average across the country – paid individuals 35% of their previous earnings. The analysis said there is evidence that when the government extended the unemployment eligibility period in the past, the length of time people spent unemployed increased.  However, researchers found those collecting unemployment now are looking for work more intensively than unemployed people not receiving benefits. The intensity of the job search was measured in terms of hours spent searching and the number of applications submitted. In a television interview, Johnson said ""Depending on which study you look at, either 68% or 5 out of 6 individuals ... are making more on unemployment than they did on the job."" He gets the numbers right, and the CBO acknowledges a disincentive to work. That said, other studies found that those who are unemployed and getting the extra money are looking harder for work than those without it. In other words, those studies downplay the idea that the extra money is encouraging people to remain unemployed. Our definition for Mostly True is ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC2C300>],/factchecks/2020/aug/13/ron-johnson/johnsons-claim-some-earn-more-unemployment-working/

Doug Jones exaggerates Tommy Tuberville’s position on Social Security, Medicare
","The most vulnerable Democrat in the U.S. Senate, Alabama’s Doug Jones, leveled a traditional Democratic charge against his Republican opponent Tommy Tuberville. ""Tuberville is for privatizing Social Security and cutting Medicare,"" an Aug. 6 campaign ad said. This sort of attack is hardly new. Our archives are full of accusations that someone would undermine Social Security or Medicare or both. Democrats accuse Republicans, Republicans accuse Democrats, and sometimes, Democrats accuse Democrats. But Jones faces a special challenge in cornering Tuberville on policy. Tuberville is a newly minted politician who spent most of the past 25 years coaching college football, including a decade at Auburn, one of Alabama’s two powerhouse teams. Tuberville avoided any debates during the primary, and his interviews were more about values than policy. On these entitlement programs, Tuberville has given few details. In looking at what he has said, Tuberville has expressed an interest in private investment accounts as a substitute for Social Security, but said nothing about what that would look like. He said federal entitlement spending should come down, but said nothing about what he had in mind. A newspaper reported that he said he opposes cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Particularly on Medicare, Jones’ ad stretches what’s known about Tuberville’s views.  Tuberville has called Social Security a ""good"" program. According to one newspaper article, he told voters outside a Montgomery restaurant in February that he opposed cuts to defense, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Tuberville did touch on changing how Social Security should be funded in three early interviews shortly after he launched his campaign in the spring of 2019. Tuberville twice floated the idea of people putting their Social Security contributions into a stock market account similar to 401(k) retirement funds. He mentioned it briefly in an April 24, 2019, interview with television station WRBL.  Tuberville got into more details with radio host Dale Jackson on May 2, 2019. Jackson brought up the deficit and asked Tuberville what could be done about Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Tuberville mentioned a hybrid Social Security system, proposed by President George W. Bush, where people could choose to put some of their contributions into relatively low-risk stock market funds. The effort stalled as public concerns grew and opponents tagged it as privatization. Here’s the full exchange between Tuberville and Jackson: Tuberville: ""What we have got to do is start a 401(k) for everybody. I think President Bush was for this.""  Jackson: ""So, you want to do away with Social Security and start 401(k)s."" Tuberville: ""Well, this would be Social Security, but you would put the 7% in —"" Jackson: ""But it’s there, as opposed to being spent elsewhere."" Tuberville: ""And the government can’t spend it. If we don’t do it, you’re not going to have any money. So, it’s Social Security, but it’s a 401(k). Retirement planning, that was what Social Security was meant to be. It’s not a slush fund."" Privatization can be difficult to define. To some experts, Tuberville’s words come close. ""Privatization is often used more when the 401(k) is used as a substitute and tries to make use of current revenues to Social Security,"" said Eugene Steuerle, cofounder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The Tuberville campaign rejected the privatization label and said he never got so specific. Research consultant and spokesman Gary Maloney said during the Jackson interview, Tuberville was ""spitballing.""  ""Neither then nor now has he committed to any changes,"" Maloney said. ""Coach (Tuberville) is furious about politicians stealing the Social Security money of seniors, and he wants that solved."" Asked if Tuberville would consider the 401(k) option today, Maloney told PolitiFact ""the 401(k) proposal is off the table."" We asked the Tuberville campaign for any evidence that Tuberville had publicly rejected the 401(k) notion before we called. There seems to be none. At the time of the Jones ad, Tuberville’s statements on people putting their Social Security contributions into a personal investment account were the most detailed available. Steuerle affirmed that Social Security presents a daunting puzzle. As more people retire, there are fewer workers paying in to cover the cost of the money going out. Tuberville has said even less about Medicare than he has about Social Security. The closest he came was in a radio interview with Scott Dawson early in his campaign. Tuberville was talking about both Social Security and Medicare running out of money. ""Our elected officials have taken our money and blown it,"" Tuberville said July 30, 2019. ""Kicking the can down the road and trying to do other things we have no business doing, and it’s just an absolute disaster, and I don’t know what we’re going to do. I really don’t. We’ve got to make adjustments soon. We’re about to run over the cliff.""  In the May 2019 interview with Jackson, when asked about what he would cut, Tuberville said, ""Well it goes back to entitlements, where most of our money is spent."" The Jones campaign told us that since entitlements include Medicare, Tuberville was open to cuts to the program. The Tuberville campaign said in a statement, ""Coach Tuberville has not discussed cutting Medicare or changing the program in any way."" The Jones campaign said Tuberville supports privatizing Social Security and cutting Medicare. At the time of the ad, Tuberville had said he was interested in allowing people to direct their Social Security payments into a 401(k)-type account, which matches some definitions of privatization. The Tuberville campaign says now that he is not interested in the 401(k) option, but that was not public knowledge at the time of the Jones campaign ad. Early on, Tuberville spoke generically about favoring cuts in entitlements, but he did not mention Medicare. He told voters at a campaign stop in February that he opposed cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. There’s some support for the ad’s claim about Social Security given his initial comments. But the ad is wrong about his views on Medicare. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB9C080>],/factchecks/2020/aug/13/doug-jones/doug-jones-misleads-about-tommy-tubervilles-positi/

Conspiracy about Moderna, Gates, Epstein, Fauci and Soros is wrong
","In an online conspiracy circulating on Facebook, infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, billionaire investor George Soros, and financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are all linked in the ongoing pursuit of a coronavirus vaccine.  An Aug. 2 post lists a series of accusations against the four men and claims their partnership was decades in the making.  ""As many of you heard, Moderna is in stage 3 of their vaccine testing. If all goes well it'll become federal law to get the vaccine,"" the post begins. Then follows a series of unfounded claims, including: Fauci was the first CEO of Moderna. Fauci and Gates were roommates at Cornell. ""It was at Cornell that Bill Gates designed the RFID (Radio-frequency identification) and patented it under US2006257852."" ""Moderna was a pharmaceutical company that started in Germany under the name IG Farben. IG Farben is infamous for it's mass production of Zyklon-B, the primary gas used to kill millions during the Holocaust."" After World War II, IG Farben was ""dissolved and its assets sold off by a Nazi turned American by the name of, you guessed it, George Soros."" ""Soros rebranded the company as Moderna."" Jeffrey Epstein was ""primary stockholder of Moderna until his death...His role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections."" ""Let that sink in,"" the post ends. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This post is filled with many accusations, none of them accurate. Let’s take them one by one: No, Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc. does not trace its lineage to Germany. It was founded in 2010 with the mission of studying a technology known as mRNA to develop new pharmaceuticals and launched operations in 2011. Moderna is in phase 3 of a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine. IG Farben––formally known in German as Interessengemeinschaft Farbenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft––was a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate established in 1925 and made up of four other German companies: BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Bayer AG, Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft, and Agfa-Gevaert Group, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.  The company did create a synthetic oil and rubber plant in Auschwitz and used inmates for drug experiments during World War II, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. But after the war, the Allied powers charged top executives with war crimes, and the company was divided into three: Hoechst, Bayer and BASF. We find no indication that IG Farben has any connection to Moderna. Moderna did not respond to our inquiries. Anthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health has taken a leading public role in the coronavirus pandemic. He was never CEO of Moderna. He graduated from Weill Cornell Medical College in 1966 and began working for the NIAID two years after graduating, according to multiple sources including the Cornell Daily Sun and the NIH. He has spent the rest of his career in the public sector. Fauci was named director of the institute in 1984 and has overseen research to prevent, diagnose and treat HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria.  Gates and Fauci were not roommates at Cornell. First, Fauci was 14 when Gates was born in 1955. Second, Gates didn’t attend Cornell. He studied for two years at Harvard University beginning in 1973. By that time, Fauci was already working for the NIH. Gates later dropped out of Harvard and founded Microsoft. RELATED: No, Fauci wasn’t on the Clinton Foundation board for two decades Gates also didn’t have a role in patenting the radio-frequency identification tag chips mentioned in the post. Mario Cardullo was the first to patent the tag in 1973.  And while the patent number ""US2006257852"" cited in the post is a real patent, it’s not for the RFID tag. It’s a patent related to the disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). PolitiFact, along with other fact-checkers, has debunked claims that George Soros was a Nazi. Soros survived the Holocaust. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, Soros’ father obtained a false identity for Soros and sent him to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson, according to the New York Times. Soros also did not buy the assets of IG Farben and disguise the company under Moderna. In 1945, when the Allied powers split up IG Farben, Soros was a teenager.   Epstein began working at Bear Stearns in 1976 and was promoted to partner in 1980, according to the Miami Herald. In 1982, he opened his own money management firm called J Epstein and Co., where he ""would manage the individual and family fortunes of clients with $1 billion or more,"" according to a 2002 New York Magazine profile on Epstein. In the late 1990s, he renamed the firm to Financial Trust Company and moved the headquarters to the U.S. Virgin Islands to receive a tax break, according to the New York Times.  When Moderna was established in 2010, Epstein was serving a one-year probation after being convicted of sex offenses in 2008, contrary to the post. In 2012, he created a start-up business, Southern Trust, to develop algorithms and mine DNA and financial databases, according to the New York Times. The company managed to pay a tax rate of about 3.9% after generating a $300 million profit in 2013, and its corporate filings show no clients, according to the article. He would also start his own international bank, but it’s unclear whether it had any customers.  Neither Epstein, nor his management firm, are listed as one of the primary stockholders in Moderna, according to CNN Business and the Wall Street Journal. We found no indication that Epstein was one of the primary stockholders in Moderna when he died on Aug. 10, 2019. He was awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges when he committed suicide in his prison cell.  A Facebook post claims that the vaccine developer Moderna is connected to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, George Soros and Jeffrey Epstein. But none of the supposed connections are founded.

Kamala Harris’s sister does take hydroxychloroquine — for lupus
","In April, appearing on ""The View,"" Sen. Kamala Harris called President Donald Trump a ""drug pusher"" for promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.  Hydroxychloroquine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat or prevent malaria and to treat autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. As we’ve previously reported, the drug is not a cure for COVID-19, and research on whether it could provide relief from symptoms of the disease is inconclusive. In July, the FDA released a summary of safety issues related to using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. On Aug. 12, the day after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named Harris as his running mate, Paul Sperry, the former Washington bureau chief for Investor’s Business Daily, tweeted what looked like a bombshell.  ""DEVELOPING,"" it said. ""Kamala’s sister takes hydroxychloroquine."" We reached out to Sperry about the tweet but did not immediately hear back.  Fact is, this story has already, well, developed. Maya Harris, Kamala Harris’ sister, broke the news exactly four months earlier.  ""I have lupus,"" Maya Harris tweeted on April 12, sharing an article she had written for the Atlantic. ""I haven’t spoken publicly about it before now. But then coronavirus hit, killing black people at alarming rates & Trump unnecessarily put lupus patients—disproportionately black women—at higher risk."" In the story, Maya Harris writes: ""Not long ago, Donald Trump started talking and tweeting about hydroxychloroquine, which I have taken for most of my adult life, as if it were a miracle drug—a ‘game changer’ for treating COVID-19, the president insists. Immediately, thousands of people began hoarding it, causing shortages that have resulted in lupus patients—and their doctors—struggling to get the supply they need."" Sperry’s tweet is technically accurate: Maya Harris does take the drug. But, as many people pointed out in their replies to the tweet, it’s wrongly cast as if this is breaking news. Other comments make clear that at least some people are reading an unsaid suggestion: that she takes it to treat or prevent COVID-19.  She uses the drug for lupus.  We rate this tweet Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC954040>],/factchecks/2020/aug/13/paul-sperry/kamala-harriss-sister-does-take-hydroxychloroquine/

Tucker Carlson misrepresents Harris’ comments on women accusing Biden of inappropriate touching
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson mischaracterized Sen. Kamala Harris’ past comments on the women who in 2019 accused Joe Biden of inappropriate touching. ""How can someone who said she believed that Joe Biden committed sexual assault against various women serve as his running mate?"" Carlson said during an Aug. 11 TV segment. Harris, whom Biden recently selected as his running mate, said in April 2019 that she believed four women who described moments where Biden made them uncomfortable with inappropriate touching or kissing. But those women had not claimed that Biden sexually assaulted them.  Sexual assault refers to ""sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim,"" according to RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence organization. The Biden campaign declined to comment on Carlson’s claim. Fox News did not respond to our requests for comment. Harris talked about the women’s stories, which were shared over a few days as Biden mulled whether to launch a White House bid, during an April 2, 2019, presidential campaign event. ""I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,"" Harris said at the event, which took place in Nevada. Asked if Biden should enter the race for president, Harris said he would ""have to make that decision for himself."" Biden announced his candidacy weeks later, on April 25, 2019.  Sen. Kamala Harris on Joe Biden accusers: ""I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it."" https://t.co/wJJXCADAHs pic.twitter.com/9FJ05g2t21 Lucy Flores, a former Democratic state lawmaker from Nevada, made the first of the four accusations in an essay in the Cut. She described how before a campaign rally in 2014, Biden put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head. ""Even if his behavior wasn’t violent or sexual, it was demeaning and disrespectful,"" Flores wrote, adding that it made her ""feel uneasy, gross, and confused."" She told a few of her staffers what happened, she said, but she didn’t make a public complaint. In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper days later, Flores said the incident left her ""shocked"" and feeling ""powerless,"" but she added that the action didn’t amount to sexual assault. ""Never do I claim that this rises to the level of a sexual assault or anything of that nature,"" Flores said. ""What I am saying is that it’s completely inappropriate."" Another woman, Amy Lappos, said around the same time that Biden had touched her inappropriately during a 2009 fundraiser in Connecticut for Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat. ""It wasn't sexual, but he did grab me by the head,"" Lappos told the Hartford Courant. ""He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth."" Two additional women, Caitlyn Caruso and D.J. Hill, shared similar experiences with the New York Times. Caruso said Biden placed his hand on her thigh and hugged her ""just a little bit too long"" during an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  Hill, a writer, said that Biden shifted his hand down her back and toward her waist while she and her husband were posing for a photo with him during a 2012 fundraiser in Minneapolis.  When asked by CBS News’ Tanya Rivero if the gesture struck her as sexual, Hill said, ""I can’t say that that’s the case. I would call it extremely uncomfortable."" Biden responded to Flores’ allegations by saying he had offered ""countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort"" during his many years as a public figure. ""And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,"" he said. ""If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully,"" Biden said. ""But it was never my intention."" The former vice president addressed the allegations again in a two-minute video statement released on Twitter after the other allegations emerged. He said he believes politics is about personal connections but pledged to be ""respectful of people’s personal space.""  ""Social norms have begun to change,"" Biden said. ""They’ve shifted. And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying. I understand it. And I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility.""  Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. pic.twitter.com/Ya2mf5ODts Biden was later accused in March of sexual assault by Tara Reade, a former aide who worked for him when he was a U.S. senator. Reade said the assault occurred in 1983.  RELATED: Tara Reade has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault. Here’s what we know Biden and his campaign have denied Reade’s allegations. And Harris, speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle in April, stood by the candidate who would later pick her as his running mate. ""I can only speak to the Joe Biden I know. He’s been a lifelong fighter in terms of stopping violence against women,"" Harris said, adding that Reade ""has a right to tell her story. And I believe that, and I believe Joe Biden believes that, too."" When the New York Times examined Reade’s sexual assault allegation in April, its reporters spoke to seven women who had publicly complained about behavior from Biden that made them uncomfortable — including the four who spoke out before Harris’ comment.  The report said: ""No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden."" Carlson said Harris ""said she believed that Joe Biden committed sexual assault against various women."" Harris said she believed four women who, in 2019, alleged that Biden had inappropriately touched them in public or semi-public settings and made them uncomfortable. The women had not accused Biden of sexual assault.

Donald Trump falsely says Democrats don’t want to protect people from evictions
","President Donald Trump criticized Democrats at a press briefing at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he signed four executive actions on evictions, payroll taxes, unemployment benefits and student loans. Trump’s executive order on evictions tells federal agencies to consider ways to try to assist renters and homeowners faced with the threat of eviction amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""The Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction,"" Trump said at the briefing. He doubled down on that claim at an Aug. 11 press conference, but it’s false. Congressional Democrats have proposed and supported legislation to temporarily ban evictions and help residents pay rent. The CARES Act, a bipartisan coronavirus relief law passed in March, banned evictions for certain renters, including those in federal housing assistance programs. In May, the House passed the HEROES Act, a $3.4 trillion coronavirus relief package introduced by Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, which would extend the ban on evictions for renters and provide people with rent assistance.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews told PolitiFact in an email that the bill was ""unserious,"" in part because it includes a portion that would provide cannabis businesses with banking access. ""If Democrats were serious about providing relief for the American people, then they shouldn’t have rejected the multiple clean bills put forward by Republicans,"" Matthews said. Meanwhile, Democrats are critical of the HEALS Act, a $1.1 trillion Republican-backed coronavirus relief package that doesn’t include an eviction moratorium.  In addition to protecting renters in federal housing assistance programs from evictions, the over $2 trillion CARES Act also protects those in properties with federally backed mortgages. The economic stimulus law was introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., in January and passed in the House and Senate with widespread bipartisan support. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that the CARES Act’s eviction provisions covered between 28% and 46% of rental units in the country. That’s up to 20 million units, but the law’s four-month eviction ban expired in late July, and Trump’s executive order did not extend it.  Over 200 congressional Democrats voted to support the HEROES Act, which would extend the eviction moratorium for up to a year and expand it to protect homeowners. The bill would also allocate $100 billion to provide residents with emergency rental assistance.  ""Being able to give money to people to pay their rent then also helps landlords be able to afford the mortgage on the property, the utilities, taxes, all of the things that it takes to maintain a property,"" said Peggy Bailey, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The HEROES Act, which has not been voted on in the Senate, passed in the House along party lines, with 184 Republicans opposing the bill. Trump said, ""The Democrats don’t want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction."" Congressional Democrats passed and supported bills that set out to protect people from evictions, including through an eviction moratorium and rental assistance.

Cleveland FBI raid resurfaces debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine and American politicians
","A recent FBI raid in Ohio inspired a rash of social media posts repromoting a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine and several prominent politicians. One post was published by a Facebook page called Q Pin on Aug. 5. ""Q"" is a reference to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims the Trump administration is investigating members of the ""deep state"" for their involvement in pedophile rings. The post includes a screenshot of a tweeted video that shows FBI agents going through boxes in an office. ""The FBI raiding a Cleveland office linked to Ukraine,"" reads a caption on the video. ""(Joe) Biden, (Nancy) Pelosi, (John) Kerry and (Mitt) Romney all had sons getting tens of millions of dollars from no-show jobs in Ukraine."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 17,000 times, and we found similar versions shared by other QAnon-related accounts. (Screenshot from Facebook) The footage in the video comes from news coverage of a recent FBI raid in downtown Cleveland. But what does that have to do with Ukraine? And how are American politicians involved?  In short: They aren’t. Let’s break it down.  First: the raid.  On Aug. 4, agents with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service raided offices in Miami and Cleveland that belong to Optima Management Group LLC. Optima is a Miami investment company that has properties across the country.  The raid was part of a money laundering investigation that’s been going on for more than a year. ""The affidavit is under seal so I cannot provide any specifics regarding the investigation,"" FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson said in an email. ""I can say no one was taken into custody. This continues to be an ongoing investigation."" Next: the Ukraine connection. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reports that Optima is partially owned by principals of the Privat Group, a large business group based in Ukraine. One of those principals is Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky In the early 1990s, Kolomoisky founded PrivatBank. It became a key banking institution in the country, serving about half of Ukraine’s population.  In 2016, the government nationalized the company, claiming that it did not have enough capital to support its loan portfolio. The Financial Times reported that PrivatBank lent billions of dollars to Kolomoisky associates. In April 2019, the Daily Beast reported that the FBI was investigating Kolomoisky — who no longer owns PrivatBank and reportedly lives in Israel — for potential financial crimes, including money laundering. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of Ohio was also part of the investigation since Kolomoisky has investments there. In early August, the Justice Department accused Kolomoisky of stealing billions of dollars from PrivatBank and using an array of companies around the world, including some in the United States, to launder the money. Kolomoisky’s lawyer has denied the allegations. But how is all that related to Ukraine more broadly?  President Volodymyr Zelensky is a former comic, and Kolomoisky owns the TV station that used to air his show. Kolomoisky is considered to be a Zelensky ally. Which brings us to the third part of the Facebook post: the connection — or lack thereof — to American politicians. In 2019, a phone call with Zelensky was the subject of President Donald Trump’s impeachment. The investigation was prompted by a whistleblower’s complaint about the July 2019 call, during which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Biden family’s dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden served as a board member for Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, from 2014 until the spring of 2019. He did so when his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was representing U.S. policy on the country. There’s no evidence to suggest that the sons of Kerry and Romney ever held similar positions. We rated a similar claim False in October 2019. RELATED: Pelosi, Romney and Kerry don’t have sons working for companies linked to Ukraine Pelosi’s son, Paul, once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil, that dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name. It’s unclear to what extent the company has done business in Ukraine, but Paul Pelosi had no part in the new entity. Back to the Facebook post.  It’s correct to say that a company linked to Ukraine was recently raided by the FBI. But there is no evidence that the sons of Biden, Pelosi, Kerry and Romney got ""tens of millions of dollars from no-show jobs in Ukraine."" They are all unrelated to the ongoing investigation of Kolomoisky’s alleged money laundering. The post is inaccurate.

Cory Booker said the U.S. Senate is “dominated by millionaires.” Is that true?
","When talks to extend emergency coronavirus unemployment relief broke down last month in Washington, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker blamed his wealthy colleagues for the impasse.  ""I’m a little frustrated that a body dominated by millionaires, I’m not one of them, is going to focus on just a few hundred extra bucks and try to cut that out from under so many millions of American families,"" Booker said in an interview with NJTV News.   We wondered how many members of Congress’ upper chamber really are millionaires.   Net worth data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics for 2018, the most recent year available, shows that almost two-thirds of U.S. senators’ net worth exceeds $1 million. And a few of them are exceptionally wealthy.  Financial disclosure forms lawmakers fill out don’t require exact values, only ranges of values, so the Center for Responsive Politics calculates lawmakers’ net worth by adding their range of assets, subtracting their range of liabilities, and calculating the midpoint of the resulting range.  U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, are the body’s wealthiest lawmakers. Each reported a net worth of more than $200 million dollars, the data show.  Two other senators reported net worths greater than $100 million — Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate and Utah Republican, and Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican.  Fifty-seven other lawmakers reported net worths of between $1 million and $100 million, including Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, who is worth about $2 million, the data show. In the past, Roll Call analyzed lawmaker wealth by focusing on minimum net worth.  Booker’s comments came as the federal unemployment benefits Congress approved early in the pandemic were set to expire and negotiations over the next relief package stalled. Democrats want to keep offering unemployed Americans an extra $600 a week. Republicans want to see the extra benefits scaled back or eliminated.  Booker argued that the Senate’s millionaires don’t support extending the more generous benefits because they don’t know what it’s like to need that money for food and rent. But the Center for Responsive politics data shows that 25 of the Senate’s millionaires are Democrats who want to continue the expanded support.  Besides Warner, the wealthiest Senate Democrats are Dianne Feinstein of California and Michael Bennett of Colorado.  So, is Booker a millionaire?  No.  His net worth is $807,503, the data show. He has a checking account, a savings account, a pension, a money market account, and several IRAs. His staff also provided a copy of the financial disclosure form Booker filed with the Senate, and it shows the same.   The data show that Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey also has net worth below $1 million.  Booker said that the Senate is ""dominated by millionaires"" and that he is ""not one of them."" Roughly two-thirds of U.S. senators are millionaires, and no, Booker isn’t one of them, data show.

Misleading NRCC claim says Morgan Carroll 'racked up $11 billion in new spending'
","The National Republican Congressional Committee is running an ad branding Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll as a tax-and-spend Democrat. Carroll is challenging Rep. Mike Coffman, a four-term Republican incumbent in the 6th Congressional District, a crescent-shaped swath of Denver suburbs considered one of the country’s most competitive swing districts. The dark, grainy ad begins with an image of the U.S. Capitol building and the narrator saying, ""Washington has a spending problem -- and Morgan Carroll would make it worse."" ""In the (Colorado) Legislature, Carroll racked up $11 billion in new spending, nearly doubling the state budget,"" the narrator continues. For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the claim that ""Carroll racked up $11 billion dollars in new spending, nearly doubling the state budget,"" making it sound like she played a key role in the increase. In support of its claim, the NRCC provided documentation showing that when Morgan became a Colorado House member in 2004, the total state budget was $14 billion. The budget grew to $25 billion by 2015 -- and Carroll voted for that budget, NRCC noted. To evaluate the accuracy of the ad’s statement, let’s start with a brief primer on Colorado tax history. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. In 1992, Colorado voters approved a Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, popularly known as TABOR, a constitutional amendment designed to restrain growth in government. As PolitiFact previously reported, the measure said the government can't spend tax money collected under existing tax rates if revenues grow faster than inflation and population. Instead, the government had to rebate that money to taxpayers. These rebates applied to many types of taxes and business fees, but it primarily affected income and sales taxes. TABOR also required any tax increases to be approved by voters. When the 2001-03 recession hit, TABOR compounded a state government fiscal crisis because of it’s so-called ""ratchet effect."" As the downturn caused state revenues to drop below the previous year’s spending, TABOR’s rules restricted the government’s spending growth to that lower baseline and state revenues plunged -- even as Colorado’s economic growth rebounded.   By 2005, many people believed the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights was hurting basic services, particularly education. So voters were asked to approve Referendum C, allowing government to stop refunding excess revenues for the next five years and permanently eliminating the ratchet effect. The measure drew bipartisan support from Colorado's elected leaders, including then Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican. Anti-tax groups vehemently opposed the measure, saying it was a betrayal of TABOR. The NRCC ad hammers Carroll for raising taxes, citing her vote -- along with a majority of the state Legislature -- to place Referendum C on the ballot. But voters approved Referendum C with 52 percent of the vote, allowing the state to keep about $3.7 billion in revenue that otherwise would have been refunded to taxpayers under TABOR. We looked closer at the claim that Carroll ""racked up $11 billion dollars in new spending"" by voting for the $25 billion budget in 2015. It’s important to note that about one-third of that $25 billion is federal money, over which state lawmakers have little control. Another 30 percent comes from ""cash funds,"" which is money from fines, fees and limited taxes that are allocated by statute to specific programs, including transportation and health care. Lawmakers exercise most of their control over the state’s general fund, which was $9.6 billion in the 2015-16 fiscal year -- or 38.4 percent of the overall budget. Yet Carroll did vote for the Senate conference committee’s budget bill, which passed on a bipartisan 31-2 vote. What the NRCC ad doesn’t mention is that Republicans control the Senate -- not Democrats like Carroll. Both Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Republican Senate leaders praised the bipartisan collaboration on the $25 billion budget that was described as ""reasonable, responsible and delivered on time,"" by Sen. Kent Lambert, the Republican chairman of the the Joint Budget Committee. Outside observers questioned the ad’s suggestion that one lawmaker is responsible for racking up an $11 billion increase in the budget over 11 years in a Legislature that totals 100 lawmakers and experienced changes in which party controlled the governorship, and both legislative chambers during that time. ""This claim strikes me as a huge stretch,"" Seth Masket, chairman of the political science department at the University of Denver, told PolitiFact. ""If Carroll is guilty of this, then so is everyone else who served in the Legislature during that time."" ""Lawmakers are restricted in their ability to increase the budget,"" he added. ""TABOR restricts growth in government spending to where spending was the previous fiscal year, plus inflation and population growth. But basically, the Joint Budget Committee in the Legislature puts together a budget resolution, and Carroll, along with a majority of legislators, voted to approve it."" Our ruling The NRCC said Morgan Carroll ""racked up $11 billion in new spending,"" implying that she had a key role in ""nearly doubling the state budget."" Carroll did vote for a $25 billion budget in 2015, but the Democrat was joined by a vast majority of lawmakers in a Republican-controlled Senate. The budget’s passage was hailed as a bipartisan accomplishment by both parties. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. While the NRCC ad focuses on the total budget, lawmakers’ control is largely limited to the general fund, which in 2015 was 38.4 percent of the overall budget. The NRCC’s misleading ad exaggerates Carroll’s responsibility for the budget increase.

Claims that Hillary Clinton wore earpiece at debate don't hold up
","The Internet had lots of questions about the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here’s one of them: Was Clinton wearing an earpiece? ""Has Hillary Been Caught Cheating (Again)?"" asked Charisma News, a Christian political website. ""Was Hillary Wired for Trump Debate?"" asked the conservative website World Net Daily. The U.K.-based Express website summarized, ""Did Hillary Clinton wear an earpiece to CHEAT the US debate? Conspiracy theory sweeps web."" It’s not the first time Clinton has faced such suggestions. As Snopes.com has noted, some questioned whether Clinton had been wearing one at NBC’s commander-in-chief forum on Sept. 7. Snopes concluded that there was ""nothing unusual"" and what viewers were seeing ""most likely captured a light source temporarily reflecting on Clinton's ear."" A reader suggested we check out what happened at the first debate -- an even higher-profile event with upward of 80 million Americans watching. So we will. (Snopes gave a False rating to a related claim that Clinton had a bulge in the back of her jacket at the debate that could have been a ""coughing prevention machine."") The original post, at Charisma News, said the device ""was meant to match her skin tone almost perfectly."" The article speculated that the device could be a hearing aid, an ""inductive earpiece"" used by actors to better hear cues, or an ""anti-seizure device."" ""None of these paint a particularly good picture for the Democratic presidential nominee. Either she has an as-yet undisclosed health condition, ranging from mild to severe, or she's been cheating during the televised debates,"" the article says. For the record, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that Clinton ""was not wearing an earpiece."" Asked whether she has a hearing aid, he said, ""No."" So, let’s take a look at the original evidence offered -- a Reuters photo and an enlargement that some say show the suspicious, fleshy bulge in Clinton’s ear.  To be honest, we don’t see any device in this image. (What’s more flesh-like than flesh itself?) But we decided to look at some other images in our wire service archive to see if anything else made her ear look unusual. When we reached out to Charisma News, an editor suggested that we contact the author of the article. We emailed him the images, but we did not hear back. Image 1 (Damon Winter/New York Times)  Close-up  Image 2 (Doug Mills/New York Times)  Close-up  Image 3 (Associated Press/David Goldman)  Close-up  Image 4 (Associated Press/David Goldman)  Close-up  In these four close-ups, we see nothing that mirrors what the original Reuters image showed (which, again, didn’t even look like a device to us). We just see a lot of ear flesh. When we ran these images by Richard Quindry, a Philadelphia-area photographic and Photoshop expert, he said that only image 2 could even potentially show anything -- the narrow white form inside the ear canal. But even saying that that shape is something other than skin would be speculative at best, he said. Each of the other images -- as well as the original Reuters image -- show ""nothing"" to support a claim that she used an earpiece, Quindry said.

Donald Trump and Lester Holt clash over whether stop-and-frisk is constitutional in New York
","Donald Trump has been pushing for cities to expand stop-and-frisk policies in order to combat crime, but some argue it’s a form of racial profiling. At the Sept. 26 presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said the country needs to ""bring back law and order"" in inner cities and praised stop-and-frisk policies in Chicago and New York. Then Holt jumped in with what sounded like a  fact-check. ""Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men,"" Holt posed to Trump. ""No, you're wrong,"" Trump responded. ""It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed."" Whenever there’s a disagreement over who has their facts right, we’re compelled to sort it out. So the question of whether stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York piqued our interest. As it turns out, Holt and Trump are both a little bit right and a little bit wrong. But Trump's more wrong than Holt. Stop-and-frisk is the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person (the stop), then patting the person down for weapons (the frisk). Stops and frisks are legal, in New York and everywhere else. In its decision in the 1968 case Terry vs. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that an officer can legally stop a person if the officer has reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. And if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that this person is armed, he or she can legally frisk the person for weapons. Because of that reasonable suspicion standard, the court said these stops would be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure. A 2013 case before the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Floyd vs. City of New York, raised the issue of the constitutionality of New York City’s stop-and-frisk policies between 2004 and 2012. Judge Shira Scheindlin found that New York City had been conducting unconstitutional stops and frisks on two grounds: Officers were stopping and frisking people without reasonable suspicion, in violation of Terry and the Fourth Amendment; and a disproportionate number of those stopped and frisked were minorities, in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. ""Both statistical and anecdotal evidence showed that minorities are indeed treated differently than whites,"" Scheindlin wrote in her opinion. ""For example, once a stop is made, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be subjected to the use of force than whites, despite the fact that whites are more likely to be found with weapons or contraband."" So Holt was right to note that a court found New York City had an unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy because police had been disproportionately targeting black and Hispanic people. But the Floyd case was specific to New York City’s particular way of conducting stops and frisks between 2004 and 2012. Scheindlin did not rule all stops and frisks unconstitutional, and her findings were consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Terry. Scheindlin ruled that New York City could continue to conduct stops and frisks as long as they made some changes. ""Stop-and-frisk was not outlawed,"" said Andrew Schaffer, former deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York Police Department and an adjunct professor at New York University Law School. The ruling only sought to correct a supposed problem of officers making stops without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and disproportionately stopping black and Hispanic people. Schaffer added, ""The Floyd decision in New York did not and could not overrule Terry."" ""The judge made it very clear that she was not finding stop-and-frisk as a general practice unconstitutional,"" said David Rudovsky, a leading civil rights attorney and senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. So Holt’s claim — ""stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York"" — isn’t quite precise because it makes it seem as if the judge decided that all stops and frisks were unconstitutional in New York, when really her ruling said New York had to stop and frisk differently. New York cops still stop and frisk today. But it also isn’t quite correct for Trump to call Holt’s claim ""wrong"" because that implies there was no finding of unconstitutionality in New York’s practices or that Scheindlin’s ruling was tossed out, when really it still stands. There might be some confusion in the public conversation over stop-and-frisk because it seems the public has come to associate the phrase ""stop-and-frisk"" with unconstitutional practices, like officers stopping people for no reason, said Ian Weinstein, professor at the Fordham University School of Law in New York. ""Constitutional stop-and-frisk is legal across America, and the unconstitutional version is illegal across America,"" Weinstein said.   For some additional context, we wanted to know what Trump was talking about when he said the case ""was taken away"" from Scheindlin. After Scheindlin ruled against them, lawyers representing New York City went to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a rung above Scheindlin’s court. A panel of Second Circuit judges decided to remove Scheindlin from all future proceedings in the Floyd case because Scheindlin had spoken to the media while the case was pending and because the panel believed Floyd had been inappropriately assigned to her. The panel did not make this decision because Scheindlin was ""anti-police,"" as Trump said in the debate. The panel also did not reverse or throw out Scheindlin’s ruling. A few months later, at the start of 2014, Bill de Blasio replaced Michael Bloomberg as the mayor of New York, and he decided to drop the appeal, accept Scheindlin’s ruling, and dramatically reduce the frequency of stops and frisks in New York City. Our ruling Responding to the assertion that stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, Trump said ""no, you’re wrong."" Trump has a point that a judge’s ruling in a 2013 case did not declare stop-and-frisk as a general practice unconstitutional in New York. Stop-and-frisk is still legal and still takes place in New York and across the country. But his claim ignores that a judge did decide that the manner in which New York previously conducted stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and that her ruling still stands. Trump had argued that stop-and-frisk was working effectively in New York City to reduce crime during the time period covered by the lawsuit. Trump’s statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC63E440>],/factchecks/2016/sep/28/donald-trump/debate-donald-trump-says-stop-and-frisk-constituti/

Has Maggie Hassan missed nearly every board meeting for the University System of New Hampshire?
","With New Hampshire students perennially saddled with one of the highest tuition rates in the country, Republicans are using higher education to attack Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat who is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte for her Senate seat this November. An ad put out by the National Republican Senatorial Committee reminds viewers that Granite State students attending New Hampshire’s public colleges will pay more than in-state students in basically every other state in the country. ""Hassan raised college tuition making New Hampshire the highest in America,"" the narrator says, ""Today, New Hampshire students are leaving to find affordable education, taking jobs with them."" The ad suggests that Hassan has been oblivious as the situation reaches a crisis point. ""Hassan missed nearly every University system board meeting. Maggie Hassan failed our students. She just hasn’t done her job,"" the ad concludes. The line was repeated again by New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Jennifer Horn on Sept. 16, after Hassan publicly criticized the University of New Hampshire for spending $1 million that a former librarian donated to the school to fund a video scoreboard for their football stadium. ""Just like a typical Washington politician, Hassan issues indignant statements when it's politically convenient, but doesn't bother to show up when it actually matters,"" Horn said in a statement which blasted Hassan for her ""excessive absences."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check out Hassan’s attendance record for the university system board meetings. As governor, Hassan is an ex-officio member of the 27-member board of trustees that oversees the University System of New Hampshire. She can make motions and vote at meetings. The USNH oversees the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Granite State College and Keene State College. The board of trustees is responsible for strategic planning, setting policies, and ensuring the system’s financial health. It usually meets about four times a year, excepting special meetings. Looking back at the minutes, the Republicans are correct: Hassan has missed every single USNH board meeting since she took office, except one on June 28, 2013, when she briefly called in and made a motion to freeze tuition, according to meeting minutes provided by a USNH official. On the other hand, skipping trustee meetings isn’t unusual for a New Hampshire governor. Hassan’s predecessor, former Gov. John Lynch, a fellow Democrat, also made it to a single meeting -- on February 16, 2006 -- during his eight-year tenure as governor. Former Gov. Craig Benson, a Republican who served a single two-year term before Lynch, doesn’t appear to have attended a meeting at all, although meeting minutes for 2004, his second year in office, appear to be partially missing. None of these governors were necessarily shirking their responsibilities. Former USNH Chancellor Edward MacKay said he recalled governors going back to Hugh Gallen -- a Democrat who served from 1979 to 1982 -- attending ""at least one"" meeting during their tenure, but added that they ""focused their time on broader issues facing the state and the associated management duties."" The governor’s job is a big one, MacKay said, adding that it’s commonly believed that the day-to-day running of the USNH is better left to those with the time to focus on it. ""In New Hampshire, the governor has very limited staff and has many more operational responsibilities than is the case in many states,"" said MacKay, who is currently the Higher Education Division Director at the New Hampshire Department of Education. ""There is an expectation the governor will need to focus on those duties and the chair of the USNH and/or the chancellor will inform the governor of critical policy issues."" Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan ""missed nearly every university system board meeting."" The governor is a sitting member of the University System of New Hampshire’s board of trustees, which gives her the power to make motions and vote. Hassan missed all but one meeting during her tenure as governor, and even the meeting she participated in came via phone call. That said, Hassan’s behavior is not out of place -- previous governors’ attendance has been similarly sparse, producing little expectation that the state’s chief executive will attend the meetings as a rule. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA23500>],/factchecks/2016/sep/28/national-republican-senatorial-committee/has-maggie-hassan-missed-nearly-every-trustee-meet/

Duckworth stretches Super PAC claim against Kirk
","In campaign fundraising email after campaign fundraising email, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Tammy Duckworth notes that, unlike her opponent Republican Mark Kirk, she isn’t benefitting from a Super PAC and needs donations from average Illinoisans. Duckworth repeatedly references hedge-fund-billionaire Super PACs supporting Kirk, says she doesn’t have any such help and is counting on ""your support."" In an August 31 email, she says, ""But while our campaign has always been about supporters like you, Republican Mark Kirk is outsourcing his campaign to a Super PAC funded almost exclusively by a bunch of hedge fund billionaires. ... I don’t have a Super PAC. I’m counting on your support to continue traveling the state and spreading the word about how I hope to serve working families in the U.S. Senate."" Another fundraising email from Sept. 19 says, ""We have a real shot here in Illinois at flipping this Republican seat blue, but we’re up against a flood of super PAC spending that could derail our campaign."" The matchup between incumbent Kirk and Duckworth is on the national radar of both political parties and numerous outside groups as it’s considered one of a handful of races key to determining whether Republicans keep majority control of the Senate. Because of that, it could be expected the candidates, party committees and Super PACs would fundraise heavily. So we wondered whether Duckworth’s repeated claims were true. Super PAC influence Super PACs can raise unlimited funds, but they cannot coordinate with a candidate or give directly to a candidate or a candidate’s campaign. That type of outsourcing a campaign to another entity is illegal. Citizens, corporations and organizations face strict limits on how much they can give when they give directly to a candidate. We asked Duckworth’s campaign manager, Matt McGrath, what the campaign’s source was for the claim that Kirk is ""outsourcing his campaign to a super Pac."" McGrath noted news stories referencing Independent Voice for Illinois, a Super PAC, or independent expenditure committee, run by Kirk’s former chief of staff and former campaign manager, Eric Elk. McGrath said in an email, ""We deduced it by looking at its leadership and public disclosures of its donors, and independent entities who know this stuff inside and out, like opensecrets.org, have confirmed it."" Open Secrets, a nonpartisan project of the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks and tallies money in U.S. politics, does show the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC so far has raised nearly $1.3 million, spending $1.17 million against Duckworth and $117,000 in support of Kirk. Elk has confirmed his involvement in the Super PAC in both the Chicago Sun-Times and Springfield State Journal-Register. He previously described the PAC as supporting the election of people who support ""common sense values"" of Illinoisans. Further, the main contributors to the Independent Voice Super PAC are hedge-fund operators and employees as well as entrepreneurs. The Center for Responsive Politics recently took a deeper look at the Senate race in Illinois: ""Outside spending in the 2016 face-off has, thus far, disproportionately benefited Kirk. More than $1.6 million has been spent to back the incumbent or oppose Duckworth, while comparable outlays to help Duckworth come to less than half that, $713,901 to date."" ""Chief among the active outside groups is Independent Voice for Illinois,"" the Center’s story continued, ""which has spent a little less than $1.1 million to oppose Duckworth. The Super PAC has received $350,000 from employees of Citadel LLC, a hedge fund, and $250,000 from Elliott Management, a hedge fund management firm. Employees of both companies were also among Kirk’s top contributors in 2010. To date, no single-candidate Super PAC has chipped in for Duckworth."" But the Duckworth campaign said Kirk had ""outsourced his campaign."" Kirk is benefiting from heavy spending by the Independent Voice super PAC, but federal data show the Kirk campaign has raised $11.3 million and spent $8.4 million for his re-election effort, while Duckworth has raised $10.1 million and spent nearly $5 million so far. That brings us to the third claim, that Duckworth does not have the support of a Super PAC. As the Center for Responsive Politics reported, no single-candidate Super PAC supports Duckworth, but, their story confirms, $713,901 has been spent by PACs and outside groups to support Duckworth. According to the Center, the Senate Majority Super PAC spent $384 against Kirk and in support of Duckworth and NextGen Climate Action Super PAC spent just under $1,000 against Kirk. Not all outside spending comes from Super PACs. Duckworth also has been the beneficiary of $623,379 in spending by a nonprofit called VoteVets.org. Super PACs have to disclose their donors, but nonprofit 501(c)(4) groups like VoteVets.org do not.  (Graphic/data, courtesy of Center for Responsive Politics, www.opensecrets.org) Our ruling Duckworth said her opponent is outsourcing his campaign to a Super PAC funded almost exclusively by hedge-fund billionaires. Kirk is the beneficiary of a Super PAC that so far has spent exclusively on the Illinois U.S. Senate race, but it is not accurate to say he is ""outsourcing"" his campaign. In fact, by law, ""outsourcing"" a campaign to a Super PAC would be illegal. And while Duckworth does not have a so-called single-candidate Super PAC, she does benefit from some minimal Super PAC spending as well as some other outside spending by VoteVets.org and from state and national Democratic party organizations.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'California', 'Stop 57 campaign']","
Campaign uses Mostly False specter of Brock Turner case to oppose Prop 57
","Brock Turner’s brief jail term for sexual assault sparked outcry across California and the nation earlier this year. A judge sentenced the former Stanford University swimmer to just six months in jail even though Turner -- who had been convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman -- faced a minimum two-year prison term, and prosecutors sought six years. On Sept. 2, Turner was released after serving half his jail term, for good behavior. Early release is standard practice in California’s overflowing jails. Turner has since moved back to Ohio and registered as a sex offender. On the day Turner was released, opponents of a California ballot measure to reduce prison crowding seized on the notorious case to make a questionable claim. ""Brock Turner’s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes,"" claims the headline of a news release on the Stop57.com campaign website. Later in the press release, the campaign expanded on this claim saying Prop 57 ""would make reduced sentences and early release for persons convicted of the same sex crimes committed by Turner a permanent part of California law."" We decided to fact check the bold claim in the headline, and to keep in mind the context included later in the press release.  Opponents of Prop 57 have used the notorious Brock Turner case to argue against the ballot measure, including in this video. Our research Proposition 57 would allow thousands of prison inmates categorized by the state as ""nonviolent"" to be eligible for early parole. It’s Gov. Jerry Brown’s latest attempt to reform the state prison system. And it’s led to heated debate over which offenders would be eligible for early release if it passes. But would the early release of sex offenders such as Turner really be ""a regular occurrence"" as the Stop 57 campaign claimed? Technically, no. Prop 57 applies to prison inmates -- not to those sentenced to jail like Turner. Still, we decided to examine the larger question raised by the claim of how prison inmates convicted of the same crimes as Turner would be affected.  California's Proposition 57 is Gov. Jerry Brown's latest effort to reform the state's prison system.  Background on Turner’s case Turner was convicted on three felony counts: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person. Those crimes are considered nonviolent because, according to California law, they do not involve force. State law considers 23 crimes to be violent, obviously including murder and kidnapping. But in California, ""nonviolent"" is broadly defined. It applies to certain rapes and sexual assaults, such as Turner's conviction, along with vehicular and involuntary manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, exploding a bomb with intent to injure and other crimes. This remarkably broad definition for nonviolent crimes has made Prop 57 one of the most debated measures on November’s ballot. Excluding sex offenders? Experts say there are valid questions about who would be eligible for parole. But Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis, said the Stop 57 campaign stretched the truth by playing up the Turner case. ""It don’t think it’s accurate,"" Chin said of the claim. ""I certainly don’t think it’s likely that people convicted of sex offenses are going to get early release under this ballot initiative."" Chin pointed to a 2014 federal court order that required the state to form guidelines to further ease California’s prison crowding. Following that order, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation created a process to allow some second-strike offenders to be considered for early parole. It excluded, however, those who must register as sex offenders. ""We see what the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is doing: They’re treating sex crimes as violent crimes. And I have no reason to imagine they would change that policy if Prop 57 passes,"" Chin said. Another view But just because it’s become practice to exclude sex offenders for early parole consideration, doesn’t mean that practice is codified in California law said Laurie Kubicek, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. ""I don’t think the public should be lulled into believing that (an inmate given early release) would never be a sex offender,"" said Kubicek. ""I don’t think that’s what the law says. I think it could be a sex offender."" She called the Stop 57 claim both ""true and false."" She also noted the state is doing its best to keep risky offenders from becoming eligible for parole. We asked the Stop 57 campaign to explain its claim. It connected us with Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse, the campaign’s co-chairman. Morse said because there’s nothing specific in the ballot measure that deals with sex offenders, one must assume they will be eligible for parole. The Yes on 57 campaign, meanwhile, pointed to the state’s current practice of excluding sex offenders from early release to say the claim at the center of this fact check was false. If 57 passes, the state must create additional regulations to further the goals of the ballot measure. Those rules must be certified by the state corrections agency, which anticipates ""that the regulations would … disqualify inmates who must register as sex offenders,"" an agency spokesman told PolitiFact California in an email. The Stop 57 campaign added in another claim that, if Prop 57 passes, it will supersede existing state policies, and will force the state to make sex offenders eligible for early parole. Our ruling The Stop 57 campaign claimed ""Brock Turner’s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes."" There are plenty of offenders who could be eligible for early parole under the ballot measure. California has a category of nonviolent offenders, many of whom committed heinous crimes and could be eligible for, though not guaranteed parole. Under its early release policy for second strike prisoners, however, the state corrections department excludes sex offenders from even being considered for early parole. That policy is not a state law. But the state corrections agency says it expects to continue this practice. The Stop 57 claim used the notorious Brock Turner case to argue that early parole ""will be"" a regular occurrence. At best, there’s a remote chance the state will allow prisoners who committed the same crimes as Turner to someday be eligible for early parole. But past practice says it won’t happen.

Is Donald Trump the only major-party nominee in 40 years not to release his tax returns?
","On Sept. 19, 2016, the Wisconsin Democratic Party called on Donald Trump to release his tax returns, issuing a statement that quoted U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., as saying: ""The time is way past due for Donald Trump to release his tax returns, as every other major party nominee has done for the past 40 years."" So, let’s see if that’s what every Democratic and Republican presidential nominee since 1976 has done. Wayback machine Baldwin has taken aim at Trump before, since he became the GOP nominee. In August 2016, we rated Half True her claim that Trump ""has a long history of exporting jobs overseas."" Trump-brand products such as his clothing have been made overseas, but those jobs were always abroad, not U.S. jobs that were moved. To back her current claim, Baldwin’s campaign cited editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which said Trump would be the first major party candidate since 1976 -- 40 years ago -- not to release his tax returns. Also cited was an editorial from the Boston Globe, which said it’s been more than 40 years. But there is an exception. We checked an archive of presidential tax returns maintained by the Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy. It shows that going back to 1976, all but one major-party nominee released at least one return. Only Republican Gerald Ford, who lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, did not release returns (he released summary tax data), the archive shows. FactCheck.org also found Ford to be the one exception. Joe Thorndike, the Tax History Project director at Tax Analysts, told us that Ford’s summaries were clearly not the same as tax returns. For instance, they didn’t provide detailed information on things such as sources of income and charitable contributions. Moreover, it’s impossible to know what might be in a return unless you see the return. It's also worth noting that while some nominees have released numerous years of returns – 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole provided 30 years’ worth – others have not. In 1980, Republican Ronald Reagan released only one return and in 2012, Republican Mitt Romney released two. In the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has released returns from 2000 through 2015. As for Trump, he has said he hasn’t released his taxes because he is being audited. When he claimed he ""released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. … You don't learn much in a tax return,"" PolitiFact National’s rating was False. Trump did release an extensive (and legally required) document detailing his personal financial holdings. But experts say tax returns would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his assets. Our rating Baldwin says that except for Trump, ""every other major party nominee"" for the past 40 years has released their tax returns. She’s almost right. During that period, the only major-party presidential nominee who didn’t release returns was Ford, the Republican nominee in 1976. It's also worth noting that many nominees have released numerous years of returns, but some have released only one or two.

Donald Trump: My Trans-Pacific Partnership opposition made Hillary Clinton change her stance
","Criticism of U.S. trade deals has been a key theme in Donald Trump's campaign, and during the Sept. 26, 2016, debate against Hillary Clinton, he focused on two. First, he criticized Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, for signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump also accused Clinton of wanting to approve a newer proposal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest regional trade deal in history. NAFTA was bad, Trump said, ""And now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, 'I can't win that debate.' But you know that if you did win, you would approve that."" Clinton said that ""is just not accurate"" and argued that she decided to oppose it once the terms of the deal were known. Trump said she had praised the deal ""and then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it."" ""Well, Donald,"" Clinton responded, ""I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts."" We wondered about the timing. Did Clinton change her mind in response to Trump's criticism of the TPP? We found no evidence to support Trump's claim. Even before he was a candidate, Trump was on record as opposing the TPP. As early as April 2015, he predicted it would hurt U.S. businesses and put people out of work. The terms of the deal were finalized on Oct. 5, 2015. Clinton announced her opposition on Oct. 7, two days later. At the time, she was under pressure to oppose the pact, but that pressure wasn't from Trump. On Oct. 7, Trump was only one of 15 Republicans still seeking the GOP nomination. The first presidential primary was five months away, Trump's poll numbers among Republicans were around 23 percent. Many people thought his lead in the polls was largely based on name recognition. Most Republicans supported the deal, CNN reported in a story about Clinton's decision to oppose the TPP. Trump is listed as a notable exception. However, the topic didn't even come up during the first two GOP debates. More urgently, if Clinton was under any immediate pressure to oppose the TPP it was from her two top opponents in the Democratic primary — Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Like many Democrats, particularly those with strong union ties, both men opposed the TPP. Sanders called it ""disastrous."" O'Malley accused Clinton of switching on the eve of the first Democratic debate. At the time, Sanders was starting to gain momentum. His support in the polls had gone from 12 percent at the end of June to 25 percent in a Clinton-Sanders matchup, and support for Clinton had slipped nearly 20 points. There was also pressure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Her biggest concern, as she explained in a July 7, 2016 video, was that the TPP gave multinational companies special power ""to challenge a country's laws they just don't like,"" including laws on pollution, safety, health and food. We emailed a half dozen people in the Trump campaign seeking evidence that Trump's opposition caused Clinton to change her mind. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump told Clinton, ""You heard what I said about (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal), and all of a sudden you were against it."" There's no evidence for cause and effect here, and the Trump campaign hasn't provided any. Clinton says her opposition is based solely on the terms of the proposed pact and her announcement to oppose it came two days after the TPP was finalized. Even if political considerations drove her decision, most of the pressure on Clinton was within her own party, particularly from Bernie Sanders, as she saw her support among Democrats slipping.

Donald Trump wrong again about NATO increasing terrorism efforts 'largely' because of him
","During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Donald Trump repeated a claim that he had succeeded in pushing NATO -- the military alliance that includes the United States and Europe -- to increase its efforts on counter-terrorism. ""About four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division,"" Trump said Sept. 26, 2016. ""And I think that's great … because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they're going to do that. … I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO."" Trump’s claim is False. We’ll explain why. What change at NATO is he referring to? When we checked with experts on NATO and terrorism, several said the likeliest change that Trump would have been referring to was the creation of an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Trump has previously tweeted out a Wall Street Journal story on the news and said the alliance ""made the change without giving me credit."" The new position was officially announced in a communiqué released on July 9, 2016, by member-state representatives at a summit in Warsaw, Poland. Was this a major change? Not really, experts said when we first investigated the claim. ""NATO members have been complaining about sharing of intelligence for generations,"" said Stephen M. Saideman, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Canada who had a fellowship on the U.S. Joint Staff at NATO in 2001. ""Every year or two, there is a discussion about how to improve intel sharing."" This change, he said, was ""not that important."" Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, agreed. ""While the top position is new, it seems most of the staff will come from an internal reorganization of NATO bureaucracy, rather than new additions,"" he said. ""This is because the summit communique describes this new NATO division as making ‘better use of existing personnel and resources.’ "" More to the point, Trump’s comment gives the impression that NATO hadn’t been responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. That’s not true at all. NATO involvement in counterterrorism issued its first formal declaration on terrorism in 1980, and it became a significant issue for the alliance on Sept. 11, 2001, said Lisa Sawyer Samp, a senior fellow in the international security program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Indeed, Clinton brought this up in her response to what Trump said at the debate. ""NATO invoked Article 5, its collective defense provision, the day after the 9/11 attacks and has focused on dealing with this threat ever since, including most importantly by deploying troops for the past 12 years in Afghanistan,"" said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as Ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. At its peak, NATO and its partners sent about 40,000 troops to Afghanistan, Benitez said, and this year, there are still about 4,000 troops from NATO allies in Afghanistan. ""It is impossible to argue that NATO has not played an overwhelmingly important role in the war on terror,"" said Timothy Andrews Sayle, an assistant professor of modern global security at the University of Toronto. It’s worth noting that, according to experts, NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counter-terrorism. ""Allied warfare is exceptionally difficult and fraught with problems of coordination and compatibility,"" Sayle said. Intelligence sharing has been especially challenging -- a shortcoming that the new position was designed to ease. NATO’s post-9/11 terrorism blueprint did undergo one major overhaul -- but that occurred in 2012, several years before Trump started running for president. The overhaul, as announced at a summit in Wales, states that ""the Alliance strives at all times to remain aware of the evolving threat from terrorism; to ensure it has adequate capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist threats."" ""So it took about a decade to update the initial post-9/11 framework for dealing with terrorism,"" said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center. Did Trump have anything to do with it? This is where Trump’s statement goes off the rails. He said that NATO acted ""largely"" because of his concerns. But experts agree that nothing of the sort happened. For starters, experts said, leaders of the NATO countries feel little warmth for Trump, suggesting that they wouldn’t do anything to bolster his prospects of becoming president. ""It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign,"" Fay said. ""Like his claim that he was against the invasion of Iraq, this is another reflection of the Republican nominee living in a foreign policy world of his own creation."" (We checked his position on the Iraq War separately here.) Even more important are the structural obstacles -- namely, that an alliance as broad as NATO tends to take longer to get all its members to sign off on strategic changes. ""This is almost certainly just an odd coincidence,"" Sayle said. ""The position would be the result of a very long slog by those who have favored the idea against those who may believe the alliance too large and diffuse to be effective – or safe – for sharing detailed intelligence."" Saideman agreed. ""NATO never works fast on anything, and most of the major changes are timed to be announced at summits like the Warsaw Summit or smaller meetings where defense ministers and foreign ministers meet."" Finally, NATO rejected the notion that Trump had anything to do with the change in a statement to Politico. Our ruling Trump said, ""NATO is opening up a major terror division. ... I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO."" The change he’s apparently referring to -- the creation of a new senior post and division for coordinating intelligence sharing -- is just the most recent incremental change in how the alliance handles counter-terrorism, a topic it has addressed, in big ways and small, for more than 30 years. There is no evidence that the change was made in response to Trump’s complaints about the alliance. Experts said such changes typically require a longer gestation period so that all member nations can get on board.

"['Education', 'Florida', 'AFSCME People']","
Unions attack Marco Rubio's education record
","Two liberal labor unions say that Sen. Marco Rubio’s priorities are wrong for Floridians. A TV ad by AFSCME People and AFT Solidarity accuses Rubio of favoring cuts to Social Security and Medicare and also says he ""voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education."" AFSCME represents public sector workers while AFT stands for American Federation of Teachers -- both unions endorsed Rubio’s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, in the U.S. Senate contest. The ad is airing in the Tampa and Orlando media markets. We have previously fact-checked similar claims about Rubio’s position on Social Security and Medicare cuts and found them Half True. Here we will look at the education-related attacks that refer to his vote on the federal budget in 2011 and a statement he made on the presidential campaign trail in 2015. Education cuts The ad doesn’t explain the timeframe for the cuts, but the fine print cites a 2011 article by the liberal Center for American Progress. At the time, the Democrats and Republicans were in a budget stalemate about how to fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year. That’s a reference to H.R. 1, legislation to fund appropriations through the end of 2011 that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. Rubio joined most of his Republican colleagues in voting in favor of it -- only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it. (Ultimately, the House, the Senate and the president agreed to a series of short-term ""continuing resolutions"" to keep the government going, rather than approving a more sweeping spending bill.) The legislation aimed to cut spending by about $57 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education. Republican leaders emphasized the broader aspects of the plan about reducing the size of government while Democrats emphasized the impact on education and disease research (the National Institutes of Health would also have been hit).   In a statement after the vote, Rubio said that he supported the Republican plan but said more time should be spent to overhaul entitlements: ""I supported this first step towards getting our fiscal house in order, but the truth is that America has reached a point where saving $57 billion is a mere drop in the bucket when compared to our $14 trillion debt. While reducing discretionary spending is an important goal, Washington is devoting a disproportionate amount of time to a tiny slice of the budget while ignoring the fact that continued inaction on saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is bankrupting our country."" Here are some examples of the education cuts: • Title I education spending. This is a program that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared with the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010. • Part B IDEA grants. This program provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared with the 2010 level. • Pell grants. This program funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than the 2011 level. • Head Start. This program provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start by a little under $1.1 billion. Education Department While campaigning for president in September 2015 in Carson City, Nev., Rubio said at a town hall, ""I honestly think we don't need an Education Department."" Rubio said that federal recommendations to state and local governments often turn into mandates tied to money. ""What starts out as a suggestion ends up being, ‘If you want money from us, you must to do it this way,’ and you will end up with a version of a national school board,"" Rubio said. Democrats noted that Rubio’s college education was paid for in part by Pell Grants and Stafford Loans, which are administered by the Education Department. But Rubio said that federal programs that have merit could be transferred to other agencies. Although he wants to get rid of the education department, he supports efforts to make higher education affordable. Rubio also supports less federal involvement and more state and local control. For example, he introduced legislation that seeks to strengthen school choice for parents through a tax credit and he supports Florida’s tax credit scholarship program. We’ll note that Rubio has a lot of company among Republicans who want to eliminate the department. Such calls to ax the department are campaign rhetoric, said University of Iowa education professor David Bills. ""Reagan back in 1980 would have loved to eliminate the DOE,"" Bills said. ""I think it would be hard to find a major Republican now who doesn’t want to at least radically shrink it. ....  All of that kind of slowed down when Bush II came in with No Child Left Behind. I think Rubio is pretty representative."" Our ruling The TV ad by liberal groups says ""Rubio voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education."" Rubio, along with nearly all of his Republican Senate colleagues, voted for legislation in 2011 that would have cut about $57 billion in spending. The ad omits that this was across-the-board spending that didn’t solely target education, and it failed to pass. While a presidential candidate in 2015, Rubio did advocate eliminating the U.S. Education Department. The ad omits that he said he would move worthwhile programs to other agencies. We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB888F80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/27/afscme-people/unions-attack-marco-rubios-education-record/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says Clinton would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in a stump speech that immigration is a national security issue, and he criticized Hillary Clinton for refugee policies that he says will make the country less safe. ""Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them,"" Trump said Sept. 20. ""Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs."" We decided to look into Clinton’s plan and its costs. We  found that Trump is doing some embellishing. Refugee math Clinton has not laid out a four-year plan for refugees as Trump described. She’s actually only talked about how many refugees should have been admitted for a single year. Clinton called President Barack Obama’s plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 a good start in a September 2015 interview on CBS Face the Nation, but she said the ""United States has to do more."" She suggested admitting 65,000 refugees, amounting to a 550 percent increase. We asked Clinton’s campaign how many refugees her administration would admit in the future and how much it would cost, but a spokesman said they had no new details. Trump’s campaign referenced a June 2016 analysis of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, chaired by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Trump supporter. It makes the assumption that Clinton would bring in 155,000 refugees each fiscal year, totaling 620,000 in four years. Here’s the subcommittee’s math: It finds that Clinton would increase Syrian refugee admissions by 55,000. (Her suggestion of 65,000 minus Obama’s 10,000 for 2016). To determine how many total refugees Clinton would admit per year, it adds 55,000 to 100,000 -- the Obama administration’s previously stated refugee admission goal for fiscal year 2017. (He recently raised it to 110,000.) To conclude how many total refugees Clinton would admit in her first term, it multiplies 155,000 times 4 (total years in a presidential term) to total 620,000 refugees. The vetting process The United States has a refugee vetting process, and Clinton has not said she would move away from it. In fact, she’s stressed the vetting process in public remarks, including at a November 2015 speech about national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people,"" Clinton said. ""So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners."" Congress needs to make sure resources are available for background checks and a close look should be placed on visa programs, she said. There’s no precise dollar amount specified on Clinton’s immigration reform page on her website. It says Clinton would create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs and ""support affordable integration services through $15 million in new grant funding."" '$400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs' This summer, Trump said ""for the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire. In that fact-check, we noted that the Obama administration requested under $2.2 billion for refugee and entrant assistance for fiscal year 2017, when the goal was 100,000 refugees. If Clinton tripled the requested amount for refugee funding in fiscal year 2017 and multiplied it over a 4-year term, it would not reach anywhere near Trump’s $400 billion claim. However, in its June analysis, the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest said the annual budget for refugee resettlement does not encompass all costs, including those related to refugees who qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income. That budget also leaves out social services costs at local and state governments and costs of future benefits once refugees become lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens, the analysis said. ""The true lifetime cost of admitting a single refugee must include an accounting of all benefits received by that refugee -- at the federal, state, and local levels, and over the course of that‎ refugee's lifespan,"" the analysis said. ""Any other calculation is akin to saying that the total cost of owning a new car is encapsulated in the down payment."" Refugees come to the United States legally and are required to apply for lawful permanent residence a year after their arrival. But they also contribute to the economy. Refugees are qualified to get Social Security cards and are authorized to work. And like U.S. citizens, they have to pay employment, property, sales and other taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare. ""The only way to arrive at the large negative effects that Trump claims is to adopt the belief that refugees neither work nor pay taxes after they arrive,"" said Michael Clemens, an expert on migration and a senior fellow at Center for Global Development. ""That is untrue, and a method of counting only fiscal outflows while ignoring fiscal inflows is not a method that would be countenanced by any respected economist."" Based on estimates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as data from Health and Human Services, a reasonably conservative figure for the total short-term, gross fiscal burden of each refugee is around $22,000, Clemens said. But that’s not the long-term net fiscal impact, he said. ""The lifetime fiscal effect of a refugee admission --  including the tax revenue they are likely to generate over the course of their working lives, and both the up-front cost of assisting them and the other government services they are likely to use, is likely to be small and positive,"" Clemens said, citing studies that found refugees tend to perform better in the labor market than non-refugee immigrants over the long-term. At a minimum, the true costs of refugees is disputed and hard to put an exact figure on. Our ruling Trump said, ""Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs."" Clinton has not said she would bring anywhere near that number; that’s an extrapolation put together by the Trump campaign. Additionally, there are established protocols for screening and vetting refugees. Finally, the $400 billion figure only looks at potential benefits refugees might draw on without considering their economic output or taxes they might pay. Overall, we rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC26B80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/trump-says-clinton-would-bring-620000-refugees-her/

Donald Trump off-base in saying murders are up in New York City
","Two New Yorkers, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, mixed it up over crime stats in the Big Apple at the first presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y. Here’s their exchange, prompted by Donald Trump’s suggestion that police should expand the use of ""stop and frisk"" policies to curb crime. Trump: ""Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact."" Clinton: ""Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is -- "" Trump: ""No, you're wrong. You're wrong."" Clinton: ""No, I'm not."" Trump: ""Murders are up. All right. You check it."" And so we will. Is it correct that ""murders are up"" in New York City, as Trump said? The most recent statistics from the New York Police Department show that murders in New York City are falling. The data, which cover the period between Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, 2016, compare various crimes, including murder, over a series of time frames. Here’s the summary:   Period 2015 murder figure 2016 murder figure Increase or decline Week to date 6 3 -50 percent Past 28 days 35 24 -31.4 percent Year to date 257 246 -4.3 percent 2 years ago to date -- -- +7.9 percent 6 years ago to date -- -- -36.1 percent 23 years ago to date -- -- -82.7 percent So, in five of the six time periods offered by the NYPD -- including the past year to date, the figure most commonly cited in the media -- crime has fallen. In only one time frame, comparing year to date 2016 to year to date 2014, did the number of murders increase. And in fact, this is essentially what the Trump campaign pointed to when we asked them to support the candidate’s claim. They noted that during the full year of 2014, there were 333 murders, a number that rose to 352 in the full year of 2015. That’s about a 6 percent increase. Still, this is just one cherry-picked time frame. And a NYPD spokesman rejected Trump’s statement via Twitter during the debate. J. Peter Donald, the NYPD's assistant commissioner for communication and public information, tweeted, ""Additionally, #NYC is on pace to have one of the safest years on record for crime. Murders, shootings are (down arrow) significantly."" In the meantime, we’ll note that the data in the NYPD release went on to compare year-end data from 2015 to four previous years and found that it is well below its previous levels -- consistent with a quarter-century decline in violent crime. According to the NYPD data, murder was down by 45.8 percent compared to 2001, down by 44 percent compared to 1998, down by 81.7 percent compared to 1993, and down by 84.4 percent compared to 1990. The year-to-date data for rape, felonious assault and grand larceny are up by between 1 percent and 3.5 percent. But Trump was specific about referring to murder. And statistics released by the FBI the morning of the debate that showed murders rose nationally by 10.8 percent in 2015, the biggest one-year percentage jump since 1971. But again, those are national figures, not murders in New York City. So among the time frames released by the NYPD, there’s only one comparison where Trump would be correct -- today compared to two years ago. In general, murders are down in New York City for almost any time period you can look at. Our ruling At the debate, Trump said that In New York City, ""murders are up."" For virtually any time frame you can look at, including the year to date, murders in New York City are down.

Donald Trump's false claim that Clinton's energy plan will cost the economy $5 trillion
","Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton on energy issues at a campaign stop in Virginia just two days before the two were set to go head-to-head at the first presidential debate. ""Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work,"" he said. ""Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion."" Trump’s claim about Clinton wanting to shut down natural gas production is not accurate, but what about his claim on the cost of her energy agenda?   The claim is misleading as $5 trillion refers to the cost of implementation, not the cost to the economy.  What’s more, the researcher who produced the figure told us the investment will actually help the economy. The $5 trillion figure The Trump campaign referred us to a 2016 working paper by Columbia Business School professor Geoffrey Heal entitled ""What Would it Take to Reduce US Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80% by 2050?"" Heal, who is in favor of climate change action, estimated a cost of $42 billion to $176 billion per year in required investment in production capacity, energy storage, energy transmission and battery-powered vehicles. On the low end, that comes out to $1.3 trillion over three decades and, on the high end, $5.3 trillion over three decades. This, however, does not refer to a loss in GDP, but rather the amount needed to update the U.S. energy system and technology infrastructure. ""It’s not a GDP loss at all,"" Heal told PolitiFact. ""This is infrastructure investment."" He pointed out that Trump and Clinton have both called for long-term infrastructure investment. Spending the $5 trillion on cutting emissions is a ""relatively inexpensive way with a good rate of return,"" Heal said, and the $5 trillion will have a ""multiplier"" effect that will help the economy become cleaner and more productive. Heal also told us to take his estimate with a grain of salt because there a lot of uncertainties, such as the price of technology. Overall, he actually supports Clinton’s ""sensible"" energy and climate change policies. ""She’s pushing for the right things,"" he said. ""I certainly don’t think they’ll bankrupt the country."" What’s more, it’s not entirely accurate to say 80 percent by 2050 is Clinton’s ""regulatory agenda.""   Clinton has proposed various energy policies to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels. She said her plan will ""put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050,"" a goal established by President Barack Obama and found in this year’s Democratic Party Platform. In other words, the analysis offered by Heal doesn’t apply to her actual policies but an aspiration the Democrats share. A 2014 paper by the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, which brings together energy researchers from around the world, found a similar result: an investment cost equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP. But the researchers note that this price tag is ""incremental"" and has a great level of uncertainty ""because they depend on assumptions about consumption levels, technology costs, and fossil fuel prices nearly 40 years into the future."" They also stipulate that the cost assumes little to no technological change nor does the estimate include benefits like avoided health and infrastructure costs. Economic cost of energy policies If we look at specific policies rather than a 30-year goal, the economic cost of Clinton’s energy agenda is dramatically less expensive. In a speech to the Shale Insight conference in Pennsylvania, Trump specified that the $5 trillion refers to the President Barack Obama’s Climate Action Plan and Clean Power Plan. Obama’s Climate Action Plan proposes new regulations, investments in renewable energy and international cooperation to cut carbon emissions. That plan includes the Environmental Protection Agency’s  Clean Power Plan of 2015 (which requires power plants to reduce their 2005 emission levels by 32 percent within 25 years) and the Paris agreement (in which the Obama administration pledged to cut national 2005 emission levels by 28 percent within 20 years). Those plans are currently in limbo. The Supreme Court ruled in February 2016 to halt the Clean Power Plan’s implementation while the Paris agreement has yet to go into effect.  Clinton has vowed to defend and implement Obama’s climate change policies, including the Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate agreement. Critics of these policies — namely the oil and gas industry, business groups and free market oriented think tanks — say they’ll impose costs on businesses and consumers alike. But these estimates do not come close to $5 trillion. According to a 2015 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation — which opposes the plan — the Clean Power Plan will lead to a loss of $2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030. Here’s table breaking down the estimates we found, all from groups that are opposed to the plans or that have concerns about them: Group Policy Estimated cost Year of analysis Heritage Foundation Clean Power Plan $2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030 2015 Heritage Foundation Climate Action Plan $1.47 trillion in national income by 2030 2013 Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation Clean Power Plan $660 billion in GDP loss by 230 2016 American Action Forum, a center-right advocacy group Paris agreement and existing climate change-oriented regulations $562 billion by 2030* 2015 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Clean Power Plan $510 billion in GDP loss by 2030 2014 *American Action Forum estimated that altogether, existing climate change-geared regulations cost $28 billion annually while the Paris agreement, which kicks in 2020, would raise that number to $45 billion annually. Estimated benefits of climate change policies On the flip side, the Environmental Protection Agency and others argue the Clean Power Plan actually leads to economic gains when health and environmental benefits are included in the analysis. Curbing carbon emissions would reduce health hazards, such as asthma and heart attacks, associated with particle pollution, saving the public $34 to $54 billion per year by 2030, according to the EPA. Factoring in the EPA’s own projected costs of $8 billion per year,  that’s an annual net gain of $26 billion to $46 billion. A 2016 cost-benefit analysis by Harvard researchers resulted in a figure in the same ballpark: a net $38 billion per year in net benefits by 2020. Meanwhile, the National Resources Defense Council had even rosier projections. The environmental group estimated that the Clean Power Plan would deliver benefits worth $55 billion to $93 billion, outweighing the costs of $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion. "" The Clinton campaign also pointed us to several papers on the cost of not reducing emissions. For examples, researchers estimated a 23 percent reduction in global incomes by 2100 if climate change is unmitigated. ""Climate change is a serious issue for the economy. It could inflict damages that will add up,"" Heal said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton’s energy agenda ""will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion."" The Trump campaign said Trump was referring to one study that looked at how much it would cost to reach Clinton’s climate goal; it referred to a high-end, 30-year estimate of implementation costs. The study did not actually measure the effects on the economy. Critics of the plan say it will reduce GDP by as much as $2.5 trillion. Supporters say it actually will have a net-positive effect.

Trump falsely tries to pin birtherism on Clinton insiders
","The long running conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in America came back to haunt Donald Trump in the first presidential debate at Hofstra University. For about two months in 2011, Trump fueled a tentative presidential bid by raising doubts about Obama’s birthplace. The issue faded after Obama released a long-form version of his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii, but it wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago that Trump publicly put the matter to rest. When debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what took him so long, Trump tried to divert blame for the birther movement to two Clinton insiders, Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager, and Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and occasional staffer. ""If you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened,"" Trump said. ""Blumenthal sent McClatchy -- a highly respected reporter at McClatchy -- to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard."" Were Solis Doyle and Blumenthal -- two top Clinton aides in 2008 -- pressing the birther movement very hard? We’ll take each person in turn. What Doyle said on CNN Doyle was on CNN on Sept. 16, 2016, and she was talking about an episode in 2007 during the Democratic primary. Doyle described a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email that promoted ""the conspiracy."" Asked during the interview if she meant the birther rumor, Doyle said she did. The Trump campaign pointed to this as an admission that at least someone in the campaign played a role. But Doyle later clarified she was referring to a volunteer who was fired for forwarding an email about Obama’s religion, not birthplace. Regardless of what Doyle said in her interview, that is what happened. (PolitiFact wrote about it here.) A rumor about Obama’s religion has an important difference from a rumor about his birthplace. While the two falsehoods overlap, only one -- whether he was born in the United States, would affect his ability to hold office under the Constitution. Blumenthal and McClatchy Blumenthal became a central figure in the birther controversy just recently. James Asher, the former Washington bureau chief of the McClatchy News service, tweeted on Sept. 15, 2016, that Blumenthal suggested in 2008 he look into rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. However, Blumenthal has told many news organizations that the editor’s claim is false, and that he never raised the issue of Obama’s birthplace. When a McClatchy reporter tried to reconstruct what actually happened, he confirmed that Blumenthal contacted Asher, and that a McClatchy reporter in Kenya explored whether Obama was born there, along with running down several other rumors. But McClatchy found no proof that Blumenthal questioned Obama’s birthplace. The article quoted an email Blumenthal sent to Asher in 2008. While Blumenthal discusses Obama’s family connections to Kenya, there’s no mention of where Obama was born. ""On Kenya, your person in the field might look into the impact there of Obama’s public comments about his father. I’m told by State Dept officials that Obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing,"" Blumenthal wrote. Asher gave a new statement to McClatchy that steps back a bit from the certainty he expressed in his original tweet. ""Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy, where he and I met in my office,"" Asher said. ""During that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to Obama. He encouraged McClatchy to do stories related to Obama and his connections to Kenya."" Asher said he remembered Blumenthal mentioning Obama’s birthplace but acknowledged that he had nothing in writing. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton insiders pushed the rumor that Obama was not born in America. His first example, Doyle, actually was involved in firing a county level volunteer coordinator who spread the rumor that Obama was a Muslim. The president’s religion might overlap thematically, but it is distinct from rumors about his birthplace. Trump’s focus on Blumenthal lacks solid evidence. Blumenthal denies the allegation and the man who made it says he has no written proof. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a47423-d419-497c-800a-ea34cf90ecf1",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA2BF80>],/factchecks/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/trump-again-tries-pin-birtherism-clinton-insiders/

At debate, Hillary Clinton tax claim ignores years when Donald Trump reportedly paid federal taxes
","Hillary Clinton is continuing to make an issue of the fact that Donald Trump has refused to release his tax returns, and at the first presidential debate, she suggested that one reason for his reluctance may be that Trump doesn't pay federal taxes. ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax,"" she said. Trump retorted that not paying taxes ""makes me smart."" In reality, neither Clinton nor Trump have their talking points correct. We looked at a nearly identical claim by Clinton previously and found it to be Mostly False. The truth is none of the tax returns she is talking about have ever been released, and she's ignoring other returns examined by New Jersey gambling regulators showing that Trump did pay taxes. The evidence is in a 1981 report that analyzed Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report, on Page 33, details Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979. The report states that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years to the tune of $71,932 on reported income of $219,334. (In current dollars, that would be a $296,121 paid in taxes on $910,319 in reported income.) In the final two years he did not pay federal income taxes because, according to tax rules, he lost money each year — more than $3.8 million then, or about $12.8 million today. New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement verified his income, losses and deductions. The division said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. But the report offers no specifics. We asked both the Clinton and Trump campaigns if they had any additional information since our original check. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The only years that anybody's ever seen"" of Trump’s tax returns ""showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."" Those records, covering five years of returns, report that in three of the five years Trump did pay federal income taxes. In two years he did not. The tax returns themselves remain secret. Clinton’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6adfa4d3-c309-41e1-940d-dd06448c5548",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE5DF00>],/factchecks/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/debate-hillary-clinton-tax-claim-ignores-years-whe/

True: Hillary Clinton says federal government sued Donald Trump for housing discrimination
","After years of repeating conspiracies that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, Donald Trump finally backed away from the so-called birther movement earlier this month. But that didn’t stop the question from coming up during a key exchange at Monday’s presidential debate in New York. Hillary Clinton said Trump embraced a ""racist lie"" and it demonstrated a pattern that carried over from his business practices. ""Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans,"" she said. That’s quite the charge, but is it true? Yes. It turns out he was. In 1973, Trump, as a 27-year-old, was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management. It operated nearly 40 apartment buildings, mostly in New York City. By all accounts, including his own, Trump was a hands-on president and very active in managing the day-to-day business operations. That year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race. ""The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings,"" the complaint reads. Black people, the government found, were often told a Trump Management complex had no availability when apartments were available for rent. In one instance, a black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn on March 18, 1972, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot. The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government said the company’s comptroller instructed a rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said ""C"" for ""colored"" to every application submitted by a person of color. Trump vehemently denied the claims, which he called ""absolutely ridiculous,"" according to a 1973 New York Times article. Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But he did offer an explanation in the debate. ""As far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued,"" Trump said. ""We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do."" Indeed, both parties settled in 1975 after a protracted legal battle. Trump claimed victory, writing in his 1987 memoir, Art of the Deal: ""In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt"" However, under the agreement, Trump Management had to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements. It’s also worth noting that most of these suits are typically settled and often quickly -- ""north of 98 percent,"" Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law, previously told PolitiFact. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt. ""That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence"" against Trump, Schwemm said. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump ""started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans."" Both parts of the statement are carefully worded and accurate. The Justice Department sued Trump, his father and their company under the Civil Rights Act in 1973. In many instances, the government said, prospective black tenants were blocked from renting in his buildings. The case was settled and Trump never admitted guilt, though his company had to agree to stipulations meant to prevent future discrimination at his rental properties. We rate the statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1eeeec4-fa30-47b3-a119-110b7b898ef1",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEBE800>],/factchecks/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/true-hillary-clinton-says-federal-government-sued-/

Hillary Clinton correctly cites outside analyses of Trump's tax plan
","During the first presidential debate of 2016, Hillary Clinton took aim at Donald Trump’s latest tax plan, saying it would explode the debt and hike taxes for some middle-class Americans. ""Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that (his tax plan) would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy,"" Clinton said. The Clinton campaign pointed us to an analysis by Lily L. Batchelder, a professor at New York University Law School. When we asked her whether Clinton’s phrasing accurately summarized her findings, Batchelder said it did. ""Yep, that’s totally accurate,"" she told PolitiFact. We’ll look at the two parts of Clinton’s statement in turn, focusing on the revised plan Trump unveiled at a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Sept. 15, 2016. (Click the links for details on the plans.) Debt increase In her paper, published a little more than a week after Trump offered his revised plan, Batchelder wrote that her calculations suggested that ""Donald Trump’s latest tax plan would cost more than $5 trillion over 10 years."" One can argue that Batchelder is not an ""independent expert"" -- she worked for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus as chief tax counsel of the Senate Finance Committee from 2010 to 2014 and as the deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama in 2014 and 2015. However, a more conservative group, the Tax Foundation, came up with a similar calculation in its own analysis. According to its model, Trump’s plan ""would reduce federal revenue"" -- in other words, add to the debt -- ""by between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion"" without taking into account increased economic growth estimates due to the plan’s tax cuts. (The Tax Foundation did note that this debt increase was smaller than what it had projected for earlier versions of Trump’s plan.) Finally, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors deficit reduction, wrote that its update found that ""both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law – though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more. ... Specifically, we estimate Clinton’s plans would add $200 billion to the debt over the next decade, while Trump’s plans would add $5.3 trillion."" So Clinton seems on solid ground for this part of the statement. Tax hikes Batchelder’s paper is the primary evidence here (along with a separate analysis by a liberal group, Citizens for Tax Justice). ""Despite its enormous price tag, his plan would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low- and middle-income families with children, with especially large tax increases for working single parents,"" Batchelder wrote. ""I conservatively estimate that Trump’s plan would increase taxes for roughly 7.8 million families with minor children. These families who would pay more taxes represent roughly 20 percent of households with minor children and more than half of single parents. They include roughly 25 million individuals and 15 million children."" Batchelder cites several reasons for why some families would see a tax increase, including Trump’s exchange of a new standard deduction for personal exemptions; his repeal of the head of household filing status, which benefits unmarried taxpayers with dependents; his exchange of a 10 percent bracket for a 12 percent bracket; and the reality that his new tax deduction and credit for child care would provide relatively little benefit to low- and middle-income caretakers. The Tax Foundation’s report didn’t address this issue, noting instead that as a rule, taxpayers in all income groups would see more money in their pocket if Trump’s plan was enacted. However, the Tax Foundation did find substantially bigger gains for wealthy Americans, which is consistent with Clinton’s statement that Trump’s plan would ""disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy."" It found that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would receive an income bump of between 0.8 percent and 1.9 percent, compared to 5.4 percent to 9.3 percent for the top 10 percent of taxpayers and between 10.2 percent and 16.0 percent for taxpayers in the top 1 percent. More to the point, the Tax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau tweeted favorably about Batchelder’s finding that some taxpayers would experience tax hikes, saying, ""We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report. The results seem reasonable to me."" Another tax policy group, the Tax Policy Center, has not released an analysis of Trump’s most recent plan. The Trump campaign sent us a paper defending the tax proposal. However, it was not ""independent"" since it was written by a pair of ""senior policy advisors to the Trump campaign."" Our ruling Clinton said that, according to ""independent experts,"" Trump's tax plan ""would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy."" Batchelder’s past work for Senate Democrats and the Obama White House may lead some to question whether she is an ""independent expert."" But her estimate of the debt increase was mirrored by findings by the more conservative Tax Foundation and the deficit-hawk Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the Tax Foundation said Batchelder’s analysis of tax increases for some families seemed ""reasonable."" We rate Clinton’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE5C600>],/factchecks/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correctly-cites-outside-analyses-t/
