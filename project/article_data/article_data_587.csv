Mitch McConnell says more women graduate from college than men do
","The Senate race between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, is turning out to be one of the most closely watched and expensive in recent years. Given that his opponent is portraying him as anti-woman, McConnell’s recent comments on women’s issues to a group of Kentucky voters were bound to attract media attention. McConnell was speaking at Fastline Publications, which produces catalogs for farm equipment. When an audience member asked him about ""the most important issues facing Kentucky women,"" McConnell said, ""We’ve come a long way"" and added that ""most of the barriers have been lowered."" ""I think virtually everything I have mentioned today applies to both genders equally,"" McConnell said. ""We’ve come a long way with pay equity. There are a ton of women CEO’s now running major companies, and more women are graduating from college now than men."" He also said he received 50 percent of the women’s vote the last time he was elected, and he cited Xerox as an example of a company with a woman CEO. After the event, McConnell received criticism from some liberal commentators for his comments that workplace sexism and inequality between the sexes was a thing of the past. Some of his claims are too subjective to fact-check. But we decided to look at his claim that ""more women are graduating from college now than men."" According to a study by the Pew Research Center, women have outpaced men in pursuing postsecondary education in recent years, partly because of a growing acceptance of women in a wider variety of jobs, meaning that ""the benefits of a college education grew more for women than men."" The Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit organization that produces information for academic and research purposes, published a study that validated McConnell’s comments. ""Simply put, young women are now more likely to enroll in, and graduate from, college than young men,"" Kevin Pollard wrote. The graph below, which was included in Pollard’s analysis, shows the percentage of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 29 with a bachelor’s degree or higher.  Throughout the 1970s, the chart shows, men graduated from college at higher rates than women did. However, that trend reversed in the early 1990s, when women began to outpace men. And since then, this pattern for bachelor’s degrees has held steady. In 2012 women earned 1,025,729 bachelor’s degrees, or 57 percent of all degrees conferred that year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal office. Women also earned a majority of master’s degrees and doctoral degrees in the 2011-12 academic year. Women received 60 percent of all master’s degrees, compared with 40 percent for men. In doctoral studies the margin was narrower, with 51 percent of PhDs being awarded to women and 49 percent being given to men. Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, provided PolitiFact with a wide variety of support for McConnell’s claim, including an op-ed written by President Barack Obama for the 40th anniversary of Title IX, a statute that banned discrimination in educational programs on the basis of sex. ""In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men,"" Obama said in the article. So Obama’s comments square with those made by McConnell last week -- though they draw different conclusions. Obama’s concludes that ""there are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make,"" while McConnell said ""most of the barriers have been lowered."" Our ruling McConnell said that ""more women are graduating college now than men."" We found that since the early 1990s, women have earned more postsecondary degrees than men -- and in the 2011-12 academic year, women earned more degrees of all types -- bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral -- than men did.

Rep. Phil Gingrey says migrants may be bringing Ebola virus through the U.S.-Mexico border
","As a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America was arriving on the United States’ southern border this month, Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., expressed concern about the impact they could have on public health. On July 7, 2014, Gingrey wrote a letter expressing these concerns to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are excerpts: ""As you know, the United States is currently experiencing a crisis at our southern border. The influx of families and unaccompanied children at the border poses many risks, including grave public health threats. ""As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose. In fact, infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of death in the United States. … Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning."" Health experts agree that when large numbers of people from countries with spotty health care systems make an arduous trek and then get corralled into crowded holding facilities, it can pose a health risk. But the introduction of Ebola, the feared viral disease of African origin that kills up to 90 percent of victims through organ failures and leaking blood and fluids? That would be terrifying. So is it true that amid the ""crisis at our southern border"" there are ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus"" into the United States? After Gingrey’s letter became widely known, some commentators expressed disbelief that he had invoked Ebola, given that the disease is endemic to Africa, not Central America. On his July 17 show, Stephen Colbert mocked Gingrey, saying, ""That virus has never appeared outside of Africa, but Gingrey may have caught it from an illegal already, because I believe one of the symptoms is baseless fear leaking out of your ass."" When we checked with Gingrey’s office, however, spokesman Cameron Harley pointed us to a comment Gingrey made to NBC News’ Luke Russert that suggested he’s standing by the concerns he stated in the CDC letter. ""The border patrol gave us a list of the diseases that they’re concerned about, and Ebola was one of those,"" Gingrey told Russert. ""I can’t tell you specifically that there were any cases of Ebola, I don’t think there were, but of course tuberculosis, Chagas disease, many – smallpox, some of the infectious diseases of children, all of these are concerns."" So is there anything to the Ebola claim? Experts we asked issued a resounding ""No."" First, we checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose job includes tracking outbreaks of serious infectious diseases. Spokesman Daniel J. DeNoon confirmed that the CDC has received no reports of a human Ebola infection anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Ebola cases in humans have never been reported outside of Africa,"" DeNoon said. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agreed. ""The congressman is misinformed,"" he said. ""There is no Ebola in the Western Hemisphere."" We also checked whether it was plausible for a child or adult entering the United States from Central America via Mexico to be infected with the Ebola virus. CDC scientists call it ""extremely unlikely,"" DeNoon said. Independent experts agreed. ""It’s very, very, highly unlikely if you are talking about someone from Central America who has not traveled to Africa,"" Thomas W. Geisbert, a microbiologist and immunologist specializing in Ebola at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Geisbert said there have been examples of travelers carrying similar exotic diseases by airplane to the United States -- for instance, a passenger infected with Marburg virus who arrived in Colorado a few years ago, and another who came to Minnesota infected with Lassa virus earlier this year. And it’s worth noting that there’s currently a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Through July 12, there were 964 Ebola virus cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, including 603 deaths, according to CNN. However, the profile of the jet-flying Ebola carrier doesn’t mesh with the types of people now flocking to the U.S. border. ""The incubation period is two to 21 days, so theoretically, an African could fly from an infected area, land in a Mexican airport, take a bus toward the border, hire a coyote to take him across and then ‘present’ with Ebola,"" said Thomas Fekete, section chief for infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. ""But this presupposes a suicidal person who also has the resources for this kind of travel."" Indeed, the prior, scattered examples of exotic and deadly diseases reaching the United States suggest that ""the likelihood of an illegal migrant getting infected and introducing the disease to the U.S. is probably less than that of a ‘legal’ traveler,"" said Daniel G. Bausch, head of the virology and emerging infections department at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No.6 in Lima, Peru. Another problem: If you had such an infection, the chances are good that you would die on the journey to the United States, said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""You would be too sick to make it to the border by foot,"" he said. So where did these ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as ... Ebola virus"" come from? Initially, when we asked for documentation, Gingrey’s office sent us a number of links to articles. Some discussed the one government-confirmed case of swine flu among recently arrived children, as well reports of scabies and lice and concerns that conditions in the centers holding newly arrived children could promote the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis. Here are the three links Gingrey’s office sent us that mentioned Ebola directly: • A post at a site called The Common Sense Show. It discusses the potential arrival of Ebola-infected migrants as part of a ""coming series of pandemics"" that ""has some governmental agency fingerprints on this invasion. Smart money would say that the CIA is involved."" • An outspokenly anti-President Barack Obama opinion piece in the American Thinker, a Web publication that, in turn, sources its Ebola information to an article on prisonplanet.com, a site run by Alex Jones, a broadcaster who describes himself as a ""prominent figure of the 9/11 Truth Movement."" Citing the continuing surge of migrants at the border, the article closes with this: ""Obama is an enemy to the American people and seems determined to destroy us one way or another. The tyrant must be removed from office as soon as possible."" • An article in WND, formerly known as WorldNetDaily, which has gained attention for publishing articles skeptical of President Obama having been born in Hawaii. The WND article, like the other two, didn’t offer hard documentation of Ebola being found in the United States -- only suggestions that it could. ""Other diseases like dengue and Ebola virus also may be in this wave of illegals, since people are coming from Central and South America, the Middle East and West Africa,"" the WND article said. When we asked Harley, the spokesman for Gingrey, whether his office considered these three citations to be credible sources supporting the Ebola claim, he backtracked, saying, ""These websites were not our source. The source was communication with border agents and organizations that we work with on immigration regularly."" When we asked for further detail, we did not hear back, so we cannot vet these sources’ credibility. Our ruling Gingrey said that amid the ""crisis at our southern border,"" there are ""reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus."" We don’t dispute that the conditions for newly arrived migrant children pose public health challenges. But Gingrey went well beyond that when he invoked Ebola, a particularly scary and untreatable disease with high mortality rates. The reality is that Ebola has only been found in Africa -- and experts agree that, given how the disease develops, the likelihood of children from Central America bringing it to the U.S. border is almost nonexistent. But most importantly for our fact-check, Gingrey’s office was unable to point to solid evidence that that Ebola has arrived in Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S. border. To the contrary, the CDC and independent epidemiologists say there is zero evidence that these migrants are carrying the virus to the border. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jul/18/phil-gingrey/rep-phil-gingrey-says-migrants-may-be-bringing-ebo/

By Odin's Beard: Whoopi Goldberg flubs fact about female Thor
","This fact-check nearly has it all: A deep dive into comic lore, epic superhero battles in alternate universes, female empowerment and a bombastic but mistaken celebrity. The only thing missing is politics, but it’s Friday, so let’s take a break from all that. We couldn’t say no to a reader’s plea to fact-check Whoopi Goldberg of ABC’s The View about big news out of the comics world this week (though not the other piece of news of Archie dying after taking a bullet intended for his gay friend). ""Thor, the God of Thunder, he messed up,"" Goldberg said in the July 15, 2014, segment. ""He is no longer worthy to hold that damn hammer of his. And for the first time in history that hammer is being held by a woman."" Almost, Whoopi. Almost. Marvel Comics announced this week it will introduce a new God of Thunder in the new comic series Thor in October -- and she will be a woman. The company billed it as a shocking shakeup, releasing an image of a blond, muscular woman outfitted in metal plating and a helmet with Mjölnir, the hammer of Thor, in her grasp. ""This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it's unlike any Thor we've ever seen before,"" said series writer Jason Aaron in a statement. This does not mean, as Goldberg wrongly said, that it’s the first time a woman will hold Mjölnir. The editor of the upcoming series, Wil Moss, addressed this point in a Q&A with Time without going into specifics. Time: ""Has there ever been a female Thor before?"" Moss: ""There have been occasional alternate universe stories where there have been female Thors. And there have been occasional stories where a female has picked up the hammer; like there’s an X-Men story where Storm picked up the hammer. But there’s never been a female Thor."" The inscription of Mjölnir reads: ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."" In the news release, Moss joked that it’s time to update the inscription. Neil Johnson, owner of Emerald City Comics in Clearwater, Fla., said that, ""All through the history of that character, when Thor’s been knocked out by a supervillain or whatever, there have been characters that have been worthy enough to pick up and wield the hammer."" Several female heroes have been ""worthy"" of holding the weapon, joining Superman, Captain America and male heroes deemed worthy. This often happens when Thor has been incapacitated or is being punished by his father Odin in alternate storylines and the main canon. We found examples from reddit, the website Den of Geek and Johnson. The earliest example of a woman wielding the hammer is Jane Foster, Thor’s human love interest, in a 1978 What If? issue (No. 1 on this list). In this alternate storyline, she discovered the hammer and became Thordis, saving Thor’s alter ego Donald Blake and beating off alien rock monsters. In another alternate reality issue in 1994, Rogue of the X-Men used her mutant power of absorbing others’ powers and basically sucked up Thor’s life force, using his hammer to wreak destruction on Thor’s alien realm, Asgard, before seeing the light and becoming the hero. Our reader pointed us to a 1996 crossover event between DC Comics and Marvel in which DC’s Wonder Woman wielded Mjölnir. Wonder Woman obtained the hammer and its powers ahead of a showdown with Marvel’s Storm, a female character from the X-Men, but decided not to use it because it would not be a fair fight. (And so she lost.) And then there was the Earth-X miniseries in which Odin transformed Thor into a female version of himself per the urging of Thor’s mischievous brother Loki (see the cover). This was an alternate future timeline, and some reasonable comic fans may argue (as a few did in our reddit thread) that those are considered non-canon and should not count. Still, Storm is one example of a woman who held the hammer in a story within regular continuity ""if people are worried about it,"" Johnson said. Storm uses Thor’s hammer in the 2011 comic X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3 to destroy an imitation hammer called Stormcaster given to her by Loki (again, bad intentions) in a 1985 comic. Other female hammer-holders include Black Widow and Crusader, both in What If scenarios. Read Den of Geek for more. Another character, Tarene, aka Thor Girl, had her own hammer but did not use Thor’s Mjölnir. Our ruling Goldberg said Thor ""is no longer worthy to hold that damn hammer of his. And for the first time in history that hammer is being held by a woman."" It appears Goldberg mixed up her talking points. While this is the first time a woman will be Thor, it’s not the first time a woman has held Thor’s hammer. Storm, Rogue, DC’s Wonder Woman and Jane Foster are among the female characters who have held Thor’s hammer, mostly in alternate storylines. By Odin’s beard, it’s tough to do this. But Whoopi, your claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jul/18/whoopi-goldberg/odins-beard-whoopi-goldberg-flubs-fact-about-femal/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Rick Scott's student spending is 'about $200 less' than during recession, Charlie Crist says
","Charlie Crist has gone on the offensive against Gov. Rick Scott, launching a TV ad campaign and pulling no punches in interviews. In one freewheeling discussion with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board July 16, 2014, former Gov. Crist attacked Scott’s education spending. ""I can only imagine how nice it would be to serve as governor when you have a surplus of almost $3 billion. That’s what this guy has right now,"" Crist said. ""And in spite of it, he still hasn’t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids. In fact, he’s about $200 less."" PolitiFact Florida has done many checks on claims about school spending by these two candidates, but we wanted to know if Scott really budgeted $200 less per student than Crist. Good thing both governors have permanent records for us to check. Budget crunch As a quick overview, the Florida Education Finance Program is the main source of dollars for K-12 education. By law, it’s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the ""required local effort,"" in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. Scott has been touting the $18.9 billion K-12 education spending budget he signed this year as the largest in state history. We rated that Half True, because it was the largest in terms of dollars spent, but not after inflation and not per pupil. When we break down the most recent budget, it works out to $6,937 in spending per pupil. Even though the budget is higher, Florida schools now have a higher enrollment, roughly 90,000 more than in 2007, according to state projections at the start of the 2014-15 school year. Crist has been contending that his per-pupil spending has been higher, referring to the $7,126 per student allocated in his $18.7 billion education budget for 2007-08. That works out to an $189 difference. But considering both governors’ terms as a whole, there’s more to the story. Education budgets declined during Crist’s administration, with a corresponding drop in per-pupil spending, save for a slight bounce his last year in office. Scott, meanwhile, came into office looking to slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget, resulting in a $700 per pupil cut. But lawmakers balked. He settled for knocking $1.3 billion out of the budget, dropping per-student dollars by $540, due in part to a loss in federal stimulus money that had been shoring up spending for Crist’s last two budgets. Then Scott’s numbers started to steadily rise. Fiscal year K-12 budget (total) Per pupil spending 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,761 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,937 The two years with an asterisk were years when the state received about $900 million each in federal stimulus money. In context, Crist said Scott ""still hasn’t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids."" Crist signed his first budget in 2007, a year before the Great Recession began. In 2008, education funding dropped to less than what the 2014 budget now offers. If you compared the 2008-09 budget to Scott’s current budget, Crist is actually behind. However, these numbers don’t account for inflation. If they did, that 2007-08 number would equal $8,176 in 2014 dollars, $1,200 more than what is currently budgeted per student. Even at the lowest spending during Crist’s tenure in 2009-10, the inflation-adjusted total in state and local funding would be around $7,209, still a higher value than Scott’s last budget. Our ruling Crist said Scott’s per-pupil education spending is ""about $200 less"" than the Crist administration did during the recession. Scott’s current budget does spend almost $200 less per student than Crist did in 2007, but that was before the recession really hit. Spending was less during the other three years of Crist’s term -- although still higher than some of Scott’s years. It’s worth noting that Scott cut school funding when he came into office, but has gradually increased it to a level that’s currently higher than what Crist signed off on during the Great Recession. When you account for inflation, though, Crist’s per-pupil spending outpaces Scott’s for every year.

"['Immigration', 'Welfare', 'PunditFact', ""Bill O'Reilly""]","
O'Reilly says over half of immigrants from 3 Central American countries use welfare
","The crisis at the border brought on by thousands of young people seeking entry, some with a parent and many without, has fueled an immigration debate that was already overheated. Fox News host Bill O’Reilly took the government’s ad hoc measures to stanch the influx and deal with those who are already here as proof of a broader problem with immigrants from Central America, particularly those from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. ""Our welfare system is strained to the limit now, so is the public school system,"" O’Reilly said on his July 8, 2014, show The O’Reilly Factor. ""About 50 percent of them lack a high school education. And more than 50 percent of immigrants from those three countries use at least one major welfare program once they get here. So the Obama administration is allowing millions of people to come in without the skills to compete in the marketplace. That is creating an underclass."" A reader asked us to dig into the claim that more than 50 percent of the people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use at least one welfare program. We asked O’Reilly’s show for the sources behind that statement and did not hear back. But a little before his program, the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower immigration levels, released a fact sheet with the numbers O’Reilly used. ""57 percent of households headed by immigrants from El Salvador use at least one major welfare program, as do 54 percent of Honduran households, and 49 percent of Guatemalan immigrant households. Among native households it is 24 percent,"" the fact sheet said. The publication relied on Census Bureau data, which counted ""welfare"" programs as including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP), Medicaid, free and reduced school lunches, Supplemental Security Income (SSI is for poor elderly, blind or disabled people), housing aid, and the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) food assistance program. We should note that several of those welfare-type programs are not available to people living here without permission -- including food stamps, TANF, housing subsidies, non-emergency Medicaid and SSI. The fact sheet made no distinction in the legal status of immigrants, nor did O’Reilly. That aside, immigration researchers we reached said the statistics presented by the Center for Immigration Studies and repeated by O’Reilly are reasonably accurate. Giovanni Peri, a professor of economics at the University California-Davis, said, ""the Center for Immigration Studies probably did it correctly from Current Population Statistics data."" Another economist, Marianne Bitler at the University of California-Irvine, agreed. ""My guess is that their analysis is accurate for the family units they describe,"" Bitler said. That said, there are a couple of caveats researchers said are worth mentioning. Bitler noted how programs that help children could cause an entire household to be included in the tally. The Census, Bitler said, ""measures whether anyone in the household is getting SNAP, but not whether all residents are getting it. Similarly, I imagine a lot of the Medicaid use they capture is by children."" Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, gave an example of how this could play out. ""Suppose there is a family where the father is a Central American legal immigrant, a small business owner,"" Ku said. ""The wife is a U.S.-born citizen and their two children are U.S.-born citizens. One young child gets Medicaid or CHIP (health insurance for children), another gets school lunch and that is the only assistance they get. The whole household is now considered an ‘immigrant welfare user.’ "" The result: a higher percentage. Steven Camarota, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies fact sheet, defends his approach. ""It makes sense to calculate welfare by household because eligibility for most programs is based on household income,"" Camarota said. Another caveat: This difference in how people coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use welfare programs depends on the specific program. Camarota himself noted in a 2012 study that immigrants use cash welfare programs -- TANF, SSI and state cash payments -- at about the same rate as people who were born here. ""Use of cash tends to be quite similar for immigrant and native households,"" Camarota wrote. ""If by ‘welfare’ one only means cash assistance programs, then immigrant use is roughly the same as that of natives."" The numbers in that analysis showed 5.4 percent of U.S. natives received such aid, compared to 7.4 percent of Guatemalans, 5.3 percent of Hondurans and 5 percent of Salvadorans. The gap substantially widens, however, when you include food aid (which included food stamps and free-reduced school lunches) and health care. Our ruling O’Reilly said that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use at least one welfare program. That’s correct when looking at households and use a broad definition of ""welfare,"" experts told us. But looking at individuals would produce a different, lower percentage. Also, there is a wide disparity depending on what particular welfare program you’re looking at. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/18/bill-oreilly/oreilly-says-over-half-immigrants-3-central-americ/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Obama didn't respond to his warning about children crossing border
","In an interview, Rick Perry charged the federal government with failing to tune in when the Republican governor of Texas wrote the Democratic president two years earlier about an increasing flow of children across the U.S.-Mexico border. ""This president, I will suggest, is totally and absolutely either inept,"" Perry told Fox News, his voice rising, ""or making some decisions that are not in the best interests of American citizens, particularly from a public safety standpoint. We flagged this issue in 2012 and have yet to even have a response, as far as I know, from, not just, not from the president, but not even from his administration."" We previously checked other claims Perry made in the June 17, 2014, interview on Fox & Friends, rating as True his statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico were being apprehended at the border, a spike that was in full swing by 2012. We found Pants on Fire his suggestion that recent border-crossers are coming from terrorism-linked countries like Syria. And did Perry flag the surge in unaccompanied children years ago to no federal response? Perry cites two letters To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry was referring to letters sent to President Barack Obama and a Department of Homeland Security official, respectively, by Perry and a gubernatorial aide in May 2012. Perry’s May 4, 2012, letter to the president, covered at the time by the Texas Tribune and Dallas Morning News, accused the Obama administration of failing to work with the home countries of immigrant children to arrange for their return. His letter said in part, ""as your administration is fully aware, there is a surge of unaccompanied illegal minors entering the United States."" It said later: ""Inaction encourages other minors to place themselves in extremely dangerous situations. The vast majority of these unaccompanied illegal minors come from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, as well as Mexico."" Urging Obama to immediately consult the governments of such countries, Perry closed: ""This must stop, Mr. President, and it is your responsibility to make that happen."" Six days later, Perry adviser Chelsea Buchholtz sent a letter to a Department of Homeland Security official, Kelly Ryan, thanking Ryan for a conference call on May 4, the day that Perry’s letter was sent. Buchholtz’s letter said the call brought together federal agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Health and Human Services to speak with the governor’s office regarding the unaccompanied children surging into Texas. In her letter, Buchholtz asked 18 questions starting with the number of unaccompanied children apprehended in Texas and the number of children remaining in the state ""after completion of their immigration cases."" Other questions focused on the number of children in specific categories including those with gang affiliation, with a criminal a record or placed into foster care. ""Please provide this information categorized by nationality for the last 10 fiscal years,"" Buchholtz wrote. No replies? Via the Texas Public Information Act, we asked Perry’s office for texts, emails, letters or other documented evidence of federal responses to the letters. Gubernatorial attorney Chris Sterner replied by email there was ""no information responsive to your request."" We shared Sterner’s response with the White House. Obama spokesman Shawn Turner replied by email that while Perry’s letter ""did not make any requests of the president, we did respond to his concerns. We thought it was important to expand our dialogue with the governor and his staff so we held a number of briefs and engaged in several conversations with the governor's team. The briefs and discussions were intended to give the governor’s team a clear understanding of the administration’s focus on the immigration issues at the border and discuss steps we’re taking to deal with the situation."" We requested dates and times of the briefings. Turner said he didn’t have such such specifics. Perry’s office didn’t respond to our inquiry about briefings. Our ruling Perry said the Obama administration failed to respond to his 2012 letter flagging an uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The day Perry sent his letter, Obama administration officials joined a conference call with his office about the crossings. It’s not clear whether this call was in response to the letter or vice versa, but it does seem to show the border situation had the attention of federal and state authorities. Otherwise, we found no documentation, in Austin or Washington, D.C., of a formal administration reply or of briefings like the ones referenced by the White House spokesman. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Susan Happ says at some point in their lives 99 percent of women use contraception
","The U.S. Supreme Court’s controversial ""Hobby Lobby"" decision in June 2014 involved contraception and the insurance coverage that companies are required to provide to employees under the Affordable Care Act. In a 5-4 decision, the court agreed with arguments made by Hobby Lobby, a chain of arts and crafts stores. Attorneys for the owners had argued they should not be forced to provide certain kinds of contraception that they feel violate their religious freedom. The decision was criticized by Democrats, who argued it allows some companies to make a health care decision for their female employees -- including which forms of birth control are covered. For instance, under the decision, the pill is okay, but intrauterine devices and the morning-after pill can be turned down. Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, a Democrat running in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary for attorney general, laid out her concerns about the ruling in broad terms. ""Giving corporations, executives and bosses the ability to make decisions about women’s health care is deeply regrettable,"" she said in a June 30, 2014 news release. ""At some point in their lives, 99 percent of women use birth control. This decision seems to ignore that fact and side with corporations over women."" Others have cited a similar figure, including President Barack Obama on Feb. 10, 2012 when he unveiled a compromise on birth control coverage in his health care bill that aimed to address concerns raised by the Catholic Church. ""Nearly 99 percent of all women have relied on contraception at some point in their lives –- 99 percent,"" Obama said at a White House briefing. Is Happ right that virtually all women rely on birth control at some point in their lives? When asked for backup, Happ’s campaign directed us to a Feb. 14, 2013 report, ""Contraceptive methods women have ever used: United States, 1982-2010,"" published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That report was based on interviews with 12,279 women between 2006 and 2010. Each woman was asked a series of questions about whether she or a partner had ever used each of more than 20 methods of contraception. The goal of the report was to prepare national estimates on the use of contraception in the United States. Its conclusions were pretty straightforward: ""Virtually all women of reproductive age in 2006–2010 who had ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime (99 percent, or 53 million women aged 15–44)."" The report said 88 percent of the women in that group have used ""a highly effective, reversible method such as birth control pills, an injectable method, a contraceptive patch, or an intrauterine device."" It added that the most common methods used were the male condom (93 percent), the pill (82 percent), withdrawal (60 percent), and the injectable Depo-Provera (23 percent). The report also said that the use of contraception had increased from 94.8 percent of sexually experienced women in 1982, to 98.2 percent in 1995 and 99.1 percent in 2006-2010. So the report is pretty clear when it comes to widespread use of contraception among sexually active women considered to be of reproductive age. But Happ’s claim was broader than that. She did not limit it to an age group, or qualify it as sexually active women, which the report did. That means there are some problems with her claim. For instance, the report says that only 86.6 percent of the women surveyed ever had sex with a male, meaning 13.4 percent never did. Similar trends were found in previous CDC surveys. A 2005 report said that about 8.4 percent of the women included in a 2002 survey said they had never had sex with a man. That survey was of 7,643 women between the ages of 15 and 44. When Obama made his 2012 statement, Cybercast News Service noted that the 2010 CDC report found 13.9 percent of women surveyed never had sexual intercourse, a figure that’s in line with the more recent study cited by Happ. So how many women are we talking about? According to the 2012 Census , the United States had about 92 million women between the ages of 15 and 44, so the number of women who never had sex is just over 12 million women. It is also worth noting that the CDC report says says 93 percent of women reported using condoms, and 60 percent reported using withdrawal as a birth control method. Those figures help  drive the conclusion that virtually all women use birth control at some point in their lives. Neither, of course, is provided by prescription -- the context in which Happ made her claim. So, that also serves to skew the numbers behind the point she is making. Our rating Happ said ""at some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control."" It’s clear she was arguing that contraception use is widespread, and important for women who run the risk of getting pregnant. But in making the statement, Happ used an overly broad brush, applying what is true for a subset (sexually active women between 15 and 44) and applying it to a larger group (all women).

Record doesn't support Kingston claim against Perdue
","In a new campaign flier, U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue is shown holding up a sign that says: ""I don’t vote but I want yours."" ""Perdue has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot,"" the flier states. ""It’s clear he only votes for one thing: himself."" Perdue, a wealthy businessman from Sea Island, and Jack Kingston, a veteran U.S. House member from Savannah, are battling to be the Republican nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Turnout is expected to be light for their runoff Tuesday. And Kingston and Perdue know the outcome could hinge on their ability to persuade their supporters and the party faithful to return to the polls. Kingston’s campaign is suggesting Perdue’s not a true Republican, a charge Perdue’s campaign vehemently denies. The flier is eye-catching. But is this statement accurate? ""Perdue has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot."" PolitiFact is on the case. We began by asking Chris Crawford, Kingston’s campaign spokesman, for proof. Crawford sent us Perdue’s voting records from Massachusetts, Texas, Tennessee and Georgia, places the former CEO of Dollar General has lived since 1994. The records, which we independently verified, show Perdue voted at least nine times in 20 years, including in the Republican presidential preference primaries of 2008 (in Tennessee) and 2012 (in Georgia). He voted by absentee ballot in this year’s May 20 general election primary, when he, Kingston and five others were on the GOP ballot for the U.S. Senate. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s campaign spokesman, said ""it’s a ridiculous assertion"" to suggest Perdue isn’t ""really a Republican."" ""Not only has David voted in Republican primaries for president, but David has also given over $65,000 to Republican candidates and causes in the past decade and raised thousands more to help elect fellow Republicans,"" Dickey said in an email. The Kingston campaign flier shows Perdue in a party hat and says: ""David Perdue celebrating a lifetime of doing nothing for Republicans."" It states that while the GOP was ""busy fighting against the Democrats, Perdue was funding them."" It also calls Perdue out for making a ""big campaign contribution to an extreme Liberal Democrat from Massachusetts"" who is not identified in the flier. Kingston isn’t the first Georgia candidate to use an opponent’s personal voting record to suggest that he or she is a party Johnny-come-lately. In 2010, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp accused GOP rival Doug MacGinnitie of failing to vote in Republican primaries for two decades. MacGinnitie countered with a commercial saying Kemp’s record showed he voted for Democrats. Kemp won the election, and Republican Gov. Nathan Deal went on to appoint MacGinnitie as state revenue commissioner. The argument can be made that, in some areas, where one party dominates, the primary can effectively decide an election. Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said polls show Kingston and Perdue in a relatively close runoff. ""So potentially anything that can move even a few thousand votes could be decisive,"" Sabato said. ""To most people, the topics of these Kingston ads might seem to be small potatoes, and in some sense, they are,"" he said. ""But you have to look at the specialized, concentrated electorate for a runoff."" Voters who go to the polls for party primaries and runoffs are generally ""the most loyal, active party members,"" Sabato said. ""They are precisely the ones who might be most concerned about the candidates’ past party loyalty, nonvoting record and political contributions."" Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said he doesn’t believe any direct-mail piece or online ad would be a game-changer at this point in the race, ""unless it was something new and jaw-dropping, and coordinated with TV and radio spots."" ""The charge that Perdue has not voted in GOP primaries is not new. Voters have heard it before,"" Swint said. ""It's also not terribly surprising for business people who are relatively new to politics to have a thin voting record."" He said voters might be more concerned about the donation to the ""liberal Democrat"" who the Kingston camp told PolitiFact was the late U.S. Rep. Joe Moakley. Kingston’s camp furnished records showing that Perdue, while vice president of Reebok, donated $500 to Moakley’s re-election campaign in 2000. Other records show that Perdue also donated to some well-known Republicans, including Lamar Alexander and Mitt Romney. To sum up, the Kingston camp, trying to convince voters that Perdue isn’t a real Republican, has sent out a flier that states: David Perdue ""has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot."" Public records show Perdue didn’t vote in a general election primary until this year, when he’s a candidate for U.S. Senate. But those same records show Perdue voted Republican in the presidential primaries in 2008 and 2012. That makes the ""never voted in a Republican primary"" claim flat out wrong. We rate the Kingston statement as False.

Do Alaska Sens. Mark Begich and Lisa Murkowski vote together 80 percent of the time?
","Sen. Mark Begich says he and Sen. Lisa Murkowski are on the same team. But she doesn’t see it that way. Murkowski, a Republican, has said that she hopes Begich, a Democrat, loses his seat to a Republican challenger in November. Both senators currently represent Alaska. Despite Murkowski’s feelings, Begich is touting their teamwork in the Senate in a new radio ad. ""Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich vote as much as 80 percent of the time together — that’s healthy for Alaska. I have a great dislike for partisan politics,"" the ad says, narrated by a man identified as Skip Nelson, an aviator living in Anchorage. ""I think Lisa and Mark are a great team for Alaska. I’d like to keep them there."" Murkowski, who is not up for re-election this year, fired back, telling the Alaska Dispatch that the pair agrees on some Alaska-specific issues, but regarding national matters, ""There is a real departure between where Mark stands and where I stand."" And in a statement sent to PolitiFact, she said, ""Over the last five years when we have taken a stand on the role of government in Alaskans' lives I have fundamentally disagreed with Sen. Begich... I believe we need less intervention from government while he pushes for more."" The current Republican front-runner hoping to beat Begich is former Alaska Attorney General Dan Sullivan. Begich’s Republican opponents have tried to emphasize Begich’s ties to President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party. Considering this Congress’ penchant for polarization and Murkowski’s response, we thought it would be worthwhile to see if they really had voted together 80 percent of the time. The numbers The Begich campaign calculated the 80 percent figure using every roll call vote in 2014 in which both Murkowski and Begich participated, through July 2. Murkowski and Begich voted 183 times, according to the campaign’s data, which we confirmed. They voted together 148 times, and they disagreed 35 times. Based on these numbers, the senators voted together 80.8 percent of the time for the first six months of 2014. The 35 votes on which Begich and Murkowski disagreed in 2014 were primarily procedural, but the list also includes more than 10 judges’ and administrators’ confirmations that Murkowski opposed. However, the pair has served together since 2009, so this is just a slice of their voting records. Since the start of 2009, Begich and Murkowski have voted together 60 percent of the time, according to a comparison report by Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. Although the 80 percent statistic inflates their overall record of voting together, they do have a history of voting together that rivals other Senate pairs from opposing parties. In the current Congress (starting in 2013), 16 states have one Democratic senator and one Republican senator. Of these 16 pairs, Begich and Murkowski voted together the most, at a rate of 65 percent in the current Congress, according to OpenCongress’ head-to-head comparison tool. The pair with the next-highest rate of voting together is 47 percent, belonging to New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, Republican. OpenCongress’ data also showed that Murkowski is more likely than Begich to deviate from her party. She voted with Republicans 65 percent of the time in the current Congress, while Begich voted with Democrats 91 percent of the time. One other point: National Journal ranked Begich as the 48th most liberal and 52nd most conservative senator in 2013, based on roll call votes from that year. The magazine ranked Murkowski as 56th most liberal and 44th most conservative, showing that they are both moderate voters. How significant are these votes? In her retort, Murkowski said the votes from this year -- on which the Begich campaign based the 80 percent figure -- were largely procedural, and that’s correct. She said the two senators have differed on important votes throughout the six years they have served together. Here are a few votes with national significance since 2009 and whether or not they voted together: December 2009, On passage of the Affordable Care Act: Disagree (Begich voted ""yes,"" Murkowski ""no""); July 2010, On passage of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill: Disagree (Begich ""yes,"" Murkowski ""no""); April 2011, In favor of stopping the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions: Disagree (Begich ""no,"" Murkowski ""yes""); March 2013, In favor of constructing the Keystone XL pipeline: Agree (both ""yes""); June 2013, On passage of the Senate immigration reform bill: Agree (both ""yes""); October 2013, On passage of the budget bill ending the government shutdown: Agree (both ""yes""); Jan. 30, 2014, On delaying the increase of flood insurance premium: Agree (both ""yes""); July 16,  2014, Failed motion to consider a bill to reverse the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision: Agree (both ""yes""). Our ruling A Begich campaign radio ad said, ""Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich vote as much as 80 percent of the time together."" We found they had voted together 80 percent of the time. However, this statistic is based on the last six months, and Begich has served with Murkowski since 2009. The pair does, though, have a history of voting together more often than not -- about 60 percent of all votes since 2009 -- and the ad said ""as much as 80 percent.""

Latinos not (yet) majority of Texans
","A Dallas legislator hailed a court ruling about the University of Texas by declaring that most Texans are Latino. In his July 16, 2014, press release, Democratic state Rep. Roberto Alonzo applauded the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for upholding how UT-Austin employs race as an element in choosing students to admit. Alonzo then called it imperative for UT to do all it can to keep pace with the state’s changing demographics. His statement listed among factors ""the fact that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas."" That didn’t sound right. Shortly, a spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau, Robert Bernstein, emailed us that as of July 1, 2013, Hispanics ""comprised 38.4% of the total population of Texas."" We spotted that Latino percentage estimate on a bureau web page specifying that of the state’s nearly 26.5 million residents at that time, 40 percent were white, 12.4 percent were black or African American and 4.3 percent were Asian. Separately, the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, advised by email the majority of Texas residents will be Hispanic as soon as 2036 (if migration into Texas from 2000 to 2010 continues at the same pace going forward) or as late as 2049 (if population changes are due solely to in-state births and deaths). Hispanic residents already comprise the majority of students in Texas public schools. According to a March 2014 report from the Texas Education Agency, some 2.6 million Hispanic students accounted for 51 percent of the state’s more than 5 million students in 2012-13--and Hispanic students have been the majority in Texas schools since 2010-11, a chart shows. In 2012-13, white students made up 30 percent of public school enrollment, the report said, with African American students making up nearly 13 percent and Asians nearly 4 percent. By telephone, Alonzo conceded his error. Minutes later, a revised release arrived by email, quoting Alonzo as saying: ""Considering the fact that Latinos now make up  a significant portion (38%) of the population in Texas, coupled with the continuing growth of Latinos in our Texas public schools compared to the low Latino enrollment at UT Austin and the lack of Latinos in professional employment and leadership positions, it is imperative that this flagship institution of higher learning do all it can to improve and keep pace with the changing, diverse demographics."" Our ruling Alonzo said Latinos comprise the majority of Texas residents. That’s incorrect. Individuals who identify as Latino are close to surpassing the share of Texans solely identified as white, but no single ethnic group makes up the majority of Texas residents.

Charlie Crist voted against minimum wage hike, Florida GOP says
","The Republican Party of Florida was quick to assail Charlie Crist’s first gubernatorial campaign commercial, claiming that while Crist says he supports a higher minimum wage, that hasn’t always been the case. ""Crist voted against raising the minimum wage,"" the GOP said in a July 8 ad. With President Barack Obama pushing to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10, the issue has become a campaign plank for Crist. The new Democrat has famously said he’s lived ""paycheck to paycheck"" his whole life, so we were curious if and when he may have voted against a wage hike. Passing the buck Crist has spent years in Florida politics holding a number of elected positions, which he recalled when PolitiFact Florida asked the former Republican what he had to say about the GOP’s allegation about his voting record. ""I haven't taken a vote since 1998,"" Crist told us, referring to his last legislative session as a state senator before a failed run for U.S. Senate. ""This is a campaign about the future. While the economy is improving I have come to the conclusion that the minimum wage we have now is not sufficient."" But the Republican Party of Florida told us they were referring to 2004, when he was attorney general. That year, Florida voters were being asked to decide on a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour. As attorney general, Crist had no say in whether the popular measure passed or not. It ended up passing, raising Florida’s minimum wage and tying it to inflation. This year it went up 14 cents an hour and is now $7.93. In 2006, the Tampa Bay Times profiled Crist as he ran for governor. The article said that as a board member of the state’s public-private economic development agency Enterprise Florida, Crist was part of an Aug. 19, 2004, teleconference in which the organization voted unanimously to oppose the minimum wage increase. The vote was a statement of principle that business leaders did not endorse the wage hike. We asked Enterprise Florida about the vote. Spokesman Sean Helton checked the meeting minutes and found that yes, the board did take a voice vote on the proposal and unanimously opposed it. Then-Attorney General Charlie Crist was present at the meeting. We asked Crist’s campaign to comment on whether Crist had voted against the proposal. They didn’t comment on the Enterprise Florida vote. The Crist campaign referred us back to coverage from 2006, when the Times asked Crist in 2006 while running for governor how he felt about the minimum wage increase of 2004. ""I don't think I had a problem with it,"" Crist said then.   There is scant mention of Crist’s stance on the issue beyond that. It wasn’t a part of his 2006 gubernatorial run, and he hasn’t discussed it until this year’s election, when he made it a part of his campaign promises. Gov. Rick Scott has often couched his lukewarm discussions about the wage as a potential detriment to businesses. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, ""Crist voted against raising the minimum wage."" We should note that the vote in question was not the kind of vote people would usually think of when it comes to the minimum wage. Crist has never voted on legislation about the minimum wage in any official capacity. But Crist was at a 2004 meeting of a business advocacy group, and there was a unanimous voice vote expressing the organization’s opinion against raising the minimum wage. Crist was at the meeting, but none of the votes were recorded. Other than that, we can’t find any evidence of Crist publicly opposing or supporting minimum wage increases, until his recent campaign.

Blog says North Korea told its people their team made the World Cup final
","Germany may have won the 2014 World Cup, but the tournament featuring soccer’s best has left the anonymous producer of the YouTube channel Korea News Backup with good reason to pop the champagne. Its mock video of a North Korean news broadcast previewing the final match has garnered over 8 million views. The video’s charm? It appears to tell North Koreans that their team made it to the final and will face the powerhouse team from Portugal. We at PunditFact took an interest because bloggers, and maybe even some journalists, thought North Korea was actually trying to put one over on its citizens. We want to be clear: The video is a fake. But a writer for the blog Outside the Beltway posted, ""North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final."" The bulk of the post is a copy and paste from an article on the British website, Metro: ""We’ve known for a long time now that supreme leader Kim Jong-un controls the flow of information to his people, with the television channels only reporting positive stuff about the country. ""But in a report posted on YouTube, the media have been caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup. ""The report says North Korea’s brave side crushed Japan 7-0, USA 4-0 and China 2-0 in the group stages, before going on to reach the final… against Portugal. ""Of course, the real final, which takes place this Sunday, is between Germany and Argentina."" The Outside the Beltway blogger observes at the end, ""This is yet another example of just how pervasive the Kim dictatorship is, and just how hard it will likely be to integrate this nation into the real world when that regime finally falls."" We emailed the blogger and didn’t hear back. Curiously, by the time other readers saw the Metro article he linked to, it said something quite different from the words he quoted. The second sentence was key. ""But in a brilliant spoof report posted on YouTube, the media appears to be caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup,"" the Metro article said. We emailed the Metro sports writer to see if the article had been changed from the original but again, no word back. So it’s possible that that sports writer had also been pulled in, but we can’t say. From the comments on the Outside the Beltway blog, it is clear that while most readers doubted the newscast’s authenticity, others were ready to believe that the North Korean propaganda machine was aiming for a personal best in the disinformation category. A dose of reality There are several reasons the North Korean government would be unlikely to try such a stunt. For one, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the games, although not live. Also, most North Koreans would likely know that about two years ago, their team failed to qualify for the World Cup. It ranks 137 in the FIFA world rankings; only 32 countries get to compete. Soccer stat maven and professor of government at Cornell University Chris Anderson said ""making it to the final is basically impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds."" Stephen Epstein, a specialist in Korean culture and society at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, noted several elements in the video would instantly tell a trained viewer that it was a joke. ""As soon as I saw it, I knew what it was,"" Epstein said. ""The way the women was speaking, her accent, sounded like a South Korean broadcaster.  Also she used the word ‘fighting’ (an English word brought over to South Korea). It clearly was not from the north."" In fact, Epstein said he thinks only people outside South Korea ""were suckered."" But he said that’s understandable. ""If you don’t have a real familiarity with North Korea and just know what Western media generally provides, this would fit with a preconceived stereotype,"" Epstein said. A mountain birth and a golf score It’s not as though North Korea doesn’t exercise creative license. According to the official biography of its previous leader Kim Jong Il, he was born on  Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture. In reality, historians place his birth on Russian soil near Vladivostok where his father lived in a camp for Korean exiles. There’s also another sports myth, and this one is interesting because it has morphed over time. In 1994, the Agence France Presse news service said the golf pro at the Pyongyang golf course told a reporter with the Australian Financial Review that Kim Jong Il had scored 5 holes-in-one on his very first time on the links. ""He is an excellent golfer,"" the pro told the reporter. What’s notable about this factoid is that it was first ascribed to the golf pro alone, with no witnesses, as told to a named Australian reporter. By 2003, the New York Post had it at 11 holes-in-one. In 2011, the golf website Cybergolf.com had the 11, plus that the feat was witnessed by 17 security guards and ""dutifully reported to the North Korean masses by the state news agency."" With golf as with soccer, stories about North Korea seem to have the ability to take on a life of their own. Our ruling Bloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final. The video was satire and bore unmistakable markings, for any Korean speaker, of having not come from the communist country. Plus, North Korea had been broadcasting the World Cup and any soccer fan there would know that their team failed to qualify.

Black voter turnout exceeds white voter turnout, even in states with strict ID laws, pundit claims
","Attorney General Eric Holder’s recent suggestion of a ""racial animus"" fueling Obama’s critics is no more than political posturing, said Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley. Some GOP politicians and conservative media objected to Holder’s comments on ABC’s This Week on July 13, 2014. Riley, dubbed by Salon magazine as ""the right’s favorite new race guru,"" dismissed Holder’s claims as fear-mongering a day later on Fox News’ The Kelly File.  ""This is about Democrats concerned about minority turnout in November, and they have nothing to offer these constituents,"" Riley said. ""It’s motivating them by scaring them, telling them that voter ID laws suppress the black vote, even though black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws."" The political and racial motivations and effects behind voter ID laws have been debated for quite some time. We wondered, how did voter ID laws impact voter turnout across the board? The phantom poll booth Riley told us he got the statistic from the U.S. Census Bureau. The federal data agency indicated in a 2013 report that the black voting rate (66.2 percent) indeed surpassed the white voting rate (64.1 percent) by 2.1 percentage points in the 2012 elections.  According to experts, the strictest voter ID laws are when voters are required to present a photo ID when casting a ballot, and if they don't, are required to take additional steps before their vote can be counted. If a voter can’t present an ID, he or she is issued a provisional ballot and must submit an ID within a certain amount of time (usually 2 to 6 days). The Census reports that in these states, black voter rates in the 2012 elections were just as high if not higher than white voter rates: Missouri: Black voter turnout higher by more than 6.0 percent* Tennessee: Black voter turnout higher by more than 6.0 percent Georgia: Black voter turnout higher by 0 to 5.9 percent Indiana: Black voter turnout higher by 0 to 5.9 percent Virginia: Black voter turnout higher by 0 to 5.9 percent* Arkansas: Voter turnout not statistically different* Kansas: Voter turnout not statistically different Texas: Voter turnout not statistically different* (* indicates that voter ID laws were not in effect in 2012) So even with the voter ID laws, black voter turnout was higher than white voter turnout nationally and in the states with the strictest voting laws. But experts say that doesn’t necessarily mean that voter ID laws don’t suppress -- or, at the very least, attempt to suppress -- the minority vote. The jury is still out  The impact of stricter voter ID laws is difficult to gauge because there are many factors determining voter turnout overall. It may be easy to tally the people who are turned away at the polls, but tracking why someone didn’t show up at the polls is another question, said Alex Keyssar, a political scientist at Harvard University. ""It’s safe to say there will be consequences (because of the voter ID laws), but measuring them is extremely difficult,"" he said. The newness of the legislation makes the impact of the voter ID laws that much more difficult to determine. In fact, many of the laws weren’t even in place in the 2012 elections. (Virginia's law goes into effect in 2014, Arkansas' went into effect in 2013 and Texas' went into effect in 2013.) ""One election doesn’t make a pattern,"" said John Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. ""We have a distance to go before we can measure the impact of these laws."" So what accounted for the high turnout of black voters in 2012? Barack Obama, Hansen and Keyssar said. In this year’s midterm elections and in 2016’s presidential race, when Obama’s name won’t appear on the ballot and the laws are in place, the rates may tell a different story. And the increased black voter rates in 2012 could also be interpreted as an unintended consequence or a ""backlash effect,"" according to Erin O’Brien. a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. The stricter voter ID laws may have actually motivated the minorities the laws were trying to suppress. That motivation, unlike its effects, is backed by pretty strong evidence. ""There’s an old quote by David Henry Thoreau. He said, ‘Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk,’ there’s some trout in this milk,"" Hansen said. After Obama’s 2008 victory, the wave of passing new laws on voter access -- including photo ID restrictions as well as proof of citizenship requirements, registration restrictions, and absentee and early voting restrictions -- had a couple of things in common, according to O’Brien’s widely cited 2013 report. The laws were proposed and enacted in states considered to be swing states, where Republicans controlled the government in both chambers, and where minority populations are having more impact on election results. ""Historically, the group that has to fight the hardest are communities of color. This legislation has been forwarded at the exact time that we’re becoming more and more demographically diverse,"" O’Brien said. ""These laws were passed in states where minority voter turnout was higher in 2008 and with larger proportions of African-Americans. So they can be seen as ways to clear these (demographic) hurdles.""   The ruling Riley said ""black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws,"" despite the Democrats claiming the voter ID laws suppress the black vote. While there is debate about the reasons why -- and if the phenomenon will last -- Riley's statistic checks out. Census data shows that indeed, for the first time ever, black voter turnout was higher nationally than white voter turnout, and at least just as high in the states with strict voter ID laws.

Attack ad in Georgia special election ties Jon Ossoff to Al Jazeera
","No Democrat has held Georgia’s 6th Congressional District since 1979. Now, in a race to replace Republican Tom Price who joined the administration as secretary of Health and Human Services, 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff stands out. In a field packed with 16 candidates from both parties, the latest poll shows Ossoff with about 40 percent. He needs to break 50 percent on Election Day, April 18, to avoid a runoff. Republican groups and their allies aim to block that. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, posted a web video that ties Ossoff to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news organization. The ad opens with shots of Islamic fighters followed by a grainy television snippet of Osama bin Laden talking. The voiceover says: ""Al Jazeera, a media outlet that has been described as a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars. But Jon refuses to tell voters exactly how much money he’s received. Just like Jon refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience. What is he hiding?"" The focus of this fact-check is on the ad’s statement, combined with the imagery that accompanies the claim, that Al Jazeera, ""a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars."" A mouthpiece for terrorists? The ad cites an article from the American Journalism Review to back up its description of Al Jazeera. The article, entitled ""The Al Jazeera Effect,"" centered on the news organization’s strategy of getting on-the-ground camera footage and reporting in the early days of the Arab Spring protests. The article relays a variety of opinions that have been offered about Al Jazeera. The ad chose one from this passage: ""For years, critics have assailed what they see as anti-Semitic, anti-American bias in the channel's news content. In the wake of 9/11, Al Jazeera broadcast statements by Osama bin Laden and reported from within the ranks of the Taliban, earning a reputation as a mouthpiece for terrorists."" But the article also quotes David Marash, a former Nightline correspondent who joined and then left Al Jazeera over concerns about anti-American bias. Despite that history, the article said Marash described ""Al Jazeera as ‘the best news channel on earth.... Al Jazeera has become the model all around the world. Video reporting from the field sets them apart and makes them the best.’"" Congressional Leadership Fund spokeswoman Courtney Alexander offered several other examples of criticism of Al Jazeera. A 2001 New York Times Magazine article said ""day in and day out, Al Jazeera deliberately fans the flames of Muslim outrage."" A 2013 USA Today article quoted an Israeli center analyst who said Al Jazeera’s Arab language broadcasts ""very often promote a very radical Islamist approach."" Alexander also pointed to reports that the news network is backed by the Qatari government, and Qatar has been linked to financing terrorist groups. On the other hand, in 2011, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described Al Jazeera in glowing terms for its work during the Arab Spring. ""I’m very proud of the role that Al Jazeera has played,"" McCain said. ""I congratulate you and I mourn for those who have sacrificed in the service of providing the information, which is knowledge, which is power."" The point is, some people have a bad opinion of Al Jazeera and others think it’s done good work. The ad cherry-picked images and a quote that cast Al Jazeera in the most dubious light possible. That characterization was the basis for the rest of the ad. Al Jazeera payments to Ossoff The video said Al Jazeera has been paying Ossoff thousands of dollars. Its source is an article from the conservative website the Washington Free Beacon, based on Ossoff’s congressional financial disclosure form. The report covered all of 2016 and nearly three months in 2017, and in it, Ossoff includes Al Jazeera as one client out of 13 that paid his firm Insight TWI at least $5,000. Insight TWI is a British-based documentary film production company. Ossoff became its CEO in 2013. Here’s the key section from his disclosure:  The Washington Free Beacon asked Ossoff to go beyond the federal requirements and say how much he received from Al Jazeera. He didn’t respond. As a technical matter, according to the experts we reached, the Al Jazeera payments went to the firm, not Ossoff as the video said. He was CEO and shared in the proceeds, but all we know is that Al Jazeera paid Insight TWI at least $5,000. In a statement, Ossoff’s campaign said his firm’s clients include broadcasters in Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. ""Under Jon’s leadership, the company’s investigations have resulted in the arrest of foreign officials stealing U.S.-taxpayer-funded aid and quack doctors who mutilate women, as well as exposed atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq, including sexual slavery,"" the statement said. According to the Insight TWI website, the company produced 10 film projects since Ossoff took the helm. Of those, nine were for Al Jazeera. During the time period covered by Ossoff’s financial disclosure, 2016 and 2017, there is only one film project reported for Al Jazeera. The other was for the BBC. The most recent Al Jazeera project was a six-part series on Latin America. Topics covered included child trafficking and sexual exploitation across the Argentina-Bolivia border, allegations of slave labor in Brazil’s garment industry and deaths in police custody in Mexico. Over the years, Al Jazeera paid Ossoff’s company for investigations that revealed government corruption in Africa, extra-judicial killings, corrupt doctors selling HIV/AIDS drugs on the black market, and related themes. One film dealt with terrorists. It was produced for the BBC and followed a group of Yazidi women turned soldiers who seek revenge on ISIS fighters. Alexander of the Congressional Leadership Fund noted that Ossoff mentions the BBC but not Al Jazeera on his website. Ossoff’s resume When Ossoff launched his campaign, he touted his national security background, saying he had five years under his belt as a congressional staffer. We found that was an exaggeration. By our count, he spent about three years in middle-to-senior level foreign policy posts. The ad says Ossoff ""refuses to tell voters the truth about his experience."" On the contrary, the campaign provided a timeline (at the bottom of this link) showing what he did and when. Alexander told us that on the stump, Ossoff doesn’t go out of his way to acknowledge his exaggeration. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund video says Al Jazeera, ""a mouthpiece for terrorists, has been paying Jon Ossoff thousands of dollars and asks ""what is he hiding?"" This is a case when a series of partial truths are strung together to promote the worst possible conclusion. Some Americans have called Al Jazeera a mouthpiece of terrorists. Others, including a U.S. senator, have praised it as a beacon of reporting in the Middle East and Africa. The ad cherry-picks its evidence to characterize Al Jazeera only as aligned with terrorists. Al Jazeera did pay Ossoff's company. During the time frame covered in his financial disclosure, Ossoff’s firm produced two film projects, one for Al Jazeera and one for the BBC. Al Jazeera has been a major client over the years, but going back to the start of 2016, it is one out of 13. In addition, the films Al Jazeera have commissioned focus on wrongdoing in Africa and Latin America and have nothing to do with the Middle East or terrorism. The ad suggests Ossoff is hiding something. Given the evidence at hand, the answer appears to be that he is unwilling to open the books of his business beyond what the law requires. The ad’s description of Al Jazeera strikes us as particularly selective and central to the suspicions the ad raises. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/13/congressional-leadership-fund/attack-ad-ties-jon-ossoff-al-jazeera/

Fake news alert: Vin Diesel names Rockford his favorite city
","If you’re a major movie star driving a rental car in Illinois this year, you may want to avoid Rockford. Or perhaps make a beeline there. In March, the website WBN 12 News had the hearts of at least a few Twitter and Facebook users in and around Rockford racing with a heartwarming story about ""Fast & Furious"" star Vin Diesel’s heavy praise of the town’s people and cuisine. ""During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently,"" read the post.    The story then describes Diesel praising the people of Rockford as ""the real deal"" and voicing his plans to retire in Rockford when his acting days are over. He also applauds the ""great freakin’ burger"" he had at Rockford’s GreenFire restaurant. Indeed there is a restaurant in Rockford called GreenFire and a quick skim of its menu indicates that its burgers likely would earn the ""great freakin’"" label. (Ex.: ""BEEF & DUCK BACON brioche bun. grass fed beef. yellow cheddar. duck bacon. $13."" Sounds freakin’ great to us.) The story then describes Diesel praising the people of Rockford as ""the real deal"" and voicing his plans to retire in Rockford when his acting days are over. He also applauds the ""great freakin’ burger"" he had at Rockford’s GreenFire restaurant. Indeed there is a restaurant in Rockford called GreenFire and a quick skim of its menu indicates that its burgers likely would earn the ""great freakin’"" label. (Ex.: ""BEEF & DUCK BACON brioche bun. grass fed beef. yellow cheddar. duck bacon. $13."" Sounds freakin’ great to us.) RULE No. 1: READ THE DISCLAIMER There’s plenty in this post to create a veneer of truth. Who’s going to argue that the people of Rockford aren’t a friendly and helpful bunch? After all, this is the town that gave the world Cheap Trick, perhaps the world’s most affable and hard-working rock band. The ""WBN News 12, Breaking news, local news"" banner at the top of the page certainly looks like something you’d find on a news website. But when a story appears under a heading that contains a link labeled ""disclaimer,"" it’s a smart news consumption practice to click that link. In this case, doing so gives the reader vital information: ""wbn12.com is a satirical and fantasy website. None of the articles on wbn12.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes. The satirical and fantasy articles on wbn12.com poke fun at our celebrity obsessed cultures and the politically correct world we’re forced to live in."" A recent Pew Research study found that 35 percent of news consumers use social media as their primary pathway to news -- roughly equal to the 36 percent who said they go directly to news sites. So when a joke gets shared on social media as real news, there’s significant potential for confusion. ""‘Fake news’ propagated by endless (social media) ‘printing presses’ can be a source of entertainment and amusement that is appreciated for its satirical presentation but too often is taken much too seriously,"" says Jim Grubbs, associate professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Springfield. When that happens, it creates a dilemma for legitimate media. Has the phony story become so rampant that it merits coverage? On this one, the answer was ""no"" for the Rockford Register Star. ""The staff here was aware of the Vin Diesel report and checked it out,"" said Mark Baldwin, executive editor of the Rockford Register Star. ""When we discovered there was nothing to it, we dropped it."" The paper didn’t want to call undue attention to the story or confuse readers by reporting on it, Baldwin said. Kudos to Rockford radio personality Mark Charvat for using his blog on station WXXQ-FM 98.5’s website to call out the Vin Diesel story as fake. VIN DIESEL: TWO-TIMER When we plugged a chunk of the ""Vin Diesel"" quote into Google, we learned that WBN News 12 is just one piece of a satirical website empire. Vin Diesel fans who believed the Rockford story likely would have been crestfallen to learn that the actor had said the very same things about Norwalk, Ohio, on the website Local 31 News, which carries a strikingly similar disclaimer to that of WBN News 12. While Rockford fed Diesel a mere burger, Norwalk feted him with a ""great freakin’ steak"" at Berry’s. Rockford residents, however, need not feel jilted by Diesel’s affection for Norwalk. They’ve also got Johnny Depp raving about their hospitality. As reported by the website Daily News 10, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" actor had mechanical problems with a rental car when he was passing through Rockford. He, too, found Rockfordians to be ""the real deal"" and, like Diesel, plans to settle in Rockford when his acting days are over. Depp’s Rockford helpers treated him to a ""great freakin’ burger,"" but it was at Buddy’s, not GreenFire. Another Rockford radio personality, Mandy James, deserves credit for flagging that one as phony in a Jan. 3 blog post. OUR OWN GATEKEEPERS PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan noted on International Fact-checking Day that in an age of ever-more-slick websites putting out articles that, at first glance, seem legitimate, news consumers need to be especially vigilant. Before sharing an article on social media, check its original source. In the examples above, an obvious disclaimer fairly screamed that the articles were not to be taken seriously. Yet they still were shared is if they were true. ""If a headline strikes you as so outrageous that you want to immediately tell all your friends about it, take a quick pause. It might well be fake. You can do your homework by inspecting the source of the news story,"" Holan cautions. ""Is it a news organization you’ve heard of? Look at the web address. Is it a clever knock-off? For example, abcnews.com.co is a phony version of the actual news site abcnews.go.com and is a purveyor of fake news."" There’s certainly no harm in imagining Vin Diesel or Johnny Depp getting a lesson in Heartland hospitality in Rockford, Norwalk, Ohio, or any other off-the-beaten-path Midwestern town. The sites that offered those articles accomplished their clearly stated goal of poking fun at our celebrity-obsessed culture. But sites that traffic in more serious ""fake news"" don’t put disclaimers on their articles. They’re out not to entertain, but to agitate. Know the warning signs and be a smart news consumer. OUR RULING Anyone who saw the Vin Diesel or Johnny Depp posts should have been tipped off about their nature by the ""disclaimer"" tab above the headline. Even the most cursory second look at this claim would have revealed it worthy of our Pants on Fire rating.",/factchecks/2017/apr/13/blog-posting/fake-news-alert-vin-diesel-names-rockford-his-favo/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Yes, Florida has the second-lowest state taxes per capita
","Gov. Rick Scott travels the state with a rap sheet of talking points laying out all he’s done to lower taxes — a topic, no doubt, on many Floridians’ minds ahead of Tax Day. (Tuesday!) Scott launched into this list during a roundtable discussion in Pensacola on April 7. ""We’ve cut taxes 55 times. Our job growth rate is showing almost double the rest of the country. Our labor force is growing four times the rest of our county, and we have the second-lowest tax burden, per capita, state taxes in the country,"" Scott said. We previously evaluated an earlier version of Scott's 55 tax-cut claim, rating a statement that he cut taxes ""more than 40 times"" as Half True. We decided to focus here on whether Florida’s tax burden is the second-lowest in the land. Florida taxes near the bottom of pack Almost all credible analyses of Florida’s tax burden have the Sunshine State paying some of the lowest taxes per capita in the country. According to the Florida Department of Revenue, the state collected about $38.6 billion in state and local taxes in fiscal year 2016. In 2016, Florida’s population, according to the U.S. Census, was about 20.6 million. Do the math, and that’s a little more than $1,800 in taxes collected per person, or capita. Other estimates are close to our own. Scott’s office pointed us to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. Using the most recent data from the U.S. Census, it found Florida collected $1,836 in per capita state taxes in fiscal year 2015. That amount gives Florida the distinction of having the second-lowest state taxes per capita out of all 50 states. Our own calculation, achieved by comparing the U.S. Census 2015 Annual Survey of State Government Tax Collections (the most recent year) to 2015 population data, also puts Florida as the place with the second lowest state taxes. A slight wrench in Scott’s factoid is that state taxes are not the only type of taxes that Florida collects. According to Florida Tax Watch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending, Florida ranked 27 out of 50 states for per capita local tax collections in fiscal year 2014. Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research, said Florida’s local tax burden is far higher than the state’s tax burden. Florida’s low state tax burden combined with a middle-of-the-road local tax burden still leaves Florida with some of the lowest taxes per capita. The same Tax Foundation analysis cited by Scott ranks Florida as having the fifth-lowest state and local taxes per capita. Thinking beyond per capita The problem with per capita figures is context, said Richard C. Auxier, a research associate in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. The per capita figure includes millions of people, namely children, who either pay no taxes or pay a nominal amount (the sales tax on a toy purchased with allowance money, for example). It doesn’t mean that all Floridians pay low taxes. For example, Florida’s lack of an individual income tax is good news for high earners. But low-income residents may feel more of a benefit with living in a state with a lower sales tax (Florida’s is 6 percent, which is about the 16th-highest rate in the country). One more thing: A state’s tax burden is the result of many factors, not just the influence of one chief executive. North Dakota had some of the highest taxes per capita in the latest fiscal year, but that’s not because North Dakota is a high tax state, it’s because the state experienced an oil boom which brought in more tax dollars that year than other years prior. Our ruling Scott said Florida has ""the second-lowest taxes, per capita, state taxes of any state in the country."" Based on our own calculations, as well as a credible analysis from the Tax Foundation, Florida has the second-lowest state taxes per capita (behind Alaska). When you include our middle-of-the-road local taxes, Florida still hovers around the bottom for per capita taxes, but it’s not the second-lowest. And it’s important to remember that just because a state’s per capita taxes is low, it doesn’t mean everyone in that state has low taxes. Scott’s measurement is accurate but doesn’t quite tell the whole story. We rate Scott’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/13/rick-scott/yes-florida-has-second-lowest-state-taxes-capita-d/

Fake news story falsely quotes Kasich saying some women not smart enough to decide on abortion
","A fake news story that made Ohio Gov. John Kasich appear to degrade women while discussing abortion actually is a bogus story first posted on an often-cited parody website. The headline on a March 28, 2017, post on WalkWithHer.com read, ""Kasich: ‘If a woman is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed, how can we entrust the abortion decision to her?’"" The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds. Kasich allegedly made the remarks after vetoing the so-called ""heartbeat bill,"" a bill that would have outlawed abortion in Ohio once a fetal heartbeat could be detected. At the same time, he signed a bill that made abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal, unless the mother’s life was in danger. The post, which is fake, said Kasich defended his actions by saying women weren’t as strong as they were in ""the old times."" They made poor decisions for themselves, including abortions, so Kasich had to take action, the article said. ""If a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion,"" the post quoted Kasich. While Kasich did take those actions on both of those bills on Dec. 13, 2016, the quote attributed him is made up entirely, as is the rest of the story. It’s another example of a story taken from Newslo.com, which first ran the parody post on Dec. 15.   Newslo.com is the umbrella site for a family of online parody outlets, and refers to itself in a disclaimer as ""the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.""

Rep. Hartzler misses the trend on insurance premiums
","Ever since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Congressional Republicans have been consistent in their criticism of former President Barack Obama’s health care law. Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, has been one of the most ardent advocates for repeal, regularly railing against the shortcomings of Obama’s health care law. Ten days before the planned Republican replacement bill was withdrawn, on March 14, Hartzler sent a tweet that said, ""For too long, Obamacare has caused high premiums and dismal coverage. It’s hurting Americans all over! We need to #RepealAndReplace!"" Accompanying the tweet was an image that read, ""Fact: Under Obamacare premiums in job-based coverage have increased by $3,775."" We wanted to fact-check Hartzler’s claim. What we found is that while health care premiums in job-based coverage have increased in the amount Hartzler claimed, experts and independent analysis reveal that Obamacare itself is only responsible for a very small percentage of that increase. The vast majority of premium increases, experts said, was due to continually rising health care costs. And, notably, the trend the in increases has markedly slowed. Accurate figures PolitiFact reached out to Hartzler’s spokesperson, Kyle Buckles, and he provided the source of the data: a Kaiser Family Foundation interactive graph published on Sep. 14. Buckles indicated that to arrive at the specific figure of $3,775, they looked at the premium increase for job-based coverage — also known as employer-sponsored coverage — between 2009 and 2015 for families. The difference in cost for those years, though, was greater than the number they cited, at $4,170. The figure from the image that Hartzler tweeted was actually the increase between 2010 and 2015 — Obama signed his health care law in 2010. So, Hartzler is correct in noting that for families the average cost of a premium in job-based coverage increased by $3,775 in Obamacare’s first five years. Impact on premiums In context with her tweet that ""Obamacare has caused high premiums,"" it’s implied that Hartzler is claiming that the the health care law was directly responsible for the $3,775 increase in premiums. But to Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, the correlation between the law and these premium increases is tenuous. ""The Affordable Care Act did require that employers provide preventative care services without cost sharing,"" Blumberg said, ""and there were some other small changes, but those changes, the actuaries estimated that at most that would have an impact of 1 or 2 percent on premiums (in job-based coverage)."" Blumberg continued, ""That difference in premiums between 2010 and today, very little of that is attributable to the Affordable Care Act."" Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, in an email agreed that only 1 to 3 percent of the increase could be attributed to the Affordable Care Act between 2010 and 2015. The rest, he said, ""would be due to increasing health care costs."" Changes in job-based coverage In addition to requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance, the health care law mandated several more changes, most of which came into effect in 2014. (The rule requiring that employers with 50-99 full-time employees offer coverage did not come into effect until Jan. 1, 2016.) Some other notable changes included: > The requirement that dependents under 26 could be covered. > Mandatory minimum coverage, which includes things like preventive services, among other things. > Bans on annual and lifetime dollar limits. > Ban on cost-sharing limits such as copays and deductibles. > Ban on refusing coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. Such changes made it impossible for employers to offer bare minimum coverage without facing penalties. A bigger picture In addition to the fact that the health care law is likely only responsible for 1 or 2 percent of the increase in premiums for employer-sponsored coverage, Hartzler’s numbers fail to take into account that the increase in premiums has actually slowed under the health care law. According to a Kaiser news release included with the interactive graph that Hartzler’s team cited, since 2011, when the Affordable Care Act was first implemented, the average of family premiums in job-based coverage has only increased 20 percent. Between 2006 and 2011 the increase in premium cost in the same coverage was 31 percent. And between 2001 and 2006 it was 63 percent, according to the full report and corresponding data. In the news release, Drew Altman, Kaiser Family Foundation president and CEO, said, ""We’re seeing premiums rising at historically slow rates, which helps workers and employers alike."" The problem with the decrease in premiums, according to Altman and Kaiser, is that, in part, they have occurred due to increases in deductibles. According to the Kaiser news release: ""In 2016, 83 percent of covered workers face a deductible for single coverage, which averages $1,478. That’s up $159... from 2015, and $486... since 2011. The average deductible for workers who face one is higher for workers in small firms (three to 199 employers) than in large firms."" Blumberg saw it similarly. ""It looks to me very much like the increases — the trends in premiums in recent years — has not been high relative to historic increases in employer-based insurance,"" she said. So, according to the data available, while family premiums under job-based plans have continued to rise since the law’s implementation, they have done so at a much slower pace than at any point since 1999. Our ruling Hartzler claimed that ""Obamacare has caused high premiums and dismal coverage,"" and that ""premiums in job-based coverage have increased by $3,775."" Her claim ignores a key finding of the study from which her numbers came: that the increase in premiums is dramatically slowing. She also discounted the fact that experts believe that only 1 to 3 percent of the increase in premium cost was actually attributable to the Affordable Care Act. Due to her misinterpretation of the numbers, we rate Hartzler’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/13/vicky-hartzler/rep-hartzler-misses-trend-insurance-premiums/

Donald Trump changes NATO position: 'It's no longer obsolete'
","President Donald Trump seems to have warmed up to NATO, declaring publicly that he no longer thinks the U.S.-European alliance is ""obsolete."" During the 2016 election, Trump criticized NATO because, he said, member countries aren’t contributing their fair share to the alliance financially, and the organization isn’t designed to fight terrorism. His comments precipitated some concern among the United States’ allies. But months later, during an April 12, 2017, press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump affirmed the United States’ commitment to the alliance and praised its seven-decade history. He said NATO is now doing more to fight terrorism, and as a result he no longer thinks the organization is obsolete. ""The secretary general and I had a productive conversation about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism,"" Trump said. ""I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change. Now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete."" That’s a big departure from comments he made on ABC in March 2016: ""I think NATO's obsolete. NATO was done at a time you had the Soviet Union, which was obviously larger, much larger than Russia is today. I'm not saying Russia's not a threat. But we have other threats. We have the threat of terrorism and NATO doesn’t discuss terrorism, NATO's not meant for terrorism."" However, the premise leading to Trump’s change of heart — the idea that he prompted NATO to start fighting terrorism — is false. He’s talking about the fact that in 2016 NATO created an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Experts said the change was not especially significant, and Trump wasn’t the catalyst. The development had been in the works for years. ""It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign,"" said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center, in a prior PolitiFact interview. Further, Trump’s comment gives the incorrect impression that NATO wasn’t responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. In reality, NATO has been actively dealing with terrorism since the 1980s. And since 9/11, it has played a significant role in the War on Terror, including deploying troops in Afghanistan for more than a decade. We should note, though, that experts also told us that NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counterterrorism because of problems with coordinating among the member countries. Even before the election was over, Trump hinted that he thinks NATO is making itself more relevant in the fight against terrorism. But at the April press conference he made his change in opinion clear, saying, ""I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete."" It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about Trump’s reversal on NATO.

76 patients did not die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center
","Assemblyman Michael P. Kearns has called for a federal investigation into the number of deaths at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center. ""I was shocked to learn of these numbers from the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,"" said Kearns, a South Buffalo Democrat. ""Seventy-six deaths in three years equate to about 25 patients a year dying at this facility."" Kearns has an intense reason to focus on the Buffalo facility. He opposes a state plan to close the Western New York Children’s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca, located in his district, and relocate its patients to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center by the end of 2018. The state has said there will be a separate entrance and wing for children at the Buffalo facility, but opponents of the plan still do not want children relocated. Kearns wants an independent investigation of the Buffalo facility before the consolidation, but the state calls that unnecessary. The state also disputes the number of deaths Kearns has cited. So, who’s right? Did 76 patients die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center over three years? How many died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center? The state requires facilities like the Buffalo Psychiatric Center to report the number of deaths that happened on-site and also certain deaths that happened away from the facility. Every patient death — inpatient or outpatient — must be reported, whether the death is related to treatment or not. If someone receiving outpatient treatment dies in a car crash, for example, that death would be reported. The facility also must count people who die within 30 days of ending treatment, regardless of the circumstances. Kearns cites 76 deaths because that’s the number reported between June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016, on a document from the state Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs. An advocate for children with special needs obtained the document through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared the information with Kearns. But the Justice Center calls Kearns’ claim inaccurate. ""It would be inaccurate to assume that all 76 deaths listed in this FOIL response to have  physically occurred at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center,"" the Justice Center said in a statement.  ""The information provided includes a listing of all deaths reported to the Justice Center of individuals receiving residential services at a particular facility or who had received such services within 30 days of their death."" Further, ""please be advised that we do not track where the death occurred, since a death could occur in a location that is not under the jurisdiction of the Justice Center, such as in an emergency room,"" the response said. The state Office of Mental Health, which runs the Buffalo facility, confirmed in an email that 13 people died on-site at the facility in the same time period. ""During the time frame in question, there were 13 deaths on the Buffalo Psychiatric Center campus, all due to natural causes,"" according to a statement from the mental health agency.   The 63 other deaths did not happen at the facility and could be unrelated to any treatment. The state did not have a breakdown of how many of the 63 people who died were still patients at the time of their deaths. Our ruling Kearns said 76 patients died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center between June 2013 and March 2016. The number is misleading. The state Office of Mental Health confirmed 13 deaths at the facility during that time. The remaining deaths did not happen at the facility.

Donald Trump's Syria strike looks a lot like Barack Obama's plan, despite what Rubio, others say
","It was ""the right move"" for President Donald Trump to launch airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack, said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on CNN April 7. But almost four years ago, Rubio opposed President Barack Obama’s plan to order airstrikes in Syria, also after dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people. Rubio explained why 2017 is different than 2013 on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos. ""Here's the first thing that's changed from 2013 to now: The Russians are now there,"" Rubio said in an April 9 interview. ""Assad was losing back in 2013. If we had armed non-jihadist elements on the ground, they could have overthrown him. That's what I thought was the better approach at the time. ""The second is that the administration, what they were proposing, had no clear objective. They wanted to blow up some things to send a message. I don't think you use the U.S. military simply to send a message. This strike was limited, but it had a clear strategic objective, which was the destruction or degrading of a key airbase installation that is used in these chemical attacks."" Rubio is one of several Republicans — including Trump — who have flipped from opposing post-chemical weapons airstrikes in 2013 to supporting them in 2017. Rubio has a point that the geopolitical situation in Syria has changed; Russia, Iran and the Islamic State are all bigger players in the Syrian civil war than they were three and a half years ago. But we were also interested in Rubio’s assertion that the Obama administration’s proposal, compared to Trump’s actions, didn’t have a clear objective. The argument rings hollow. Obama and his team spent several days making the case to Congress and the public that they should support military action in Syria, and the goals and plans they laid out were quite similar to the actions Trump took in 2017. We reached out to Rubio's staff for comment but didn't hear back. Making the case In August 2013, Assad’s regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack on the city of Damascus. Obama wanted to strike Syria in retaliation, but he chose to ask Congress to authorize his use of military force. Obama couldn’t get enough votes to pass his proposal, so he did not order strikes fired in direct retaliation for the chemical attacks. The 2017 chemical weapons attack was much smaller, killing about 80 people. Two days later, without advance notice or requesting congressional approval, Trump launched nearly 60 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield used to carry out the chemical weapons attacks.   Because the Obama administration spent several days lobbying Congress and the public to support his proposed military action, there are numerous speeches, media interviews, documents and congressional hearings during which his team laid out the strategy. For Trump, in contrast, we have to look at what members of his administration have said to justify the airstrikes after the fact. Here are three examples each of the Obama and Trump administrations laying out their goals. Both describe sending a message to Assad that chemical weapons use is unacceptable. Both involve a targeted attack plan designed to degrade Assad’s chemical weapon capabilities by taking out related facilities and resources. If anything, the Obama White House’s objectives, as well as the scope of the operation, were more clear than Trump’s because the Obama administration had to lobby the public instead of acting unilaterally. Obama:  In this 2013 photo, members of former President Barack Obama’s administration — Martin Dempsey, John Kerry and Chuck Hagel — appear before the Senate to make the case for military action in Syria. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press) • Obama’s proposal to Congress: ""The objective of the United States' use of military force in connection with this authorization should be to deter, disrupt, prevent, and degrade the potential for, future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction."" • Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey in a House hearing: ""(Obama) has directed me to plan for a militarily significant strike that would do the following: deter the Assad regime's further use of chemical weapons and degrade the regime's military capability to employ chemical weapons in the future. We've assembled target packages in line with those objectives. We have both an initial target set and subsequent target sets should they become necessary. The planned strikes will disrupt those parts of Assad's forces directly related to the chemical attack of 21 August; degrade his means of chemical weapons delivery; and finally, degrade the assets that Assad uses to threaten his neighbors and to defend his regime. Collectively, such strikes will send Assad a deterrent message, demonstrating our ability to hold at risk the capabilities he values most and to strike again if necessary."" •  Secretary of State John Kerry in a Huffington Post article: ""It would be a tailored action to make clear that the world will not stand by and allow the international norm against the use of chemical weapons to be violated with impunity by a brutal dictator willing to gas hundreds of children to death while they sleep. Our action would be a limited and targeted military action, against military targets in Syria, designed to deter Syria's use of chemical weapons and degrade the Assad regime's capabilities to use or transfer such weapons in the future."" Trump:  In this image provided by the U.S. Navy, a guided-missile destroyer launches a missile in the Mediterranean Sea, April 7, 2017. (via Associated Press) •  Trump in a statement to Congress two days after the strikes: ""United States intelligence indicates that Syrian military forces operating from this airfield were responsible for the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians in southern Idlib Province, Syria, that occurred on April 4. I directed this action in order to degrade the Syrian military's ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks and to dissuade the Syrian regime from using or proliferating chemical weapons, thereby promoting the stability of the region and averting a worsening of the region's current humanitarian catastrophe."" • National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster in a press briefing: ""Obviously, the regime will maintain the certain capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons, we think, beyond this particular airfield. But it was aimed at this particular airfield for a reason because we could trace this murderous attack back to that facility. And this was not a small strike."" • Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on This Week: ""The president was very clear in his message to the American people that this strike was related solely to the most recent horrific use of chemical weapons against women, children and, as the president said, even small babies. And so the strike was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the U.N., your agreements under the Chemical Weapons Charter back in 2013, that those would not go without a response in the future."" Rubio himself had the opportunity to question Obama administration officials about Syria in a September 2013 Senate hearing. There, he said he was concerned that Obama’s proposed operation was too narrow to degrade Assad’s chemical weapons abilities and deter future attacks — a position that conflicts with his current stance that Obama administration’s plans weren’t focused enough. ""Quite frankly, I'm a bit skeptical that the act, that what the president is asking for will provide the support needed to achieve these objectives and that these objectives are even realistic at this point,"" Rubio said. ""It leads me to my second question: How confident are you, and how confident can you express to this committee, you are that we can, in fact, put in place a military plan that's limited in scope and duration, that can effectively degrade Assad's capability to carry out future chemical attacks?"" Dempsey replied, ""I'm confident in the capabilities we can bring to bear to deter and degrade. And it won't surprise you to know that we will have not only an initial target set, but subsequent target sets should they become necessary."" Philip Gordon, who was the White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf Region from 2013 to 2015, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t see any material difference between the Trump administration’s actions in 2017 and Obama’s proposed actions in 2013 that could lead a politician to change their position, other than political calculation. Yes, the dynamics of the Syrian civil war have changed, in that Russia, Iran and ISIS now play larger roles, Gordon said, ""But none of those are relevant to the core question at hand: Is this strike capable of deterring chemical weapons? That’s the stated goal of both presidents."" Our ruling Rubio said the Obama administration’s 2013 Syria airstrike proposal ""had no clear objective,"" while Trump’s Syria strike ""had a clear strategic objective."" In 2013 Obama’s team made their goals clear through a days-long lobbying effort: to degrade Assad’s chemical weapons abilities and deter future attacks through targeted military strikes on facilities and resources related to the attack. Trump in 2017, conversely, didn’t lobby Congress and the public because he launched his strike unilaterally. After the strike, his team said the action was designed to degrade a facility related to the chemical weapons attack and send a message that the United States doesn’t tolerate chemical weapons use. There is little material difference between what Obama planned to do and what Trump actually did, in terms of goals and scope.

Did he or didn’t he? Trump contradicts himself on whether he knew Steve Bannon
","President Donald Trump wavered in his support for White House aide and strategist Steve Bannon in an interview with The New York Post on Tuesday, following stories of a rift forming between Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. ""I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,"" Trump said. ""I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn’t know Steve. I’m my own strategist, and it wasn’t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary. ""Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will,"" Trump said. Trump ""didn’t know Steve""? That’s an altogether different story than Trump told when he first hired Bannon, a former top editor at the conservative website Breitbart, onto his campaign staff last fall. It also directly contradicts the public record. Trump announced the hiring of Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway as part of the Trump campaign on Aug. 17, 2016. Here’s what he said at that time: ""I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years. They are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win,"" Trump said. ""I believe we’re adding some of the best talents in politics, with the experience and expertise needed to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and continue to share my message and vision to Make America Great Again. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election, and ultimately become President because our country cannot afford four more years of the failed Obama-Clinton policies which have endangered our financial and physical security."" So, in Trump’s own words he either ""didn’t know Steve,"" or he has ""known Steve … for many years."" One of those claims is clearly wrong. Rebecca Berg of RealClearPolitics provides the answer. She reported the day after Bannon’s hiring by the campaign that Bannon first met Trump in 2011, when Trump was considering whether to challenge President Barack Obama in 2012. In later years, Bannon hosted a radio program in which Trump was a frequent guest, Berg reported. ""As Breitbart grew, Mr. Trump was constantly in touch with Steve about news articles and doing interviews with his reporters,"" David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy nonprofit Citizens United, told RealClearPolitics. The Washington Post counted nine times that Trump appeared as a guest on Bannon's radio show. That version of events is corroborated by The New Yorker. ""In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama. Bannon and Trump met at Trump Tower and discussed a possible campaign. Trump decided against the idea, but the two kept in touch, and Bannon gave Trump admiring coverage. Bannon noticed that, when Trump spoke to crowds, people were electrified. Bannon began to think that Trump might be ""the one"" who could shake up American politics.""

Evangelical leader Kenneth Copeland did not threaten Trump opponents with having homosexual children
","A fake news story claimed evangelical leader Kenneth Copeland said Christians who don’t support President Donald Trump could face punishment from a vengeful God, who would potentially give the unfaithful a homosexual child. An April 7, 2017, post on AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com carried the headline, ""Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be ‘punished’ with gay child."" The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected it may be fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to cut down on fake news in users’ feeds. The post said Copeland, the head of Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries, understood that Trump was not perfect, but leaders are chosen by God and must be followed in accordance with God’s will. What would happen if Christians don’t obey? ""If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God,"" the story quoted Copeland as saying. ""Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child."" Of course, Copeland didn’t say this, because the story is fake. Copeland did support Trump prior to the election, and served as one of the billionaire’s faith advisers during the presidential campaign. He also told followers in October 2016 that there would be consequences for skipping a vote for Trump. ""You’re going to be guilty of murder,"" he said on a TV program.

Congressman proposes new tax on remittances to pay for Trump's border wall. We checked his numbers
","While President Donald Trump maintains that Mexico will pay for a border wall, Republican lawmakers are looking for other ways to help fund the president’s signature campaign promise. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., introduced the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017 to levy a 2 percent fee on money sent by individuals in the United States to recipients in nations ""south of the U.S. border,"" funds known as remittances. ""This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall,"" Rogers said in a March 30 press release. He added some large numbers about remittances to bolster his case. ""Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the U.S. to their home countries,"" Rogers said. ""In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances."" Remittances serve as a source of income for migrants’ families who generally use the money to pay for housing, food and other living expenses. To an extent, Rogers’ two-fold statement is backed by data. The exception is his point about South America — we could not find any countries on that continent with remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP. Money sent to Mexico checks out Rogers’ bill seeks to tax immigrants living in the United States illegally who send money back to their countries, according to a press release from his office. The text of the bill itself does not explicitly address how people here unlawfully could be targeted. Experts have told us that while undocumented immigrants do send remittances, it’s hard to determine how much they send, since U.S. citizens and immigrants living here legally also send money. Mexico receives more money from U.S. residents than does any other nation, by far. Rogers’ statement about remittances sent to Mexico is based on data from the World Bank. The World Bank has for several years estimated the bilateral flow of remittances from its member countries. The latest number is actually higher than what Rogers said. Mexico received more than $25.6 billion in remittances from individuals in the United States in 2015, according to the most recent World Bank estimates. Mexico also topped the list as the country receiving the most remittances from the United States from 2010-15, according to a May 2016 Congressional Research Service report. China came in second and India placed third. Money sent to South and Central American countries Rogers claimed that some South and Central American countries receive more than 15 percent of their gross domestic product, or GDP, in the form of remittances. We asked what countries he had in mind. A spokesperson pointed to Haiti, a poor island in the Caribbean, as well as Honduras and El Salvador in Central America. (The spokesperson added that Rogers' statement was actually based on 2015 data, not 2014.) A country’s GDP is an indicator of the health and size of its economy. Comparing remittances to a country’s GDP can be helpful in understanding the economic effects of foreign labor migration and money sent to residents across countries. In other words, a large remittance total may be less eye-popping when it’s compared to the broader economy — and vice versa. ""For example, if I tell you that in 2015, Mexico received $26 billion in remittances and Haiti received $2.2 billion, you might think that remittances are far more important to the Mexican economy than they are to Haiti's,"" said Roy Germano, a New York University professor who has researched migrants’ remittances. ""But the fact is, Mexico's economy is much larger than Haiti's (as is its population)."" Remittances to Haiti represent a much greater share of income for the country than they do in Mexico. In 2015, remittances from the United States accounted for more than 15 percent of Haiti’s GDP and about 2.2 percent of Mexico’s GDP. Small island states or small, impoverished countries are most likely to have shares of remittances at 15 percent or more of GDP, said Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, professor and chair of the economics department at San Diego State University. Tajikistan, in Central Asia, has depended on remittances since years-long armed conflict in the 1990s claimed more than 100,000 lives, noted the Congressional Research Service’s report. Tajikistan topped a CRS list as the country with the greatest percentage of its 2014 GDP in form of remittances (from all places), at nearly 42 percent. Rogers’ office did not provide any examples of countries from South America with remittances via the United States that amount to more than 15 percent of GDP. We crunched the numbers for South America and found that none came close to 15 percent. Here’s a sample: Percent of Guyana’s GDP in form of remittances? 5.9 percent. Ecuador: 1.02 percent. Colombia: 0.5 percent. Bolivia: 0.4 percent. Brazil: 0.04 percent Venezuela: 0.01 percent (based on 2013 GDP/remittances data) Our ruling Rogers said, ""In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances."" Based on World Bank estimates, Mexico did receive more than $24 billion in remittances from the United States in 2015 (the year Rogers meant to use). Rogers would have been on safer ground in the second part of his statement had he described nations south of the border more generally. According to the latest data, a couple of countries in Central America — El Salvador and Honduras — received at least 15 percent of their GDP from remittances. Haiti, in the Caribbean, also received at least 15 percent. No country from South America reached that threshold.

House Speaker Richard Corcoran says small businesses get 'almost nothing' from Enterprise Florida
","Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran continued his scorched-earth campaign against taxpayer-backed business incentives, this time attacking Gov. Rick Scott for spending too much time defending Enterprise Florida and not enough time on issues that protect jobs. In an April 3 Tampa Bay Times column, Corcoran warned that not addressing the state's workers' compensation system and a property insurance issue known as ""assignment of benefits"" will put small and family-run businesses in jeopardy. Corcoran said that instead of working with the House on these issues, Scott has spent most of the 60-day legislative session fighting for an agency that doesn’t help small businesses. ""(Enterprise Florida) subsidizes big companies with over 1,000 employees to compete against our small businesses, which make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce and who almost never receive a penny of government money,"" Corcoran wrote. For this fact-check, we decided to focus on the statistics about small businesses in Florida and whether they ""almost never"" receive government money. Regardless of how you define them, small businesses make up a large chunk of all businesses in Florida. However, his point that small businesses ""almost never"" receive government money is at best an exaggeration. Small businesses not so small in Florida  There is no standard definition for a small business. The difference between large and small firms can depend on how many people a firm employs, the amount of revenue the firm makes or the type of industry. No matter which way you slice the pie, small businesses in Florida comprise a significant chunk of all business in the Sunshine State. Florida is home to approximately 2.4 million businesses of all sizes. That figure includes large firms, small firms and nonemployer firms — a technical term to describe a business with no employees. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals whose business may or may not be the main source of income, such as someone who earns money as a tutor. Nonemployers make up 81.5 percent of all businesses in the state. The latest snapshot comes from the federal government. The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy considers a small business as any firm with fewer than 500 employees (including the nonemployers). Under that metric, the total number of small businesses is about 2.3 million. That comes out to 99.8 percent of all businesses, an even larger share than Corcoran’s figure. Corcoran got to his figure of 98.9 percent by excluding firms without a single employee. The figure came from a report that divided the number of firms with fewer than 500 employees (almost 420,000) with the total of firms with employees (424,550). To throw out another measure that still proves the prevalence of small businesses, firms with fewer than 20 employees make up about 90 percent of all businesses in the state. Corcoran’s point about small businesses employing ""nearly half"" of the workforce is slightly above the actual figure. The latest number shows that small businesses (defined as fewer than 500 employees) employed 3.2 million people. That is about 42.8 percent of the workforce. Kwame Donaldson, a senior economist at Moody’s, said that compared to the national average, small businesses in Florida employ a smaller share of the workforce (43 percent in Florida vs. 48 percent nationwide). Are small businesses getting gypped? Corcoran said small businesses ""almost never"" get government money. Corcoran’s team pointed to a December 2016 review of Enterprise Florida’s economic development system by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, a nonpartisan research arm of the Legislature. The analysis found that the majority of businesses incentives (51.9 percent) went to employers with more than 1,000 employees. The analysis pointed out that businesses with less than 50 employees received only 14.5 percent of economic incentives. ""Although 96 percent of the state’s businesses employ fewer than 50 employees, most state-level economic development programs, particularly incentives, generally benefit large businesses,"" it reads. Here’s the breakdown:  If we consider a small business as a firm between 1 and 499 employees, as Corcoran did for the other part of his point, then small businesses were awarded 38.3 percent of economic incentives. That’s not as much as the big firms got, but it’s not ""almost nothing."" Our ruling Corcoran said small businesses ""make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce"" and ""almost never receive a penny of government money."" No matter the definition, small businesses in Florida make up the majority of all businesses in the state. Corcoran’s specific numbers are accurate if a small business is defined as any firm with fewer than 500 employees. However, by that 500-employee metric, it is not the case that small businesses ""almost never"" receive government money. While large firms get the majority of incentives, firms that employ between 1 to 499 people in Florida were awarded almost 40 percent of all incentive projects in past years. So while large firms receive the majority of economic incentives, it is imprecise to say there’s ""almost nothing"" left for the little guy.  For a partially accurate claim that requires explanation, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/11/richard-corcoran/are-small-businesses-getting-gypped-incentives/

Did Adolf Hitler use chemical weapons? Sean Spicer wrongly says Hitler didn't sink to that level
","Sean Spicer turned heads in the White House briefing room during a discussion of the situation in Syria when he wrongly claimed that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons. Spicer, President Donald Trump’s top spokesman, was discussing why Russia might withdraw support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and referenced Assad’s attacks on his own people. ""You had someone who is despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons,"" Spicer told reporters April 11, 2017. Spicer attempted to clarify his point when pressed by reporters. ""He was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,"" Spicer said. ""He brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that. But (not) in the way that Bashar al-Assad used them where he went into towns, dropped them down, into the middle of towns."" We believe Holocaust centers refers to concentration camps. As for the rest of Spicer’s statement, there is a reason Nazis and Hitler became synonymous with the term gas chamber. That’s because they pumped hydrogen cyanide gas into the killing rooms packed with Jews, Roma, and others singled out for extermination by Nazi leaders. At concentration camps such as Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen, Jews were taken from cattle cars and forced into ""showers,"" where guards released the gas. At the height of deportations, an estimated 6,000 Jews died each day in the Auschwitz gas chambers. Spicer appears to be trying to limit his definition of chemical weapons to those dropped from planes or fired through cannons, as Assad has been alleged to have done. That sells short the definition in the Chemical Weapons Convention, which took force in 1997. Here’s the convention’s definition: 1. ""Chemical Weapons"" means the following, together or separately: (a) Toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where intended for purposes not prohibited under this Convention, as long as the types and quantities are consistent with such purposes; (b) Munitions and devices, specifically designed to cause death or other harm through the toxic properties of those toxic chemicals specified in subparagraph (a), which would be released as a result of the employment of such munitions and devices; (c) Any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of munitions and devices specified in subparagraph (b). The Nazis’ hydrogen cyanide meets the first condition and the gas chambers would qualify as a ""device"" in the second. There is no mention that chemical weapons are only those used on the battlefield. Brian Finlay, president of the Stimson Center, a Washington defense policy group, told us that ""the Nazis would surely have been in contravention of the (Chemical Weapons Convention) had it being in effect during the second World War."" For what it’s worth, the consensus view is that Hitler did not use chemical weapons in battle. But Spicer’s qualification that Hitler didn’t use them on his ""own people,"" overlooks that German Jews were full citizens until they had their rights stripped away by Hitler’s totalitarian regime. A large number had assimilated and some had become Protestants. It’s possible Spicer was thinking of Austrians, Hitler’s birthplace, but Austrian Jews fared no better than German ones. Spicer, in a statement after the press briefing, said: ""In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers.  Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable."" Our ruling Spicer said Hitler never used chemical weapons. The Nazi regime brought an industrial approach to mass murder of its citizens and others it sought to exterminate. The construction of gas chambers and the use of deadly gas was fundamental to that strategy. While the convention against chemical weapons did not exist in World War II, the modern definition would encompass the Nazi gas chambers. It makes no difference whether victims are brought to a room filled with deadly gas, or if the gas is sent to them in a bombing raid.

Fake news site alters real story of fiery car crash, tries to spread malware on your computer
","A fake news website looking to spread malware lured readers by altering details of a tragically true news story of a fatal car wreck that killed two women and several children. At least 22 posts we first noticed on April 10, 2017, on the website CountyNewsroom.info carried headlines that declared, ""2 moms, 5 kids killed in car crash,"" followed by the name of a county, such as Stark County or Schuyler County. Facebook users flagged multiple versions of the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. The story is fake, although it does steal details from a real event (more on that in a second). The posts at CountyNewsroom.info appear to exist to goad readers into clicking on them because a familiar county name is used. When users get to the site, however, pornographic malware can be downloaded onto their computers. We won’t be linking to any of the stories for that reason. The site made a minimal attempt to look official, using the CountyNewsroom.info domain and listing the author of the posts as ""Police."" The graphics used evoke breaking news from a real media outlet, and can change from post to post. Some of the articles have comments posted expressing sympathy for the victims, although it’s not entirely clear if those comments are real or not. There is no contact information on the website, but it is registered to an administrator in Tbilisi, Georgia. The small country in the Caucasus has been a growing source of multiple fake news websites since the 2016 presidential campaign. We emailed the person listed in the WHOIS lookup, but have not heard back. The story, meanwhile, gives no indication in which state it is located, but the details of the accident are identical in each version. Two men — Carter Anderson, 35, and Nathan Mcconaghy, 47 — were the sole survivors of a crash that killed their families, the posts said. According to the story, the two men were in a minivan with their families when the minivan hit a black BMW on the side of the road. The minivan was then struck from behind by ""a big rig,"" sending the minivan toppling into a ravine. The minivan caught fire, the story read, and the two men managed to escape. Their wives and children, aged 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 years old, were trapped and died in the fire. The men were severely burned on their hands and faces trying to rescue their families, but had to be restrained by authorities. ""Words can’t describe what that was like when we arrived on scene,"" a law enforcement official identified only as Officer Dan Williams was quoted in the posts. ""It was very horrific seeing them trying to get their families out, us trying to help get their families out. Like I said, the van went up in flames very, very quickly."" The two men were airlifted to an unspecified hospital, the article said. While that particular accident is fake, the framework of the article has been taken from a real-life tragedy in June 2016 near Gorman, Calif. Some, but not all, of the details were changed. Two California men named Aaron Hon Wing Ng, 34, of San Francisco and Wei Xiong Li, 45, of Daly City were involved in a nighttime accident that happened as described in the fake post. Their wives and four children, not five, were trapped in their minivan and killed in the fiery wreck. The children were aged 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the two men did suffer burns trying to save their families. The quote is unaltered, and came from a California Highway Patrol officer named Dan Williams. Another CHP officer also is quoted in some true reporting of the incident. The author of the post made minimal changes to real news stories about the accident, using the shocking specifics to fool readers into clicking. But visitors thinking they are reading about a local accident end up being fooled into exposing their computers to an attack with pornographic software. We rate this story False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/11/countynewsroominfo/fake-news-site-alters-real-story-fiery-car-crash-t/

Is vehicle break-in the most common crime in Pittsburgh?
","Parking is a contentious issue in the nightlife hotspot South Side Flats — and according to Pittsburgh City Council President Bruce Kraus, it’s also the source of the city’s most common crime. As part of an effort to ease parking woes for residents and improve public safety, the city launched shuttle service Nite Rider on March 17. The fare-free shuttle runs Friday and Saturday evenings, allowing Pittsburghers to leave their cars at the Second Avenue Parking Plaza to go to the nightlife on East Carson Street and the surrounding South Side Flats. It’s part of a ""public safety strategy designed as a transportation strategy,"" Kraus told The Incline, adding that vehicle break-ins are the most frequent crime in the South Side Flats — and overall in the city. Within the Flats, assault is the No. 2 crime (if simple and aggravated assaults are combined), Kraus said. ""Data shows that vehicle break-in is the No. 1 crime in the city, but also the No. 1 crime in the South Side Flats, and it’s closely followed by assault. So it’s always been my dream that if we take cars out of residential areas, put them in a single, secure lighted location, they’re easier to patrol, there’s less chance of miscreant behavior, and I’m hoping at the end of the year to show a drastic reduction in vehicle break-ins,"" Kraus said. While the Nite Ride and other changes, including extended parking meter hours, are designed to make it easier and more inviting to go to the South Side business district, we wondered, are vehicle break-ins really the top crime in the South Side Flats? And in the city? Kraus told The Incline that he based his statement on conversations with Zone 3 Pittsburgh Police Commander Karen Dixon, and the data they discussed is reflected in the police bureau’s Annual Report. The most current version of that report available is from 2015. In it, police breakdown reported crimes into 24 categories, plus an ""other"" section. Of the 24 specific crimes, theft was No. 1 in 2015 with 7,101 reported incidents out of the year’s total of 30,900 reports. Those numbers are tabulated based on reports to police. But theft is a broad category that includes more than just vehicle break-ins. In 2015, there were 2,311 reports of vehicle break-ins or ""theft from auto,"" as police call it, per Emily Schaffer, spokeswoman for the public safety department. When theft is split into those two categories — theft from auto and other theft — that puts theft from auto as the fourth most common crime in 2015, behind simple assault at No. 1 (5,446), followed by other theft (4,790) and vandalism (3,507). In the report’s neighborhood breakdown, theft was also No. 1 for 2015 at 505. Of those, 190 were ""theft from auto"" per Schaffer. Using the same list of 24 specific crimes for 2015, after theft is public drunkenness in second with 323 incidents, and in third, 310 simple assault incidents. However, combining simple assault with the 61 aggravated assaults brings it to No. 2, as Kraus said, with a total of 371 assaults. But, split theft from auto and other theft, and vehicle break-ins come in at No. 5. First is 323 incidents of public drunkenness, second is 315 reported thefts, third is 310 reports of simple assault and fourth is 211 reports of vandalism. If aggravated and simple assaults are combined, it becomes the most common crime in the South Side Flats in 2015, followed by public drunkenness, other theft, vandalism and theft from auto. Our ruling When theft is split into ""theft from auto"" and ""other theft,"" vehicle break-ins fall to the fourth most common crime across the city and No. 5 in the South Side Flats. That split also makes simple and aggravated assaults the most common crime in the neighborhood for 2015. The councilmember would have been on firm ground if he had said theft — the category vehicle break-ins falls into — was the most common crime in the city and South Side Flats. When looking at the overall theft category and combining the two assault categories, theft does become the most common crime, and Kraus also would be correct that the second most common crime in the Flats is assault. We rule the claim False.",/factchecks/2017/apr/11/bruce-kraus/vehicle-break-most-common-crime-pittsburgh/

Will California soon have the highest gas tax in the nation?
","Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno recently claimed California would soon have the ""highest gas tax in the nation."" He made the claim in a press release days after the California Legislature passed a 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax hike, part of a funding package to raise billions of dollars for state road repairs. ""The $52 billion tax will also put Californians in a special, yet unenviable category – drivers who pay the highest gas tax in the nation,"" Patterson said in the release issued April 10, 2017. With Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature the bill will go into effect in November. The Golden State’s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country. Our research Asked for evidence, Patterson’s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation.  That map and its numbers, however, are outdated. A map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates. Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees.  It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58 cents. California’s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation. Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California’s tax will trail Pennsylvania’s by 8 cents per gallon. ""You won’t be No. 1, that’s for sure,"" said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. ""Pennsylvania will still be the highest."" A chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation’s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state. Based on current rates, California’s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii. This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts. We looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California’s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii’s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said. Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline. This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state’s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which ""would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania,"" Henchman said. Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not. Our ruling Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California’s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the ""highest gas tax in the nation."" Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates. Current figures from the Tax Foundation show California’s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania’s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November. California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation. These figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute. In the end, we rate Patterson’s claim False. UPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline.  The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California’s new legislation. It concluded ""Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin."" This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November.  The state’s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California’s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation’s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concluded this higher California gas tax, even in 2019, would  be ""just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax.""

How many people are at risk of dying from starvation?
","Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., joined members of Congress on Twitter April 7 to raise awareness for food issues using the hashtag #FightFamine. ""More than 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within 6 months in 4 nations,"" he wrote. More than 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within 6 months in 4 nations. This is unacceptable. #FightFamine pic.twitter.com/pwj0tZ0V4Y Is that true? The tweet is based on a projection from the United Nations. The U.N.’s head of emergency relief Stephen O’Brien provided the 20 million persons estimate to the U.N. Security Council on March 10. Behind that figure lie crises in Yemen, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria and Somalia. ""Without collective and coordinated global efforts, people will simply starve to death,"" O’Brien told council members. To be clear, the number of people today who literally would have nothing to eat if it weren’t for international aid is less than 20 million. But O’Brien warned that it would reach that number if nothing is done. O’Brien said this disaster would unfold in 2017. The chief economist of the U.N. World Food Program warned in February that the world could see widespread starvation develop in these four places within six months. ""This is the first time that we are literally talking about famine in four different parts of the world at the same time,"" Arif Husain told Reuters in an interview. An immediate surge of $200 million in aid was needed O’Brien said, but he cautioned that most of the problems are political. ""With access and funding, humanitarians will do more, but we are not the long-term solution to this growing crisis,"" he said. Only in Somalia has nature played a key role. The causes in Yemen, South Sudan and northeastern Nigeria are primarily man-made. Yemen Years of civil war have killed an estimated 10,000 civilians and shredded the fabric of life for millions of Yemenis. A coalition of followers of the Houthi movement and forces loyal to the previous president toppled the elected government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Iran has backed the insurgents. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have deployed airstrikes and soldiers to restore Hadi to power. The World Food Program said nearly a quarter of the population -- 6.8 million -- rely entirely on outside assistance. A sharp delcine in oil and gas exports caused the economy to collapse, essentially shutting down all imports of wheat and rice. South Sudan After almost 40 years of civil war, South Sudan separated from Sudan in 2011, but peace was short lived. By 2013, competing factions battled for control of the new country. Since then, the violence displaced about 2.7 million people. Combatants target civilians and aid workers, making South Sudan one of the most dangerous places to deliver humanitarian assistance. The U.S. Famine Early Warning Network reported that the ""conflict has disrupted planting, harvesting, and other livelihood activities."" With production down, food prices have shot up beyond the reach of millions. Northeastern Nigeria Kidnappings and attacks by Boko Haram insurgents in the north produced a running battle with Nigerian armed forces. About 2 million people abandoned their fields and fled their homes. The crisis is most acute in the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe where about 7 million people need humanitarian assistance. Despite gains by the Nigerian military, farmers have been unable to plant for three years in a row. Some fear outright attack, but landmines present an ongoing threat long after rebels have been driven back. Without a new harvest, not only will farmers’ families lack food, but what food is available will be more expensive. Somalia Extreme weather has dramatically added to the human misery in an already fragile state. After floods ruined crops and displaced people in 2015, drought has now led to some of the driest conditions in decades in some regions. According to the United Nations, over half of the population -- about 6.2 million -- is in need of help. That includes about 363,000 acutely malnourished children. Aid officials say the nation is on the brink of famine. Our ruling Crowley said that 20 million people are at risk of dying from starvation within six months in four nations. That’s in line with the assessments of two U.N. officials who say the threat is of historic proportions.
