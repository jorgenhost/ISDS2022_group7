No, OnlyFans isn’t recruiting for adult film stars on college campuses. Man in viral video is acting
","Some social media users on Twitter and other platforms raised alarms over a video that they claimed shows a recruiter pitching college women on contributing pornography for OnlyFans, an internet subscription platform popular for hosting adult content. The original video was posted Feb. 9 to Instagram by a social media influencer who goes by the name Bendadonnn, and who has hundreds of thousands of followers on the platform. He did not respond to a request for comment sent via Instagram direct message. The 45-second video shows him wearing a shirt that says ""OnlyFans Recruiter"" while distributing brochures and urging the students at Florida International University in Miami to consider contributing adult content to OnlyFans. He tells women passing by that the company could be their stepping stone to ""financial freedom."" The man is not a real OnlyFans recruiter, however; his video appeared to be created as a joke.  The caption on his Instagram post featured 20 laughing-face emojis. The comments under it included comments from several professional athletes, including Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., applauding Bendadonnn for his ""acting."" And on Twitter days later, Bendadonnn wrote that the video ""pissed em off"" and was ""impeccable acting.""  But that didn’t stop some social media users from reposting his video as though it depicted a real OnlyFans recruiter who was running a table at a sponsored campus event. ""OnlyFans has guys on campus encouraging your daughters to do porn for ‘financial freedom,’"" said one Feb. 10 tweet that went viral. ""The colleges are lost. Don't send your kids there."" The tweet was viewed hundreds of thousands of times and shared widely, including by one host of the conservative website the Daily Wire, who wrote that the recruiter was ""creepy.""  A Feb. 10 tweet falsely cast an Instagram video as an authentic portrayal of an OnlyFans recruiter on a college campus. Similar posts on other platforms were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In separate statements to PolitiFact, spokespeople for Florida International University and OnlyFans confirmed that Bendadonnn isn’t affiliated with either the university or the company. ""Last week, a person claiming to represent a private business recorded a video in the Graham Center,"" said Maydel Santana, the university spokesperson. ""The individual’s use of the space was in violation of our campus policies, and he was quickly asked to leave campus. This person is not a representative of FIU and their actions do not reflect the values of our community."" In its statement, OnlyFans said: ""OnlyFans is not affiliated with this individual and he is not employed by nor does he represent the company in any way. These actions are not sanctioned by OnlyFans and fall outside our acceptable use policy, which prohibits impersonating OnlyFans or one of its employees.""

Fact-checking a claim that Nevada ranks close to last on election integrity
","Nevada was one of the battleground states where former President Donald Trump spun falsehoods that the 2020 election was rigged and that the state was sending ballots to dogs.  Nevada is now one of many states where Republicans running in 2022 primaries vow to improve election integrity, including Jesse Haw, a former state senator and Reno-based developer who’s running for secretary of state. The candidates are running to replace term-limited Barbara Cegavske.  Haw wants to get rid of Nevada’s system of sending a mail ballot to every voter, add a photo ID requirement for in person voting, and require ID verification such as a driver’s license to vote by mail. Haw says Nevada has a long way to go to improving elections. ""Nevada ranks 50th in election integrity ratings,"" he said in a Feb. 2 Facebook ad. We were curious whether Nevada did rank last and how such a ranking would be compiled. While Haw’s statement suggests there were multiple ratings, it is based on one. And it comes from a group with a strict view of election integrity that tends to align with laws Republicans favor. Haw said his ad was referring to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization that in December announced a state-by-state election integrity scorecard. Heritage ranked Nevada 50th, ahead of only Hawaii. (The District of Columbia was included in the ranking). Georgia ranked first. The scorecard does not champion ease of voting or ballot access. Instead, it opposes expansive voting by mail and rewards tighter election rules such as strict photo ID requirements. ""They have a one-sided view of what’s important,"" said Matthew Weil, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""They really focus on what they deem to be integrity measures."" Other groups that analyze state election laws or outcomes gave Nevada higher marks than Heritage did. Heritage’s scorecard is based on their views of state election laws Heritage’s methodology is based on examining 12 areas of state election law. States with expansive mail voting policies — such as sending a mail ballot to every voter, as Nevada does — lose out on points. The state also lost points for having same-day voter registration and automatic voter registration where people can register to vote at the DMV.  The point system is ""essentially anti-mail voting,"" said Thessalia Merivaki, a political scientist and expert on elections at Mississippi State University.  Among Heritage’s critiques of Nevada are that it has ""unattended, unsecure drop boxes."" A state law passed in 2021 says that drop boxes must be secure, locked, and made of metal — but it doesn’t state that election workers must stand by the boxes or have security cameras on them. Jennifer Russell, a spokesperson for the secretary of state, told us that most drop boxes are attended by election workers. (Ballot drop boxes are generally more secure than mailboxes.) Heritage also deducted points because Nevada doesn’t use a federal database called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, to verify whether voters are citizens. But few states use SAVE to verify citizenship, and when Florida tried using SAVE to find noncitizen voters in 2012, it went so poorly, it scrapped the effort. In Nevada, citizenship is validated by the voter through an affidavit signed under penalty of perjury when registering to vote, Russell said. The state conducts a post-election audit of the voter rolls and refers for investigation anyone identified as potentially falsifying this requirement.  We found at least one indicator in Heritage’s assessment that appeared to be wrong.  Heritage said Nevada does not have ""procedures to investigate the validity of a registration when an absentee ballot is returned undeliverable by the post office."" But Russell told us if a ballot is returned as undeliverable, the clerk or registrar follows up with the voter to confirm their address. If the voter does not reply within 33 days, their voter registration is inactivated. Absentee ballots are not accepted if they do not match an active registered voter.  Evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election in Nevada was scarce. An AP investigation found roughly 90 possible cases out of more than 1.4 million votes cast. Danielle Strasburger, a spokesperson for Verified Voting, a group that advocates for safer election technology, said Heritage doesn’t evaluate whether states conduct post-election audits or use voter-verified paper ballots, a system that allows voters to print out the ballot to check it over before finalizing their votes. ""At a time when voter concerns about hacking of voting machines and electronic counts have never been greater, paper ballots and audits provide a much-needed basis for confidence in election outcomes,"" Strasburger said. Heritage’s scorecard, Merivaki said, shows ""a clear bias about specific processes, such as absentee voting. It completely ignores security protocols that states have to ensure secure voting.""  Some elections experts agreed with parts of Heritage’s methodology, such as giving states points for participating in the Electronic Registration Information Center, a consortium that helps states maintain accurate voter rolls, while disputing other parts of their methodology. ""To their credit, they identify some healthy election practices, such as participation in the interstate program ERIC, but they also look down on practices that would actually create more accurate voter rolls and improve the voting experience for citizens, such as automatic voter registration,"" said Matthew Germer, a fellow at the R Street Institute, a right-of-center think tank. We found other groups have rated states’ elections on more diverse criteria. One of the longest-running and most frequently quoted analyses is the Election Performance Index, developed with guidance from officials who work in elections and now run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In 2018, Nevada scored an 80% and ranked 14th. (The group plans to publish the 2020 index in a couple of weeks). Charles Stewart, an MIT professor who runs the index, said it takes into account convenience and security, although security can be a challenge to measure.  Another analysis of state election practices was developed by a group of nonprofit think tanks across the political spectrum including R Street and the Bipartisan Policy Center. The group agreed on minimum standards for voter registration, casting a ballot, counting votes and security, and it calls on the federal government to give grants to states that meet those standards.  The group found that two states — Colorado and Georgia — meet all the recommendations. Nevada was in compliance with 83% of the standards, placing it in the top fifth of the states.  Other analyses rate states on ease of voting by mail. One of them, from the National Vote at Home Institute, gave Nevada its top rating, five stars, for 2021. Nevada got high marks because it sends all voters a mail ballot, provides online registration, provides multiple places to return mail ballots and takes steps toward securing the voter rolls. Haw said in a Facebook ad, ""Nevada ranks 50th in election integrity ratings."" The ad suggests that multiple ratings have found Nevada in last place, but that’s not true. The 50th place rating came from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which tied its rating solely to security issues, not ballot access or voter convenience.  Other groups that considered multiple issues found that Nevada was not significantly worse than other states. MIT’s Election Performance Index, for example, ranked Nevada 14th in 2018. The National Vote at Home Institute gave Nevada five stars, its top rating, in June based on policies that include ease of voting by mail. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.  RELATED: Republicans facing off in 2022 GOP primaries are running ads claiming the 2020 election was stolen RELATED: How the GOP spun a 'dead voter' allegation in Nevada RELATED: Much has changed since Jimmy Carter’s report on fraud in mail voting",[<zip object at 0x00000280974AB1C0>],/factchecks/2022/feb/14/jesse-haw/fact-checking-claim-nevada-ranks-close-last-electi/

COVID-19 vaccines do not contain HIV
","COVID-19 vaccines do not contain harmful substances or introduce disease, though those debunked theories continue to circulate on social media.

The audio that was substituted comes from a video by a Canadian group, Together As One, that opposes COVID-19-related public health measures. Though the Facebook post says the second booster contains eight ""strains"" of HIV, in the video, a female narrator seems to say ""strands"" rather than strains. The narrator also says the strands of HIV ""completely shuts off your ability to make white blood cells, and if you Google what that disease is, it is HIV."" PolitiFact and other fact-checkers have reported that COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain HIV. The vaccines bolster the immune system rather than weakening it, as HIV does. The full lists of ingredients for all three vaccines approved for use in the U.S. — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — have been shared by manufacturers. The post’s reference to a ""second booster"" is also misleading. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are a two-shot primary series with a recommended third shot that is a booster. The vaccine ingredients do not change between doses, though the size of the dose can vary. Each shot in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series, including the booster, has the same ingredients, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and reporting by WCNC Charlotte.

Has Virginia's economic growth ""stalled at less than 1%,"" as Youngkin says?
","Gov. Glenn Youngkin says Virginia families, fighting to cope with inflation, don’t take solace in the state’s economic outlook. ""They see an economy whose growth has stalled at less than 1% per year for eight years,"" Youngkin, a Republican, said in his maiden address to the General Assembly on Jan. 17. We fact checked Youngkin’s claim about the state’s economic growth, which he made repeatedly during last year’s campaign, and found it credible, but a little low. Youngkin has pledged to charge Virginia’s growth by reducing regulations, cutting business taxes and expanding workforce training. Youngkin’s percentage for the state’s economic growth comes from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, according to Macaulay Porter, his press secretary. BEA statistics show the state’s gross domestic product - the total value of all finished goods and services produced in Virginia - grew from $458 billion at the start of 2014 to $596 billion at the end of September 2021 (the latest figure available). Over that period, Virginia’s economy averaged 3.3% growth each year, compounding to a total of 30.1%. A more meaningful figure, however, comes from measuring Virginia’s growth in inflation-adjusted dollars. Measured in 2012 dollars, Virginia’s GDP rose from $445 billion at the start of 2014 to $494 billion in September 2021. That’s an adjusted annual growth rate of about 1.3% - much closer to the ""less than 1% per year,"" Youngkin described. Virginia ranked 27th among states in inflation-adjusted growth, according to the BEA.  Virginia also ranked near the middle among neighboring states. Here are the numbers for average annual GDP growth in adjusted dollars from 2014 through September 2021: Tennessee, 2.1%; North Carolina, 1.9%; Virginia, 1.3%; Maryland, 1%; Kentucky, 0.9%; West Virginia, 0.6%. Nationally, GDP grew annually at an inflation-adjusted 2.0% rate, according to the BEA. The largest growth occurred in Western states. Virginia’s economy is closely linked to federal spending, with a huge government contracting industry in Northern Virginia and the world’s largest naval base in Norfolk. ""Seven out of $10 in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and Richmond have some tie to federal spending,"" said Robert McNab, director of the Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy at Old Dominion University. The plus side is that the federal largesse protects Virginia from extreme economic downturns. The downside is Virginia is beholden to Washington. Economists say the state was slammed in the past decade by a federal sequestration program that automatically cut defense and domestic spending when Congress could not agree on a budget. ""Virginia’s become a mature state with slow but steady growth,"" said Terry Rephann, regional economist with the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. Recent governors have set goals to diversify Virginia’s economy in efforts to lessen its dependence on Washington.  Youngkin has accused the two Democratic governors before him of creating an unfriendly business climate. Democrats point out that CNBC has named Virginia ""America’s Top State for Business"" for two straight years. Youngkin said Virginia’s economic growth ""has stalled at less than 1% per year for eight years."" He’s a little low. The state’s inflation-adjusted GDP has grown by about 1.3% over the last eight years.

No, COVID-19 vaccines aren’t responsible for an increase in deaths
","At the end of 2021, OneAmerica, an Indiana-based life insurance company, shared data about the ways the pandemic had impacted the life and disability insurance industry.  ""We are seeing right now the highest death rates we’ve ever seen in the history of this business — not just at OneAmerica, the data is consistent across every player in that business,"" said OneAmerica CEO Scott Davison in December. ""What we saw just in third quarter — and we’re seeing it continue into fourth quarter — is that death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic."" Davison didn’t provide much detail about the specific factors he believed caused the increase in deaths, but that didn’t stop vaccine skeptics on blogs, TV and social media from speculating. ""Life insurance companies suffered while the funeral industry prospered in 2021 after COVID vaccines were rolled out,"" read one Feb. 4 blog post’s headline.  Charlie Kirk, co-founder and president of Turning Point USA, suggested vaccines were the root cause when speaking to Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Feb. 7: ""Some would conjecture, ‘Hey, does this have something to do with the fact that we might have done a mass inoculation strategy?’"" One person on Facebook shared a screenshot from Carlson’s show about the OneAmerica numbers, writing in a Feb. 8 post, ""It’s not from C-[virus emoji]."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines were to blame for any surge in deaths in 2021. The suggestion that the COVID-19 vaccines might be to blame for the increase in deaths identified by OneAmerica was debunked by the Associated Press and others.  PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have repeatedly found that there is no basis for claims that COVID-19 vaccines have caused thousands of deaths. Research suggests that COVID-19 is responsible for the increase in deaths.  What’s driving up the death rate? During a December virtual conference, Davison said that a 10% increase in deaths would be considered a one in 200-year catastrophe, ""so 40% is just unheard of."" ""And what the data is showing to us is that the deaths that are being reported as COVID deaths greatly understate the actual death losses among working-age people from the pandemic,"" he said. ""It may not all be COVID on their death certificate, but deaths are up just huge, huge numbers."" Davison clarified that he wasn’t suggesting COVID-19 deaths were being undercounted, but rather noting that COVID-19 was contributing to other ""pandemic-related"" deaths. For example, someone who contracted the virus and recovered, but later died of complications from a subsequent illness that took a toll on the individual’s weakened immune system.  (Most experts do consider it more likely COVID-19 deaths are being undercounted than overcounted, however.) Catherine Theroux, a spokesperson for LIMRA, a group that has researched the pandemic’s impact on life insurance claims, said they have studied both deaths attributed to COVID-19 and excess deaths, and ""it is clear the uptick we have found can largely be attributed to the COVID deaths.""  Jeff Lancashire, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that, throughout the year, deaths were higher compared to the same periods before the pandemic. During the pandemic, Lancashire said the ""peak months for deaths"" were December 2020 through January 2021, and August 2021 through September 2021. The spike in COVID-19 deaths reported during those months was likely ""due to the emergence of new variants,"" he said. (The data — particularly the newest data — are ""provisional and subject to change,"" he said.)  Lancashire noted that because COVID-19 is a leading cause of death for Americans of all ages, the illness would be a factor in an increase in deaths. Davison of OneAmerica pulled his 40% increase from third-quarter data, which includes July through September and therefore aligns with the second spike in deaths the CDC identified.  Theroux said it is possible COVID-19 might have indirectly contributed to an increase in deaths: ""Some of the excess deaths we are seeing during the time of the pandemic may be caused by COVID indirectly, mostly because of delayed medical treatments and/or regular well-health screenings."" But she said that there is ""absolutely no evidence"" that COVID-19 vaccines are responsible for the increase in deaths. Posts suggested a 40% increase in deaths identified by a life insurance company was from COVID-19 vaccines, rather than from the virus.  Research indicates that COVID-19 is likely responsible for the increase, both directly and indirectly. There is no evidence to suggest the vaccines are to blame.

Florida produces more solar power than most states, though it lags smaller ones on rooftop panels
","U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, a Democratic candidate for Florida governor, criticized a bill moving through the state legislature that opponents say will restrict the growth of rooftop solar adoption. The legislation, SB 1024, intends to revise Florida’s net-metering policy, which allows customers to get reimbursed for the excess electricity their solar equipment feeds back to the power grid. If the bill becomes law, customers who own or lease solar equipment could see about a 75% decrease in their reimbursed rate, according to CNN.  Crist, who was governor from 2007 to 2010, said that smaller states are doing a much better job on solar production than the Sunshine State. ""New Jersey and Maryland produce more solar power than Florida, the Sunshine State,"" Crist tweeted Feb. 3. ""A bill that strips solar panel incentives is bad for homeowners, jobs and our environment.""  New Jersey and Maryland produce more solar power than Florida, the Sunshine State! A bill that strips solar panel incentives is bad for homeowners, jobs and our environment.I'll be a governor that promotes the use of solar energy, not one who cozies up to the Big Utilities. In 2013, Crist said Florida ""was hardly doing any solar energy production,"" which PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. We wanted to check in on the numbers and find out whether Florida really lagged behind New Jersey and Maryland’s solar production. One way to gauge the accuracy of Crist’s claim is to measure each state’s installed solar capacity — the electricity-generating potential of installed solar equipment. In 2012, the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, ranked New Jersey and Maryland the third- and eighth-best states, respectively, for installed solar capacity.  It might surprise people that smaller states out-produced the Sunshine State, but it was true back then: Florida did not crack SEIA’s top 10, ranking 17th. That said, the situation has changed. As of 2021, Florida ranked third in the U.S. for installed solar capacity, with 7,765.1 megawatts. California was first with 32,209 megawatts, and Texas came in second with 12,309 megawatts. (One megawatt is equivalent to 1 million watts.) New Jersey and Maryland fell down the rankings in 2021. New Jersey ranked seventh with 3,826 megawatts of installed solar capacity, and Maryland was 17th with 1,396.5 megawatts. The results were similar when comparing the latest figures for each state’s solar generation — the actual amount of electricity produced.  Florida produced more than 7,500 megawatt-hours in 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated. (One megawatt-hour is equivalent to 1,000 kilowatts of electricity generated per hour.) New Jersey produced almost as half as much solar power as Florida, and Maryland produced one-fifth.  ""It's possible that former Gov. Crist is speaking to something that is outdated,"" said Susan Glickman, director of Florida Clinicians for Climate Action, a coalition of health professionals concerned about climate change. The bulk of Florida’s growth in solar output comes from utility companies and not from residents installing rooftop panels. The percentage of solar generation coming from small-scale facilities, including homes and businesses, in New Jersey and Maryland is much higher — about 65% for each.  About 15% of Florida’s solar generation comes from small-scale facilities, per the EIA. Though Florida has enough solar installed to power more than 1 million homes, only about 90,000 households in the state are solar-powered, according to the state Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities.  Florida ranked 21st in the nation for residential solar systems per capita, according to an industry analysis conducted by the SEIA. New Jersey ranked 10th and Maryland was 13th. (The analysis is not available publicly, but SEIA confirmed the rankings with PolitiFact.) This difference is largely due to Florida’s solar policy.  The state does not allow power purchase agreements, which arrange for a developer to install a solar energy system on a customer’s property and sell the power generated to the customer at a fixed rate often lower than the retail rate. The SEIA estimates that 83% of New Jersey’s residential solar systems are a result of power purchase agreements and similar third-party solar financing. Florida also has no renewable portfolio standard policy — which would require utilities to fulfill a certain percentage of a state’s energy needs through renewables such as solar.  When we asked Crist’s campaign about the tweet, a spokesperson said that Crist was referring to the percentage of electricity that New Jersey and Maryland derive from solar.  While Florida has more installed solar capacity and generation, only 4.04% of the state’s electricity comes from solar generation.  This difference is more pronounced in New Jersey, where more than 7% of its electricity comes from solar. In Maryland, however, the difference with Florida is razor-thin, with 4.43% of the state’s electricity coming from solar.   Florida, which is the second-largest producer of electricity in the country, gets three-fourths of its in-state net generation from natural gas, according to the EIA.  Still, there’s little question that Florida produces much more solar generation than either New Jersey or Maryland.  ""Florida has more annual solar generation, period, than Maryland and New Jersey,""  Justin Vandenbroeck, president of the Florida Board of the Solar Energy Industries Association, told PolitiFact.  Crist said New Jersey and Maryland ""produce more solar power than Florida."" The raw numbers don’t back him up. Florida generated much more solar electricity than New Jersey and Maryland in 2020 and currently ranks third in the U.S. in total solar power generating capacity. Where Crist has more of a point is that the smaller states get a larger share of solar energy from small-scale facilities, such as homes and businesses. And despite its sunnier skies, Florida’s overall share of solar is lower than New Jersey and Maryland (but barely).  Crist’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B28540>],/factchecks/2022/feb/11/charlie-crist/florida-produces-more-solar-power-most-states-thou/

No evidence for Senate hopeful McCormick’s claim that China created COVID-19
","Battling in a crowded GOP primary campaign for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, businessman and Army veteran  Dave McCormick singled out rival Dr. Mehmet Oz before making an unsubstantiated claim about the origins of COVID-19. ""When Mehmet Oz questions my patriotism, he's crossed the line,"" McCormick said in a TV ad, referring to the physician and talk show host. ""I joined the 82nd Airborne to fight communism. In combat, we faced down Chinese weapons. And like Trump, no one fought China harder for tough trade deals."" Then McCormick pivoted to the pandemic.  ""I approved this message because I'll fight for what Washington won't. We all know China created COVID. It's time to make them pay for it."" A message on the screen underscored McCormick's notion that China was at fault: ""Make China pay trillions for COVID.""  The scientific consensus is that the virus originated in Wuhan, China, but there is no clear evidence that China created it, on purpose or by accident. Alina Chan, a microbiologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and co-author of ""VIRAL: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19,"" said COVID-19 ""may have a natural or lab origin, but no direct evidence has been found for either hypothesis.""  ""If COVID was the result of manipulation in a laboratory, it is also important to make clear that similar research is conducted worldwide, even in the U.S., and the SARS-like virus researchers in Wuhan had received funding from the U.S. and Europe,"" she said. SARS-CoV-2 was first noticed in Wuhan, close to a lab where bat coronaviruses were being studied.  Less than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, in late-summer 2020, the consensus among researchers was that the coronavirus had originated in bats before jumping to humans — though it was possible that Chinese researchers were studying the virus in a lab when it managed to spread outside the lab. By the spring of 2021, that view softened. Scientists who studied the coronavirus generally concluded that it resembled naturally occurring viruses, but were paying more attention to the possibility that the virus somehow leaked from the lab. There was nothing conclusive, however. Then in the fall, more evidence emerged indicating that the first outbreak occurred outside of a lab. University of Arizona evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey reported that the first known person sickened by the coronavirus was a vendor in a Wuhan animal market. To back up McCormick’s claim, his campaign cited an August 2021 memo from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence that summarized the views of U.S. intelligence agencies on the origin of COVID-19.  The memo laid out the prevailing hypotheses, but did not make any finding that China created the virus. The memo said the intelligence community agreed that ""two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident.""  It added: ""We judge the virus was not developed as a biological weapon. Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way. Finally, the IC assesses China’s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of COVID-19 emerged."" One agency ""assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" the memo said. McCormick’s campaign also cited a May 2021 Wall Street Journal article on a U.S. intelligence report that said three researchers from the institute became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care. The article pointed out that that is when experts believe the virus began circulating around Wuhan. But that still provided no conclusion on how the coronavirus originated. In short, there is no evidence to back McCormick’s claim. ""There's absolutely no data to suggest China created COVID,"" said Kristian Andersen, a Scripps Research Institute professor of immunology and microbiology. ""The evidence for natural emergence has only gotten stronger."" Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, said it is unknown whether the virus entered humans ""through a natural accident or through a laboratory accident. If SARS-CoV-2 entered humans through a laboratory accident, the accident may have involved a natural virus or may have involved a laboratory-modified virus.""  Joel Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, San Diego, said scientists have found numerous bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in southern China and Laos. ""The genetic similarity of these viruses points to a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 in this region,"" he said.  ""There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab. SARS-CoV-2 looks like other naturally circulating coronaviruses."" Lawmakers are seeking answers about the origin. Several days before McCormick’s ad began running, news reports said bipartisan draft legislation was being circulated in the Senate that would create a commission to examine the origins of the pandemic and the U.S. response. The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and who decided not to seek re-election. The primaries are May 17. McCormick is the former chief executive of the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund and held positions in President George W. Bush’s administration. The same day McCormick began running his ad, Oz ran an ad attacking McCormick as ""China’s friend, not ours."" Other GOP candidates include conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos and Carla Sands, former President Donald Trump's ambassador to Denmark. The Democratic candidates include U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. The race is rated a tossup and competitive. The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. China is a recurring theme in ads for Senate contests. A super PAC supporting Republican Josh Mandel for an open seat in Ohio claimed that Republican Jane Timken’s family business moved jobs to China. In a race for an open seat in Missouri, a super PAC backing Republican Eric Greitens attacked Republican Eric Schmitt over Missouri legislation Schmitt supported that helped China, in a claim we rated Half True. Meanwhile, Alex Lasry, one of the Democrats challenging GOP incumbent Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, pledged to ""finally stand up to China."" McCormick claimed: ""We all know China created COVID."" There is no clear evidence that China ""created"" the virus. Scientists have not reached a consensus on how the virus originated. Researchers believe it could have originated naturally or from an accident in a lab. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A495F40>],/factchecks/2022/feb/11/dave-mccormick/response-dr-oz-no-evidence-senate-hopeful-mccormic/

GOP lawmaker’s proposal to decertify Arizona election won’t change anything about 2020
","Former President Donald Trump and his allies have cheered a resolution by a Republican Arizona state lawmaker to decertify the 2020 election won by Joe Biden — a proposal that has no legal merit and isn’t going anywhere. ""Arizona House bill would decertify three counties in Arizona,"" said a Feb. 8 Facebook post by David J. Harris, a conservative commentator. The post links to an article on his website that says that if the resolution passes, ""it could effectively recall the Biden electors.""  He’s wrong. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The resolution he’s talking about was authored by State Rep. Mark Finchem. Trump, who has endorsed Finchem as a candidate for Arizona secretary of state, declared the resolution ""big news in Arizona!"" But it’s just wishful thinking by people who see political gain in rehashing the falsehood that Biden’s victory was the result of voter fraud. People should ignore claims from anyone about the prospect of undoing the 2020 results, says Chris Krebs, the former federal cybersecurity official who declared the 2020 presidential election ""the most secure in American history"" before being fired by Trump. ""There is no mechanism for such a thing under the law,"" Krebs tweeted in September. ""Here’s the thing: you’re the mark. They want your money, they want your rage, they want you turning out, protesting, & threatening officials. You’re a pawn. Nothing more."" Finchem’s resolution recycles claims about voter fraud that have been debunked by fact-checkers and elections officials. And it revives allegations of fraud and probable cause of criminal wrongdoing that investigations have dismissed. The resolution calls for setting aside the results in Pima, Maricopa and Yuma counties because Finchem said he believes the election there was ""irredeemably flawed,"" which prevented ""the declaration of a clear winner."" Biden won Pima and Maricopa while Trump won Yuma. Finchem acknowledged in a press release about his resolution that there is no process under current law to decertify the election. But he said that doesn’t mean the Legislature can’t ""provide a remedy for outcome-determinative fraud and illegality in the conduct of the election."" Rick Hasen, an election law professor at University of California, Irvine, called Finchem’s argument ""nonsense."" ""This argument is not legally sound,"" Hasen said. ""The Arizona legislature had the right under Article 2 of the Constitution to set the manner for choosing presidential electors. It gave that right to Arizona’s voters, with no power to ‘decertify’ the results afterwards — whatever that means."" After counties canvassed the results weeks after Election Day, Arizona state officials certified the results on Nov. 30, 2020, showing that Joe Biden won Arizona by about 10,500 votes. The electors cast their ballots for Biden on Dec. 14, 2020, and Congress accepted the results Jan. 6, 2021. The Legislature can’t disregard the results of the votes cast by electors, said Paul Bender, an Arizona State University law professor. ""I would not take Finchem's assertions seriously,"" he said. Arizona state House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican, called the bill ""obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise"" – a sign that it won’t go anywhere. An article shared on Facebook says an Arizona House resolution proposing to ""decertify"" the 2020 results in three counties ""could effectively recall the Biden electors."" The post refers to a resolution by Finchem, a state legislator who has called for decertifying the results of the 2020 presidential election in Pima, Maricopa and Yuma counties.  The resolution won’t change anything about the 2020 election. Arizona certified the results in November 2020, the electors cast their ballots in December and those results were accepted by Congress in January 2021.  The Constitution lays out the process for certifying the election, and that process is over.

A Facebook post cries foul at Washington Post headline, but COVID-19 data supports the journalism
","The omicron variant of COVID-19 has proved to be less severe than previous strains of the virus, but deaths in the U.S. have remained high due to its higher transmissibility, health experts have said. A recent article in the Washington Post noted the high death toll in recent months and noted that omicron had been particularly harder on the elderly and unvaccinated Americans.  A social media post used the headline from that story alongside an image of a graphic embedded in the story to misleadingly suggest the Post article was misinforming readers. ""Here is an article caption by the Washington Post,"" the Feb. 8 Facebook post read. ""Look at the second image for a statistical reference. That was provided within this article. You tell us if this headline is misleading or misinformation."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because the headline is right — and the graphic is right. And they are not contradictory, as the Facebook post suggests. ""Deaths highest in a year as omicron hits unvaccinated, elderly"" reads the headline in one image. Next to it, a screengrab shows a graphic from that story illustrating deaths by age groups since the start of the pandemic. It’s not clear if the author of the post takes issue with the death totals rising or the fact that the headline mentions the toll on the unvaccinated. But the claim is incorrect on either count. If you navigate to the original Post story, which is not linked in the Facebook post, you will find the first paragraph reads: ""Though considered milder than other coronavirus variants, omicron has infected so many people that it has driven the number of daily deaths beyond where it was last spring, before vaccines were widely available, according to Washington Post data."" Indeed, the Post’s data tracker, which is linked to in the story and draws from Johns Hopkins University figures, shows that COVID-19 deaths for all ages are higher than at any time since the previous spring, including during the delta surge in September. The CDC’s numbers, which are based on deaths reported by states and territories, differ slightly from the Post’s, but show a similar trend. The story goes on to say that, according to health officials, omicron has been especially deadly for Americans over age 75, the unvaccinated and medically vulnerable people, citing doctors and health officials The graphic shows the percentage of total deaths by age group over time since April 2020 through January 2022, based on CDC data. It reveals that people over age 75 made up about half of the COVID-19 deaths in January. The Post article cites doctors and public health officials when discussing deaths among unvaccinated Americans during the recent omicron surge, which began shortly after Thanksgiving. The City of Chicago, for example, ""reported an age-adjusted death rate peaking at 14 per 100,000 for the unvaccinated around Jan. 22 compared to about 1 per 100,000 for the boosted,"" the Post article said. The  most recent CDC data on deaths by vaccination status from Sept. 19 through Dec. 4, 2021, shows unvaccinated Americans dying at a rate of 9.74 per 100,000 cases, compared with 0.10 per 100,000 for fully vaccinated people.  A Facebook post accused the Washington Post of misleading readers with a headline showing that the omicron variant of COVID-19 has pushed deaths in the U.S. to their highest numbers in a year and that the elderly and unvaccinated have been hit hardest. It juxtaposed the headline with a graphic from the article that showed the percentage of deaths by age group, indicating that the omicron variant has hit people over 75 particularly hard in recent months.  Data from Johns Hopkins University — which the Post used — as well as CDC totals show that deaths had risen recently to their highest numbers since last spring. While data on deaths by vaccination status aren’t yet available after Dec. 4, the Post spoke with doctors and public health officials who noted a higher death rate among unvaccinated Americans.  The Post’s article was neither misleading or misinformation, but this Facebook post was.

No, the COVID-19 vaccine is not increasing child mortality in England
","A United Kingdom-based blog has taken COVID-19 data out of context to claim that the vaccine is causing an uptick in deaths among children. The headline of a Jan. 29 blog post by The Daily Exposé claims: ""Official data shows children are up to 52 times more likely to die following COVID-19 vaccination than unvaccinated children & the (Office of National Statistics) is trying to hide it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The ONS, which reports directly to the U.K. Parliament, collects, analyzes and disseminates statistics about the U.K.'s economy, society and population. There is no evidence in the ONS data to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are linked to children’s deaths, agency spokesperson Glenn Garrett told PolitiFact. The ONS reported that as of Feb. 3 there had been 15 deaths in England where a COVID-19 vaccine was mentioned on a death certificate. In 10 of these cases, the vaccine was the underlying cause. None of the people who died were under the age of 35. The ONS data for England covers Jan. 1 to Oct. 31, 2021 and shows: Total deaths related to COVID-19, by vaccination status, for people ages 10 to 19 Total deaths unrelated to COVID-19, by vaccination status, for people ages 10 to 19 Of the 81 vaccinated children who died during this time, one had COVID-19. And of the 256 unvaccinated children who died, 20 had COVID-19. The dataset does not list the cause for non-COVID-19 deaths. The sample size of vaccinated children is much smaller than that of unvaccinated children because for most of 2021 in England, the COVID-19 vaccine was available only to children who had health conditions that could make them more vulnerable to a serious case of the disease. The vaccine became widely available to all children 12 to 17 years old in August 2021. Children under 12 became eligible for the vaccine in December 2021. The Daily Exposé attempted to do its own mortality rate calculations and claimed children are up to 52 times more likely to die following COVID-19 vaccination than unvaccinated children. However, this is misleading. The blog’s calculations found deceptively high mortality rates for vaccinated children because of the over-representation of children with medical conditions. The ONS calculates the age-standardized mortality rates for adults in England. But the ONS did not do that for children because of the disparities in sample sizes of vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and due to how children who had other health issues that made them at higher risk for severe illness were prioritized for the vaccine. Due to these factors, any mortality rate comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated children would not be meaningful, Garrett said. Other factors can also influence mortality rates, regardless of vaccination status, including individual health conditions, changes in COVID-19 infection levels, the emergence of new dominant variants and differing levels of immunity from prior infection. A blog post said that in England, ""official data shows children are up to 52 times more likely to die following COVID-19 vaccination than unvaccinated children."" There is no evidence that links the COVID-19 vaccine to an increase in deaths among children in England. We rate this claim False.

Pritzker’s Mostly Correct About Illinois’ Vaccination Claims
","As Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week delivered his annual State of the State address in Springfield, he highlighted the challenges COVID-19 presented, but bolstered his administration’s response to the pandemic by claiming Illinois leads the way in vaccination rates compared to the rest of the Midwest. ""One thing we can all do right now is continue rising to the challenge of combating the pandemic head on. And we are,"" he said. ""A larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state."" The statement reminded us of one Pritzker made last year when he said Illinois was the ""vaccine leader among the 10 most populous states in the country."" We rated that claim Half True.  So we thought we’d see exactly what the governor meant when he made this most recent claim.  Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh referred us to the Centers for Disease Control’s vaccination data tracker. She first pointed out that Illinois has vaccinated more people than its neighboring states: Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Michigan. But the Midwest is bigger than just those states contiguous to Illinois. It also includes Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Ohio, according to the  U.S. Census Bureau, which doesn’t include Kentucky as a Midwest state. When asked for clarification, Abudayyeh said Illinois is ahead of neighboring states and the entire Midwest in terms of vaccinated residents and drew a distinction between total residents who had received at least one vaccination shot versus those who are fully vaccinated with two shots or even those who have gotten an additional ""booster"" shot. ""The Governor never said among fully vaccinated,"" Abudayyeh said in an email. ""He said we are leading the Midwest in vaccinations, which is true. More Illinoisans have received a vaccination than anywhere else in the Midwest."" As we were checking Pritzker’s claim from Feb. 2, the governor echoed the sentiment during a press conference when he announced plans to end the indoor mask mandate by the end of February. ""More Illinoisans have gotten a COVID-19 shot than anywhere else in the Midwest,"" Pritzker said on Feb. 9.  After the press conference, Abudayyeh clarified in an email to the BGA that by saying the state is leading in vaccinations, the governor is referring specifically to the percentage of the population that has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.  So we checked the stats with an eye toward comparing Illinois’ vaccination rates to those in all 12 Midwestern states.  The CDC Data Tracker separates data into three categories: people who are fully vaccinated, people who have received at least one dose and people who have received a booster shot. According to the CDC data, Illinois does have the highest Midwest percentage of people  who have received at least one shot. On Feb. 2, 75.6% of Illinoisans reported having at least one dose. The nearest Midwestern states are  South Dakota with 74% and Minnesota at 73.6%. But in his Feb. 2 claim, Pritzker did not specify whether he counted only those with one dose, so we checked the data on those who have been fully vaccinated, and here is where his claim falls a bit short. According to the CDC Data Tracker, one Midwestern state has had a consistently higher rate of people fully vaccinated: Minnesota.  On Feb. 2, 67.1% of residents in that state were fully vaccinated, compared to 66.4% in Illinois.  Pritzker said that ""a larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state."" There are many ways to measure vaccination rates — by single doses, people who have been fully vaccinated and those administered booster shots.   While his spokeswoman later clarified he meant the percentage of Illinoisans who had received a single dose of a COVID-19 shot, Pritzker’s initial statement could be interpreted as Illinois being the Midwest leader in those who are fully vaccinated. It is not. We rate this claim Mostly True.  MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974B5FC0>],/factchecks/2022/feb/11/jb-pritzker/does-illinois-have-larger-percentage-vaccinations-/

Wisconsin GOP gubernatorial candidate Kevin Nicholson jumps gun on calling ballot drop boxes illegal
","The coronavirus pandemic has changed many aspects of American life, including how votes are cast. As more people are voting by absentee ballot, more are also using ballot drop boxes. More than 500 drop boxes were available during the 2020 presidential election, according to a database compiled by the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism.  Like so many other election-related issues, there is litigation surrounding drop boxes, so a Jan. 28, 2022 tweet from Kevin Nicholson – a Republican candidate for governor – caught our attention. ""The use of ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting is illegal, and all of these questions should have been settled years ago. Absurd we're at this point."" But, as we noted, the issue is currently tied up in court – and the mere fact there is a legal challenge to the practice suggests it is not as cut-and-dried as Nicholson presented. So, is he right about the use of drop boxes and ""ballot harvesting"" being illegal? When asked to provide backup for the claim, Nicholson’s staff pointed us to a more recent tweet, from Feb. 2, 2022.  In it, Nicholson restates his illegality claim, cites a portion of the law related to the ""ballot harvesting"" issue, and links to an article by WISN radio talk show host Dan O’Donnell posted on the website of the MacIver Institute, a Madison, Wis.,-based conservative think tank. Drop boxes and what has been termed ""ballot harvesting"" are different things, but have become tangled together in the debate.  Opponents of drop boxes argue that under State Statute 6.87, there are only two ways to return an absentee ballot – through the mail, or by hand-delivering it to the clerk. In short, the argument goes, because drop boxes are not the mail and not a clerk, they are not permitted. Drop box supporters argue that using drop boxes is simply a form of returning ballots in person.  Meanwhile, opponents also cite State Statute 12.13, which, among other things, makes it a crime punishable by six months in jail to ""receive a ballot from or give a ballot to a person other than the election official in charge.""  But that provision applies more to cases when a voter’s ballot is returned by someone else. This is known as ballot collection or, pejoratively, ""ballot harvesting.""  As previously reported by PolitiFact Wisconsin, the practice involves a third-party returning an absentee ballot after the voter fills it out, signs it and performs any other required action. The practice is explicitly allowed in 31 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  ""Many of these states limit this provision to a family member, household member or caregiver,"" the NCSL noted. ""Sixteen states allow a voter to designate someone — not necessarily a family member, household member or caregiver — to return their ballot for them."" In some cases, there are other rules, such as how many ballots an authorized person can return, or how quickly they must be returned.  Such restrictions are aimed at combating fraud, such as in a North Carolina case in which, as reported July 19, 2019 by The New York Times, political operative L. McCrae Dowless Jr. was accused of obstruction of justice and illegal possession of an absentee ballot, among other charges. North Carolina prosecutions at the time alleged that Dowless directed others in the criminal mishandling of absentee ballots and that ""spoiled absentee ballots were counted.""  At the time, Dowless was working during the 2018 campaign for Mark Harris, the Republican nominee in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District. Harris eventually dropped his bid for office and a new vote was ordered.  University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor of Political Science Barry C. Burden said Nicholson’s illegality claim is premature, and noted that municipalities – and voters – using the drop boxes were following the guidance they were given. ""In 2020, the Wisconsin Elections Commission provided guidance to clerks stating that both drop boxes and delivery of ballots by other individuals were permitted,"" Burden wrote in an email. ""The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case out of Waukesha County district court that will in part address the legality of drop boxes and delivery of ballots on behalf of voters. These issues remain unsettled."" Burden, who is director of the UW Madison Elections Research Center, cited a March 31, 2020, guidance memo from the commission to local election officials from Megan Wolfe, administrator of  the commission. Minutes from a commission meeting a year earlier, on March 11, 2019, show that Wolfe told the body that Wisconsin statutes do not directly address ballot collection. At that meeting, she cited the North Carolina case before noting: ""Commission staff is not aware of efforts of any political campaign or other organization systematically contacting absentee voters to collect marked ballots and offering to return them to the clerk.""  Meanwhile, Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said she thinks Nicholson is taking the statute out of context. The same statute cited by Nicholson includes language stating that no one may ""willfully or negligently fail to deliver, after having undertaken to do so, official ballots prepared for an election to the proper person, or prevent their delivery within the required time, or destroy or conceal the ballots."" Said Woodall-Vogg: ""I think 12.13(3)(c) implies that it is fine for someone to deliver absentee ballots on behalf of someone else and would be a felony to undertake delivery and then not deliver.""  All of that, of course, will be hammered out in the court case. So far, rulings have offered a mixed message. On Jan. 13, 2022, a Waukesha County judge ruled that absentee ballot drop boxes can't be used in Wisconsin. Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Michael Bohren determined state law allows absentee ballots to be returned in person or by mail — but not in a ballot drop box. On Jan. 24, 2022, the District 4 state Court of Appeals blocked the lower-court order and ruled absentee ballot drop boxes can be used in the Feb. 15, 2022 primary. The court issued its order a day before election clerks were scheduled to send voters absentee ballots in the race for Milwaukee mayor and other local contests. On Jan. 28, 2022, the state Supreme Court agreed to take the case over absentee ballot drop boxes, but left in place the ruling that says they can be used for the Feb. 15 primary.   On Feb. 11, 2022, the state Supreme Court ruled that it would allow a lower court decision to go into effect that will ban the use of ballot drop boxes for the April election. However, drop boxes can still be used for this week’s primaries, and it's possible the high court will change course and allow them for future elections. The Nicholson tweet came on Jan. 28, the same day as the Supreme Court agreed to take the case, which leads us to an important final point. The fact the case is before the state Supreme Court shows it is an unsettled matter – far from the definitive claim from the candidate. What’s more, there is nothing illegal about using the drop boxes in the upcoming primary. It is clearly allowed by the court’s order. Nicholson claimed  ""The use of ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting is illegal.""  The statement came on the same day the state Supreme Court agreed to take up a lawsuit that addresses these very same questions. That alone underlines the fact that the matter is unsettled and Nicholson’s declaration is – at best – premature. The fact the court specifically allowed the use of the drop boxes in the Feb. 15 primary is significant, in that – contrary to the impression left by Nicholson’s claim – voters using the drop boxes, and municipalities putting them in place, are not doing anything the courts have deemed impermissible. That said, there is an element of truth in that at least one lower court reached his conclusion, even if subsequent rulings have muddied the matter and left the question unsettled – both at the time Nichoson made his claim, and as we publish this item. We rate the claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280968B2280>],/factchecks/2022/feb/11/kevin-nicholson/wisconsin-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-kevin-nichol/

Scott Walker says Americans will spend more on taxes than on food, housing and clothing combined
","On April 14, 2015, Scott Walker asked followers of his personal Twitter account if they’ve been taxed enough already. ""Did you know, Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined?"" Walker’s campaign team tweeted. (We know Walker didn’t personally pen it because it’s signed ""TW,"" for Team Walker). The tweet highlighted a chart showing Americans collectively paid $4.8 trillion in taxes in 2014, more than the total of the three life essentials. It’s a claim PolitiFact National checked in 2014 and 2011 after identical statements by the Tax Foundation and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, respectively. Both those were rated Half True. Let’s see what the latest figures show. Digging into the numbers Walker’s campaign told us he relied on the Tax Foundation’s annual ""tax freedom"" day report. Among other things, that report examines taxing and spending figures based on U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Both the Tax Foundation and Walker make clear they are using collective taxing and spending figures -- by using a chart, in Walker’s case, and words and charts in the Tax Foundation’s case. One cautionary note: Full data is not yet available for 2015, since we are not even at the midpoint of the year. The Tax Foundation based its claim about 2015 on 2014 figures that it adjusts for economic growth predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the group. We checked the BEA’s data for 2014, the latest available, and found a significant edge for total taxes paid over the aggregate amount spend on food, housing and clothing. Total spending on groceries, restaurant meals, clothing, footwear, housing and utilities came to $4.2 trillion. Meanwhile, taxes -- local, state and federal -- rang up to $4.9 trillion. For perspective, total personal consumer expenditures, which includes additional things like vehicles, recreation and health care, were $11.9 trillion in 2014. In recent years, the federal figures show, taxes have consistently topped food, shelter and clothing. Another perspective But PolitiFact National’s earlier work points out there is another way to look at the comparison: by examining what individual Americans pay. That’s a complex task, but one way to do it is to examine what people at different income levels spend and pay in taxes as a share of their total income. Through that lens, many poorer Americans likely pay a higher share of their income on food, shelter and clothing, in part because they pay little in taxes. Conversely, richer Americans may well pay a higher fraction of their income in taxes and a smaller share for those essentials. So by this other method, for many people, Walker’s claim does not hold up. The 2014 item concluded that a majority of Americans probably pay more for the three essentials than for taxes. Our rating Walker claimed, based on what happened in 2014, that Americans in 2015 collectively will spend more on taxes than they do on food, housing and clothing combined. The statement is partially accurate -- on target based on past experience by the method Walker uses, but inaccurate by another method that examines the claim in a fuller context. That’s a Half True on our meter.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966ECA40>],/factchecks/2015/apr/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-americans-will-spend-more-taxes-/

Joe Morrissey says Rosalyn Dance opposed medicaid expansion
","Former Del. Joe Morrissey is raising Virginia’s refusal to expand Medicaid as a key issue in his bid to unseat state Sen. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg. At the announcement of his candidacy last month, Morrissey distributed a flier that accused Dance of apostasy in representing her heavily Democratic district. At the top of Morrissey's complaint list was this: ""Rosalyn Dance voted against President Obama’s Medicaid expansion."" We wondered whether Morrissey was right. When he made the claim, Morrissey was planning to oppose Dance in a June 9 primary. But the district’s Democratic committee blocked him from the primary ballot, ruling that he had not gathered enough valid signatures on petitions to qualify. Morrissey, who lost a legal bid to get on the ballot, now plans to run as an independent. Dance still faces competition in the primary from state Del. Joseph Preston, D-Petersburg. She won the Senate seat in a November special election after serving nine years a state delegate. Medicaid expansion has cleaved a deep partisan rift into Virginia in recent years. Under Obamacare, the state could opt to expand eligibility for its program to about 400,000 additional low-income and disabled citizens. Uncle Sam would pay all of the expansion costs through 2016 and phase down to 90 percent after that. Democrats have strongly backed expansion and Republicans have vehemently resisted, saying Medicaid is already inefficient and predicting that the debt-burdened federal government will renege on its promised payments. The GOP has prevailed because it has controlled either both legislative chambers in recent years or the House of Delegates and the governorship. Morrissey, in his campaign flier, sought to back up his claim that Dance opposed Medicaid expansion by citing votes she cast in favor of entire state budget bills in 2013, 2014 and this year that did not include the enlargement. Let’s look at Dance’s votes in each of those years. 2013 Morrissey points to Dance’s vote on Feb. 7, 2013, backing a House budget bill that  that made any expansion contingent on first reforming the state Medicaid program to weed out inefficiency. Twenty-two House Democrats voted against the proposed budget; Dance was among nine who supported it. Passing a budget is a complicated process, however. The bill -- hundreds of pages long and containing funding for all state programs -- takes different shapes and requires a number of votes as it moves through the House and Senate. When the final version of the measure passed the House all Democrats, Morrissey included, voted for it even though it didn’t expand Medicaid. Ed Reed, a spokesman for Dance’s campaign, emailed us a statement that said she voted for the 2013 budget thinking, as many Democrats did, that it put the state on a path to Medicaid expansion, because it included a provision that said expansion could take effect after a state panel signed off on reforms. 2014 There was a long battle over Medicaid expansion last year, and there’s a lot that Morrissey is leaving out. The bottom line is that in the regular session Dance voted for an initial version of the 2014-2016 budget that did not include Medicaid expansion. But she did so only after backing a failed amendment that called for the state to enact Marketplace Virginia, an alternative to traditional Medicaid expansion where low income residents would still get coverage through a private insurance network. But most importantly, Dance sponsored a McAuliffe budget alternative that called for expanding Medicaid under a two-year pilot program. She told the House in a March 25, 2014, floor speech that under the measure ""400,000 Virginians could benefit from Medicaid expansion. By taking no action at all, we are doing a huge disservice to our citizens, some of the most vulnerable."" Dance’s bill was defeated and she voted against the final version of the budget, which did not include Medicaid expansion. Dance also backed an unsuccessful bill by Del. Tom Rust, R-Fairfax, that would have provided another alternative to traditional Medicaid expansion that would use federal funds from Obamacare to extend coverage to the uninsured. 2015 Morrissey points to Dance’s Feb. 26 vote for an updated 2014-2016 budget without Medicaid expansion. It’s true Dance backed a budget without Medicaid expansion. But before that final vote, Dance opposed a successful Republican amendment that blocked Medicaid expansion from the budget. The day Morrissey made his charge, Dance’s campaign fired an email to reporters saying she wanted the spending plan to expand Medicaid. Even though that didn’t happen, she said she still voted for the budget because contained ""well-deserved and needed pay raises for teachers and other state workers.""   ""Budgets are overall documents that fund the government and ensure that other priorities are funded,"" Dance’s statement said. ""Voting against a budget simply because it leaves out one priority (however significant that priority may be) also puts at risk all of those other priorities."" We should note that the final budget bill passed the Senate by a 38-1 vote and sailed through the House, 95-5. Morrissey was among the handful of delegates who opposed it. Our ruling Morrissey says Dance ""voted against President Obama’s Medicaid expansion."" Dance, as Morrissey points out, has voted for state budgets that didn’t expand Medicaid. But that doesn’t mean she was voting against the Medicaid growth specifically.  Budgets are huge documents that fund more than $44 billion in state programs a year and go through many  votes. Sometimes Dance shunned protest votes against the budgets that did not expand Medicaid because, she says, she supported many other priorities in the spending plan. In 2014, however, she joined all fellow Democrats in voting against the a final budget. It’s important to note that Dance always voted in favor of expanding Medicaid when faced with specific floor votes on the issue. So Morrissey’s statement is highly misleading and we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A411C00>],/factchecks/2015/apr/23/joe-morrissey/joe-morrissey-says-rosalyn-dance-opposed-medicaid-/

Group: Black Texans have higher unemployment rate than whites and earn less than they did in 2000
","Urging the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to choose a president who prioritizes jobs and rising wages ""for all communities,"" a Texas group said African Americans in the state have fared poorly on both fronts. The Texas Organizing Project, which says it promotes social and economic equality for low- to moderate-income residents, joined labor unions in calling on the Fed, which has kept interest rates near zero since 2008 to spur business lending, not to raise interest rates and focus instead on full employment and higher wages, according to a March 4, 2015, news story in the Dallas Morning News. The project got our attention in a March 2015 press release with this: ""Although the economy is adding jobs, the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000."" We sought elaboration. Report offered as backup To our inquiry, a project spokesman, Daniel Barrera, pointed us by email to a March 2015 report by the Brooklyn-based Center for Popular Democracy, which says it promotes ""equity, opportunity and a dynamic democracy."" The report, ""Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate,"" presents charts with the cited figures, which the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute based on federal wage and employment data. One chart says the 2014 Texas black unemployment rate, 9.5 percent, was more than twice the state’s white unemployment rate of 3.7 percent; the 2014 Hispanic jobless rate was 5.3 percent. Conditions may have been better in Texas than elsewhere over those years. Nationally, according to the report, black-white unemployment disparities were greatest in Wisconsin (the black jobless rate was 4.6 times the white rate), and Minnesota (the black rate was 3.7 times the white rate). Another chart in the report indicates median hourly wages of Texas whites and Hispanics increased 8 and 2.9 percent, respectively, from 2000 to 2014 while median hourly wages of black Texans decreased 0.8 percent. We wondered if blacks saw falling wages by this measure all through those years. They did not: To our inquiry, the Economic Policy Institute provided year-by-year data showing the hourly median for black Texans decreased in six years while going up in eight years. Through the period, the real median wage for Texas African Americans bottomed out at $13.61 in 2008. It crested at $15.18 in 2012. Nationally at the end of the 15-year period, median real wages of African-American workers were down even more than in Texas alone, according to the report. That is, the national median real hourly wage for African Americans in 2014 was $13.97, about 3 percent less than the comparable median of $14.41 in 2000. Also, according to the report, other states had bigger differences between the first and last years studied.  Source: Report, ""Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate,""  Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015   Source: Report, ""Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate,""  Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015  And why? Missing from the report: Why the differences between black workers and others? When we called to ask about that, Ady Barkan, a center official, suggested multiple longstanding factors including racism and differences between blacks and whites in education levels and rates of incarceration. By email, Barkan also pointed out a July 2011 issue paper from the liberal Center for American Progress noting, among reasons, that in each of the latest U.S. recessions, blacks were most often the first employees fired and the last ones hired (once each recession was ending). We asked the Economic Policy Institute why black unemployment in Texas appeared to be running higher than white and Hispanic unemployment. Josh Bivens, director of research and policy, said by email this may be because of discrimination in the labor market and pre-labor market. And what’s the ""pre-labor"" market? Bivens said residential segregation can lead to blacks going to lower-quality primary and secondary schools, potentially resulting in lower levels of educational achievement and less lucrative jobs. We also sought an explanation of the cited differences from Chris King, director of the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at the University of Texas. By email, King said labor economists would  explain higher unemployment among blacks/African Americans nationally by pointing out that African Americans tend to have lower levels of education and be employed in lower-paying occupations and industries than whites. King elaborated by pointing out Bureau of Labor Statistics data covering 2011 showing black men more likely to work in service, production, transportation and ""material moving"" jobs. Conversely, he wrote, black men were less likely to work in professional and managerial jobs than whites; the picture was similar, he said, for black women. (See his full reply here.) Another view Separately to our inquiry, analyst Chuck DeVore of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation suggested real median hourly wage estimates used by the institute may deliver an incomplete picture of economic well being. ""People don’t live on wages alone,"" DeVore said, adding that a more accurate indicator of wealth would be household income, folding in Social Security, inheritances and any other financial assistance. See more on this aspect here. Our ruling The Texas Organizing Project said: ""The unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000."" Texas African Americans may not have been as bad off as residents of other states, and this claim doesn’t acknowledge wage fluctuations over the years. Regardless, evidence shows Texas blacks having a higher unemployment rate than fellow Texans and also being the lone group with lower wages in 2014 than in 2000. We rate the statement True.

MSNBC's Ed Schultz: Trade deals closed 50,000 factories
","A Pacific trade pact moving through Congress has split many pro-union Democrats with President Barack Obama. Liberal MSNBC television host Ed Schultz is among those opposing the deal. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would expand trade and investment between America and 11 Pacific Rim countries. But Schultz says it's a bad proposition for the American worker. ""Proponents of this trade deal claim that there have been net job gains under previous American trade deals,"" Schultz said April 17, 2015. ""That's false. America has lost over 50,000 manufacturing factories on other trade deals. America has turned its economy to a paper-shuffling service industry economy."" In this fact-check, we assess whether past trade deals have caused more than 50,000 factories to shut their doors. We sent a note to Schultz through the MSNBC press office to get more details on his statement and didn’t hear back. The number of factories The easiest part to check is the number of manufacturing establishments. Our starting point is 1993 because the biggest free trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement, otherwise known as NAFTA, took effect on Jan. 1, 1994. The Census Bureau gathers statistics on U.S. business and it identifies the ones involved with manufacturing. In 1993, there were 355,338 establishments. This is a count of manufacturers of all sizes, from lone operators all the way up to businesses with over 1,000 workers. Some people might say a guy in his garage doesn’t fit the description of a factory, but there’s no obvious point to draw the line so we used the most inclusive number. We drew on two census databases -- Statistics of U.S. Businesses and the Longitudinal Business Database. The numbers from both are pretty much in line with the other, but the longitudinal database has data for every year while the other is missing figures for 1993-96. Both data sets show a rise in manufacturing businesses immediately after NAFTA followed by a steady decline in the number of establishments starting in 1996 or 1997. (One company may have many manufacturing establishments.) The following chart comes from the longitudinal database. So how do Schultz’s figures hold up? He’s right so long as you include the impact of the Great Recession. Between 1993 and 2012, the number of manufacturing establishments fell by 71,525. Using the other census data set, the decline was over 90,000 (the totals vary due to different survey methods). There’s another way to look at the data. Schultz didn’t credit NAFTA with adding to the country’s manufacturers, but we note that the number of establishments rose in the first three years the treaty was in effect. Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean that one caused the other, but simply to cover our bases, we looked at the drop since the high point of 1996. Working from the longitudinal data set, that gives us 77,487 firms lost between 1996 and 2012. Schultz talked about losing ""over 50,000 manufacturing factories,"" which seems like a safe number. Except for one big thing -- the Great Recession itself. Schultz said the country lost those factories due to trade deals. It seems difficult to argue that a global economic meltdown didn’t play a much larger role. Every sector took a hit to some degree, from retail, to real estate to construction. Looking back on the crisis, no one would claim that construction firms shut down due to NAFTA or any other trade agreement. To keep the recession out of the equation, we looked at 2007, the last year before the economy tanked. Doing that changes the numbers in a big way. Based on the longitudinal data set, between 1993 and 2007, 32,363 establishments disappeared. If 1996 is the starting point, 39,297 were lost. Using the other database, Schultz does better -- 56,261 since 1992 and 62,485 since 1997. We don’t know where Schultz got his facts, but one key data set suggests Schultz exaggerated the impact of past trade deals. Trade, manufacturing and the economy It is difficult to tease out the specific impact of trade on jobs. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but the details get tricky and economists will disagree on some fundamental facts. Schultz put the loss of 50,000 factories squarely at the doorstep of trade deals. From our survey of the research and feedback from economists, trade agreements caused anywhere between some and a lot of those closures. There’s no consensus on where in that range the actual point lies. Plus, analysts differ on whether the jobs that replaced manufacturing put the country on a better course. A quick word about trade deals. Some treaties with countries are formalized as free-trade agreements. That list includes NAFTA, CAFTA (which involved several Central American nations), South Korea, Chile -- 20 countries all told . China is a different matter. In 2000, China was granted permanent normal trade relations status. While this wasn’t a free trade deal, it eliminated potential tariff increases on goods from China and opened the door to much greater flows of investment between the two nations. For most intents and purposes, it was a trade deal. It arguably has proved the most significant. In 2014, total trade with China approached $650 billion in exports and imports, with a trade deficit of about $316 billion, larger than with any other single country. For the record, American trade with Canada was greater, $759 billion, but the trade deficit was only $7 billion. An analysis co-authored by Justin Pierce, a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and Peter Schott, a Yale economist, found that U.S. policy on China hit American jobs hard and manufacturing even harder. It reduced total employment growth by nearly 20 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 compared to a decade earlier. Among production workers, the reduction was nearly 25 percentage points. Robert Scott is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank supported in part by unions. Scott told PunditFact that America’s trade deficit with China cost about 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013. ""With China, somewhere in excess of 75 percent of the jobs lost are due to trade,"" Scott said. Others are not so sure that trade deserves the brunt of the blame. Martin Baily, an economist at the centrist Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, says some of the job losses stem from trade, but not all. ""Part of what has happened is that there has been consolidation in the industry to take advantage of larger scale production,"" Baily said. ""Manufacturing is changing because of technology and trade and that inevitably will lead to plant closures."" One line of argument is that workers have become more productive and it takes fewer of them to produce the same goods. (Scott and others say the numbers don’t back that up.) But for Baily, one of the reasons that jobs moved overseas has less to do with trade itself and more with the appetites of American consumers. In effect, Americans wanted more things than our factories could produce, so imports grew. But as proof that all explanations are subject to debate, we found economists who argue the exact opposite. Economists Robert Z. Lawrence and  Lawrence Edwards writing in the Harvard Business Review said a lack of demand led to manufacturing job losses. American factories grew too efficient, and therefore needed fewer workers to meet the needs of consumers. ""Trade deficits in manufactures have played only a partial role in reducing employment—and almost no role over the past decade,"" they wrote. Our ruling Schultz said that more than 50,000 manufacturing factories were lost due to trade deals. His numbers are up for some interpretation, depending on how you factor in the most recent recession. The recession itself exposes a flaw in Schultz’s math in that he blames trade deals for almost all of the decline in factories. But there is no question that worldwide economic events played the dominant role after 2008. Changes of technoogy also have played a role. This statement is partially accurate but leaves out many important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D57340>],/factchecks/2015/apr/23/ed-schultz/msnbcs-schultz-trade-deals-closed-50000-factories/

Medicaid recipients '97 percent more likely to die' than privately insured, Corcoran says
","Constituents demanding a solution to the Legislature’s budget impasse over Medicaid expansion have been emailing Rep. Richard Corcoran, who has been telling voters that the federal program is dangerous for its patients. Several PolitiFact Florida readers have sent in an email response from the Land O’ Lakes Republican, who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Joint Legislative Budget Commission. In his reply, Corcoran decries the already high enrollment and expense of Medicaid, the joint state and federal health care program for the very poor, as a reason to not accept federal expansion money under the Affordable Care Act. ""Unfortunately, those Floridians belong to a troubled delivery system,"" Corcoran wrote. ""The largest national study, conducted by the University of Virginia, found that Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance. Expanding coverage through a health care program that delivers questionable care is not a public policy that Florida should embrace."" Saying patients are twice as likely to die is an eye-opening statistic to cite when arguing against Medicaid, implying not only is the program delivering substandard care, it’s actually bad for patients. We wondered if the federal plan was really to blame for such a high mortality rate. What we found is that if you’re on Medicaid and you have surgery, the study Corcoran cited did say you are more likely to die -- but it’s probably not because you’re using Medicaid to pay for treatment. The Virginia study The University of Virginia study was published in 2010, and followed the patient outcomes of almost 900,000 major surgeries across the country. That’s different than the Medicaid population as a whole. It also kept track of whether those patients had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or no insurance at all. The eight researchers adjusted for patient health care and population variables like age, income, where they lived, the type of hospital they were in, what kind of operation they were having and more. The results showed Medicaid patients were the most at-risk, and were 1.97 times more likely to die following a procedure than a patient with private insurance. That’s where Corcoran got his percentage, although experts we talked to said it was misleading to use as a reference. Medicaid patients also were more likely to die after a procedure than Medicare patients (1.54 more than insured patients) and even the uninsured (1.74 times). Medicaid recipients also had the highest total costs and longest hospital stays, although mortality rates varied depending on a variety of factors. So does that mean Medicaid is the culprit for the higher odds of patient deaths? Not at all, University of Virginia School of Medicine professor and cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Irving Kron (rhymes with ""phone"") told us. Kron was one of the researchers for the study. While it does adjust for socioeconomic factors, the study notes that if you’re on Medicaid, you’re probably suffering from a whole host of risk factors other categories of patients don’t have, he said. Medicaid recipients are the poorest, least educated and sickest of all patients, and often don’t seek medical help until conditions are at their worst. Those patients have the highest incidence of AIDS, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders, psychoses and metastatic cancer, the study said. ""The reality is it’s apples and oranges,"" Kron said. ""The problem with Medicaid is there’s more emergencies, because they’re sicker than most people. … They wait for care and unfortunately, emergent patients don’t do as well as elective patients."" Kron said the study focused on whether socioeconomic status was a factor in medical treatment, which it clearly was, and not on the quality of the systems paying for health care. Corcoran insisted the study proved him right. ""My point was that Medicaid is a subpar health care delivery system,"" Corcoran said via email. ""The University of Virginia study supports that conclusion."" The study does include a caveat that there is a possible ""system bias"" that gives privately insured people access to better hospitals and doctors. ""For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease. Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons,"" the study said. But Kron and health policy experts disagree with Corcoran’s takeaway. Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research for the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, said Medicaid patients are a very broad category that is tough to compare to others, even the uninsured. Echoing Kron’s concerns, he added that uninsured patients may elect to go without coverage and end up on Medicaid when they become sick, or that insured patients in the study may have reached lifetime policy limits and had to resort to Medicaid. ""As the researchers in the paper acknowledge, part of the reason that Medicaid is associated with higher mortality is that many people fall into Medicaid when they are very sick and impoverished,"" Ku said. Other reports Corcoran also directed us to a recent Oregon study that examined the difference between patients allowed to join expanded Medicaid rolls in a 2008 lottery versus others who did not get into the program. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. In essence, the research found Medicaid didn’t really improve physiological health, although patients said they felt better. That’s probably because they didn’t have to worry as much about getting treatment, Harvard health economist Ben Sommers said. People in the Oregon study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. One thing it didn’t say, which Corcoran originally argued with the Virginia study, was that Medicaid hurt its patients. ""In any accounting, there is no evidence of people being worse off for having gotten Medicaid. Getting Medicaid is a major improvement over being uninsured in these studies,"" Sommers said. Sommers, who is a part-time adviser to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, helped research a report on the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York. The team found patients in those states showed improved access to care, self-reported health and reduced mortality, compared to nearby states that didn’t expand Medicaid. Improvements were higher in minority and very low-income patients. He added that there are other reports that compare different primary payer categories to each other, but there was no evidence of what Corcoran implied in his email -- that Medicaid itself was to blame for the higher mortality rate by providing substandard care. ""To my knowledge there are no studies that examine the impact of states’ expanding Medicaid, or individuals going from uninsured to Medicaid, showing Medicaid to be harmful,"" Sommers said. Our ruling Corcoran said, ""Medicaid patients were 97 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance."" Corcoran was citing a 2010 University of Virginia study that looked at Medicaid patients who underwent surgery, not all people in the program. Experts we spoke to -- including one of the study’s authors -- said it’s a misleading statistic to cite. While it’s accurate to say Medicaid patients who undergo operations have higher odds of dying than those with private insurance, it’s because they are sicker and tend to wait until the last minute for care, not because the program is inadequate. Other studies show using Medicaid improves access and quality of life for many patients, or at the very least doesn’t hurt them.

Fact-checking Gwyneth Paltrow's $29 weekly food stamps budget claim
","Love or loathe Gwyneth Paltrow, her experiment buying groceries on a food stamp budget stirred up a lot of awareness about the nation’s anti-hunger programs. Which, you know, was kind of the point. Paltrow, a health-conscious actress who prefers to cook with fresh ingredients, accepted a challenge from celebrity chef Mario Batali to live on food stamps for a week and draw attention to the Food Bank for New York City earlier this month. Paltrow shared a photo of her grocery haul in an April 9 tweet, writing, ""This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store—what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week.""  The Internet quickly balked at her choices, particularly the green garnishes that do little to stave hunger — seven limes, really? But few people paid attention to whether the budget she shared is actually accurate or typical of a family that needs assistance. A reader saw the figure in a CNN story about Paltrow’s challenge, which she quit after four days, and asked us to look into it. If you want to know what Paltrow ended up cooking from her basket, check out her GOOP recipes for black bean taquitos and sweet potato saute served with kale, brown rice and a poached egg. If you want to know what’s wrong about her $29 SNAP budget, keep reading. SNAP in a snap The key to understanding SNAP starts with its full name — Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The ""Supplemental"" is key because SNAP is not designed to provide low-income families with all the money they need to eat every single meal. It’s supposed to supplement grocery spending, not replace it. SNAP is one of the government’s biggest welfare programs, costing about $70 billion in 2014. Demand for SNAP grew over the course of the recession, reaching a high of more than 47 million beneficiaries in 23 million households. Program costs and payouts have come down amid the economic recovery. To receive SNAP benefits, a person must: Show assets less than $2,250; Report gross monthly income at or below 130 of the federal poverty line; Report net monthly income at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty line. How much a person or household receives depends on how much income they make and how big the household is. The sliding scale, which comes with monthly maximums, emphasizes how SNAP is indeed supplemental, and how Paltrow’s claim is wanting. Say a household of four qualifies for SNAP with a $1,136 net monthly income. While the maximum SNAP benefit is $649 a month, that household would receive only $308 a month (about $19 per person, per week), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In this case, the USDA assumes the household would spend an additional $341 of their own money (30 percent of their monthly income) on food. The case of the person with no net income So the system is set up as supplemental food assistance. But what about people who have no income? They would get more SNAP money. A single person could receive $194 a month (about $48 a week). SNAP benefits for a household of four would be closer to $40 a week. Neither number is near Paltrow’s $29 a week figure. That figure is the amount of SNAP benefits for the average individual (all benefits divided by all people). The trouble is that calculation misses the point that SNAP is supposed to supplement people’s food budget, does not account for the fact that people with no net income receive more government support, and ignores other government programs that provide food aid. Many families bring in other income or benefits that complete the overall budget for food, said Greg Mills, who studies SNAP policy at the Urban Institute think tank. ""Households on food stamps do typically receive some other benefits from the government, but it may be limited,"" he said. For low-income women who are pregnant or have infants, they may also utilize another USDA supplemental program for women, infants and children (WIC). School programs offer free and reduced breakfast and lunch to children (48.1 percent of all students were eligible for free or reduced lunch in the 2010-11 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education). D.C. public schools also offer after-school snacks and supper, Mills said. In 2013, 24 percent of SNAP households had Social Security income, 7 percent received welfare payments under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and 4 percent received unemployment assistance. Paltrow, whose ""conscious uncoupling"" from musician husband Chris Martin previously ignited the Internet, has two children, Moses and Apple. If we consider an alternate reality in which Paltrow applied for benefits for herself and her children, the average monthly benefit for a household with children may provide a more useful look than a per-person figure. In 2013, the average monthly benefit for a household with children was $410, or $95 a week. In reality, Paltrow abandoned the $29 a week challenge after four days. Our ruling Paltrow pointed to $29 worth of groceries as what ""families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week."" It’s clear Paltrow is trying to do a good thing. But her specific claim falls short. SNAP is not intended to feed families by itself. It is designed to help people with low incomes meet a government-approved budget for food by providing a benefit that helps them get there, sometimes in conjunction with other sources of meals, such as school food programs, and financial support. The government expects SNAP beneficiaries to spend 30 percent of their own income on food. That expectation is what makes the $29 a week figure look so low. A single person with no income could receive about $48 a week in SNAP benefits (65 percent more than Paltrow stated) and would not factor in other types of government support.

In protest, the woman then proceeds to do only 78 percent of her job, much to the dismay of her male co-workers and bewildered bosses. The comedic attack on the gender wage-gap struck a nerve. As of this week, it had 9.7 million views, thanks to social media sites. It was released on the site BuzzFeed in conjunction with Equal Pay Day (April 14th ) and entitled ""One Woman Discovers the Wage Gap."" PolitiFact couldn’t resist. We’ve been here before. But it ‘s worth another visit based on the viral dissemination of the video. The bottom line is this. There is a gender wage-gap. But it is not 22 percent for men and women of the same age performing the same job. That is an urban myth perpetuated by politicians and advocacy groups misreading Census data compiled on cumulative earnings by men and women. PolitiFact has given you the nuts and bolts about gender wage-gap statistics  in past fact-checks. You can read the two most important works in this area here and here. Basically, there is a wage gap. That is a fact. But it tends to diminish when you compare women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education. The video implies the woman and her better-paid cubicle-mate are otherwise equals. Their cubicles are at least identical and the co-workers appear to be about the same age. We reached out to the folks at BuzzFeed. They shared word from the video’s producer, Chantel Houston, that a research team had looked at information from the White House and four other sources before deciding to go with the 78 percent statistic. This included a 2014 report in the liberal groupThink Progress, which cited 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau showing that the average woman working full-time and year-round was making 78 percent of what a man with similar employment. The report said that was a slight but not statistically different increase from 77 percent in 2012, and not far off the wages in 2007. The double-digit gender pay-gap relying on U.S. Census Bureau data has been widely reported. That data has shown women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The Census Bureau did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield much smaller wage gaps. BuzzFeed actually looked at some sources that got it right, but then produced a misleading video. For example, BuzzFeed reviewed a CNN Money report from last October, which said that 78 percent stat was ""an aggregate of all men and women in the workplace"" that doesn't take into account important variables like education level, total hours worked, type of work and job tenure. A wage gap does exist, the show’s audience heard. But CNN Money talked about a study from the American Association of University Women that controlled for college major, occupation, age, geographical region, hours worked and more, and found there was still a 7 percent wage gap between male and female college grads a year after graduation. In addition, the video’s researchers said they reviewed a recent report from the Pew Research Center, which says women have to work about 60 extra days, or about three months, to earn what men did by the end of the previous year, based on the White house estimate that full-time working women earn 77 percent of what their male counterparts earn. But for young women, the wage gap is even smaller – at 93 percent – meaning they caught up to their same-aged male counterparts by roughly the last week in January of this year, the Pew Research Center estimates. Some studies put the real gender-based wage gap at half that. And some studies show that highly educated single women in urban areas actually make more than their male counterparts. Our ruling. The BuzzFeed video takes a legitimate statistic and illustrates it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is. The 78 percent  figure is real, but for culmulative wages.  It does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. And, unlike the video, the Census data never attempted  to compare equal pay for equal work. Using this statistic to illustrate the gender pay-gap is misleading. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF5200>],/factchecks/2015/apr/22/viral-buzzfeed/viral-video-misfires-on-wage-gap/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Does the United States spend more per student than most countries?
","While some conservative activists and presidential hopefuls have trashed Common Core, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush remains a supporter of the education standards. Bush’s support for Common Core could put him at odds with primary challengers should he decide to enter the race: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, opposes Common Core, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential candidate, once showed tacit support but later called for repeal. During an event on April 17 in New Hampshire, a Nashua resident asked Bush straight up: ""Gov. Bush: where do you stand on Common Core?"" Bush said: ""Thank you for bringing that up. If it wasn’t going to be brought up, I was going to bring it up myself."" Bush then made his case that Common Core is essentially a push for higher standards, to address concerns about student achievement in the United States. ""We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries,"" Bush said. Bush drew applause when he said ""we don’t need a federal government involved in this at all,"" and added that he supported proposed legislation to ban the feds from creating standards or curriculum. (PolitiFact has rated multiple claims from other politicians that Common Core is a ""federal takeover"" of education and found them misleading.) Here we will fact-check Bush’s claim about the national graduation rate and how much we spend per student compared to other countries. Graduation rates and per-pupil spending There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates including the federal government's cohort method, which examines how many students who enter 9th grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma. By that measurement, the national average was about 81 percent in 2012-13. (Florida is below that national average.) As for spending, Bush’s spokeswoman pointed to a 2013 Associated Press article about a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that compared per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations. Formed in 1961, OECD sets international standards on a wide range of topics, including education spending. The most recent OECD study -- from 2014 using 2011 data -- shows that the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education. Four countries -- Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland -- spend more. Those same countries are also the only ones that spend more than the United States per student on primary schools. Country Secondary per-pupil spending Austria $13,607 Luxembourg $16,182 Norway $13,939 Switzerland $15,891 United States $12,731 (Bush mentioned Liechtenstein, a tiny country located between Austria and Switzerland, but that wasn’t included on the OECD list.) Pointing to the OECD data, the federal government’s National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country’s wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student. When examining expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for all levels of education, the United States and Chile are seventh out of 32 countries. Stanford professor Eric Hanushek, an expert on economic analysis of educational issues, told PolitiFact that the OECD ranking is the best source currently available to judge differences among nations in education. However, University of Iowa education professor David Bills offered one caveat. ""What matters is not the absolute budget per se, but the proportion of that budget that is spent on instruction,"" Bills said. Traditionally the United States spends big parts of its educational budget on non-instructional items such as security -- more so than some other nations. Bush has changed how he has worded his claim about how per-student spending in the United States compares to other countries. In 2013, Bush claimed that the United States spends ""more per student than any country in the world,"" which Factcheck.org noted was inaccurate since a few countries spent more. Our ruling Bush said, ""We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries."" The national average for the graduation rate was 81 percent in 2012-13, according to one method the federal government uses to calculate the rate. Among advanced countries, the United States ranked fifth in per student spending for secondary education behind Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland. Liechtenstein wasn’t on the list, but since Bush expressed uncertainty, we think his statement is still accurate. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FF9E6AC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/21/jeb-bush/does-united-states-spend-more-student-most-countri/
"['National', 'Education', 'History', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton says U.S. was first to create community colleges
","In her bid for the White House, Hillary Clinton is lavishing attention on community colleges. She met with groups of community college students in both of the early caucus and primary states -- Iowa and New Hampshire -- and during those roundtables, Clinton sang the praises of how community colleges give a new generation of students skills to succeed in a changing job market. At a session with students and teachers at NHTI-Concord’s Community College on April 21, 2015, she said, ""The United States invented the community college. Nobody else had ever done anything like it."" She added, ""I really support President Obama's effort to try to raise the visibility and to try to make it even more affordable for more people"" to go to community college. This echoed comments she made in a visit a few days earlier to Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa. In a roundtable event with students, Clinton told her Iowa audience that ""community colleges"" are a ""uniquely American invention ... something nobody else in the world did."" We wondered if Clinton was correct that the United States was a trailblazer in this regard. So we checked with a number of historians of American education, and, despite a few quibbles, they agreed that Clinton was basically right. The experts we checked with said the idea for community colleges first emerged in 1901, when Central High School in Joliet, Ill., established a program to academically parallel the first two years of a four-year college or university. It was geared toward students who had graduated from high school and who wished to pursue a college education but didn’t want to leave their hometown. The program in Joliet was officially renamed Joliet Junior College in 1916 (and it still exists). While some of this new class of institutions were private, community colleges are largely public today. ""It's fair to say that the U.S. was the first place to try to combine terminal vocational training with education intended to lead to transfer to a four-year school,"" said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. ""It wasn't exactly invented out of thin air, and it evolved in part from vocational high schools, but it was a self-consciously distinctive institutional development."" We heard two quibbles with Clinton’s comment, and they are minor. • Clinton’s terminology is slightly off. For a half century or more, the institutions in question were called ""junior colleges,"" rather than ""community colleges"" -- the term Clinton used at both events. The term ""community college"" emerged from a 1947 report by President Harry Truman’s Commission on Higher Education. The commission’s report said, ""The name used does not matter, though community college seems to describe these schools best; the important thing is that the services they perform be recognized and vastly extended."" While some institutions still call themselves ""junior colleges,"" the name ""community college"" gained widespread use beginning in the 1960s, said Roger L. Geiger, education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II. ""It was the junior college, especially the public junior college, that was the distinctive American institutional invention,"" rather than the ""community college"" per se, said John R. Thelin, a professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education. • Other types of institutions, both in the United States and in other countries, shared aspects of the community college. The best example is the system of vocational education that’s common in parts of Europe, especially Germany. This system ""has a much, much longer history, since it comes out of the apprenticeship system of the trade guilds from medieval times on forward,"" said Margaret O'Mara, historian at the University of Washington and author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. A key difference between the two, Geiger said, is that community colleges in the United States bestowed university credits and encouraged students to enroll in traditional universities for their third and fourth years. Despite some similarities with European systems, ""the U.S. community college system is basically a unique organizational structure — part of the nation’s rich mix of postsecondary institutions,"" said Christopher Loss, a public policy and higher education professor at Vanderbilt University. Our ruling Clinton said ""the United States invented the community college. Nobody else had ever done anything like it."" This is largely correct, though Clinton’s terminology could have been more precise. Also, other types of institutions in Europe share characteristics of community colleges. Still, the specific U.S. system is was an innovation. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966EEEC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-was-first-create-community/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'Military', 'Evan Bayh']","
Former Sen. Evan Bayh says health care costs are fastest growing part of Defense Department budget
","When former senators Evan Bayh, D-Ind.,and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., made a swing through the state this month promoting their First Budget initiative, they threw around facts and figures like rice at a wedding. The two emphasized the nation’s ever-increasing debt (now at $18.2 trillion) and ongoing deficits ($485 billion for 2014). But amid their calls for voters to hold presidential candidates accountable for the country’s finances, a few nuggets stood out. Both at an appearance at the Rudman Center at the University of New Hampshire School of Law and at an editorial board meeting at the Monitor, Bayh talked about a specific challenge of reining in military spending. ""The fastest-growing part of the Pentagon’s budget are health care expenses,"" said Bayh, a former Senate Armed Services committee member. It’s growing faster than spending on tanks and planes and salaries? Could this be true? We decided to look into the matter. According to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow in defense budget studies at the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Bayh is on the mark. While Bayh’s statement is broad, and one can divide the defense budget into different wedges, health care spending has soared. ""Among the main areas of the defense budget (like procurement, R&D, construction, pay, etc.) military healthcare has grown the fastest,"" Harrison wrote in an email. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found the same trend. According to a report it released last year: ""The cost of providing health care to service members, retirees, and their families increased by 130 percent"" from 2000 to 2012. But what are the specific numbers? For fiscal year 2016, Harrison said, the military’s projected health care costs are expected to total $48 billion dollars. That sum covers the 9.2 million beneficiaries of Tricare, the Pentagon’s benefits program. Most of that money doesn’t help out frontline troops, either. It pays for benefits to their dependents, or to retirees. The CBO report found total spending of $52 billion in 2012, which is lower than the 2016 projection. But Harrison said any decline is illusory. The Defense Department has included reforms to health care system in its budget request, but Congress ""will likely deny many if not all of the reforms,"" he said. The actual cost would then be higher. Overall, Harrison wrote, military health care costs have ""grown from being just 4 percent of the DoD budget in 1990 to 10 percent today."" If anything, this undercounts the actual fiscal impact. The Tricare system of military health care coverage is an entirely separate entity from veterans’ health care, which is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ budget. And VA coverage isn’t cheap: It’s likely to cost $62 billion in fiscal year 2016, Harrison said. By the standards of health insurance, Tricare coverage is generous. According to reporting by the Military Times, ""active-duty family members . . . pay no annual enrollment fees and no cost-shares to see a physician. Retirees pay $555.84 a year to enroll themselves and their families in Tricare Prime and pay fees ranging from $12 to 20 percent of a bill depending on the care received."" The addition of retirees and their families under the so-called Tricare for Life program has been a major driver of the increased costs, the Military Times wrote. In fact, former defense secretary Chuck Hagel warned that the health care expenses were hurting the military’s overall mission. The Pentagon’s greatest fiscal challenge, he said in 2013, was ""the growing imbalance in where that money is being spent internally."" That is, toward doctors’ bills, not boots on the ground. Competition for the fastest-growing part of the budget is spending to fight terrorism and extremism (called overseas contingency operations).    Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said resources devoted to those operations spiked far higher on a percentage basis. But that depends on how one slices the Pentagon budget and the time frame used to measure growth. According to the Defense Department’s 2016 budget request, overseas contingency operation spending was $22.9 billion in fiscal year 2001, and peaked at $186.9 billion in fiscal year 2008. It’s projected to come back down to $50.9 billion for 2016. In other words, while that spending increased a staggering amount, it has dropped markedly in recent years. In their New Hampshire appearances, Bayh and Gregg said military spending is not the main driver of the United States’ debt and deficits. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid pose the biggest long-term challenges. Discretionary spending -- which includes spending on the military -- ""is not our problem,"" Gregg said at the Rudman Center. Our ruling Bayh said that ""the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon’s budget are health care expenses."" There’s little debate that generous military health care benefits are taking up an ever-increasing share of the Pentagon’s budget. While other parts of the budget have spiked, that’s in the past.

Polls show majority in swing states see Hillary Clinton as untrustworthy, GOP's Reince Priebus says
","On the day Hillary Clinton announced her run for president, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus tried to hang an ""untrustworthy"" label on her. Priebus, the former Wisconsin GOP chairman, made his charges April 12, 2015, on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" After host Bob Schieffer noted that a national GOP web ad had attacked Clinton two days earlier, there was this exchange with Priebus: Schieffer: Is there a concern that you might, you know, that it might backfire here and make her, you know, people sympathetic to her with all of this starting so soon? Priebus: I don't think so. I mean, she has kind of portrayed this air of inevitability. I think if you look at the facts of the case -- which is where I really would like to stay as chairman of the party -- you know, if you look at the facts of the scandal that surrounds her, you look at the facts of the recent polling -- where a majority of people in battleground states say that she is untrustworthy -- when you look at the fact she has 100 percent name recognition --

Schieffer: A majority --

Priebus: -- majority of the people polled in Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Florida, said she is untrustworthy. So, Priebus claims that in recent polling a majority of people in battleground states said Clinton is untrustworthy.​ After Schieffer interjected, Priebus singled out Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Florida. However, as we’ll see, the polling he relies on also surveys two other battleground states. And there is an issue with what pollsters refer to as a plurality, which is not the same as a majority. Poll results breakdown Before jumping into the polling results, we'll note that we rated another Priebus claim about Clinton on the same program as Half True. Priebus said Clinton took ""money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen."" The monarchies in the first three countries did give money to the Clinton Foundation, but not to her personally. Yemen, which does not have a king, did not. To back Priebus’ polling claim, his office pointed us to the latest swing state surveys from Quinnipiac University Poll. The Hamden, Conn., college regularly polls nationally as well as in what it describes as swing states for the 2016 presidential election. They are the four states Priebus cited, plus Ohio and Pennsylvania. The latest results from Quinnipiac in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia were released April 9, 2015; and the latest results for Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania were released March 31, 2015. All of the people surveyed were self-identified registered voters and the margin of error in each survey is about 3 points. One question was: ""Would you say that Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy or not?"" Here are the results:   State Yes -- Clinton is honest and trustworthy No -- Clinton is not honest and trustworthy Don’t Know or No Answer Colorado 38% 56% 6% Virginia 40% 52% 7% Iowa 43% 49% 8% Florida 41% 50% 9% Pennsylvania 44% 49% 7% Ohio 47% 46% 7%   At first glance, it might seem Priebus' claim is largely correct. In five of the six states, more people say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy than say she is. But a closer look shows that in three of the five states that didn't break in Clinton's favor, neither the yes nor the no answer got more than 50 percent. In other words, there was not a majority opinion. And in Ohio, the plurality opinion was, by one point, in Clinton's favor. Before we close we'll note some national polls, done in March or April 2015, that asked the same question or a similar one. In a CNN/Opinion Research Center poll of adults, 50 percent said Clinton is honest and trustworthy and 49 percent said she isn't. In a ABC News/Washington Post poll of adults, 46 percent said she is honest and trustworthy and the same percentage said she isn't. In a CBS News poll of adults, 42 percent said Clinton is honest and trustworthy and 47 percent said she isn’t. A Fox News poll of registered voters asked if ""honest"" describes Clinton -- 44 percent said yes and 52 percent said no. Our rating Priebus said that in recent polling in battleground states, a ""majority of the people"" said Hillary Clinton ""is untrustworthy,"" and he went on to cite Colorado, Virginia, Iowa and Florida. But there are two other states -- Ohio and Pennsylvania-- included in the six swing states that are surveyed by Quinnipiac University Poll, which is what Priebus cites to back his claim. In five of the states -- Colorado, Virginia, Iowa and Florida and Pennsylvania -- more people said Clinton is not honest and trustworthy than said she is. However, the percentage reached a majority -- over 50 percent -- in only Colorado and Virginia. Meanwhile, by 47 percent to 46 percent, people polled in Ohio said Clinton is honest and trustworthy. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

"['Medicaid', 'Florida', 'Steve Crisafulli']","
What polls say about Medicaid expansion in Florida
","The Florida Legislature is split on what to do about Medicaid expansion, but House Speaker Steve Crisafulli said that isn’t the case for many constituents. ""If you go into a federal program like that, you will soon find out what it means to be married to Washington. There's folks that are not in this chamber today because of that very issue,"" he told radio station WUSF’s Health News Florida. ""People spoke in those districts, and we feel like Medicaid expansion isn’t necessarily a very popular issue on the street."" The Florida House and Senate are currently debating whether to expand the program to insure the very poor as part of contentious budget negotiations. Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, opposes Medicaid expansion and was speaking broadly about how discussing it had doomed some candidates’ political ambitions. His office said he ""was speaking as a matter of his perspective."" But we at PolitiFact Florida thought his statement can be verified or contradicted by public opinion polls. And since it's such a critical issue in Florida, we decided to take a look. It’s all in the wording The Legislature is debating whether to accept billions from the federal government to increase the number of people eligible for Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. More than 800,000 currently uninsured Floridians would join the program’s rolls. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the expansion at first, gradually shifting to 90 percent by 2020. (The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 the expansion was optional for states; 28 states and the District of Columbia have expanded the program as of April 2015.) The Florida Senate now favors an expansion while the House opposes it. Senators have proposed the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program, which would create a state-run private insurance exchange for low-income Floridians with federal dollars. Residents using the exchange would pay premiums and be required to either have a job or attend school. The House has not set forth a proposal of their own. Several polls over the years have looked at whether Floridians favor making the program larger. In 2013, three polls showed support for expansion as high as 62 or 63 percent, although one from the James Madison Institute was as low as 30 percent. One 2014 University of Florida poll put approval of expansion at 67 percent. That’s a pretty wide range, but it likely had a lot to do with how the poll questions were worded, according to Alan Reifman, a Texas Tech University professor who specializes in social science research methodology. The James Madison Institute poll’s question focused on how the state’s budget would grow with a bigger Medicaid program, with no mention of how many Floridians would be covered or that the federal government would be paying the lion’s share, Reifman said. A Public Policy Polling question that included state and federal costs, plus the number of people who would benefit through coverage and new jobs was ""probably the most balanced question-wording of those I’ve seen,"" he said. That poll tallied 62 percent in favor of expansion. Updated for March 2015, the Public Policy Polling survey used a shorter question focusing on federal funding, but still found 58 percent in favor of expansion. Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said wide support for expansion in most polls shows that once people understand the issue and how expansion would be implemented, attitudes tend to shift. A state solution like what the Senate is offering tends to be particularly popular in Florida, she said. What’s generating headlines from Tallahassee now isn’t so much overwhelming voter opposition, but rather an ideological debate in the Legislature. ""This is not a partisan issue in the strictest sense,"" Alker said. ""This is a fight within the Republican Party."" In April 2015, Gov. Rick Scott’s Let’s Get to Work PAC released a poll that referred to ""significantly expanding the federal Medicaid program under Obamacare here in Florida."" Scott has recently renewed opposition to the expansion and is threatening to sue Washington over pressure to accept federal expansion money. His PAC’s contentious poll wording may have influenced responses, Reifman said, and sampled likely voters, which favors Republicans. That poll found a 44-44 percent split between those who favored and opposed expansion. Partisan attitudes were more apparent when Let’s Get to Work polled a sample of 500 Republican primary voters -- they opposed Medicaid expansion by 75 percent. Our ruling Crisafulli said, ""Medicaid expansion isn’t necessarily a very popular issue on the street."" He was speaking broadly about how constituents don’t want the expansion. Several polls give the edge to a majority of Floridians favoring the expansion, although results vary depending on how the questions are worded. A recent conservative poll found that Republicans don’t like the expansion by a wide margin. Taken together, those numbers present a more nuanced picture than what Crisafulli suggested. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CDE80>],/factchecks/2015/apr/20/steve-crisafulli/polls-medicaid-expansion-florida/

Is Loretta Lynch nomination delayed longer than 7 other attorneys general combined?
","Democrats have recently been accusing Senate Republicans of obstructing the nomination of Loretta Lynch to succeed Eric Holder as attorney general. Lynch, currently the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would become the first African-American woman to head the Justice Department, but she’s been awaiting a confirmation vote by the full Senate for several months. While observers expect Lynch to win confirmation, the Senate’s Republican majority has been withholding a vote as leverage to secure other legislative items. In addition, some Republicans have taken issue with Lynch’s refusal to speak out against President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration, which some in the GOP have called unconstitutional. Obama himself decried the delay at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on April 17, 2015. Obama called it a ""crazy situation where a woman who everybody agrees is qualified, who has gone after terrorists, who has worked with police officers to get gangs off the streets, who is trusted by the civil rights community and by police unions as being somebody who is fair and effective and a good manager -- nobody suggests otherwise -- who has been confirmed twice before by the United States Senate for one of the biggest law enforcement jobs in the country, has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined."" We wondered: Has Lynch’s nomination been ""sitting there longer than the previous seven Attorney General nominees combined""? We looked at data from the Senate about the past seven nominees. Here’s a rundown, in reverse chronological order:   Nominee President Nomination received by Senate Confirmed by Senate Days Eric Holder Obama Jan. 20, 2009 Feb. 2, 2009 13 Michael Mukasey G.W. Bush Sept. 21, 2007 Nov. 8, 2007 17 Alberto Gonzales G.W. Bush Jan. 4, 2005 Feb. 3, 2005 30 John Ashcroft G.W. Bush Jan. 29, 2001 Feb. 1, 2001 3 Janet Reno Clinton Feb. 26, 1993 Mar. 11, 1993 13 William Barr G.H.W. Bush Oct. 25, 1991   Nov. 20, 1991 26 Richard Thornburgh Reagan July 25, 1988 Aug. 11, 1988   17 TOTAL 119   So the previous seven nominees waited a collective 119 days. How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated. Lynch’s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate. Then, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch’s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That’s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins. If you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama’s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article’s publication date). That’s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees. However, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama’s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama’s comments, and 103 by this article’s publication. That’s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it’s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May. Obama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long. Of the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Among the more notable waits: • Richard Cordray, nominated for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2011-13: 1+ years • Miguel Estrada, nominated for U.S. Circuit Court judgeship, 2003: 240 days • Richard Holbrooke, ambassador to the United Nations, 1999: 176 days  • Lewis L. Strauss, nominated for Commerce Secretary, 1959: 152 days • Robert Gates, nominated for CIA Director, 1991: 134 days • Robert Bork, nominated for Supreme Court, 1987: 108 days Of these, the only nominee for an official Cabinet position to wait longer than Lynch was Strauss, and that was more than half a century ago. So Lynch’s case is pretty unusual by historical standards. Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political scientist at George Washington University, sees the argument for starting the clock with the resubmission of Lynch’s nomination, but she added that focusing on that distinction misses the larger point. ""Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team,"" Binder said. ""Given Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials, why force her and the president to wait so long for a confirmation vote?"" Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist who has studied the Senate, agreed. ""There’s a little sleight of hand"" in Obama’s comment, ""but the overall message is that there’s been a lot of delay and that it’s historic in length."" And it’s not as if Republicans were powerless to resist even if the Democratic-controlled Senate had tried to act, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis. ""The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close,"" Smith said. Our ruling Obama said that Lynch’s nomination ""has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined."" Mathematically, Obama was correct if you start counting from Lynch’s initial nomination, but short by 19 days if you start counting from the resubmission of her nomination to the newly installed Republican-controlled Senate. Either way, it’s clear that Obama has a point that Lynch’s delay has been long by historical standards, especially for a Cabinet nominee. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097233940>],/factchecks/2015/apr/20/barack-obama/loretta-lynch-nomination-delayed-attorney-generals/

Hillary Clinton took money from the kings of four countries, GOP chief Reince Priebus says
","For probably as long as Democrats anticipated Hillary Clinton announcing for president, Republicans anticipated attacking her. On April 12, 2015, the day Clinton’s run became official, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus disparaged her on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" The former chairman of the Wisconsin GOP appeared on the program after U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who declared for president several days before Clinton did. Paul told host Bob Schieffer that Clinton will have a problem with women voters because ""she has taken money from countries that abuse the rights of women,"" and he referred to Saudi Arabia. Schieffer later noted that Saudi Arabia had given money to Clinton’s foundation, and then while interviewing Priebus, said Clinton couldn’t use that money personally. Schieffer added: ""But it also occurs to me, a lot of your candidates and the Democrats as well, are going to be taking campaign contributions that we are never going to know where they come from -- but now you can give these unbelievable amounts of money without any accounting of where the money comes from."" Priebus replied with a claim about kings and cash: ""But the difference is, all those other entities -- Super PACs, parties, individual candidates -- they can't take money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen, and that's what Hillary Clinton did. And so she's going to have to account for this money."" Priebus' statement goes beyond foreign government contributions to the Clinton Foundation, leaving the impression Clinton herself may have benefitted from money donated by the four countries -- including Yemen, which is the home of one of al-Qaida’s most active branches, and where the United States has conducted airstrikes since 2009. Let's sort it all out. Clinton Foundation  Not only Republicans are raising questions about whether the Clinton Foundation is taking millions of dollars a year from governments and other donors that want political influence. The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Politico and CBS News have run stories about the questions, with a Journal analysis noting that the number of governments contributing to the foundation in 2014 appeared to have doubled from the previous year. Responding to Priebus’ claim, the foundation emailed us a statement saying: ""Like other global charities, the Clinton Foundation receives support from individuals, organizations and governments from all over the world because the foundation's programs improve the lives of millions of people around the globe."" The charity, originally named the William J. Clinton Foundation, was launched in 2001 by former President Bill Clinton. Its aim is to partner with government and non-government organizations to tackle issues such as AIDS and poverty. The foundation has received millions of dollars from foreign governments, as PolitiFact National found in February 2015 when it rated that claim by a conservative group as True. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, under President Barack Obama, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. When she left the Cabinet post, in February 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising. Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board just before announcing her candidacy. And a few days later, the foundation announced it would modify its policies while she is a candidate for president, limiting which governments can give directly to the foundation. An important note: Candidates for office are prohibited by law from accepting campaign contributions from foreign governments, but foundations have no such restriction. Here’s what we know about the four countries cited by Priebus: Saudi Arabia The kingdom gave between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation between the time the foundation was created through 2014, and some portion of the funds was contributed in 2014, according to the foundation’s searchable database. (The database only reports ranges of the total amounts given and does not provide a breakdown by year, except that it notes which donors made a contribution in 2014.) According to a February 2015 news article by the Washington Post, Saudi Arabia was among some foreign governments that had been supporting the foundation before Clinton was appointed secretary of state, did not give while she was in office and then resumed giving. Saudi Arabia has long been regarded by the United States as a friend and a ""strong partner in regional security and counterterrorism efforts,"" according to the State Department. Oman The Sultanate of Oman gave the foundation between $1 million and $5 million through 2014, including contributions given in 2014, according to the foundation database. The U.S. and Oman have been parties to a military cooperation agreement since 1980. Oman ""plays an important role in helping the United States realize its regional stability goals"" in the Middle East, the State Department says. Morocco Four days before Clinton announced her run, Politico reported that the foundation was accepting at least $1 million from a Moroccan government-owned company to hold a high-profile conference in May 2015 in Marrakech with the king of Morocco. The article noted that in 2011, Clinton’s State Department had accused the Moroccan government of ""arbitrary arrests and corruption in all branches of government,"" but that when she announced the conference in September 2014, she praised Morocco as ""a vital hub for economic and cultural exchange."" The U.S. regards Morocco as a ""strong partner in counterterrorism efforts,"" according to the State Department. Yemen Neither the Post nor the Politico articles, which were cited to us by Priebus’ office, reported any donations to the foundation from Yemen. And a spokesman for the foundation told us the country has never been a donor. Yemen borders Saudi Arabia and Oman, but unlike those countries and Morocco, is not a monarchy. American drones have been conducting strikes in Yemen since 2009. On April 14, 2015, the al-Qaida terrorist group announced that one of its top spokesmen for its branch in Yemen had been killed the previous day by an American drone strike. Our rating Priebus said Clinton took ""money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen."" The monarchies of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman have contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Yemen, which does not have a king, has not. And although Priebus’ claim was made during a discussion of the foundation as well as contributions to political candidates, his phrasing could have left the impression that Clinton herself, rather than the foundation, received the money. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

No firm evidence on often-repeated claim about Court of Appeals
","The 2015 General Assembly session was expected to conclude by midnight April 2, and lawmakers were racing against the clock. Veteran state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta, was in the well of the chamber, lamenting that lawmakers were being asked on the fly to increase the size of the Georgia Court of Appeals by three judges -- or 25 percent. The one-year cost to taxpayers, with support staff, would be $1.5 million. ""I have grave concerns for how we’re doing this business of such great consequences at this late hour. It smacks of packing the court, and it’s not something we should be doing at 11:05 (p.m.) on sine die,"" he said. Fort was then asked a question that summed up the key point of supporters. ""Is it not true that Georgia’s Court of Appeals is the busiest intermediate court of appeals in the country and has been for a decade or more?"" Sen. Charlie Bethel, R-Dalton, asked in traditional legislative parlance. The plan to expand the Court of Appeals passed the state Senate late on the 40th and last day of the legislative session, 37-18, as an amendment to a House bill raising judges’ salaries. PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Bethel’s statement for two reasons: Legislators didn’t publicly vet the case for increasing the court from 12 to 15 judges; and the added costs fall to taxpayers. The Georgia Court of Appeals was created in 1906 and has jurisdiction over many types of appeals. Exceptions include murder, divorce, alimony, constitutional questions and election contests, all of which are heard by the state’s highest court, the Georgia Supreme Court. By its own calculations, the Court of Appeals’ caseload increased yearly for 20 years and peaked in 1995. New appeals have been relatively steady in recent years -- 3,260 in 2009, 3,212 in 2010, 3,312 in 2011, 3,464 in 2012, and 3,432 in 2013,  the last year for which data is available. So how is it that Georgia is thought to have the nation’s busiest intermediate court of appeals? Arguably the best case for the claim is an apparently unique provision in the Georgia Constitution. It mandates that the state’s two appellate courts -- the Georgia Supreme Court and the Georgia Court of Appeals -- rule on any appeal within two court terms, or in about eight months. Failure to meet that deadline means the prior court ruling in the case stands. Stephen E. Castlen, the clerk of the court of the Court of Appeals, said cases move through the court ""in rocket fashion as far as compared to courts of appeals around the country."" ""It’s intense,"" Castlen said. ""It’s a commonly held belief that we’re the busiest. You hear it talked about at conferences. Every book I’ve read or article will have a line in there somewhere that we’re one of the busiest courts in the country. I can’t imagine it’s not true."" William Raftery, an analyst with the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., said he has reviewed the constitutions of all states and, ""to my knowledge,"" concluded that only Georgia places a two-term deadline on its appeals courts. But the center steers clear of labels such as ""busiest"" court because apples-to-apples comparisons aren’t realistic given that not all state intermediate courts of appeals handle the same types of appeals, have the same volume of cases, have the same number of judges or handle cases in the same way. And even though Georgia is the only state with a constitutional requirement that cases be completed in two terms, other states, such as Maryland, have set case turnaround goals to ensure that appeals move quickly, the center’s data experts said. ""The national center would not say X is busier than Y for those reasons,"" Raftery said. Last year and this year, resolutions were introduced in the state Senate to have a study committee look at the Court of Appeals’ caseload and the possibility of creating three new judgeships. But that proposal became moot when, late last month, Gov. Nathan Deal sent word to House and Senate budget negotiators that there was an extra $45.8 million to spend and 15 items he’d like the money to target. One of those items would allow him to appoint three additional judges to the 12-member Court of Appeals. Judges on the court make about $166,000 a year. Claims about the court’s caseload have persisted since the 1990s. Bethel, an attorney and chairman of the Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor, told PolitiFact he’s been hearing about the Court of Appeals’ caseload and record as the nation’s busiest court since he was in law school in the late 1990s. He emailed us links to newspaper articles, a law review article and an online history of the court, all of which included claims along those lines. For instance, Court of Appeals Judge Herbert E. Phipps was quoted in The Albany Herald in May 2013 saying the court was the nation’s busiest based on caseload per capita. The court’s website doesn’t go quite that far. It says that during the 1990s, the Georgia Court of Appeals was, ""on the basis of the number of cases decided by each judge, one of the busiest appellate courts in the country."" An analysis, conducted by the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts in 1995, found that the court was the nation’s busiest in 1993 -- based on signed opinions per judge. The Georgia court, which had nine members then, averaged 278 signed opinions per judge that year, and California was second with 137 signed opinions per judge. We found other similar claims even on Wikipedia, but none that said the court is currently the  nation’s busiest and has been for a decade or more. Bethel told us he was surprised that there was any question about the court being the busiest. ""The judges say it. They don’t say they think it,"" he said. ""They say it definitely."" Our ruling. The Georgia Constitution is apparently unique in that it requires the state’s two appellate courts to handle appeals within two terms, or in about eight months. That undoubtedly requires the justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals to work swiftly. And it does a lot to boost the credibility of the often-repeated statement that the court is among the nation’s busiest. But experts say there is no absolute measure out there to compare the court’s workload to that of other courts. That’s a lot of missing context. For that reason, we rate the statement Half True",[<zip object at 0x0000028097236AC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/20/charlie-bethel/no-firm-evidence-often-repeated-claim-about-court-/

Herring says average woman loses $431,000 to pay gap over career
","Attorney General Mark Herring was among scores of Democrats across the nation who posted a message on April 14 in recognition of Equal Pay Day. ""According to U.S. Census data, by age 65, the average woman will have lost $431,000 throughout her working career as a result of the pay gap,"" Herring wrote on his Facebook page. We wondered if he’s right. A quick web search showed Herring’s words mirrored statements made by many liberal organizations and politicians since 2012 to quantify the pay disparity between women and men. Ellen Qualls, a senior political adviser to Herring, said the attorney general’s source was a 2012 White House blog headlined ""By the Numbers: $431,000."" The calculation is based on Census Bureau statistics on the median yearly earnings of males and females, 15 or older, who worked full time for at least 50 weeks. In 2010, the middle pay was $47,715 for males and $36,931 for females. The gap was $10,784. The next step is to multiply the gap by 40 -- representing the number of years one may have worked full time before reaching age 65. You come up with $431,360 and then round down. The lifetime disparity increases slightly if you use the most recent census figures. In 2013, median pay was $50,033 for men and $39,157 for women. The gap rose to $10,876 which, multiplied by 40 years, comes to $435,040. The question that intrigues experts is how much of the gap is attributable to sex discrimination. A 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh concluded that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other factors that are common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend to have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; and they take more time off than men for child-related reasons. The American Association for University Women issued a 2013 report that offered similar explanations, saying the pay gap is partly due to ""men’s and women’s choices, especially the choice of college major and the type of job pursued after graduation. For example, women are more likely than men to go into teaching, and this contributes to the pay gap because teachers tend to be paid less than other college graduates."" Pamela Coukos, a senior program advisor at the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, said in a July 2012 blog post that ""economists generally attribute about 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination -- making about 60 percent explained by differences between workers or their jobs."" The White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report this month citing 2007 research by two economists at Cornell University: Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn. They concluded that career choice and experience largely accounted for pay disparity. But 41 percent of the gap is unexplained, they concluded, opening up the possibility that some or all of it was caused by discrimination. Our ruling Herring wrote, ""According to U.S. Census data, by age 65, the average women will have lost $431,000 throughout her working career as a result of the pay gap."" The much-used figure accurately describes the disparity in the median earnings of men and women over a 40-year career. It’s widely accepted by economists that sexism plays a role in the gap, although, perhaps, not the lead part. We quibble, however, with the part of the statement saying the average woman will have ""lost"" that sum. It ignores the fact that many women chose to go into lower-paying fields than men and make other lifestyle decisions that affect their career earnings. On the whole, we rate Herring’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809710A180>],/factchecks/2015/apr/20/mark-herring/herring-says-average-woman-looses-431000-pay-gap-o/

Bernie Sanders says 99 percent of 'new' income is going to top 1 percent
","When U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., finds a microphone these days, you can expect him to harp on the erosion of the American middle class. Sanders, who has said he is considering a 2016 presidential run and caucuses with Democrats, made a striking point about the country’s income inequality over the last 40 years in an April 19 interview on Fox News Sunday. ""What we're seeing, Chris, right now is that for 40 years, the American middle class has been disappearing. Millions of people are working longer hours for lower wages despite a huge increase in technology and productivity,"" Sanders said. ""And what we have seen during that period is a massive transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of America — massive wealth and income inequality, where you have 99 percent of all new income today going to the top 1 percent."" With the financial rift between everyday and mega-rich Americans poised to dominate the 2016 White House race, PolitiFact wanted to examine Sanders’s statement about 99 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent. The research behind the claim Sanders used a similar line about the top 1 percent taking home 99 percent of all new income during a Brookings Institution speech a couple months ago, saying, ""In fact, the latest information that we have shows that in recent years, over 99 percent of all new income generated in the economy has gone to the top 1 percent."" The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded that claim One Pinocchio, a designation for claims that include in part a ""selective telling of the truth."" Sanders did not agree with the conclusion and doubled down on the accuracy of his claim in a displeased letter. Sanders’ office told us the senator was talking about pre-tax income growth from 2009-13 during his Fox interview. A Sanders spokesman highlighted a New York Times Upshot article in January by Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. Wolfers based his calculations on the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who uses pre-tax income reported on Internal Revenue Service filings in his studies of top incomes, including capital gains. Saez and French economist Thomas Piketty have written about the disparate recovery from the recession among America’s two big income classes for several years. Saez found most recently that the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12. Using Saez’s preliminary 2013 numbers, Wolfers stretched the window to account for an average of 2012-13 incomes (He used an average for those years because tax rates on top earners increased in 2013, prompting some to shift more income to 2012.). The takeaway? The average income for the richest 1 percent of Americans, excluding capital gains, rose from $871,100 in 2009 to $968,000 from 2012-13, he wrote. The 99 percent, on the other hand, experienced a drop in average incomes from $44,000 to $43,900, Wolfers said. The calculation excludes government benefits in the form of Social Security, welfare, tax credits, food stamps and so on. ""That is, so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent,"" Wolfers wrote for the New York Times post. Sanders spokesman Jeff Frank said his office double-checked the statistic with Wolfers, who double-checked his own work with Saez. Saez told PolitiFact that the key to understanding the statistic is knowing that it’s measuring pre-tax, pre-government benefit income. ""That's the key stat to think about how the market allocates incomes in the first place,"" Saez said. ""Anybody should be worried that the recovery from the Great Recession has been so skewed in terms of market incomes."" Other points to consider Other economists argue that the more comprehensive way to talk about income is by looking at earnings after taxes and how government alters the income picture. That measure is called net or disposable income. Under this measure, the income differences are not as badly skewed, Saez said. That’s because on one side, government programs are making life easier for low-income Americans through things such as Social Security, unemployment compensation, veterans’ benefits, food stamps, welfare, housing assistance, health subsidies, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, said Brookings Institution fellow Gary Burtless. At the same time, tax policy has become more progressive since 2009 through lower taxes for middle- and lower-income Americans and higher taxes for higher earners. The drawback with this analysis, however, is it does not reflect how people are ""sharing directly in the rewards of the market,"" said Urban Institute fellow Eugene Steuerle, who has written about the different definitions of income. For Steuerle, all of the numbers matter, though each one holds a different meaning depending on the policy question. Steuerle is a fan of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, which he said offers a more comprehensive look at the income gap by including labor, business, capital and retirement income. Another way to think of it is comparing living standards. In November 2014, CBO released a study of household income taxes, which compared income growth after taxes since 1977. The problem is it only goes up to 2011, so we cannot compare it to the 2009-13 market measure. Other researchers have probed inequality in income growth over other time periods (a couple detailed here), but they do not apply to Sanders’s recovery timeframe. ""Is there a lot of inequality in living standards after tax and transfers? The right data to answer that question is simply unavailable for recent years,"" Wolfers said. Often, income inequality measures do not account for health care, the costs of which are often employer-paid and can level the playing field between low- and middle-income earners and the super rich, Steuerle said. Another point to keep in mind: The country’s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession — a point that Sanders’s claim does not account for because it picks up with the recovery, Burtless said. To Burtless, Sanders’s estimate is correct in the narrow way he meant it but would be overstated under a broader income definition that extends pre-2009. Our ruling Sanders said that ""99 percent of all new income (is) going to the top 1 percent."" Sanders is referring to pre-tax, pre-transfer income growth during the economic recovery from 2009-13. We found consensus among economists that the statistic and calculation offered by Sanders is credible, but it’s just not the only way to consider income inequality. Other measures may be equally valid and produce different results. But economists say specific data does not yet exist. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional notes of context. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFCB44C0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/19/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-99-percent-new-income-going-to/
