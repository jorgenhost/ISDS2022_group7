Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits or pay
","
In an interview with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory zeroed in on the issue at the heart of the union showdown.

""What's so wrong with...collective bargaining?"" Gregory asked.

Walker began with a comparison to federal employees.

""Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today,"" Walker said. ""Under Barack Obama, he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has.""

Whether Walker's proposal is less restrictive than what the federal government has today is a matter of opinion (and we'll explain why later), but we were curious whether Walker's was correct that most of the roughly 2.8 million federal workers do not have collective bargaining rights to negotiate pay and health or pension benefits.

We turned first to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) which represents 600,000 federal government workers in 65 agencies, including the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Social Security, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is the largest federal employee union.

It's true, said Beth Moten, legislative and political director for AFGE, that most federal employees don't have collective bargaining rights over pay and benefits.

""So what's the point?"" Moten asked. ""Should employees in Wisconsin be treated as badly as federal employees are?""

There are some exceptions to this rule. Air traffic controllers, for example, can bargain over wages under a 1996 law that granted full bargaining rights to a number of federal workers covered under the Federal Aviation Administration, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor expert at Cornell University.

Some also point to the U.S. Postal Service, which has nearly 600,000 career employees, most (but not all) of whom have collective bargaining rights for pay and benefits. But theirs is a somewhat different situation. Although the U.S. Postal Service reports to Congress, it is an independent agency of the United States government. Unlike the private sector, explained U.S. Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders, postal employees cannot strike, nor can management lock them out.

Walker said ""most"" federal employees. And by that measure, he is correct, Bronfenbrenner said.

""Unlike all the other state, county and municipal workers in the country who have collective bargaining rights, federal workers have their pay and benefits set by Congress,"" Brofenbrenner said. ""But federal workers can bargain over terms and conditions of employment besides pay and benefits.  

""This has not created stable labor relations in the public sector by any means,"" she said. ""Instead it has meant that senators and congressional representatives with large numbers of federal employees in their districts end up fighting to have money put into bills for federal workers in their districts the same as if they were lobbying to get money for a large federal contract. Thus, instead of being done in the very open transparent process of state and local public sector bargaining it is all done at a higher level, mostly behind closed doors, but the money still is getting there, just not as equitably as it would if there were collective bargaining.""

Moten, of the American Federation of Government Employees, also stressed that federal employees do have collective bargaining rights over working conditions. And that's an important right. It affects vacation time, work hours, safety issues -- all sorts of things important to workers.

Under Gov. Walker's plan, collective bargaining for state workers would be limited to base pay rate (and raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation).

In a fact-check our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin did regarding limiting labor negotiations to only wages, they quoted Candice Owley, president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, who said wages are only part of what’s important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals.

""We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions,"" she said, such as seniority, schedules, the length of shifts, and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department.

Said Owley: ""We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable.""

Bottom line, negotiations over working conditions are important, and so Walker's larger point -- that he is asking for  ""something less restrictive than what the federal government has"" -- is debatable. But in saying that most federal workers don't have collective bargaining rights to benefits and pay, though, Walker is accurate. Although there are some federal workers who have collective bargaining rights for benefits and pay, ""most"" do not. And so we rate his comment True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/02/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-most-federal-emplo/

Tim Kaine says the economy has added private sector jobs 12 months in a row
","
Amid cheers of ""Run, Tim, run,"" former Gov. Tim Kaine was the star attraction at the Virginia Democratic Party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner Feb. 19.

With fellow Democrat Jim Webb’s announcement that he will not seek a second term in the U.S. Senate next year, Kaine is under intense pressure to run for the seat. He tossed the hungry crowd  slabs of red meat by criticizing the Republican Party’s economic record.

Kaine, now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the economy has performed better under President Barack Obama than it had under his predecessor, George W. Bush.

""Two years into a Democratic administration gross domestic product is not shrinking; it is growing again,"" he said. ""We’ve now gained private sector jobs 12 months in a row.""

With the U.S. unemployment rate at 9 percent and millions still out of work from the recession, we wondered if this jobs claim is true.

Private sector jobs cover workers not employed by the federal government, a state, city or county. Of the roughly 130 million Americans who currently hold jobs counted by BLS, about 83 percent of them, or 107.8 million, worked in the private sector last month.

There are two sources for job data. One is the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases information on job creation and the unemployment rate each month. The second source is Automatic Data Processing, a business outsourcing company that conducts a wide-ranging, monthly employment survey of private businesses.

According to BLS, private payrolls climbed by 144,000 people during March 2010 and have risen every month since then, meaning they have increased for 11 straight months. In January, the most recent month for which data are available, private payrolls added 50,000 jobs, according to preliminary estimates.

It’s worth noting that total payrolls, which include government jobs as well as private ones, have been on a roller coaster during the past year. Total payrolls posted big gains in March, April and May of 2010, helped by the hiring of short-term Census Bureau workers. But as those short-term jobs ended during the summer and fall, total payrolls slumped, falling each month from June through September. State and local budget cuts also meant fewer government jobs.

Since October, total payrolls have been on the climb.

What about the data from ADP, which focuses solely on private-sector jobs? Data show slow job growth began in March 2010 and continued until September, when 2,000 private jobs were lost. Growth resumed in October and has lasted four straight months.

In 2009, the private sector lost about 5 million jobs, and during the first quarter, the economy was shedding more than 700,000 jobs every month. Now it is gaining 700,000 jobs over the course of six to eight months. That suggests we face a long road to full recovery.

William Johnson, a labor economist at the University of Virginia, said this recession and the dot-com recession in 2000 were different from past slumps. In previous downturns, he said, output declined more than payrolls ebbed. Companies, in effect, kept more employees than were strictly necessary because they wanted to retain their skills for better times ahead.

That paradigm shifted in 2000 and 2008, Johnson said. Companies cut employees faster than they reduced production, asking the remaining staff to work harder and pick up the slack.

""It’s a new pattern, and nobody has really been able to explain it,"" Johnson said. ""Some people say it is the health care law introducing uncertainty about the cost of hiring new employees, but it also happened in 2000 when there was no health care bill.""

Top officials at the Federal Reserve have projected that the national unemployment rate will remain at or slightly below 9 percent for the rest of 2011 and stay above 7 percent into 2013. The national unemployment rate was roughly 5 percent before the recession began in 2008.

Let’s review. The official government source on employment says private sector job growth has occurred in each of the last 11 months. ADP, another nationally respected source on job growth, says private payrolls grew in 10 of the last 11 months and fell by just 2,000 jobs in the one month where a decline was reported.

Speaking as an advocate of the president and his party’s policies, Kaine presented private sector job growth in the best possible light. But it is important to remember that the economy has recovered just 20 percent of the private sector jobs lost in 2009.

Kaine said private sector jobs have been created for ""12 months in a row."" He was close, but missed the bull’s eye. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/02/tim-kaine/weve-now-gained-private-sector-jobs-12-months-row/
"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Liberal Blogger']","
Liberal blogger says abortion bill could affect women who miscarrry
","
Republican state Rep. Bobby Franklin has made a hobby out of triggering liberal ire. And yes, he’s done it again.

The Marietta legislator’s House Bill 1 rejects the authority of landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade. It bans abortion and labels it ""prenatal murder,"" a crime punishable by life in prison or death.

But that’s not what had bloggers at left-leaning publications seething. It’s that they think the bill could allow prosecutors to charge mothers who miscarry with a crime.

Jen Phillips, a staffer with liberal magazine Mother Jones, wrote the bill ""showed an astonishing lack of concern for women’s health and well-being.""

""Under Rep. Franklin’s bill, HB 1, women who miscarry could become felons if they cannot prove that there was ‘no human involvement whatsoever in the causation’ of their miscarriage,"" she wrote.

Women who miscarry could be charged as felons? Is that true?

Franklin has sponsored similar anti-abortion bills without success. This one doesn’t have much steam behind it, either. But given how this claim took off in the blogosphere, we thought it was worth a look.

We called Phillips, who pointed us to a portion of the bill that defines ""prenatal murder.""

""Such a term does not include a naturally occurring expulsion of a fetus known medically as a ‘spontaneous abortion’ and popularly as a ‘miscarriage’ so long as there is no human involvement whatsoever in the causation of such event,"" the bill states.

The problem is the phrase ""no human involvement"" is so broad and the causes of miscarriage can be so complex and difficult to understand that any woman whose actions can be viewed as playing a role in her miscarriage could be prosecuted, Phillips argued.  

This could be a problem. Other critics we interviewed said that under this language, a woman who miscarried could be prosecuted for choosing cancer treatment, taking illegal drugs, or falling off a bicycle while pregnant. All of those situations require some ""human involvement.""

Franklin said these objections have absolutely no merit.

""[T]hose criticisms are mere smoke screens since as you know the bill does not specifically call for … those things,"" Franklin wrote in an e-mail.  

Abortion rights advocates agreed that Franklin’s legislation could criminalize miscarriage. A spokeswoman for anti-abortion group Georgia Right to Life said they have not analyzed the bill.

Franklin is right that the bill does not specify that women can be prosecuted under the scenarios that critics raised. However, laws can have unexpected consequences. We therefore took a closer look at Georgia law.

An existing state statute on ""feticide,"" or the destruction of a fetus in the uterus, generally bars women from being prosecuted in the death of her fetus. Frankin’s bill does not repeal this law.

But there’s an exception under Georgia’s ""feticide by vehicle"" statute. In a 2010 Douglasville case, a pregnant driver fled from police, leading them on a chase.

The driver crashed. Her baby was delivered by emergency C-section but did not survive.

Prosecutors charged the pregnant driver. While Georgia’s ""feticide by vehicle"" statute does not mandate mothers be charged when they cause crashes leading to the death of their own fetuses, it does not prohibit it.

Research shows that nationally, women have been prosecuted for conduct affecting their fetuses, even when the law does not expressly provide for it, said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which fights anti-abortion laws.

Paltrow gave us examples, which we confirmed.

For instance, in a 2008 South Carolina case, a woman faced homicide charges after attempting suicide while eight months pregnant, killing the fetus. A 1997 state Supreme Court ruling decided that a fetus is considered a child if it is viable, or able to live outside the uterus. This means pregnant women can be prosecuted under state child abuse statutes.

In Missouri, the law bars prosecuting a woman for ""indirectly harming her unborn child by failing to properly care for herself or by failing to follow any particular program of prenatal care,"" but mothers have been charged with child abuse and convicted of involuntary manslaughter for substance abuse while pregnant, news accounts show.  

Since HB 1 does not repeal existing Georgia feticide law, it’s possible to argue its passage might not lead to the prosecution of women in the death of their fetuses. A judge might decide the earlier feticide law prevents it. However, such a ruling is no sure thing.

In conclusion:

Critics of Franklin’s bill say that the ""human involvement"" language is so vague that women could be prosecuted for miscarriages, and we agree with them.

While the law does not explicitly allow for miscarriage prosecutions, and Franklin said this is not his intent, the language is so broad it does open the door for women to face felony charges if they abuse drugs, fall off a bicycle, fail to wear a seat belt, or opt for cancer treatment while pregnant.

Women in Georgia and across the nation have previously been prosecuted for actions investigators think adversely affected their fetuses, even if the law does not specifically call for them to do so.  

However, women who miscarry might not be handled as felons. It depends on how prosecutors and judges decide to handle the law.

The statement could use a little more context. We therefore rule Phillips’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/02/liberal-blogger/liberal-blogger-says-abotion-bill-could-affect-mis/

Chain e-mail on Gabrielle Giffords treats satire as truth
","
A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail with a rather striking claim about Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who is recovering from a brain injury after an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011.

A version of it has been posted on a variety of blog sites, including this one. Here are excerpts:

""I had no idea that this Congresswoman was such a nut case.

""It was a tragedy that 19 people were shot and six died. As a result Giffords will be held out as a saint, when in fact, she is an idiot , a left wing ‘enviro-nut’ who should not be in Congress. The media only cares about her because she is a Democrat. Had she been a Republican, like the federal judge who was killed, she would have been off the front page the next day, as he has been.

""I had forgotten she was the Congresswoman that was involved in the following exchange with General Petraeus:

""Poster-child for what is wrong in Washington, DC Our Arizona 8th District US Congressional representative, the Hon. Gabrielle Giffords, in a meeting of the House Armed Services Committee, asked General David Petraeus the following question: ‘General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?’ Wow. I had to read, and re-read this several times to believe it. ...

""What Google says about Rep. Giffords: Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’ ‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’ Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I'm just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’

""She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’""

We found it hard to believe that a member of Congress would actually say that the Army should ""put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output."" So we set out to find the source.

Our friends at Snopes.com provided the first clue, noting in a post from July 28, 2010 -- six months before the Tucson shooting -- that a false e-mail had been circulating about Giffords’ alleged questioning of Petraeus.

Snopes.com explained that on June 16, 2010, Petraeus had testified before the House Armed Services Committee and that one of the lawmakers who questioned him was Giffords. She did indeed ask a question that combined elements of environmental and military policy, but the line of inquiry was rather different than what the e-mail suggested.

""There's been a lot of attention back here in the United States on what's happening with the BP oil spill,"" Giffords said at the hearing. ""And as we all know, the largest user of energy on the planet is actually the United States Air Force, and the (Department of Defense) is the largest user of energy in the United States. And I really want to commend the work done on behalf of DOD, and also what's happening in the field with our energy, but it's an area that I just really want to focus on.

""And I know a lot of questions have been asked, but during the last three years, supply lines have increasingly threatened -- have been threatened, either by enemy action or through international places. And in places like Kandahar, where we have a large presence, we have been plugged in to a very unsustainable and really an incapable grid system.

""We know that a major part of the upcoming Kandahar offensive will include some serious repairs and upgrades to the energy system which include small-scale solar and hydropower systems, and also some solar-powered streetlights. I'm just curious whether or not there's plans to utilize any of those same technologies at our bases around Afghanistan, and wouldn't that greatly reduce our need for fuel?""

In other words, Giffords did not ask, ""General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?"" -- as the e-mail indicated -- but rather asked him whether the use of alternative energy sources could provide a more reliable and more secure power source for troops located in a faraway, unstable theater of operations, potentially relieving soldiers from having to defend vulnerable supply chains required to move conventional forms of energy.

And that’s where the e-mail checked by Snopes.com ended. The version we received added new claims, including the parts about battlefield environmental impact statements and about Giffords urging American forces to club, rather than shoot, enemy forces.

These comments were also absent from the transcript of the June 16, 2010, hearing. 
But we were able to track down the source: a July 17, 2010, post at the Arizona Conservative blog that was clearly labeled ""Semi-News — A Satirical Look at Recent News.""

Here’s the entire satirical post:

""Army’s ‘Carbon Footprint’ Taints War Effort

""Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’

""‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’

""Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I’m just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’

""She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’""

In other words, the chain e-mailer cut and pasted the satirical post -- but, whether intentionally or accidentally, left out the crucial label ""satirical.""

We reached out to two people who have posted or forwarded the item but did not hear back.

So where does this leave us? In the hearing, Giffords did indeed raise an issue involving alternative energy with Petraeus, but it was not to express a concern that the military should ""reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror"" -- rather, it was to improve energy reliability and security for American forces on the ground. And the claims that Giffords urged American forces to club, rather than shoot, the enemy in order to reduce carbon emissions were pure satire but not labeled as such by the chain e-mailer. All told, the claims in the chain e-mail are ridiculous. So we rate this chain e-mail Pants on Fire! 
UPDATE: Shortly after we posted the story, the man who wrote the satirical post in July 2010 returned our e-mail. ""I have been writing about 300 satirical pieces a year since 2005,"" said John Semmens. ""Only once did I directly see one passed around as real news."" Semmens said he has been contacted by journalists about a half dozen times over six years, so seeing one of his pieces circulate in this way strikes him as ""a relatively unusual event.""",/factchecks/2011/mar/01/chain-email/chain-e-mail-gabrielle-giffords-treats-satire-trut/

Gov. Rick Scott raps Tri-Rail while rejecting high-speed rail funding
","
It's become Florida Gov. Rick Scott's version of a campfire ghost story: Stay away from high-speed rail, or you'll wind up with a huge money suck on your hands.

Just like Tri-Rail in South Florida.

Scott has repeatedly tried to draw parallels between the two rail systems, saying the 71-mile commuter train now running through Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties is hardly covering its costs. So why would the Orlando to Tampa system? Scott again drilled home the point during a national TV appearance on Feb. 27, 2011, when he was asked to explain his decision to reject $2.4 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail line.

""What I have said all along is our taxpayers aren't going to take the risk of the cost overrun in building it. It could be $3 billion ...,"" Scott told CNN's Candy Crowley. ""We already have a train that goes from Palm Beach to Miami. Only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by the fares.""

While legislators and the Florida Department of Transportation said private contractors would be required to pay for any high-speed rail construction cost overruns, Scott halted the project before it went out for bid. So we can't really check that part of his statement.

But we can examine his comparison to the Tri-Rail system.

The numbers for Tri-Rail 
The Tri-Rail system started operating in 1989 as a temporary way to alleviate traffic congestion that was expected to be created by a massive road-widening project on Interstate 95. But the state Legislature decided to keep the system alive permanently through a funding agreement between the state and Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The federal government also helps fund the rail line through the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration.

A total of 3.6 million riders used Tri-Rail in fiscal year 2010, down from 4.2 million riders in FY 2009.

Scott described his problems with Tri-Rail in more detail during a Feb. 21 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, and suggested its story acts as a warning for people considering the high-speed rail proposal. ""Let's all remember. We have Tri-Rail right now. Tri-Rail costs us $64 million to operate. The fares only cover $10 million of it,"" he said. ""The state's funding almost $35 million of that. So I'm not going to put our state taxpayers in a similar position."" The fuller context of Scott's thoughts on Tri-Rail better explain his comment to CNN that only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by fares -- fares of about $10 million divided into a $64 million operating budget.

We reached out to the governor's office to ask them about their figures, but we did not get a response.

So we turned to the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees Tri-Rail.

According to the authority's certified financial reports, Tri-Rail took in about $10.3 million in operating revenues in fiscal year 2010 -- an increase of $3 million since 2007. That's the good news.

The bad? Operating expenses totaled $54.5 million in FY 2010, according to the financial reports. Bonnie Arnold, a spokeswoman for the authority, confirmed the figures in the report. She said the authority also received $10 million in federal money for preventative maintenance, which might be how Scott arrived at his $64 million figure. That's in addition to the normal operating subsidies provided by the federal government.

The financial report concluded that rider fares covered between one-fourth and one-fifth of Tri-Rail's operating costs in 2010 (23 percent, see Page 63 of the report), up from 22 percent in 2009 and 19 percent in 2008. The rest of the money comes in the form of subsidies from the state, the counties and the federal government.

The report reveals that Scott is a little off by saying one-sixth, which is the equivalent of about 17 percent.

But the more important question is whether Tri-Rail's failures at the fare box really are evidence that high-speed rail won't work as it's proposed? Are the two rail lines enough alike for comparison?

That's where this claim gets off track.

A subsidy surprise? 
Governments and transportation experts walked into the Tri-Rail project with their eyes wide open. They knew the project would be subsidized by taxpayers. The question was just how much.

The legislation that created the Tri-Rail line required the commuter system to recoup 60 percent of its operating costs. That number, however, was quickly panned as unrealistic. ""Almost no one can recover that,"" then Tri-Rail executive director William Howard told the South Florida Business Journal in 1988, before the system was even operating. The pessimism was shared by George Sirianni, a public transportation specialist with the Florida Department of Transportation. Sixty percent is ""really high,"" he said. ""The national average for public transportation systems is only about 20 to 30 percent."" 
In 1992, the state formally amended its requirement, saying that Tri-Rail needed to recoup 25 percent of its costs, according to the Miami Herald. 
That's about the what the system now pays for, though it's not what was initially anticipated by the Legislature. 
Compare that to the Tampa-Orlando line, where experts say there will be no public government subsidy. 
The most recent available ridership studies for the Tampa-Orlando line predict about 2.4 million riders in the system's first year, enough to cover the operational expenses of the system. In rejecting federal funding, Scott said he was briefed on a new ridership study that concluded the system would have 3.07 million riders annually. We're assuming the new study concludes that passengers will cover the costs to operate the high-speed rail line. (We can't say for certain because the state has yet to make that study available, and in fact, has taken down the official web site discussing the high-speed rail project.) 
So to recap, Tri-Rail was created with the idea it would be subsidized; high-speed rail is being proposed as a system that won't need government support. 
But that's not the only difference. 
The Tampa-Orlando line would have five stops over 84 miles of track, with trains reaching speeds up to 168 mph. A trip between Tampa and the Orlando International Airport would take 55 minutes, according to estimates. Tri-Rail, meanwhile, has 18 stops over 71 miles and it takes one hour, 55 minutes to travel from one end of the route to the other. 
Rob Gregg, director of transit management and innovation at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research, said high-speed rail is like an interstate while commuter rail is like a parkway. 
The clienteles, and costs, would be different, too, said Stephen L. Reich, another USF transportation expert. 
Tri-Rail is mainly intended to serve people coming to and from work, while more than one-third of projected passengers on the high-speed line would be tourists traveling from Orlando International Airport to Disney World. 
A one-way ticket on the high-speed rail would cost an estimated $15 to $30, depending on how far a rider travels. On Tri-Rail, commuters can purchase an unlimited monthly pass for $100 and a roundtrip ticket cost between $4.40 and $11.50. 
""The high-speed rail and Tri-Rail systems are different in technology, application and target markets,"" Gregg said. ""Tri-Rail is targeting commuters/workers during peak congestion periods. The high-speed rail corridor surely targets tourists as well as business/commuter trips.

""What should be reflected upon is the larger context of investing/subsidizing such systems relative to the entire transportation system (roads, transit, airports, etc.) and economic viability to the region (generating jobs, products, services and thus revenues),"" Gregg said. ""Disney, a profit-motivated business, 'subsidizes' its comprehensive transportation system (trams, buses, monorail, Cruise Coaches) as a part of its entire financial model."" 
Look at the side-by-side of the two projects. In Tri-Rail's case, subsidies were always anticipated, but high-speed rail is projected to cover its own costs through ticket fares. Riders of Tri-Rail use the system to commute to work in South Florida, while Central Florida's high-speed rail will be used for more leisure and tourist travel. The ticket prices, train speeds and time schedules are all projected to be be dramatically different. 
The costs and benefits of Tri-Rail are simply not the same as the high-speed rail, and expecting them to operate the same way is misguided.  
Subsidies dog more than just rail projects 
Most of the talk here is about subsidies. Scott is right that they are typical for rail systems. 
But they also are typical for most every other form of transportation system. We did some research.

In Jacksonville, the local bus service covers around only 20 percent of its costs through rider fares. The majority of its money comes from government -- the biggest chunk from the city of Jacksonville. In Pinellas County, riders are only paying for about 23 percent of the cost of the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority bus system, said spokesman Bob Lasher. Property tax collections are keeping that system running.

Highways, too, rely on more than just fees paid by users through tolls or gas taxes. According to an analysis by the Pew Charitable Trust, only half of the federal money set aside in 2007 for highway construction and maintenance was generated by user fees. That's down from 10 years earlier when user fees made up 61 percent of total spending on roads, Pew found. 
Scott has asked that the $2.4 billion he is rejecting for rail be used in the state for port and highway projects. The federal government has said the money will be used for rail. 
Robert Puentes, senior fellow and director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the comparison between Tri-Rail and high-speed rail is like comparing apples to oranges. 
""If comparing different types of rail, you would also have to look at highway travel and the enormous subsidies there to be fair,"" Puentes said. 
Our ruling

If Scott were on a crusade to end public subsidies for all forms of transportation, that would be one thing. Transportation systems -- including roads, buses, ports and trains -- more than not require government help.

But Scott is trying to isolate the problem to trains when citing Tri-Rail's revenue problems as a reason for nixing high-speed rail in Central Florida. It may be a convenient talking point, but the two systems are hardly alike. In the end, high-speed fail might fail and the projections for ridership might be too rosy. But people shouldn't use Tri-Rail as evidence any more than they should cite any other form of mass transit. We rate this claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-raps-tri-rail-while-rejecting/

State Sen. Tom Niehaus accuses protesters of defecating in Statehouse
","
The lasting image thus far surrounding the controversy over Senate Bill 5, a proposal to restrict collective bargaining rights for organized labor, occurred on Feb. 22 when more than 5,000 union workers staged a raucous protest rally with colorful signs and bullhorns outside of the Ohio Statehouse.

The protesters’ target was Republican Gov. John Kasich and the GOP-controlled Senate that is pushing the bill. Even Republican Senate President Tom Niehaus the next day grudgingly expressed admiration for the groups’ ability to coordinate so well and make themselves part of the lawmaking process.

But right after comments praising the protesters, Niehaus veered in a totally different direction, painting a different lasting image of the protesters at the Statehouse — one not quite so becoming.

""Unfortunately, we have documented instances where people defecated in the building. We have documented instances where they have written on the walls,"" Niehaus said. ""This is the people’s house. I used to say treat it like it’s yours. Well, I don’t want it to be like it’s theirs if that’s the way they treat their own home.""

Some union groups responded immediately, denying that a group featuring police officers, firefighters, teachers, nurses and others unionized workers would commit such vile acts in the storied building.

So, what gives?

It is clear that Kasich and Statehouse Republicans are frustrated by being upstaged by protesters over SB 5 (Thousands more were expected to rally at the Statehouse on Tuesday, March 1). But PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether Niehaus’ accusation would hold up on the Truth-O-Meter. Did protesters really defecate in the Statehouse?

We asked Niehaus’ staff about the ""documented instances"" and were told that several were reported to the senator and that he confirmed them with Statehouse management. That management is handled by the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board.

We called the CSRAB, the curators of the Statehouse, for an accounting of any incidents in the building during the protest.

""There was defecation in the stairwell to the parking garage,"" said CSRAB spokesman Gregg Dodd, but not inside the Statehouse. Furthermore, there is no proof it was left by protesters, and Dodd expressed his doubt. He noted that CSRAB has dealt with this issue before when there are no demonstrations taking place at the Statehouse.

""Unfortunately it happens from time to time even when there are no events going on, and we think it is either a homeless person or persons, or someone waiting for the bus stop,"" Dodd said, explaining that this particular stairwell leads up to the street level where there are stops for the Columbus bus system.

The top of the stairwell, at the street level, is enclosed by a small, heated shelter house. There are two of these shelters around the Statehouse.

They are used by homeless people to congregate and sleep at night. The area is also along a stretch that is a main transfer area for the city’s transit system. Scores of people gather at various times of the day waiting for buses.

""So, there is no way to determine if that was in fact someone associated with the rally,"" Dodd said regarding the human waste left behind in the stairwell.

We’ll give Niehaus a small nod for being right about the writing on the walls. Dodd said there was some writing on the walls inside the Statehouse, but he also noted it was with chalk and was easily cleaned up by the Statehouse maintenance crew. There were also some union stickers stuck to Statehouse floors that needed to be scraped up.

But Niehaus’ key accusation dealt with defecation..

In the context of his statement, he clearly was suggesting that protesters soiled the floor, and that it happened inside the Statehouse.

As Senate president, Niehaus is one of the most influential people in the state government and when he speaks people listen. Yet this claim is beyond inaccurate. It’s a ridiculous assertion that is unsupported by the people who actually take care of the Statehouse.

Statements that are both inaccurate and ridiculous get a special rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Pants on Fire.

"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Eddie Lucio, Jr.']","
 State Sen. Eddie Lucio said a miscarriage is considered an abortion
","
State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., among supporters of a proposal requiring women seeking an abortion to first get a sonogram, made a dramatic statement in the floor debate before senators advanced the measure to the House. 
""There are literally millions of abortions going on each year in our own state,"" the Brownsville Democrat said Feb. 17, adding that he would ""like to see the definition of abortion really be looked at. A miscarriage is considered an abortion, and I don’t think it should be considered an abortion because that’s a natural thing that unfortunately happens."" 
After we sought more information from Lucio’s office, Lucio spoke again in the debate, saying: ""A while ago I was speaking with numbers, I misspoke with my numbers."" 
For other articles, we’ve confirmed that there have been about 50 million abortions nationally since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling and that 80,000 abortions took place Texas in 2008. 
As we started to check Lucio’s other floor statement — that a miscarriage is considered an abortion — Lucio told us in an e-mail statement that friends who lost a baby and underwent a procedure to remove the fetus from the womb told him their insurance company considered the  procedure an abortion. He said he didn’t intend to suggest that a miscarriage in itself should be considered an abortion. ""I have strong beliefs about life,"" Lucio said. ""In an effort to articulate my beliefs... I misspoke."" 
We sought independent guidance on whether a miscarriage is considered an abortion. 
Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us miscarriages are sometimes referred to as ""spontaneous abortions,"" though she said that the agency doesn’t include them in its annual abortion counts. 
No law requires the agency to track miscarriages, Williams said. ""Unfortunately miscarriages are very common and often happen before a woman even knows she’s pregnant making complete and accurate data collection very difficult,"" she said. 
She cited the legal definition of abortion in Texas. According to the Texas Health and Safety Code, an abortion is ""an act or procedure performed after pregnancy has been medically verified and with the intent to cause the termination of a pregnancy other than for the purpose of either the birth of a live fetus or removing a dead fetus."" 
According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, 66 percent of 6.4 million pregnancies in 2008 resulted in live births and 19 percent ended in abortions. In Texas, 70 percent of 579,700 pregnancies were live births and 15 percent ended in abortions. An estimated 15 percent of pregnancies result in miscarriages, according to the institute. 
Rebecca Wind, an institute spokeswoman, told us that while ""spontaneous abortion"" is the medical term for an abortion, miscarriages aren’t included in abortion statistics and there is no national effort to track miscarriages. ""In many cases, women who have miscarriages may not know they have had them,"" Wind said, because one can happen early in a pregnancy. 
Next, we contacted the Texas Medical Association, which represents 45,000 physicians and medical students. Spokeswoman Pam Udall confirmed that doctors usually call a miscarriage a spontaneous abortion because ""the body itself is aborting the pregnancy,"" she said. ""It is a natural consequence that affects up to one in four pregnancies."" 
Udall pointed us to a 2002 pamphlet written by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says ""the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks is called early pregnancy loss. Often the loss is a miscarriage (sometimes called spontaneous abortion by doctors)."" 
Where does that leave us? 
There’s truth in Lucio’s statement: In medical terms, a miscarriage is also termed a spontaneous abortion. Where the senator got off track was in conflating those natural occurrences with elective abortions — medical procedures that terminate a pregnancy. 
We rate his statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/01/eddie-lucio-jr/state-sen-eddie-lucio-said-miscarriage-considered-/

Bill O'Reilly says unemployment is lower in 'right-to-work' states
","On the Feb. 24, 2011, edition of Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly said that the jobs picture is better in ""right to work"" states -- that is, states in which workers can refuse to pay dues or fees to the union that represents them in bargaining.

""The right-to-work states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do,"" O’Reilly said while interviewing Caroline Heldman, a political scientist at Occidental College.

We thought we’d check to see whether O’Reilly is correct.

First, some background. According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, 22 states have passed some form of right-to-work law (the exact provisions can vary) -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. The other 28 states do not have such laws.

To test O’Reilly’s claim, we turned to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which is the official source for unemployment statistics in the United States. BLS’ most recent state-by state data is for December 2010.

We consulted with Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, about the fairest way to look at the data. We agreed that it was best to compare right-to-work and non-right-to-work states through data weighted according to state population. That way, California’s unemployment rate would be given more weight than, say, Wyoming’s.

When we did the math, we found that the unemployment rate in the 22 right-to-work states was 9.17 percent, compared to 9.65 in the 28 non-right-to-work states. (The national unemployment rate that month was 9.4 percent that month -- right in the middle.) So O’Reilly is basically correct.

His only shortcoming was his use of the phrase ""much lower level of unemployment."" The difference for December 2010 was only about half a percentage point, which is fairly modest, given that the range of state unemployment figures stretched from 3.8 in North Dakota to 14.5 in Nevada.

As always, there’s a question about causation -- that is, whether right-to-work status actually produces low unemployment. Of the 11 states with the lowest unemployment (there was a tie for 10th place) eight were right-to-work states. Of those, seven states -- North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma -- are from the Great Plains and the Mountain West, which have in general been less hard-hit during the recent recession.

To see whether today is an unusual situation, we asked the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation whether they had historical data on the unemployment gap. They said they did not. James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that numbers he’s run suggest that in 2008, before the worst of the recession set in, the gap was slightly larger -- about eight-tenths of a percentage point  -- but was in the same general ballpark.

In any case, none of the economists we spoke to thought the gap was especially surprising, either now or historically.

So where does that leave us in terms of O’Reilly’s claim? He said that ""right-to-work states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do."" To say it’s ""much lower"" is a stretch, but he's right that it is lower. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-unemployment-lower-right-work-st/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says Barack Obama promised stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen doesn’t like President Barack Obama’s economic record or the stimulus bill.

""Two years ago today, President Obama signed into law a $800 billion jobless stimulus bill that promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent,"" said Allen in a Feb. 17 statement. ""Instead the American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9 percent or higher unemployment, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, and our nation’s debt has hit a record-setting $14 trillion.""

On Monday we checked Allen’s claims about unemployment and job losses, rating them True. This piece examines his assertion that the stimulus ""promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent.""

Allen, a former governor and U.S. senator, is not the only Republican peddling the claim. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and conservative pundit George Will have made similar statements. So did Virginia’s Eric Cantor, now House Majority Leader, back in July 2009.

PolitiFact has ruled that they had their facts wrong. Allen’s are wrong, too.  

Obama warned upon taking office that if ""dramatic action"" were not taken, ""the unemployment rate could reach double digits,"" with the recession lasting years. But neither we, nor our colleagues at PolitiFact’s Washington, D.C. bureau, could find evidence of anyone in the administration making a public pledge along the lines of ""if we pass the stimulus, we promise unemployment will stay below 8 percent.""

We asked Allen’s campaign for the source of the candidate’s claim that that it was ""promised"" the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Katie Wright, Allen’s director of communications, pointed us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Other Republicans have also cited this as their source for past claims.

Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The study included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus, unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.

As we all know now, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and was at 9.4 percent in December. It fell to 9.0 percent in January.

But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers.

""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

There's also a footnote that goes with the chart that states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.""

That’s not a promise. It is an estimate and an admission that these predictions may not be accurate. And the administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong.

In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: ""None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated.""

In January 2009 the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus.

So, is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed?

President Barack Obama has said, and many independent economists agree, that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has. In fairness, not every economist agrees with that.

But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The implication of Allen's comment is that a rising unemployment rate in 2009 proves the stimulus didn't work. Many economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other.

The White House claimed the stimulus would improve the employment picture and applied that to the baseline for projected unemployment going forward. Allen and other Republicans argue Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent.

The administration never characterized it that way. True, it’s projections were off, but the report contained plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a guarantee on an upper limit on unemployment.

Allen is recycling a claim that should go to the dump. We rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/george-allen/george-allen-says-barack-obama-promised-stimulus-w/
"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Jim Renacci']","
Rep. Jim Renacci says signs for stimulus projects cost $20 million to $40 million
","
Signs of economic recovery can be elusive. The Federal Highway Administration tried to help, in its own way, by encouraging road signs at stimulus-funded highway projects that state: ""Putting America to Work. Project Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.""

As far back as July 2009, Republican legislators and some Democrats criticized the signs as wasteful. Sarah Palin, speaking at a Tea Party convention a year ago, claimed that one state alone -- Ohio -- spent $1 million on stimulus signs. PolitiFact rated that claim as Half True, finding that the figure was a suspect and almost certainly exaggerated estimate.

But the issue did not go away. When Rep. Jim Renacci was asked during a recent radio interview where the federal budget could be cut, he said: ""I'll give you a small item that I see on the highway every day. It's the signs that say 'This is the recovery act.' I think it was $20 or $40 million in signage.""

PolitiFact Ohio couldn't help being interested in an estimate with a range of 100 percent. We asked where the 16th District Republican got his figures, and did some looking of our own.

The congressman's press secretary, Karin Davenport, cited a figure from Rep. Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican. He introduced a bill last July requiring agencies to report what they already had spent on signs and prohibiting funding for more.

""Reports have stated these signs can cost taxpayers up to $10,000,"" Schock said, ""and my home state of Illinois has spent over $650,000 on these signs. That’s roughly $20 million spent nationwide, without creating one single job.""

Where did Schock get the number?

His communications director, Steve Dutton, told us, ""The number comes from several sources of information, including information reported by individual states, independent reporters (some amounts included up to $200 million) and several ranges from the White House.

""The White House initially said the cost was around $5 million and then they came back with $10 million, but the accounting for the actual cost is somewhat difficult as the way the stimulus bill was written it didn't require states to have to account for the costs of the signs. Several states did account for the cost, but not all of them did. There was a CNN story on the costs of the signs in Ohio.""

That put us back where we started. The CNN story, from a year ago, used the $1 million Ohio figure that PolitiFact found suspect and likely exaggerated. The story also said that CNN ""found most states are spending stimulus money on signs and that could cost taxpayers nationwide about $3.8 million.""

House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, supporting Schock's bill, said ""no information exists as to how much all of these signs cost taxpayers, but reports indicate that potentially tens of millions of dollars have been spent.""

Schock sits on the House Subcommittee on Oversight. The full committee's ranking Republican and chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, last year called the stimulus signs ""propaganda"" and made them a particular target.  Last June, he asked the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to investigate the total cost of recovery act signs in six agencies: the Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and General Services Administration.

The six agencies reported spending about $9 million total on signs, though they relied on only a sampling of projects for their estimates. The Department of Transportation spent the most, $8,154,000. The reported per-sign cost ranged from ""negligible"" (adding a recovery act logo to a sign that would have been posted anyway) to $1,950.

""I can't remember this issue coming up since then,"" the communications director for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, Edward Pound, told us. ""I think that's the extent of it.""

But Issa complained that the reporting was inadequate.  He and Republicans on the oversight committee asked the public to ""track down"" and photograph ""propaganda signs"" (which they said cost as much as $20 million), posting them online under the banner ""Signs of a failed stimulus.""

The website says the signs cost ""potentially"" and ""up to"" $192 million. No basis is provided for that figure. Calling it a ""potential"" cost makes it a theoretical high end, not an estimate.

Sam Rosen-Amy, a budget and fiscal transparency policy analyst with OMB Watch, said making any estimate would be difficult because signs are not mandated on projects, some signs are used on multiple projects and the per-sign cost varies widely. The recovery board doesn't track the cost of signage.

So we end where we started: Whether the signs are useful or wasteful is something for legislators and the public to decide. The $1 million figure for signs in Ohio was suspect a year ago, and it remains a big part of the foundation for later estimates.

There’s an element of accuracy in Renacci’s statement. The cost of the signs nationally has run into the millions.

But although some huge numbers have been cited, no one was able to document an exact figure. And when agencies putting the signs up were asked to investigate the costs, their estimates tallied up to less than half of Renacci’s figures.

That’s an important detail the listener needs to put things in proper context, and on the Truth-O-Meter that means we rate the congressman’s claim as Half True.

"['National', 'Children', 'Federal Budget', 'Jim DeMint']","
Sen. Jim DeMint takes aim at the ""Muppet Lobby""
","
Is Big Bird a fat cat? Is Elmo a lobbyist?

So says Sen. Jim DeMint, who is leading the charge to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. DeMint's Muppet rant was set off, in part, by a press conference on Feb. 16, in which Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., stood alongside a life-size version of Arthur from the animated PBS show of the same name, and blasted the Republican plan to eliminate CPB funding.

Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said Republicans ought to be focused more on reviving the economy and less on ""silencing Cookie Monster"" and ""laying off Bert and Ernie.""

DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, responded with a blog post and an op-ed in the Washington Times in which he argued that Sesame Street would do just fine without federal funding.

""Shows like Sesame Street are thriving, multimillion-dollar enterprises,"" DeMint wrote. ""According to the 990 tax form all nonprofits are required to file, Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513 -- nearly a million dollars -- in compensation in 2008. And, from 2003 to 2006, Sesame Street made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales. Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies.""

That's a lot of Elmo dolls. So we decided to check DeMint's numbers, and to put his overall argument about Sesame Street solvency into some context.

We got the 2009 990 tax form submitted by the Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit group that produces the show, and DeMint is correct. It shows Knell's salary at $806,990, with an additional $149,523 worth of other compensation. For the toy sales numbers, we have to go to the 2008 990 tax form. In a section on ""other income,"" it reports ""toys and consumer products"" as bringing just over $211 million from 2003 through 2006 (nearly $53 million a year, on average).

Now for some of the bigger picture.

The 2009 tax form shows that Sesame Workshop brought in about $140 million in revenues in 2008, with government grants accounting for just over $14 million of that (roughly 10 percent).

So would Sesame Street be ""just fine"" without that government money, as DeMint says, or would it ""silence Cookie Monster,"" as Lowey said.

They are probably both exaggerating.

Sesame Street is a lucrative enterprise, and Big Bird isn't likely to jump ship to Nickelodeon if federal funds are eliminated. But some of the services Sesame Street provides might, according to a statement released by Knell, the Sesame president.

""As a nonprofit organization which has a long history of building public and private partnerships, Sesame Workshop has benefited from the generous support of CPB [the Corporation for Public Broadcasting], which most recently provided critical grant support for literacy programs for 6-9 year olds, like The Electric Company,"" Knell said in a statement released Feb. 15, 2011. ""CPB has helped support our work with military families to provide social and emotional coping skills for children of parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who have left family behind during deployment. It also has provided important funding for our work helping parents who have lost jobs or been displaced due to the economic recession to keep their families intact and positively motivated. Additionally, CPB has been active in helping transition video content into digital assets to be used in schools and distributed through web-based applications nationwide.""

With federal funding an annual and often highly political battle, Sesame Workshop and many other companies that get support from the CPB have tried to become increasingly less reliant on government support.

According to a fact-sheet provided by Sesame Workshop, revenues from sales of its products ""offset about two-thirds of the research and production costs associated with the Workshop’s educational programs. The remaining one third comes from a combination of philanthropic support, corporate sponsorship and government funding.""

""As a result of this financial revenue model,"" the fact-sheet says, ""we are able to deliver each new season of Sesame Street to PBS with more than 93 percent of production costs covered by licensing activities or corporate sponsorships. In 2010, Sesame Workshop had total operating revenues of $136.4 million and total operating expenses of $136.5 million.""

Under different circumstances, Republicans might be cheering Sesame Street for making money ""the good old-fashioned way"" through merchandise sales instead of relying as heavily on federal handouts, said Steve Behrens, editor of Current, a newspaper and website about public media in the United States. Now, he said, that success is being used against it. It's so successful, the argument goes, it doesn't need the government's help.

Sesame Street might be okay without federal funds, Behrens said, but other kids programs that are ""less successful selling dolls"" might not be. (Indeed, we're thinking that sales of Jim Lehrer plush toys may not cover the full cost of the NewsHour.)  

Particularly hard hit by elimination of CPB funds would be some of the independent programming that gives public broadcasting its identity, Behrens said.

""The independent productions are almost all paid by federal money or foundations,"" Behrens said. ""Foundations only pay for things they have a direct interest in. They want programs that reflect their interests and promoting their ideas...There are strings attached to every piece of money that comes in to public broadcasting. Except for the federal piece.""

""Certain things would disappear,"" Behrens said, ""and the whole idea that it belongs to the public, there would be less reason to think that. It would be nice if some of the money coming in to public broadcasting didn't have so many strings attached to it.""

In an op-ed piece, Jonathan C. Abbott, president and CEO of WGBH, and Charles Kravetz, general manager of WBUR, argue the elimination of CPB funds would hit smaller, rural stations the hardest.

""Each federal dollar provides critical seed money that public broadcasters leverage to raise more than six more dollars from local sources,"" they wrote. ""As crucial as CPB funding is to stations in major metropolitan areas like ours, the situation is even more dire for smaller stations, where federal funding truly is the life blood.""

Charles Chamberlain, political director for liberal group Democracy for America, said the point of public broadcasting ""is that the programs offered should not/must not be subject to the whims of corporate sponsors and the ups and downs of merchandise sales. The shows and programs on public TV are subject to the needs of the entire public. The public funds these important programs as an alternative to the privately funded model used for programing on network and cable TV because profit shouldn't be the driving force behind every single form of broadcast media, especially educational programing.

""So the point here is not if Sesame Street can survive without publicly funding. The point is Sesame Street must stay independent of corporate sponsors or merchandise sales to retain its public educational mission and meet the full needs of the entire public,"" Chamberlain said.

Again, we're fact-checking Sen. DeMint's statement that Sesame Street raked in tens of millions of dollars from toy and consumer product sales over a recent four-year period, a figure cited as backing for his larger argument that ""Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies.""

Federal grants make up less than 10 percent of Sesame Street's budget. Whether Sesame Street would be ""just fine"" without that money is largely in the eye of the beholder. It seems unlikely that cutting federal funds would spell the end of Sesame Street, though some argue it might cause the demise of some small, rural stations that carry Sesame Street.

Still, as its own tax filings show, Sesame Street makes a lot of its revenue from non-government sources, much of it through the sale of toys and other consumer products. Toy revenue is just a portion of Sesame Street's budget and federal funding for Sesame Street is just a portion of the overall issue of federal funding for public broadcasting. But DeMint's figures on Sesame Street toy revenues are right. And so we rate DeMint's statement True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-takes-aim-muppet-lobby/

George Allen says 2.6 million jobs have been lost since stimulus bill was signed
","
George Allen was in no mood celebrate the second anniversary of President Barack Obama signing into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Feb. 17.

The Republican observed the occasion by firing an e-mail to reporters blasting the stimulus bill and the president.

""Two years ago today, President Obama signed into law a $800 billion jobless stimulus bill that promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent,"" said Allen, who is running to regain the U.S. Senate seat he lost to Democrat Jim Webb in 2006. ""Instead the American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9 percent or higher unemployment, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, and our nation’s debt has hit a record-setting $14 trillion.""

There are several things we wanted to check in this statement: Did the bill really ""promise"" that the unemployment rate would stay below 8 percent? Has unemployment really been above 9 percent for 21 months in a row, with 2.6 million jobs lost since the stimulus was signed?

This report will take on the second of those questions, looking at the unemployment rate and the number of jobs lost in the last two years. In a story tomorrow, we will examine Allen’s claim that the stimulus ""promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent.""   

Katie Wright, director of communications for Allen’s Senate campaign, said the unemployment and job-loss data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The national unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in April 2008 but began racing higher as the American and global economies fell into recession. The rate crossed the 9 percent threshold in May 2009 and has stayed above that level every month since. It peaked at 10.1 percent in October 2009.

In January the unemployment rate fell to 9 percent, down from 9.4 percent in December 2010. So the BLS data backs Allen up. The unemployment rate has been at 9 percent or higher for exactly 21 months.

What about the number of jobs lost? We looked at BLS job data from March 2009, the first full month after the stimulus bill was signed, through this January. The economy shed 3.5 million jobs during the last 10 months of 2009. It gained 909,000 during 2010 and another 36,000 in January of this year. That leaves us with a net loss of 2.57 million. With rounding, that comes out at 2.6 million.

So Allen’s right again.

What Allen ignores in his statement is that many jobs were saved by stimulus funds in school districts and local governments that used federal money to pay employees rather than making layoffs. There also were construction jobs created through projects funded by the stimulus.

Uncle Sam has been tracking stimulus spending at www.recovery.gov, and the program is overseen by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. Each quarter, recipients of the federal aid have reported the number of jobs being funded with stimulus money during the past three months.

During the final quarter of 2010, 585,654 jobs were reportedly being funded through stimulus dollars. The third quarter of 2010 saw 675,841 stimulus-supported jobs, the second quarter 750,045 jobs and the first quarter of last year 682,322 jobs. During 2009 the program was supporting between 600,000 and 635,000 jobs, according to the Recovery Board.

Edward Pound, the board’s director of communications, said the oversight agency has not tracked a total number of jobs created over the life of the program. He said the quarterly estimates were considered the most accurate measurement since stimulus funding often goes towards road and construction projects, which may only provide jobs for a finite period of time.

Let’s review.  Allen said ""the American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9 percent or higher unemployment,"" and that ""2.6 million jobs have been lost"" since the stimulus bill was signed in February 2009.

The unemployment moved above 9 percent in May 2009 and has been at that level or higher for 21 months. Since March 2009, 2.57 million jobs have been lost, which rounds up to the 2.6 million figure cited by Allen.

Allen ignores the number of jobs saved or created by stimulus, but the figures he uses in his claim are correct. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/george-allen/george-allen-says-26-million-jobs-have-been-lost-s/

Rep. Cliff Stearns says U.N. Headquarters remodeling budget has doubled
","
It's the place where heads of state have made the case for war and peace, and issues like world hunger and global warming have taken center stage. But the nearly 60-year-old United Nations Headquarters is also a place that in recent years has been plagued by structural issues like asbestos, leaky roofs and outdated electrical systems.

A $1.9 billion renovation is now under way at the 18-acre site in New York City, financed by member countries, including the United States. But the project's price-tag has caught the ire of one Florida congressman.

On Feb. 18, 2011, Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns, who represents portions of Alachua and Marion counties, proposed a budget amendment that would keep the U.S. from contributing money toward the project during the upcoming fiscal year. The cost for the renovations is being divvied up by the U.N.'s member countries -- with each country paying based on the percentage it pays for membership. For the U.S., that amounts to 22 percent, or roughly $377.7 million, according the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Stearns' amendment, which passed 231-191 on a largely party line vote, would eliminate this year's funding for the U.N. project -- $75.5 million. (Starting in 2007, the $377.7 figure was divided into five-year payments.)

""The cost for renovating the headquarters of the U.N. has doubled from the original estimate, and my amendment prohibits taxpayer funds from being used in the design, renovation or construction of the headquarters,"" Stearns wrote in a press release touting the amendment.

We decided to take a closer look at Stearns' claim. Have renovation costs on the 50-year-old headquarters doubled?

First some background on the buildings and what has led to the current state of disrepair.

Construction on the U.N. Headquarters started in 1949, along New York City's East River. By 1952, construction was completed on the four main buildings: the 39-story Secretariat building, the General Assembly, the Conference Building and the Library.

However, as years passed, the different buildings started facing problems from sewage backups to leaky roofs. There were also safety concerns because the buildings were not equipped with a fire-sprinkler system.

""The United Nations (U.N.) headquarters complex in New York City does not conform to current safety, fire and building codes or meet U.N. technology or security requirements, making it a potentially hazardous environment for visitors, employees and delegates,"" states an April 2008 report by the GAO.

In 2002, the U.N.'s General Assembly approved a complete renovation of the headquarters dubbed the ""Capital Master Plan."" Under the plan, the historic buildings would be refurbished rather than completely replaced.

In February 2003, the preliminary price-tag was set at $953 million, according to a timeline of the project found on the U.N.'s website. This is the base figure that Stearns cites when referring to the cost increase.

In March 2004, President George W. Bush approved a $1.2 billion low-interest loan to the U.N. to finance the project, according to a press release from the United Nations.

Fast forward to 2011. The cost projection now is $1.87 billion, according to this website for the Capital Master Plan.

A variety of factors have been cited for the increase in price, including high turnover among those managing the project.

""I have been frustrated by a number of factors, all working together, including the lack of clear support by many major stakeholders and difficulties of working within U.N. practices as it applies to a large building project,"" former project director Louis Frederick Reuter told the Washington Times in a May 4, 2006, interview. He quit after 10 months at the helm of the project.

The project is now being overseen by New York architect Michael Adlerstein, who joined other U.N. officials for a ceremonial ground-breaking on May 5, 2008. Since then, more than 4,700 employees have been shuffled around to temporary offices being leased throughout New York City. The restoration is expected to be completed by 2013, according to the U.N's website.

From an original price estimate of $953 million to a project now reaching close to $2 billion, Stearns is correct in noting the costs of the U.N. renovations have doubled. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/28/cliff-stearns/rep-cliff-stearns-says-un-headquarters-remodeling-/

Mitch McConnell says minimum wage hike would 'destroy' 500,000 to 1 million jobs
","In the first and only debate of Kentucky’s U.S. Senate race, Sen. Mitch McConnell was peppered with questions about his opposition to a proposed minimum wage hike. In response, McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, said raising the minimum wage in already difficult economic times would hurt employment. He cited a Congressional Budget Office study that he claimed said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would ""destroy half a million to 1 million jobs."" ""That’s not the way to grow our economy,"" he added. His Democratic challenger, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, countered that the report also noted a minimum wage hike would lift, ""over a million Americans out of poverty."" (In a separate fact-check, we rated that Mostly True.) We’re taking a look at McConnell’s claim in this fact-check. The report in question from the Congressional Budget Office, the chief fiscal scorekeeper for Congress, came out in February 2014. It took a look at President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 in 2016. The report found most low-wage workers ""would received higher pay that would increase their family’s income."" But the report said there’s a downside as well. Some people could lose their jobs. Why? An increase in wages would increase companies’ costs. That causes companies to raise their prices, which means fewer people want their goods or services, leading to less production and fewer workers needed to get the job done. Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers also encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing more productive higher-wage workers. For example, it might be cheaper to pay more for new machines that can replace workers, than to pay higher minimum wages. The net impact of this? The CBO estimates a total reduction in the workforce of about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers. How, then, did McConnell get between ""half a million and 1 million jobs"" would be destroyed? The CBO is very careful to note that 500,000 is a rough estimate and the midpoint of the range of likely outcomes. The report said, ""There is about a two-thirds chance that the effect would be in the range between a very slight reduction in employment and a reduction in employment of 1 million workers."" Instead of quoting the halfway point or — most accurately — offering the full-range of estimates, McConnell presents the top half of likely outcomes as though it’s fact. It’s just as likely that there are somewhere between very few and 499,999 jobs lost, but you would not get that impression from McConnell’s statement. Our ruling McConnell claimed that a Congressional Budget Office report said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour ""will destroy between half a million and one million jobs."" The report said ""roughly"" 500,000 workers could lose their jobs if the minimum wage went up. But the CBO added that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million. McConnell focuses on the high-end of the spectrum on a range of potential outcomes.

Rick Scott changed the terms of his promise to create 700,000 jobs on top of natural growth, ad says
","What’s 700,000 jobs give or take … 1 million? That’s the question a new ad from the Charlie Crist campaign hopes to answer for Florida voters. ""He made a promise,"" the ad says, showing video of Gov. Rick Scott from the 2010 campaign for governor. ""Hold me accountable for delivering on the campaign promises I make,"" Scott says. The ad then shows Scott promising to create 700,000 jobs ""on top of what normal growth would be."" Later, in reaction to a reporter’s question on that metric, Scott said, ""No."" The ad is paid for by the Florida Democratic Party, but the Crist campaign approved it and promoted it to the media. So we’re rating it as coming from the Crist campaign. Since 2010, PolitiFact Florida has been tracking Scott’s promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years, so this controversy is very familiar to us. But if you’re just tuning in now, we’ll start the story from the beginning. Because of the state’s housing-driven economy, Florida took a tremendous hit during the financial crash of 2008. By 2010, state economists said that the bottom had hit and Florida would gradually recover. That July, economists predicted that Florida would gradually recover, adding 1 million jobs by 2017 -- no matter who was governor. On July 21, 2010, Scott unveiled his now famous 7-7-7 plan, promising to create 700,000 new jobs in seven years (actually the plan was written to create 661,914 jobs, but the Scott campaign rounded up for effect). The jobs would flow from his pro-business, anti-regulation, anti-tax agenda. During the campaign, Scott said that the jobs would come on top of natural growth. ""Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be,"" Scott said during a 2010 debate hosted by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association on Oct. 20. (This is the video shown in the Crist ad.) Accounting for normal growth would make the target 1.7 million jobs over seven years. A few months after Scott took office in 2011, though, he started backtracking. First his staff and then Scott himself announced that they would be counting new jobs toward a goal of 700,000, period, not 700,000 on top of natural growth. When an Associated Press reporter reminded Scott in August 2011 that his original promise was 700,000  jobs on top of natural growth, Scott said, ""No, that’s not true.""  Members of the Sun Sentinel editorial board asked Scott in September 2011 if that was his promise -- ""Your pledge was for 700,000 in addition to normal growth, wasn't it?'' -- and Scott said no. At the time, PolitiFact Florida rated Scott's new position a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter.  Scott seems to be sticking to his new metric. In May 2013, Scott said the state was ""already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years"" when approximately 302,500 net jobs had been created since December 2010. We rated the claim that he was halfway to his 2010 goal as Mostly False, noting that he still had a ways to go to make it to 1.7 million jobs created. His jobs promise, which we track on our Scott-O-Meter, is rated In the Works, because Scott promised the jobs would be created over seven years, and he still has three more years to go. The seven-year yardstick is ignored in Crist’s latest ad. Our ruling Crist’s ad says that Scott changed 2010 his 2010 promise of 700,000 jobs created ""on top of what normal growth would be"" to just 700,000 jobs. That’s a difference of 1 million jobs, as had been projected by economists. The ad provides a concise but accurate summary of Scott’s 2010 pledge and then his public statements that modified the terms.

Trump: Obama's New York fundraising trip cost 'between $25 million and $50 million'
","With President Barack Obama’s low approval ratings already weighing down Democrats in the mid-term elections, his Republican critics like nothing better than giving voters more reasons to think less of him. Accordingly, billionaire and occasional presidential aspirant Donald Trump called out Obama for the cost of his recent New York fundraising trip. ""He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York,"" Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News’ Fox and Friends. We reached out to Trump to learn where he got his numbers and didn’t hear back. But we wondered, would a one-day New York trip cost between ""$25 million and $50 million""? The president made a one-day trip between Washington and New York on Oct. 7. According to the White House schedule, from take-off at Andrews Air Force Base to return took a bit over nine hours. In New York and Connecticut, Obama attended two events for the Democratic National Committee and one for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Obama traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York via Air Force One, which is the call sign for one of two 747 jets specially equipped with communications gear so the president is always able to respond in an emergency. According to a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service, the policy arm of Congress, the hourly cost of Air Force One is $179,750. On domestic trips, a cargo aircraft and a backup aircraft normally accompany Air Force One. For the purposes of Trump’s calculation, that would put the total cost of the air travel between $360,000 and $1.6 million, assuming a range of two and nine hours of usage time for Air Force One. Note: Under the rules of presidential travel, when the purpose of a trip is political, not official, the president’s political organization reimburses the government. For airfare, the price is based on the cost of a commercial ticket for the president and all those who accompany him. In this case, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would be on the hook. In addition to the aircraft, there would have been a Secret Service cost, but those figures are classified. There also would be security costs for the New York Police Department. To get a fuller picture of what the cost of presidential travel is, we have to go back to 1999 for a more comprehensive accounting. That year, the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s auditing division, looked at the price tag for three foreign trips taken by President Bill Clinton. Again, these numbers don’t include the Secret Service expenses, or the pre-trip planning. But they do include pretty much everything else. (We adjusted the 1998 dollars to account for inflation.) Trip Total days Daily cost (2014 dollars) Africa - six nations 12 $5.1 million/day Chile 5 $3 million/day China 9 $3 million/day Foreign travel requires much more staff and equipment than the one-day jaunt Obama made to New York City. In Africa, for example, the Marines sent a helicopter squadron. The Air Force deployed five additional planes and ran refueling missions. The Chilean trip pulled in about 600 staffers from a variety of agencies. There were hotels and meals to pay for. While we can’t know all the details of Obama’s New York jaunt, there is no evidence that it approached the complexity of either of the lower cost trips in the GAO report. And if those trips halfway around the world came in at about $3 million per day (in today’s dollars), it is extremely likely that a back-and-forth to New York would cost less. Much less. Bottom line: Presidential travel is expensive, but Trump’s estimate of Obama’s fundraising trip to New York is wildly high, based on everything we know. Our ruling Trump said Obama’s recent New York fundraising trip cost between $25 million and $50 million. Trump provided no evidence, likely because all the available information points to a total that would be way, way lower than $25 million, let alone $50 million.

Wasserman Schultz says state's ID law struck down by Supreme Court
","Separate judicial rulings in Wisconsin and Texas on Oct. 9, 2014 gave cheer to opponents of state laws requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls. Here’s part of what the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, had to say in a statement: ""With less than ten days before early voting starts in Texas and Wisconsin, I am pleased with the judicial decisions yesterday striking down burdensome photo ID laws in those states."" Did the brief Supreme Court order ""strike down"" the Wisconsin statute? The DNC leader was in a minority in using that terminology, we found in reviewing media reports and reactions from legal and political observers. But the New York Times’ headline on its story may have influenced some -- and in fact a DNC spokesman pointed it out to us in providing backup for Wasserman Schultz’s  claim. ""Courts Strike Down Voter ID laws in  Wisconsin and Texas,""  the  paper’s online headline declared Oct. 9, 2014. The story beneath that headline, though, used ""struck down"" only when referring to the Texas ruling. Here’s what it said about Wisconsin: ""The Supreme Court on Thursday evening stopped officials in Wisconsin from requiring voters there to provide photo identification before casting their ballots in the coming election."" There’s a significant difference between the rulings in the two states. In Texas, a federal district court judge -- the lowest level in the federal system -- found that state’s ID law unconstitutional, writing that it intentionally discriminates against black and Hispanic voters. The Wisconsin case is much further along: The action Wasserman Schultz reacted to was from the U.S. Supreme Court. In April 2014, Federal District Court Judge Lynn Adelman ""struck down"" Wisconsin’s law, but the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found it sound and cleared the way for its use in the Nov. 4, 2014 election. Several groups then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court in its Oct. 9 action did not take up the merits of the Wisconsin law’s constitutionality or even decide whether to take the case at all. Instead, without comment from the majority in the 6-3 decision, it temporarily blocked the implementation of the law, perhaps in response to plaintiffs’ claims that it was too close to the Nov. 4, 2014 election to be properly implemented. Underscoring the limited and temporary nature of the ruling, two justices who supported upholding Indiana’s voter ID law in a 2008 ruling -- Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy -- voted in the Wisconsin case to block the law for now. Most media outlets, legal observers and participants in the case used terms like ""blocked"" or ""stayed"" to describe the impact of the Wisconsin ruling. The DNC told us there’s only a semantic difference between ""struck down"" and ""blocked."" We heard otherwise. ""It’s not accurate to say it was ‘struck down,’ but it’s understandable"" given the New York Times headline and other media coverage, said Daniel P. Tokaji, an Ohio State University law professor and expert on election law. Non-lawyers especially can be forgiven for using the term, he said. ""The Supreme Court did not ‘strike down’ the voter ID law,"" Wisconsin Department of Justice spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us.  ""It vacated the Seventh Circuit’s September 12th order staying the District Court’s injunction."" She added: ""The September 12th order from the Seventh Circuit permitted Wisconsin to enforce the voter ID law in November. The Supreme Court did not take any action whatsoever as to the merits of the voter ID law."" Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen is exploring ways to reinstate the law before the November election. We asked a lawyer for one of the groups that sought the stay to weigh in on this. Larry Dupuis, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin Foundation, said he wouldn’t use ""struck down."" But he added that there is no technical legal definition of ""struck down, ""so I suppose someone could say the law was ‘struck down’ temporarily or for the November election."" The DNC told us Wasserman Schultz’s statement was ""consistent with news accounts and had one goal: to communicate clearly to voters that the United State Supreme Court’s action meant that the Wisconsin photo ID law would not be applicable in this year’s election."" We tackled a somewhat similar claim when Gov. Scott Walker said the John Doe investigation into his campaign finances had been ""resolved"" after two judges ruled it was ""over."" We rated that claim False, since it was not final and more court action lay ahead. Indeed, the federal appeals court overturned the lower-court decision and sent it back to a Wisconsin court, where an earlier action halting it remains under appeal. Our rating Wasserman Schultz said the Supreme Court struck down Wisconsin's photo ID election law. The high court temporarily halted the law from going into effect but did not take any action on the viability of the law itself. The ultimate fate of the law is yet to be determined. We rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-states-id-law-struck-down/

American LeadHERship ad ignores the three years Allan Fung didn't raise taxes
","He's the only candidate in the race for Rhode Island governor who has been in a position to raise taxes.

The ad calls him ""a career politician"" and says, ""as mayor, he raised taxes three times."" Fung became mayor in 2009. He has repeatedly acknowledged that he raised taxes three times during his six years in office. But he also inherited a huge pension problem, a budget that had $1.5 million in phony savings, and a school committee that had spent about $8 million it didn't have. His first year in office was marked by a massive cut in state aid that rocked cities and towns. And, with the Great Recession in full swing, it didn't get easier for him or other mayors. For example, early in his term, general revenue sharing, where the state gave about $55 million from sales and income taxes to municipalities, was eliminated. But he and the city ultimately stabilized the budget and during the last three of his six years in office, the city has not raised taxes. In the end, the statement in the American LeadHERship commercial is accurate.

Key context missing in attack on Perdue's job record
","A nine-year-old legal document has become a focal point in the highly competitive contest to become Georgia’s next U.S. senator. Democrat Michelle Nunn has made several attacks and claims against Republican David Perdue based on his blunt statements about outsourcing in a 2005 deposition. Most of the political hay comes from Perdue saying that he ""spent most of my career"" establishing work and supply lines in foreign countries. At the Oct. 7 debate, Nunn pounced on something else she found in the 186-page document. ""He talked about 16 countries,"" Nunn said. ""Not once did he talk about creating jobs in the United States."" Since the outcome of the race is expected to help decide control of the Senate, and polls show a potential runoff, the claim called out for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. First, some background. The deposition was taken as part of a bankruptcy lawsuit against Pillowtex, a North Carolina textile company that failed shortly after Perdue’s brief tenure as CEO. Perdue, who was CEO at Dollar General when he was deposed, said his turnaround plan when he joined Pillowtex in 2002 called for a mix of marketing and outsourcing. High-end products would be made in America, while lower-cost products would be manufactured overseas. That was the idea, at least, until Perdue and other Pillowtex executives found a large unfunded liability missed when the firm exited its first bankruptcy. Unable to execute his plan, Perdue left after less than a year and the firm eventually collapsed. The legal interrogation lays out that failure and includes Perdue’s description of various executive jobs where he specialized in outsourcing with firms such as Reebok and Sara Lee. Asked specifically about his ""experience"" with outsourcing, Perdue goes on at length about that background. ""I dealt with companies from Japan westward  all the way to Kenya and Lesotho in Africa, Dubai, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, all points west of Japan,"" Perdue said in part of his answer. In addition to those 12 countries, Perdue mentions three more and Hong Kong, now part of China. He does not reference the United States. That’s technically 16 then-nations. So is the case closed? Not without an understanding of how a deposition works. For the interrogation, Perdue would have been under oath, sworn to answer honestly the questions posed to him. A deposition is similar to taking the witness stand, but there is no judge present to referee the questions and answers, said Jill Polster, an Atlanta defense attorney. That means the attorney of the person being deposed counsels them to be sure to answer only the question posed. ""I tell all of my witnesses, you answer the question that is asked and no more,"" Polster said. ""Witnesses can sometimes talk about whatever they want to talk about, but that would be weird in a deposition. It’s a narrow inquiry."" In Perdue’s case, that narrow focus was, unsurprisingly, on his business successes finding low-cost manufacturing plants and labor. The line of questioning that led to Perdue to talk about his experience in other countries included: ""Can you describe your experience with outsourcing?"" ""When you joined Reebok, was Reebok outsourcing all of its product to Asia?"" and, ""At any of your jobs prior to Pillowtex, were you involved at all in building the infrastructure of outsourcing? In other words, there were no questions about the United States. And the structure of a deposition would not allow for much free form discussion about jobs there, even if Perdue wanted to bring that up. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s spokesman, said a careful reading of the deposition could show Perdue was trying to show efforts to save American jobs – not just outsource them – with his turnaround plan for Pillowtex. Moreover, at the time Perdue was starting work on creating thousands of jobs at Dollar General, through a massive expansion of the discount chain. But the list of countries doesn’t get into that, Dickey said, because no question was posed for him to answer. ""He was obliged to answer what the attorney was asking about,"" Dickey said. ""It’s disgusting to twist it to say otherwise."" Nunn is accurate to say Perdue lists job creation in 16 countries in his 2005 deposition. The United States isn’t one of them. But legal experts say it is unfair to focus too much on a missing answer in a deposition, since the real culprit would be a missing question. Nunn’s claim contains an element of truth but takes it out of context to be misleading. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/14/michelle-nunn/key-context-missing-attack-perdues-job-record/

Republican Party attacks Charlie Crist for Digital Domain mess and calls it 'de facto Ponzi scheme'
","Gov. Rick Scott and his opponent Charlie Crist are having a heyday accusing each other of being corrupt. Crist and the Democrats have repeatedly attacked Scott for the $1.7 billion Medicare fraud fine against Columbia/HCA, a health care company headed by Scott before he stepped down in 1997 amid the federal investigation. Scott and the Republicans have attacked Crist for his friendship with a past campaign donor, Fort Lauderdale lawyer Scott Rothstein, who went to prison for a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme in 2011. Crist was not implicated in the Ponzi scheme. A new TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida reminds voters about Crist’s Rothstein connection and then makes this claim: ""And now Crist is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme,"" says the narrator. The text on the screen then states: ""Florida lawsuit calls Digital Domain ‘de facto Ponzi scheme,’"" citing a July 2014 article in the South Florida Business Journal. Digital Domain is a special effects movie company that took $20 million in state money under then-Gov. Crist before it went bankrupt in 2012. The state did file a lawsuit that called the botched deal a ""de facto Ponzi scheme,"" but the ad omits crucial context about that lawsuit: It was filed recently by attorney William Scherer, a Scott supporter and frequent donor to GOP candidates. Crist’s campaign lawyer, Mark Herron, sent a letter to TV stations calling the ad ""false"" and urging them not to air it. We decided to fact-check Crist’s role in the Digital Domain deal and whether he was ""embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme."" Digital Domain lawsuit Digital Domain California, created by director James Cameron, animated the scenes in Titanic and the Transformers movies. Despite its creative success, the company had debt problems. (For a thorough analysis of the Digital Domain fiasco, read this Palm Beach Post investigation.) Digital Domain Florida was formed in 2009 with hopes that it would get money here to settle debt from its California company. But that strategy wasn’t known to state officials at the time. After Enterprise Florida rejected a request for Digital Domain to get $20 million, the company sought another avenue. State Rep. Kevin Ambler, R-Tampa, inserted a budget amendment that included the $20 million. Crist signed off on the budget in June 2009. But in September 2012, the Port St. Lucie company announced it was closing its Florida operations, filing for bankruptcy and laying off more than 300 employees. The state hired Scherer to go after Digital Domain, and Scherer filed his lawsuit in the 19th Judicial Circuit in Port St. Lucie on July 22, 2014. The suit names Digital Domain executives and entities involved with the company as co-defendants, as well as Ambler, who was given a position on Digital Domain’s board in 2011 after he left the Legislature. Ambler’s son also got a job with the company. The lawsuit doesn’t name Crist as a defendant. However, Scherer’s lawsuit repeatedly points the finger at Crist and casts him as a key politician responsible for the state’s end of the deal. In fact, the lawsuit mentions Crist by name 35 times. The lawsuit portrays Crist as being wooed by Digital Domain executives starting years before the company got the state money. Scherer’s account of Crist starts in 2007 when an entrepreneur involved in Digital Domain, Sean Heyniger, invited Crist to a party in order to lobby Crist to give the company state money. Heyniger’s ex-wife, Kelly Heyniger, had been dating Crist at the time. The lawsuit says that Crist went to California to check out the project. A different picture emerges in the state inspector general’s report ordered by Scott after the company collapsed. That report says that no laws or rules were broken by state officials, though it generally raises concerns about the process for companies to get state incentive money. The report shows how several politicians and state officials -- not only Crist -- played a role in Digital Domain walking away with $20 million. It portrays Crist as making sure legislative leaders were involved by sending a letter to Senate President Jeff Atwater and House Speaker Larry Cretul asking for them to notify them of the funding before he approved it. (The report also stated that a lack of documentation and conflicting information hampered the ability of the inspector general to make a complete determination. Crist didn’t return a message by investigators.) So Crist did play a significant role in the company getting state money -- but he wasn’t the only political player who made that happen. The Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times wrote that the report showed that ""several legislative power players said ‘Yes’ to a deal that later cost taxpayers dearly."" That included Crist, Ambler, Crist’s economic development director Dale Brill and legislative power brokers, including then state Rep. David Rivera, who chaired the state’s legislative budget commission where the project was discussed before it received state money. Crist told the Palm Beach Post in 2013 that he signed off on the $20 million grant because he thought Digital Domain represented a promising opportunity for the state. ""I was really supportive of trying to develop the film industry,"" Crist said. Was it a ‘de facto Ponzi scheme’? In the lawsuit, Scherer wrote, ""Digital Domain California was a de facto Ponzi scheme. It was a serial borrower which constantly replaced old debt with new debt to keep the enterprise going."" Digital Domain now faces allegations of fraud in a civil suit, but was it a ‘de facto Ponzi scheme,’ as the ad suggests? We interviewed Andrew Levi, a former federal prosecutor who prosecuted Ponzi schemers in South Florida and is now in private practice. ""It definitely is not a classic Ponzi scheme,"" Levi said. ""It's more of a debt scheme."" In a classic Ponzi scheme, a business -- which may or may not include a legitimate practice -- solicits money from investors with promises of high returns. When the business can’t deliver on the returns, it seeks money from a second group of investors to pay off the first group. The scheme ultimately implodes when it can’t continue to pay off investors. According to Scherer’s lawsuit, Digital Domain California started up Digital Domain Florida with the intention of soliciting money and covering their debt from the California company. ""It doesn’t mean that it’s not a fraud of some kind if the allegations are true, but it doesn’t fit into the common classic definition of a Ponzi scheme,"" Levi said. ""It’s really a stretch to apply the term ‘Ponzi scheme.’ "" A campaign spokesman for Crist, Brendan Gilfillan, described Digital Domain as a ""business failure, not a crime, and Rick Scott’s own administration has said Gov. Crist did nothing wrong."" Crist isn’t alone in handing out state money in exchange for jobs that failed to materialize. A Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times investigation found that under Scott the state gave $266 million in tax breaks and other incentives in return for 45,258 new jobs, but only 5 percent of the jobs materialized. Our ruling The Republicans’ ad said, ""Crist is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme,"" referring to Digital Domain getting $20 million in state incentives and then going belly up. But a state report, ordered by Scott, concluded there were no violations of law or rules by Crist or any other politician. The report also showed Crist was one of many political players who helped the company get the state money. A civil court could find that Digital Domain committed fraud. However, the company’s plan to pay off its debt in another state by getting money from Florida doesn’t meet the definition of a classic Ponzi scheme. Also, while Crist is mentioned in the court filing, he's not a defendant in the case.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/13/republican-party-florida/republican-party-attacks-charlie-crist-digital-dom/

Warner embelishes PolitiFact finding on Gillespie ad
","U.S. Sen. Mark Warner is airing a TV ad accusing Ed Gillespie, his Republican opponent, of running deceptive campaign commercials. Warner cited two of our Truth-O-Meters as proof. ""Ed Gillespie … is attacking Mark Warner with false ads experts call misleading, completely made up,"" the narrator of ad says. While those words are being spoken, the written words ""SIMPLY FALSE"" and ""MISLEADING"" pop up on the screen with citations from PolitiFact this year -- the first from Sept. 28 and the second from April 25. Let’s take a look at what we actually said about the Gillespie claims that Warner denounces. The first case concerns a False rating we gave to a recent Gillespie ad that indicated our colleagues at PolitiFact National gave Warner its ""Lie of the Year"" award in 2013 for promising four years earlier that he wouldn’t vote for health care reform that took away insurance plans people like. We did use words ""simply false"" in the ruling summary. PolitiFact’s story announcing to lie of the year never mentioned Warner. It focused on President Barack Obama’s repeated promises that under the Affordable Care Act, ""If you like you insurance, you can keep it."" Obama made the promise at least 37 times over the years and stood by it long after he enacted regulations that guaranteed some people would lose that plans because of minimum coverage requirements in the ACA. The second citation by Warner concerns a fact check we did on a statement by the Republican Party of Virginia that Warner has voted with the president ""97 percent of the time."" But far from debunking the claim -- which has become a staple of Gillespie’s speeches and ads -- we rated it True. We pointed out a few issues with the statistic, which is compiled by CQ Weekly, a nonpartisan Washington news service once known as Congressional Quarterly. For one thing, Obama has taken a position only 28 percent of the bills Warner has voted on, and more than half of those were for confirmation of presidential appointees. Also, Senate Democrats on the whole have backed the president 95.4 percent of the time during Warner’s term. Warner most notably backed the president when he voted for Obamacare in 2010. He’s bucked the president by voting against regulating assault weapons and against delaying the start of automatic budget cuts in 2013. Warner says the presidential support rating ignores his efforts to work across the aisle with Republicans, particularly trying to fashion a bipartisan plan to reduce debt. He correctly notes that several congressional watchdogs have rated him among the most conservative Senate Democrats. Did we call the statistic misleading? Nope. But a political scientist we quoted did. Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington said, ""To imagine that Warner votes like a politburo member for the president would be misleading."" Our ruling A Warner TV commercial says PolitiFact Virginia has frowned upon two negative claims that have aired in Gillespie ads. Warner’s right that we labeled as ""simply false,"" the indication in one Gillespie ad’s that the Warner was awarded the ""Lie of the Year"" by our colleagues at PolitiFact National. But the senator is wrong in suggesting we labeled as ""misleading"" another attack by his opponent -- that Warner has voted with the president 97 percent of the time. In fact, we rated the statistic True. In the article, we quoted a political scientist who said it would be ""misleading"" to conclude from the statistic that Warner is a yes-man to the president. Warner tries to walk a fine line on the ad by having the moderator say ""experts call"" the ads misleading. But the bold letters on the screen saying ""POLITIFACT VIRGINIA"" put the words in our mouth. In one case, that’s so; in one case, it’s not.  All together, Warner’s ad statement is Half True.  ",/factchecks/2014/oct/13/mark-warner/warner-embelishes-politifact-finding-gillespie-ad/

Brad Schimel says most Republican and Democrat colleagues have endorsed him
","Political scientists say that in a tight race between little-known candidates and few defining issues, endorsements can have more influence than usual. That might be why Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for state attorney general, is calling himself ""law enforcement’s choice."" And it’s probably why the first thing that pops up on the Waukesha County district attorney’s campaign website is a boast regarding 89 endorsements. In a new TV ad just a month from his Nov. 4, 2014 face-off with Democrat and Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, the ad’s narrator says that as a ""decorated prosecutor and father of two girls, Brad Schimel puts public safety ahead of politics."" The TV spot, which began airing Oct. 1, 2014, continues: ""It’s why an overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel."" Is Schimel right? Behind the numbers Schimel defines ""law enforcement leaders"" as county sheriffs and district attorneys. A solid majority of them -- about 60 percent -- run as Republicans, so Schimel had a natural advantage vs. Happ. But a fair number of law enforcement officials decline to endorse, so the advantage is not guaranteed. We analyzed the endorsement lists of both candidates and here’s what we found: Combined, Happ and Schimel claim 112 endorsements from current DAs and sheriffs. Schimel has received 80 percent of those endorsements. If you were to look at all sheriffs and DAs -- including those who have not issued endorsements -- his total of 89 would represent about 60 percent. Significantly, Schimel won over nine Democrats and one independent. In contrast, Happ’s 23 endorsements were all from within her party -- not a single Republican official defected to her side. Bottom line, Schimel started with a natural ""base"" of 60 percent, but wound up with 80 percent support from those who endorsed. So, by that measure his ""overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders"" claim holds up to scrutiny. But his claim can also be read as a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats. By that measure, he is accurate with Republicans, but not with Democrats. Of the 32 Democrats who have endorsed, Happ received 23 compared to Schimel’s nine. For Schimel, that is 28 percent of the nods from Democrats. That’s 28 percent more than Happ won from Republicans, but not a majority. Our rating Schimel’s ad says that ""an overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel."" The AG candidate has won 80 percent support from those who endorsed, and wooed 9 Democrats into the fold. He has won a clear majority overall, and from Republicans, but not from Democrats alone. That makes for a partially accurate claim, our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/13/brad-schimel/brad-schimel-says-most-republican-and-democrat-col/

Nunn mostly right about Perdue's opposition to farm bill
","One of rare compromises out of Congress this year has become a talking point in Georgia’s hotly contested U.S. Senate race. At issue is the 2014 Farm Bill, a bipartisan effort that ended direct payments to farmers, beefed up crop insurance and cut funding for food stamps. Michelle Nunn, the Democratic candidate running for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat, invoked her support of the bill in her first debate this week with Republican candidate David Perdue. ""Saxby Chambliss, Johnny Isakson, have said that the farm bill was the most important piece of legislation to Georgians, and yet you stood against it,"" Nunn said. Given agriculture pumps $71 billion into the state’s economy every year, making it the state’s largest industry, implying lack of support for farmers is serious business. But is it true? PolitFact Georgia decided to check. Nunn’s claim is designed to bolster her bipartisan bona fides - and showcase where she agrees with conservatives such as Georgia’s two current senators, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, and powerful groups, such as the Georgia and American farm bureaus. Both Perdue and Nunn have said they want to serve on the Senate agriculture committee. Her claim is based on statements that Perdue made in February, when he was running in the crowded GOP primary. Of the seven Republicans running, only U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Savannah, said he supported the farm bill.   At the time of that  debate, Nunn had already voiced her support for the measure, which took more than two years to pass, as well as her intent to seek a seat on the Senate’s agriculture committee, said her spokesman Nathan Click. ""While David Perdue opposed the Farm Bill -- the No. 1 legislative priority for Georgia farmers --  Michelle Nunn has said since the beginning of this campaign that fighting for Georgia farmers is one of her top priorities,"" Click said. Lawmakers across the political spectrum supported the farm bill largely because of the importance of agriculture in various states. Isakson and Chambliss both supported the final bill, with Chambliss taking the floor of the Senate to urge others to vote with him. ""There is no single piece of legislation that impacts as many people in my state as this one,"" said Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer. Opposition came mostly from the far-left and far-right of each party. Democrats who voted against the bill complained about $8.6 billion cut over a decade to food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Republican opponents claimed those cuts did not go far enough. Perdue sides with the GOP opponents to the measure, said spokesman Derrick Dickey. He believes that Congress missed an opportunity for a broader overhaul of the food stamp program. ""We have seen exponential growth in food stamps throughout the years,"" Dickey said. ""David supports a discussion focused on getting those people back to work, separate from protections from farmers."" That sort of debate would require a bifurcated bill, to fund agriculture and nutrition. An effort to do just that failed in Congress before lawmakers rallied behind the compromise. With that history, it is clear that Nunn is correct to say Perdue did not support the 2014 farm bill. But it is an overreach to imply that opposition to the bill translates into opposition to farmers or agriculture.

McCain: We were 'told' there'd be no Ebola in the United States
","Early Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a second person had contracted Ebola in the United States. The patient is a female nurse in Dallas, who had treated the first patient diagnosed in the United States -- Thomas Eric Duncan, who came into contact with Ebola in Liberia, fell ill in Dallas and died there Oct. 8. The CDC believes the nurse, who had been taking CDC-mandated precautions, was exposed to Ebola because of a ""breach in protocol.""   The new case is fanning the fears of those who think the government is not doing enough to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States -- despite the CDC’s repeated assurances that it is highly unlikely the disease would spread here. In light of the news, the Sunday talk shows shifted from their scheduled topics to discuss the case. On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- invited on the show to talk about U.S. military activity in Iraq -- said it’s not obvious to the public that anyone in the government is taking charge over Ebola. ""Americans have to be reassured here,"" McCain said on Oct. 12, 2014. ""I don’t think we are comforted by the fact that we were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States, and obviously that’s not correct."" At a press conference Sunday, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said there’s a risk that the Dallas area might see additional cases in coming days because of this possible ""breach in protocol."" However, the organization remains ""confident that wider spread in the community can be prevented."" We decided to look back and see if any official said that a case of Ebola would ""never"" come to the United States. Although many media outlets and health care officials have urged people not to panic about Ebola, we could not find a single instance where someone said it would ""never"" get here. As far as we can tell, the CDC and the President Barack Obama’s message has been the same throughout the epidemic, which began in Africa in December: It’s possible a case might make its way to the United States, but a full-fledged outbreak is highly unlikely. (We reached out to McCain’s staff, but they never got back to us.) The administration’s reasoning: America’s health system is much better prepared to fight diseases like Ebola than those in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the disease has been spreading. Here’s some of the CDC’s statements: July 28, after two Americans contracted the disease in Africa: ""There is no significant risk in the U.S. While it is unlikely that the disease would spread if imported into the United States, the recent infections in U.S. health care workers working abroad highlight the need for vigilance."" (The CDC has issued periodic updates on Ebola since March, but this was the first one we could find that addressed the disease spreading to the United States.) Aug. 13, press release: ""A disease threat anywhere in the world is a threat everywhere in the world, and CDC is preparing for any possibility, including that a traveler might become ill with Ebola while in the United States.  Although Ebola poses very little or no risk to the U.S. community at large, CDC and health care providers in the United States need to be prepared."" Sept. 17, testimony at congressional hearing: ""We do not view Ebola as a significant public health threat to the United States. … It is possible that infected travelers may arrive in the United States, despite all efforts to prevent this; therefore we need to ensure the United States' public health and health care systems are prepared to rapidly manage cases to avoid further transmission."" The White House: July 31, press briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest: ""The CDC has concluded that there is no significant risk in the United States from the current Ebola outbreak. And while it is unlikely that the disease would spread if the virus were detected in the United States, the CDC is taking action to alert health care workers in the U.S. and remind them how to isolate and test suspected patients while following strict infection control procedures."" Sept. 16, Obama’s remarks at the CDC: ""First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low."" Oct. 8, Obama’s statement to state and local officials, after Duncan (the first Dallas patient) died: ""Because we’ve got a world-class medical system, because we’ve put in place tough safety measures, because of the work that many of you have done in conjunction with organizations like the CDC and dealing with infectious disease generally, and because of the nature of Ebola and the fact that it’s not something involving airborne transmission, the chance of an Ebola outbreak in the United States remains extremely low. … I’m confident that so long as we work together, and we’re operating with an appropriate sense of urgency that we will prevent an outbreak from happening here."" The common refrain in all those comments? A widespread outbreak is extremely unlikely in the United States. But individual or isolated cases were possible, hence the need for the CDC to be ready. Our ruling McCain said, ""We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States."" Based on public statements, Obama and CDC officials have repeatedly said there’s a chance an Ebola case could appear in the United States, but the possibility of an outbreak is extremely low. We found no instance in which an official said Ebola would ""never"" make it here -- rather, it has always been acknowledged as a possibility.

Tony Perkins: We 'know' from social science that children do best with a mom and a dad
","The Supreme Court’s refusal this week to review any of the same-sex marriage cases that had been sent for appeal undercut such bans in several states. Supporters of gay marriage celebrated the move. Opponents criticized it as further proof that ""unelected judges"" have the power to overrule the will of the majority. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a leading group in the fight against gay marriage, said children’s welfare is central to the council’s position. ""We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad,"" Perkins said Oct. 12 on Fox News Sunday. We have examined this sort of claim before. The independent research fails to back up Perkins’ view. The Family Research Council has a Web page with 10 arguments from social science against same-sex marriage. We went through the list to see which spoke to the welfare of children, and of those points, which were based on studies that compared children in same-sex and opposite-sex households. Not addressing the welfare of children Five of the 10 had more to do with marriage and society than children. They advanced claims that opposite-sex marriage promotes the domestication of men, paternal commitment, sexual fidelity, ""gender-typical"" roles and the association of marriage with procreation. A sixth one spoke of how children conceived through artificial insemination ""hunger"" to know about their biological fathers. While those questions no doubt occur, the book cited by the Family Research Council focused largely on what fathers can bring to child-rearing. It was more a guide to fathering, and less a comparison study of different kinds of households. In fact, it wasn’t a peer-reviewed comparison study at all. The remaining four pieces of evidence That leaves four items on the Family Research Council list. One asserted that children need fathers and cited a study on households where the father is absent. However, that research looked at single-parent households, not children with same-sex parents, and so it addresses a different issue entirely. The Web page offers the corollary point that children need mothers. It cites books, not academic studies, and again, the books are not focused on comparing same-sex and opposite-sex households. They look at gender differences and how children develop over time. The final two points from the Family Research Council address the data on children of same-sex households. You can find many research papers that claim that growing up in same-sex households does no harm. But the council cited the court affidavit of a University of Virginia professor who said that not one of those studies ""was conducted according to generally accepted standards of scientific research."" That testimony has been critiqued on two scores: It came in 2001 and research has passed it by, and it overlooked a range of studies. But even if the methodological critique were correct, it wouldn’t prove that growing up in an opposite-sex household is better. The council then cited the work of New York University sociologist Judith Stacey to make the point that children raised in same-sex households ""are more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders."" When we looked at this topic before, Stacey said this represents a ""complete misuse of the research."" Stacey wrote that the differences she described, such as children being more open to same-sex relationships, need not be seen as deficits. Stacey accused same-sex marriage opponents of cherry-picking her findings. What other research shows We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it was denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, the researcher loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. In contrast, we found several research projects that compared much larger numbers of children in same and opposite-sex households. One published in 2012 looked at 78 children -- about half boys and half girls -- raised by lesbian parents. The mothers joined the research project as far back as 1986, long before their children were born. The children were assessed over time and those results were matched to children from heterosexual couples. When asked about how they felt about themselves, their relations with their parents and with their peers, the children of lesbians responded much as did the children of straight parents. However, they were more likely to report being teased at school because of their parents. The American Psychological Association produced a comprehensive review of studies going back three decades. The most relevant section focuses on research that compares the children of lesbian or gay parents. The studies looked at children in terms of their school performance, their relations with their peers, intelligence, self-esteem and a number of other variables. According to this review, ""the belief that children of lesbian and gay parents suffer deficits in personal development has no empirical foundation."" Our ruling Perkins said that based on social science, we know ""that children do best with a mom and a dad."" The research cited on the website of Perkins’ group, the Family Research Council, does not provide any support. It relies on books rather than peer-reviewed research, it quotes selectively or mischaracterizes from the work it cites, or at best, challenges the quality of the methodology behind findings that go against its position. In contrast, we found recent peer-reviewed social science research that finds that at the very least, children of lesbian parents do as well as other children.

Unemployment for young people down to 2.6%, Michelle Obama says
","While campaigning for Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke for the second time in nine days, Michelle Obama took time to praise the presidential virtues of her husband. ""By almost every economic measure, we are better off today than when Barack Obama took office. That is a fact,"" the first lady said Oct. 7, 2014 at the Overture Center for the Arts, near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. ""Here is just some of the proof; some of the proof,"" she said, with dozens of students clad in Badgers-red arrayed on the stage behind her. ""Our businesses have created more than 10 million new jobs since 2010; that's including the 236,000 jobs created last month alone. And this is the longest uninterrupted run of private-sector job growth in our nation's history. Do you realize that? In our history."" Then Obama made a claim of particular interest to many of those on the stage and in the audience: ""The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 percent today."" Whatever sluggishness there might be in the nation's economy, the overall unemployment rate has been coming down. But has the rate for young people dropped eight full points -- to just 2.6 percent -- in the past five years? ""Youth unemployment"" Attacking Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Mitt Romney claimed that under Obama, ""youth unemployment"" was double the overall unemployment rate -- that is, 16.4 percent for people ages 16 to 24, versus 8.2 percent for people ages 16 and up. PolitiFact National rated the statement Half True. The two figures were correct, but the phenomenon wasn’t unique to Obama’s presidency. Youth unemployment had been roughly double the overall rate for every month dating back to January 2001, when GOP President George W. Bush took office. The first lady’s claim is slightly different than Romney’s in that she referred to young people not youth. But, as we’ll see, she misfired on the numbers. Sorting out the claim The relevant part of a White House transcript of the first lady’s remarks reads as follows: ""The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 [6.2] percent today.""   The brackets indicate Obama transposed the numbers when she spoke. But even if 6.2 percent was the rate she meant to cite, the age group of the young people she talked about still wasn’t clear. After we exchanged several emails with The White House, a spokeswoman for the first lady eventually told us that Obama was referring to the unemployment rates for people ages 25 to 34 -- ""a good proxy for young people out of school."" Many folks would consider people in that age group young. Then again, many of the college students who saw the first lady in Madison might think 34 sounds kinda old. In any case, here from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics are the seasonally adjusted September unemployment rates for various age groups in 2009, the first year Obama cited, and 2014. The September figures are the latest figures available for 2014.   Age group September 2009 unemployment rate September 2014 unemployment rate Overall (ages 16 and up) 9.8 percent 5.9 percent Ages 16 to 24 18.4 percent 13.7 percent Ages 25 to 34 10.4 percent* 6.2 percent   *Note: The high rate for all of 2009 was 10.6 percent, in October. So, for people ages 16 to 24, and for those ages 25 to 34, unemployment was considerably lower in September 2014 than it was five years earlier. But not as low as what Obama said in her speech. Our rating The first lady said: ""The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 percent today."" But the latest figures, for September 2014, show the rates were considerably higher for two groups that could be considered young: 13.7 percent for people ages 16 to 24, and 6.2 percent for those ages 25 to 34.

Allan Fung claims Wall Street investors went bust on 38 Studios deal
","In the drama that's playing out over who should be the next governor of Rhode Island, a key role is being played by a character known as ""Wall Street."" You can see it in the ""Bust"" commercial from Republican gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung. It's an attack on his Democratic rival, Gina Raimondo, a venture capitalist who was elected general treasurer four years ago. The underlying issue is 38 Studios, the now-defunct video-game company created by former Boston Red Sox star Curt Schilling. Before the company went bankrupt, the state gave it a loan guarantee of $75 million.  Whether the state is obligated to pay off the investors who purchased the bonds continues to be a hot topic in Rhode Island. With interest, the total payment would be $112.6 million over 10 years. ""Wall Street investors took a risk, and went bust,"" Fung's commercial says. ""But Gina Raimondo wants to use our money to bail them out. A former Wall Street financier herself, Raimondo's looking out for Wall Street, not Main Street."" It's well known that Raimondo thinks the state should pay the holders of the ""moral obligation"" bonds and Fung thinks Rhode Island should not. For this fact-check, we’re going to focus on whether Wall Street investors really went bust on the 38 Studios deal. But first, a slight diversion. We also had considered checking whether it’s accurate to call Raimondo a ""former Wall Street financier,"" a phrase that implies significant power, influence and -- in the aftermath of the the Great Recession -- questionable dealings. Fung spokesman Robert Coupe said the campaign was referring to the first venture capital firm Raimondo worked for, Village Ventures, which has an office in midtown Manhattan. It may not have had an office directly in New York City's financial district, but the ""Wall Street"" phrase ""refers to the financial services industry in general, not just firms that are physically located on Wall Street or at the southern tip of Manhattan,"" Coupe said. Raimondo spokeswoman Nicole Kayner said the term doesn't apply because ""Wall Street is investment banks, people who trade in stocks and bonds. It's not something Gina ever did.""  Instead, she said, Raimondo traveled to areas of the country ""under-served"" by capital to find and help finance entrepreneurs starting companies. We contacted more than a half dozen of the top U.S. business schools looking for experts to provide some guidance on this general question. Only one even wanted to venture an opinion, which was that, unless you're a major player, the accepted definition for ""Wall Street financier"" is as firm as jelly. The evidence on the second statement -- whether ""Wall Street investors . . . went bust"" as a result of the 38 Studios deal -- is much clearer. The 38 Studios bonds were sold in three blocks totaling $75 million; buyers were promised interest rates ranging from 6 percent to 7.75 percent annually.  After 38 Studios went bankrupt, there was much debate over whether Rhode Island should repay the bonds. Ultimately, in June, the General Assembly and Gov. Lincoln Chafee approved a budget that included the $12.3 million due to 38 Studios bondholders this year. It was the second state payment for the loan. Last year the state made an initial payment of $2.5 million as the bonds became due. In short, the bondholders are getting their money, contrary to what Fung's commercial suggests. Even if the state were to renege someday, the bonds come with insurance from Assured Guaranty Municipal Corporation, a AA-rated bond insurer. If the state stopped payment, the insurance company would be on the hook to pay the investors. In an email, Coupe said that ""went bust"" is a reference to 38 Studios itself, which went bankrupt. ""The graphic on the screen during this line refers specifically to the 38 Studios bankruptcy,"" he said. But the narrator specifically says, ""Wall Street investors took a risk, and went bust."" Asked about the insurance, Coupe said, ""If the State of Rhode Island does not appropriate the funds to repay investors, then insurance coverage may repay the investors, but that insurance coverage does not operate as a guarantee. ""It is accurate, therefore, to say that the investors went bust, although they may at some future point be made whole either by a state guaranty or insurance coverage,"" he said. ""But both of those potential forms of repayment are conditional on other factors."" Our ruling We'll leave it up to readers to decide whether Allan Fung is correct in calling Gina Raimondo ""a former Wall Street financier."" But when Fung's TV commercial says that ""Wall Street investors . . . went bust"" on the 38 Studios deal, it's clear that those investors are doing just fine. The state is making its payments on schedule.  Even if Fung had said that the investors ""might"" go bust in the future, that seems highly unlikely, thanks to the insurance that came with the sale. We rate his characterization of what happened to the 38 Studio's Wall Street investors as False.

Would raising the minimum wage cost 500,000 jobs?
","The minimum wage has long been a dividing line in the race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist in the governor’s race, so it’s not surprising that it emerged during the first of three televised debates. During the Oct. 10, 2014, debate hosted by the Spanish-language network Telemundo, a panelist asked Scott if he favors keeping Florida’s minimum wage at $7.93 or raising it. After bringing up his family’s money problems growing up, the multimillionaire governor said he does not support raising the minimum wage because he wants more jobs in the state. He cited a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). ""I want more jobs. And that’s why I ran on 7 steps to 700,000 jobs. The CBO says that if we raise the minimum wage the way Charlie wants to do it, it would lose 500,000 jobs,"" Scott said. ""I don’t want to lose those jobs."" The context here is important; Scott used the 500,000 number while talking about Florida jobs. As we'll see, that number applies nationwide. Crist has said he would ""fight every way I possibly can to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour."" This mirrors an amount eyed by President Barack Obama, who has pushed to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25 to $10.10 over two years. In 2016, it would be tied to inflation. (States can set their minimum wage higher than the federal rate, the minimum wage in Florida automatically increased in 2014 to $7.93 because it is tied to inflation.) The CBO analyzed Obama’s proposal in a February 2014 report that provided a mixed bag of political talking points. It studied the effect of the policy on the national workforce and did not provide a state-by-state breakdown. People who support raising the minimum wage can highlight the CBO finding that 16.5 million low-wage workers would earn more money a week under Obama’s proposal. People who don’t like raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10, like Scott, can point to the fact that CBO said it would cost the country an estimated 500,000 jobs as businesses shoulder new employee costs. This figure is not precise. The analysts at CBO cushioned their findings by saying the number of lost jobs from the $10.10 hourly policy could range from a ""very slight"" decrease in employment to a loss of 1 million jobs. Back then, a top White House economic adviser pushed back on the findings, telling reporters the CBO report ""goes outside of the consensus view"" of economists who study the influence of higher minimum wages on employment. The Scott campaign directed us to a page for communities on Crist’s website, African Americans for Charlie. The page says he will increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for state workers and contractors ""and fight to raise it for all Floridians."" Scott campaign spokeswoman Jackie Schutz acknowledged the CBO report applies to federal minimum wage workers, not just Florida minimum-wage earners, but the effect of job losses ""would certainly happen in Florida."" In Crist’s ""Fair Shot Florida,"" a policy road map for middle-class families, he said he will immediately urge the Legislature to pass a minimum wage of $10.10 -- a nod to how powerless he is to actually enact this for all Floridians, as it would likely not be popular in the state’s Republican-dominated Legislature. Our ruling Scott said, ""The CBO says if we raise the minimum wage the way Charlie wants to do it, it would lose 500,000 jobs.""  Scott is referencing the CBO’s rough estimate for the effect of Obama’s plan to lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour on employment. It’s not necessarily what would happen, as he said, but what could happen. In other words, a loss of 500,000 jobs is the agency’s best guess, and other possibilities include a slight effect on jobs to about 1 million lost jobs. More importantly, its analysis pertained to the country as a whole. Scott's comments came in a discussion about Florida jobs, which means the number is being taken out of context.  The average Floridian may not know that the CBO report does not apply to ""the way Charlie wants"" to raise the minimum wage in Florida. Florida’s minimum wage is slightly higher at $7.93 in 2014. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/rick-scott/would-raising-minimum-wage-cost-500000-jobs/

Charlie Crist says in debate that stimulus saved 20,000 teacher jobs
","During the first debate between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, Scott repeatedly hammered Crist for jobs lost during his tenure. Scott said that 832,000 jobs were lost during Crist’s tenure. Crist -- who served from January 2007 through January 2011 as a Republican but is now running as a Democrat -- countered that he governed during a global economic meltdown. ""One of the decisions I made to get us through it was to work with the president so that we would have funds available to keep teachers on the job. Now, Rick Scott has said taking the recovery was an absolute mistake, which would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers."" Crist used the term firing, which isn't quite accurate, since these would have been layoffs. However, we don't see this as a serious issue, because the context makes clear the kind of job losses he's talking about. Is it true that by taking federal stimulus dollars Crist saved 20,000 teachers from being laid off? Stimulus money saved jobs Crist made a similar statement when he announced he was running for governor in St. Petersburg in November. It is one of many back-and-forth attacks about education funding and teacher layoffs hurled between the two candidates. Crist’s statement refers to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by President Barack Obama and passed by Congress in 2009. The Florida Department of Education published information in 2010 about how many ""instructional personnel"" the Recovery Act affected. The department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affecting a total 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. Instructional personnel included classroom teachers as well as other school employees including guidance counselors, librarians and audio-visual workers. The state’s education commissioner at the time, Eric Smith, said that the stimulus dollars saved 26,000 teacher jobs. (Smith was appointed by Crist.) The stimulus money was paid out over two years: In 2009-10, nearly $908 million went to K-12 education, and another $873 million the year after, according to Ruth Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. ""The infusion of this federal cash was tremendously important in keeping school districts solvent during the recession,"" Melton told PolitiFact Florida when we first looked into this claim in 2013. But it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off without the federal infusion of money, because we can’t predict how each district would have handled their own budgets. Some districts with healthier reserves might have avoided or minimized layoffs more than other districts. Or perhaps they would have found ways other than teacher cuts to reduce their budgets. ""It could have meant actually more teachers than reported,"" Melton said. At the other extreme, some districts could have laid off more expensive teachers who were close to retirement -- and that could have lowered the number. Our ruling Crist said that if Florida had not taken the stimulus it ""would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers."" The Education Department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affected by the stimulus money. That’s close to what Crist said, but that figure includes not just teachers but other types of school workers as well. In addition, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off statewide, since districts would have had discretion in how to handle budget cutting and may have had other options to reduce spending beyond laying off teachers. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-debate-stimulus-saved-20000-tea/

Rick Scott blames Charlie Crist for 832,000 job losses
","One issue that Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign has not been afraid to exploit is how many Floridians lost their jobs during Charlie Crist’s term as governor. During the Oct. 10 Telemundo debate in Miramar, Scott noted about a half dozen times that 832,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed while Crist was in office. Scott spent much of the debate blaming Crist for worsening conditions during the new Democrat’s term, but he kept coming back to jobs. ""You want to talk about jobs – Charlie, 832,000 people lost their job while you were governor."" Jobs numbers have been a major talking point for the current governor as far back as his 2010 campaign, when he first promised to bring 700,000 jobs -- and then up to 1.7 million jobs -- to the state over seven years. Our Scott-O-Meter says that promise is In The Works. Scott also said the state lost 825,000 jobs under Crist, a claim we rated Half True in 2012, because Crist, like any governor caught in the midst of a recession, had little control over job losses. At the debate, Scott offered a slightly larger figure -- 832,000. Is this number accurate? PolitiFact Florida took a closer look. Numbers game If you’ve followed what we’ve written on this question over the years, you’ve no doubt noticed that the numbers change from time to time. Economists regularly revise these numbers based on new information. Further complicating matters, Scott’s campaign website has cited private-sector job losses of 828,800 under Crist, specifically from January 2007, when Crist took office, to December 2010, Crist’s last month in office. Understanding the different time spans being measured, and what exactly they are measuring, helps explain the nuances of this claim. First of all, we’ll note that there’s a difference between private-sector jobs and all jobs; the main difference with the latter is that it includes government jobs. For the same months as Scott’s chart -- January 2007 through December 2010 -- the BLS reports that Florida lost 822,200 private-sector jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis (a process that smooths out month-to-month comparisons). The number for total nonfarm job losses during the same time period, seasonally adjusted, was 836,700. So where is the Scott campaign getting 832,000? They changed the time frame to between December 2006 -- the month before Crist took office -- and December 2010. In that case, the total for seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs was 832,700. The reason the number decreased is because the number jobs went up slightly between December 2006 and January 2007. This means the December calculation starts from a lower baseline than the January calculation. When we measured private-sector jobs -- which, incidentally, is the kind that Scott routinely touts for his own record, perhaps because the numbers look rosier for him -- we came up with a loss of 819,600 over the same period. In the big picture, the magnitude of the difference isn’t all that great. The 832,700 figure is only 1.5 percent bigger than the 819,600 figure. Whichever number you choose, these job losses don’t look good. Where Crist has some cover is that he’s hardly the primary reason for these job losses. Experts have consistently told PolitiFact Florida that it's hard to tell how much influence the governor of any one state has on job losses (or -- sorry, Gov. Scott -- job creation). It may take years to find out whether policies have had any effect on job totals at all. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics who studies Florida, noted back in 2012 that by the time Crist took office in 2007, ""the seeds of destruction"" had already been sown. An overheated housing market and dirty dealings in the lending industry had long been entrenched problems. ""That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist,"" Lafakis said. Our ruling Scott said ""832,000 people lost their job"" while Crist was governor, blaming his opponent for not doing enough while in office to improve Florida’s growing ranks of the unemployed. It’s possible to quibble with the specific number of job losses that occurred under Crist, but the differences are small -- 1.5 percent in one direction or the other. The bigger issue is that it’s a stretch for Scott to ascribe blame for job losses on a governor’s watch, since it’s unclear whether any given governor’s policies have had an effect on employment trends. If Scott is trying to impugn Crist’s record on jobs during a recession -- something that depends heavily on the national and international economic picture -- he’s largely off base, even if his numbers are pretty close. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-blames-charle-crist-832000-job-losses/
