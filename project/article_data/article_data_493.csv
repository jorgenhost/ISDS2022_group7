Most Syrian refugees are women and children, as Keith Ellison said
","Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., pushed back on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to indefinitely suspend admission of Syrian refugees, calling it a Muslim ban and arguing that the order affects many women and children. ""When you try to ban refugees, these folks go through an 18-to-24-month vetting as it is,"" Ellison said Jan. 29 on CBS’ Face the Nation. ""The fact is, is that Syrian -- if you talk about banning Syrians, about three-quarters of those folks are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old."" Ellison, who is vying to lead the Democratic National Committee, accurately cited data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We previously explored the demographic makeup of Syrian refugees when Trump, as a candidate, made false claims that most Syrian refugees were actually strong men. (For background on Trump’s immigration executive order, check out our explainer.) UN’s refugee agency data There are more than 4.89 million Syrian refugees according to the UN’s latest count. That total accounts for about 2 million refugees registered by the UNHCR (in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon), 2.8 million registered by the Turkish government and more than 29,000 registered in North Africa. Ellison referenced a UNHCR regional demographic breakdown based on refugees registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. To determine a figure for women and children, Ellison summed the percentage of registered Syrian males under 18 years old with the percentage of women of all ages -- it comes out to about 73 percent, according to data last updated Jan. 19. Factoring in women of all ages and boys under 12 years old, it's about 66 percent. Ellison’s other point about ""a full third"" of refugees being younger than 12 years old also checks out for the UNHCR group. About 17 percent relocated to Egypt, Jordan, Iraq or Lebanon are boys and about 16 percent are girls. We wanted to know if the demographics were similar for the larger pool of 2.8 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. They are. In Turkey, about 70 percent of registered Syrian refugees are women of all ages and males under 18. About 30 percent are children under 12 years old, according to data last updated Jan. 12. Women of all ages and boys under 12 years old represent about 62 percent of the population. A demographic report for the estimated 29,000 refugees in North Africa (Egypt included in other UNHCR report) was not available. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, said there's a large Syrian community in Libya and that it's likely many Syrian refugees there have not been registered. The flow of Syrians to Libya after 2011 has been much greater than 29,000, Mock said. Syrian refugees have also gone to Tunisia, though the number there is less than 1,000 registered Syrian refugees according to a UNHCR fact sheet, he said. The United States accepted 12,587 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015-Sept. 30, 2016) and fewer than 2,000 in fiscal 2015. Prior to that, the most Syrian refugees the Obama administration had accepted was 105, according to data from the State Department's Refugee Processing Center. Here's a breakdown of fiscal year 2016 admissions: - Total: 12,587 - Male: 6,571 - Female: 6,016 - Boys and girls under 14 years old: 6,118 (about 48.61 percent of admissions) Our ruling Ellison said, ""About three-quarters of (Syrian refugees) are women and children. A full third of them are kids under 12 years old."" With only slight rounding, Ellison is correct on average for Syrian refugees registered in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. A demographic breakdown is not available for more than 29,000 refugees in other North African countries, which represent less than 1 percent of all registered Syrian refugees.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says majority of Florida undocumented immigrants overstayed visas
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio supports President Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall at the Mexican border but says it won’t address the main path that undocumented immigrants use to arrive in Florida. ""In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane,"" Rubio, a Florida Republican, told reporters while visiting growers in Immokalee Jan. 27. ""They overstayed a visa -- the wall isn't going to address that."" Rubio, who along with Trump advocated for implementing a system to track visa overstays, is one of many politicians to raise concerns about immigrants overstaying their visas -- in 2015 he said that nationally 40 percent of illegal immigrants had overstayed a visa, a claim we rated Mostly True. But in Florida, is the rate really 70 percent? We found no comprehensive data from the federal government to back up Rubio’s point and his spokespersons didn’t respond. However, a former government official and longtime researcher about the undocumented population came up with an estimate for Florida that was close to Rubio’s number. Visa overstays Although there are legislative requirements to track nonimmigrants’ entry into and exit from the United States, the federal government has struggled to accurately count visa overstays. What we know about the number of immigrants who overstayed their visas nationally is largely based on either recent incomplete data from the federal government or data that is several years old or estimates. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that out of 45 million U.S. arrivals by air and sea whose tourist or business visas expired in fiscal year 2015, about 416,500 people remained in the country in 2016. However, that data only covers a small slice of the undocumented population, capturing one year of data and omitting people who arrived via land. Also, the report did not provide a breakdown by state. In 2006, the Pew Research Center estimated that as much as ""45 percent of the total unauthorized migrant population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. for a limited amount of time."" That report relied on a 1997 study from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. There have been other estimates of overstays (though they are also old): In January 2003, an INS report said that 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, estimated visa overstays ranged from 27 to 57 percent.   Since the U.S. government has not provided an overstay rate for the entire unauthorized population in recent years, the only way to come up with a figure is an estimate. Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 INS report, said that in recent years relatively more immigrants have overstayed their visas than have ""entered without inspection.""  Source: Center for Migration Studies The percentage of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico dropped significantly during the past 15 years -- and that’s a key country for the group of immigrants who cross the border illegally without a visa. Warren, who is now a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, did some calculations for PolitiFact Florida. Warren used the Center for Migration Studies’ estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Those estimates show about 10.9 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, including 710,000 in Florida. Then Warren examined the number of undocumented immigrants from 148 countries living in the United States and in Florida. He made some assumptions about what percent of undocumented immigrants from various countries overstayed their visa compared with those who sneaked across the border. For example, he estimated that 15 percent of undocumented Mexicans were visa overstayers while most arrived by crossing the border. Meanwhile, 75 percent of undocumented immigrants from the Dominican Republic were visa overstayers, he estimated. Using those assumptions, he concluded that in Florida an estimated 430,000 of 710,000 undocumented immigrants -- 61 percent -- were visa overstayers. It’s not a surprise that Florida’s undocumented immigrant population would include a higher percentage of visa overstayers than the national average. While most people crossing the border illegally come from a few countries including Mexico, undocumented immigrants who come from countries in South America, Asia or Europe are nearly all visa overstayers, he said. ""What it comes down to is Florida has a higher mix of people who don’t come from Mexico or Central America than the country as a whole,"" he said. However, Warren said that the percentage of visa overstayers in Florida probably would be higher if you just looked at arrivals in the past 10 years. ""To make estimates in this area of research you must make some assumptions based on the best information you have -- that is what I have done here,"" he said. We sent Warren’s estimate to other immigration experts, including Jeffrey Passel at the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan ""fact tank"" that doesn’t take policy positions, and Jessica Vaughan, who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. Both Passel and Vaughan said Warren’s estimates were reasonable, although Vaughan said his starting point numbers for the size of the undocumented population are too low. While Warren estimated the nationwide population at 10.9 million including 710,000 in Florida,  Pew shows 11.1 million nationwide and 850,000 in Florida in 2014. ""Warren’s calculations on the overstay rates are reasonable, although I sometimes disagree with some of his assumptions,"" Vaughan said. Our ruling Rubio said, ""In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane. They overstayed a visa."" Rubio’s spokespersons provided no evidence for his claim so we are uncertain of his source. The federal government does not appear to provide comprehensive data on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed their visa. However, a demographer who has studied the undocumented population for decades estimated that about 61 percent in Florida overstayed their visas. We rate this claim Mostly True https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d65fcb2-e8f3-47a0-ad04-e19ac599c283",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAC1240>],/factchecks/2017/feb/02/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-majority-florida-undocumented-imm/

Trump claims Obama made deal to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia
","Did Donald Trump really hang up on the Australian prime minister? That’s what a Washington Post report based on anonymous sources says. Reportedly, the heated Jan. 28 exchange was about a refugee agreement between the United States and Australia, countries that are usually close allies. We can’t know how the call really went down, but a few days later, Trump slammed the agreement publicly on Twitter. ""Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!"" Trump tweeted Feb. 1. Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! Trump’s tweet mischaracterizes the deal in two ways. First, the deal involves fewer than 2,000 people. That’s not ""thousands."" Second, the individuals would not come to the United States illegally, but through the legal refugee program. Background on the Australian deal Australia has a strict policy against illegal maritime arrivals. The country has intercepted migrants at sea and sent them to regional processing centers on Pacific islands away from Australia, specifically Nauru and Manus. (Manus is part of Papua New Guinea). Instances of abuse have been reported at the centers, with the United Nations calling for the closure of the Nauru facilities after claims of ""violence, sexual assault, degrading treatment and self-harm."" Papua New Guinea’s Supreme Court in April 2016 ruled that detaining refugees at the Manus facility was illegal, because they had not willfully entered the island. Australian officials said in August they would close the Manus facility but still would not accept the detainees into their country. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in November 2016 that his government reached an agreement with the United States for the resettlement of refugees held in its regional processing centers. Most of those refugees are from Iran, Iraq and Somalia. The centers held 1,254 individuals — not ""thousands"" as Trump said — as of a November 2016 immigration detention report. ""The priority under this arrangement will be for resettlement of those who are most vulnerable, namely women, children and families,"" Turnbull said in a statement. He also said the United States would assess the refugees and decide which ones would be resettled in America. He said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was supporting the arrangement. Worldwide, the United States accepted 84,994 refugees in fiscal year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015-Sept. 30, 2016) out of a cap of 85,000, according to data from the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center. Obama’s administration last year said it would raise the refugee admission ceiling to 110,000 in fiscal year 2017. But in his Jan. 27 executive order, Trump said the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal 2017 ""would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest."" Up to Jan. 27, the United States had admitted 32,125 refugees. After extensive vetting, refugees arrive legally in the United States and are required by law to apply for a green card one year after their arrival. The fate of the deal The U.S.-Australian deal resurfaced after Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 temporarily halting the refugee admission program and the admission of nationals from seven countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- flagged by the Obama administration as terrorist hotbeds. The White House’s official readout of the next day’s phone call simply states, ""Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally."" Turnbull told reporters on Jan. 30 that he and Trump had a ""constructive"" conversation, adding, ""We also discussed the resettlement arrangement of refugees from Nauru and Manus, which had been entered into with the previous administration, and I thank President Trump for his commitment to honour that existing agreement."" The White House has given conflicting signals about the fate of the deal. Sean Spicer, Trump’s press secretary, said during a Jan. 31 press briefing that the deal to take in 1,250 refugees would go on, applying extreme vetting to potential arrivals as was agreed in the deal. The day after Trump’s tweet, Turnbull told the Wall Street Journal that Australia was still negotiating refugee agreements with other governments, but couldn’t accept them given its laws banning the resettlement of asylum seekers coming by boat. ""Our expectation naturally, given the commitments that have been made, is that it will go ahead,"" Turnbull said. ""The only option that isn’t available to (the refugees) is bringing them to Australia for the obvious reasons that that would provide a signal to the people smugglers to get back into business."" Spicer, at a press briefing Feb. 2, said the president was ""unbelievably disappointed"" by the ""horrible deal"" cut by the Obama administration, but said the process would continue under ""extreme vetting"" conditions. Given his opposition to the deal, Trump would be able to walk back on it, as it appears to be an executive-to-executive agreement, said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. ""The new U.S. executive could back away from what Obama agreed to,"" Yale-Loehr said. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia."" Trump’s referring to a deal for the United States to take in 1,250 people -- mostly from Iran, Iraq and Somalia -- held by Australia in offshore detention centers. The detainees were caught at sea by Australian officials as they tried to illegally land on the island. The United States is expected to vet the individuals and determine who will be accepted as refugees. Refugees arrive in the United States legally. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

NC Gov. Roy Cooper makes questionable claim about private school vouchers lacking accountability
","North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper says that even though the state gives millions of dollars to hundreds of private schools, it has no sense of how students at those schools are performing. And the day lawmakers returned to Raleigh to start crafting the state budget, Cooper said he would like to see funding for private school vouchers re-routed to public schools. ""I am very concerned and have opposed vouchers because of the lack of accountability,"" Cooper said at a breakfast with education leaders Wednesday. ""We really don’t know what these schools are doing or how they are performing. Instead, we need to invest in our public schools."" The state began offering ""Opportunity Scholarships"" for families to leave public schools for private schools in 2014. In this school year North Carolina will spend $45 million on the program. Legislators plan to triple that in the next decade, to $145 million by 2027. The state’s public school budget in 2015-16, for comparison, was $8.9 billion. Cooper was critical of vouchers throughout his campaign for governor. And he was endorsed by the powerful teachers group N.C. Association of Educators, which also opposes vouchers. But vouchers are popular with supporters of the school choice movement and with Republican politicians, who have the final say in the state budget. What are vouchers? North Carolina allows qualifying parents to receive up to $4,200 annually in state funds per child for private school tuition. It’s one of 13 states (and the District of Columbia) with such a program. Qualifications include being disabled, being from a low-income family, living in a foster home or having a parent in the military. Supporters say it gives many students an option that was previously reserved for wealthier families. Critics question its accountability, or point to the many religious schools that receive taxpayer dollars (which was found constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002). In North Carolina last year, more than 90 percent of voucher money went to Christian or Islamic schools. Regulations and accountability Darrell Allison, president of the pro-voucher Parents For Educational Freedom in North Carolina, said Cooper is wrong. ""When you hear critics say ‘They don’t have accountability; they don’t have testing,’ what they're really saying is ‘They don’t have the same accountability and testing,’"" Allison said. An expert in education policy agreed with him, at least in part. ""There is some accountability attached to the opportunity scholarship program,"" said UNC-Chapel Hill professor Eric Houck. For instance, every voucher student has to take a standardized test and have the results reported to the state. But Houck said Cooper also has a good argument in his favor, in part because the overall results don’t have to be made public – and many of the traditional accountability measures on public schools don’t apply to voucher schools. ""Accountability is a big word,"" Houck said. ""If the governor is talking about accountability in the way that the General Assembly has been talking about accountability since the 1980s, he's right. But there are other ways of defining accountability."" Accountability was one factor in a North Carolina Supreme Court case that challenged the constitutionality of the voucher program. The plaintiffs in the case, arguing against vouchers, made a claim similar to the one Cooper is making now. They were backed up by a group of education scholars who filed a brief saying the voucher program ""has virtually no accountability system whatsoever."" However, the Supreme Court was not swayed by those and other arguments and allowed vouchers to continue. So let’s look at the program as it stands now. Testing Public schools must use standardized tests to gauge if students are at grade level. Private schools only have to give standardized tests to students attending on vouchers. They also must use a nationally standardized test, not a state test. Allison said the state will use the results to measure academic gains or losses of voucher students compared to students from similar backgrounds in public schools. But Houck said due to the differences between the tests we’ll eventually know how voucher students compare to their peers in other states, but not whether they’re reading at North Carolina’s definition of grade level or know the content required of public school students. Performance data The test results must be sent to the state. A legislative committee must then use the data to make recommendations ""regarding improving administration and accountability."" But the results aren’t automatically made public, as public schools’ test results are. And furthermore the oversight committee isn’t expected to give the General Assembly its 2015-16 report until this fall, Allison said. By that time the legislature will already have approved the state budget for the next two years. So Cooper is correct that state leaders don’t have performance data. It’s also worth noting the data for these few hundred private schools is lagging behind the state’s thousands of public schools, which published their 2015-16 testing data in November 2016. Comparing schools While the statewide data isn’t public, some of the largest individual recipients of vouchers will have to make their performance results public. But the law applies an enrollment cutoff that meant, in 2015-16, that more than 90 percent of the schools were exempt. The opposite is true of the public school system, where almost every school makes its results public. Allison said the cutoff that keeps most individual schools’ results secret is in place to keep from releasing information that might identify individual students. However, public schools use a cutoff of 5 students, while voucher schools use a cutoff of 25. In terms of non-academic accountability, voucher schools also fall short of public schools in several ways. Only three schools that received vouchers in 2015-16 received enough to trigger a financial review. The hundreds of other, unaudited schools accounted for 95 percent of the $25 million spent that year. Public schools also have stricter measures for how much education teachers must have, and for conducting employee background checks. And that’s despite the fact that North Carolina’s public schools received an ""F"" in a 2016 USA Today report on teacher background checks. Our ruling Cooper said, regarding private schools receiving public funds, ""we really don’t know what these schools are doing or how they are performing."" While private schools do have much less oversight and accountability than public schools, it isn’t entirely lacking. Schools do have to give voucher students standardized tests and report the results to the state for oversight. But there are many areas in which voucher recipients don’t face the same oversight and public reporting requirements as public schools, or have a lesser standard. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/088bcd03-e7cf-4e20-9c7d-690b64ce562e",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAAB940>],/factchecks/2017/feb/02/roy-cooper/nc-gov-roy-cooper-says-private-school-vouchers-lac/

Does Neil Gorsuch side with 'felons over gun safety,' as Pelosi says?
","President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee favors felons over gun safety, says House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi said nominee Neil Gorsuch has ruled against liberal positions on a litany of issues like employee rights, food and water safety, reproductive rights and guns. Gorsuch is a conservative federal judge for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver. ""If you care about that for your children, he's not your guy,"" Pelosi said during a Jan. 31 town hall on CNN. ""(Former Democratic Rep.) Gabby Giffords' group, the group for responsible solutions relating to gun safety, said that he comes down on the side of felons over gun safety."" Pelosi’s claim that Gorsuch ""comes down on the side of felons over gun safety"" caught our attention. Her office sent us a press release that Giffords’ gun control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, put out along with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""In his time on the 10th Circuit, (Gorsuch) made repeated efforts to weaken the federal law that’s prohibited felons from possessing guns for the past 50 years, a law that has saved thousands of lives and enjoys near-unanimous support among Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle,"" wrote Robyn Thomas, the law center’s executive director. It’s fair to assume that Gorsuch takes a right-leaning approach to the Second Amendment; the National Rifle Association supports him. But it’s misleading to say Gorsuch’s past rulings demonstrate that he thinks more felons should be allowed guns than what is already permitted under the law. Games-Perez The primary case in question is United States vs. Games-Perez. The defendant, Miguel Games-Perez, was a convicted felon, and he possessed a gun — an apparent violation of the federal law that bans felons from knowingly possessing guns. (Remember the word ""knowingly."") Games-Perez, however, wanted to make the case that he shouldn’t be convicted for this offense because he didn’t know he was a felon. He said that the state trial judge who ruled on the prior crime (the felony) repeatedly suggested to Games-Perez that he wasn’t being convicted of a felony but instead a lesser charge. In line with precedent, the 10th Circuit denied Games-Perez’s request. But Gorsuch disagreed. Gorsuch said he believes the federal law is written in such a way that a defendant must have both knowledge of being a felon and knowledge of possessing a gun in order to be convicted. Thus, Games-Perez should have the opportunity to make his case in court. If it’s decided that Games-Perez really didn’t know he was a felon, he shouldn’t go to prison on this charge. The upshot is that Gorsuch’s opinion did not say felons should be allowed guns or that the law violates the Second Amendment. It said a defendant who didn’t know he was breaking the law should have the chance to make his case in court instead of going straight to prison. He did, though, make the point that this is especially important in this case because possessing a gun is a constitutionally protected right. While this case has a gun component, Pelosi’s claim has it ""quite backwards because I don’t think Gorsuch’s opinion is about guns. For him, it’s about treating people fairly before sending them to prison,"" said Eric Citron, a partner at Goldstein & Russell who profiled Gorsuch for SCOTUSblog, and a self-described liberal. In theory, if courts adopted Gorsuch’s interpretation of this law, it could marginally weaken the federal law because some people charged with possessing a gun as a felon might successfully convince a jury they didn’t know they were felons and thus not go to prison for that offense.  But it doesn’t change the fact that felons are not allowed to possess guns, and people generally know whether they’ve been convicted of a felony. Adam Skaggs, litigation director for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, emphasized the fact that Gorsuch’s reading of the statute deviated from the majority of justices on the panel, as well as other federal courts. And if Gorsuch’s opinion were to be adopted, ""The immediate effect is to create the possibility that this guy would be back on the street,"" Skaggs said. Reese Gorsuch’s 2014 decision in United States vs. Reese has also been cited against Gorsuch. But it takes a tremendous leap of logic to view this decision as an attempt to rethink the federal ban on gun possession by felons. In this case, a court had convicted defendant James Reese of being a felon in possession of a firearm. But Reese appealed the decision to the 10th Circuit and won because the state of New Mexico had restored his civil rights. If a felon’s civil rights have been restored under state law — including the right to vote, serve on a jury, hold public office and own firearms under state law — federal law allows the felon to legally own a gun. The 10th Circuit’s decision was uncontroversial. The opinion was unanimous and written in just 300 words. Even the government attorneys who brought the original charges conceded ""that Mr. Reese’s federal firearms conviction is unsustainable."" Had the court come to a different conclusion, it would have been ""appalling,"" said Eugene Volokh, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, who clerked on the Supreme Court with Gorsuch. Pope We won’t spend much time on this third case, United States vs. Pope. We wanted to note, though, that here, Gorsuch had the opportunity to address the question: Is there a situation in which the federal ban on gun possession by people with domestic violence convictions is unconstitutional? Here, he intentionally chose not to answer the constitutional question. Instead, he relied on procedural rules to affirm a grand jury’s decision to charge the defendant, convicted of domestic abuse, with violating the federal ban. Rule of law Volokh and Citron both noted a touch of irony: In both Games-Perez and Reese, Gorsuch advocated in favor of a big-picture principle generally associated with liberals more so than conservatives: defending the rights of criminal defendants. This is an area where the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch might fill, found common ground with liberals, too. ""This is a standard liberal position historically,"" Volokh said. ""It’s a standard rule-of-law conservative position, as well. The criticism of (Gorsuch) for this is misplaced."" Skaggs sees it differently. He said Gorsuch is willing to ""bend over backwards"" to make rulings outside the mainstream opinion on the law banning felons from owning guns, noting that it’s important to consider whether Gorsuch would advocate for criminal defendants’ rights in the same manner in cases that don’t involve guns. Our ruling Pelosi said Gorsuch ""comes down on the side of felons over gun safety."" There’s one case, Games-Perez, where Gorsuch wouldn’t immediately send the defendant, a felon, to prison for having a gun, despite the federal ban on felons possessing guns. But Gorsuch’s reasoning wasn’t about whether the law infringed on the defendant’s Second Amendment rights. Instead, he thought the law allowed the defendant an opportunity to make the case in court that the he didn’t know he was a felon. Two other cases that came up in our research, Pope and Reese, turned out to be irrelevant. Pelosi’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A0DC0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/02/nancy-pelosi/pelosis-misleading-claim-gorsuch-sides-felons-over/

Half True: Senator's claim it's 'already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone'
","A Democratic opponent of a legislative proposal dictating who enters which bathrooms says existing law already bars Texans from slipping into facilities intending to do wrong. Houston state Sen. Sylvia Garcia declared in a Jan. 5, 2017 press release: ""All Texans want to go to the bathroom in peace, including transgender people. That’s why it’s already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone."" We wondered about that as the Texas proposal, dubbed the Texas Privacy Act by authoring Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, was assigned to a Senate committee in early 2017. Senate Bill 6 primarily would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings, public schools and universities corresponding with the sex they were assigned at birth. The proposal also would prohibit city and county officials from adopting ordinances that prevent private businesses from making policies for their bathrooms and dressing rooms. Nationally through the first few weeks of 2017, GOP lawmakers in eight states, including Texas, had proposed bathroom-related legislation, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures. And over the previous few years, at least 24 states considered ""bathroom bills,"" though North Carolina was the only state to have passed and implemented a measure, according to the group. In Texas, Democrats have denounced Kolkhorst’s measure as discriminatory against transgender people and warned that it could harm Texas businesses and tourism. Proponents led by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick say the measure will keep men from entering women’s restrooms to commit crimes. So, is entering a bathroom with plans to hurt someone already against Texas law? Asked to appraise Garcia’s claim, a Kolkhorst spokesman, Matthew Russell, said by email it’s incorrect that Texas law already forbids a person from entering a restroom for the purpose of committing a crime. Russell also provided a statement from Kolkhorst conceding that laws ""exist to protect people everywhere from harm,"" but her legislation, Kolkhorst said, ""specifically recognizes that predators often seek to target victims in vulnerable locations such as showers, locker rooms and restrooms."" Garcia's backup In contrast, a Garcia aide guided us to a Houston ordinance and a state criminal law pertaining to public bathrooms. John Chapa Gorczynski, Garcia’s chief of staff, noted a Houston city ordinance that makes it a crime to enter an opposite-sex restroom without permission. The 1968 ordinance states: ""It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally enter any public restroom designated for the exclusive use of the sex opposite to such person's sex without the permission of the owner, tenant, manager, lessee or other person in charge of the premises, in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance."" Those, of course, are one big city’s restrictions. YetChapa Gorczynski also pointed out sections of state criminal laws forbidding certain behaviors, though in them we saw no general proscription against entering the bathroom designated for an opposite sex. Chapter 42 of the Texas Penal Code, prohibits anyone from looking into ""an area such as a restroom or shower stall or changing or dressing room that is designed to provide privacy to a person using the area."" Other parts of the code pointed out by Garcia’s aide: Chapter 20.01 and 20.02 – Illegal to restrain a person against their will anywhere Chapter 21.07 and 21.08 – Outlaws public lewdness and indecent exposure in public places, including acts of ""deviate sexual intercourse"" or ""act of sexual contact"" Chapter 21.15 – Against the law to make invasive visual recordings where someone ""has a reasonable expectation that the intimate area is not subject to public view"" including, the law specifies, bathrooms and changing rooms Chapter 21.16 – Voyeurism with the intent ""to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of the actor"" also is against the law At the Texas Municipal League, which says it serves more than 16,000 mayors, councilmembers, city managers, city attorneys, and city department heads, an official said by email that Houston’s bathroom entry ordinance might be unique. Bennett Sandlin said: ""I’m not aware of any other ordinances that get into the specifics of bathroom access. Most of the cities that have them are more generic in terms of supporting civil rights,"" meaning access to public services and accommodations regardless of a person’s race, sexual orientation or gender identity, he said. Our ruling Garcia said it’s already illegal in Texas to enter a bathroom to harm someone. In many ways, significantly, Texas laws forbid a person from harming another person. Also, a longstanding Houston ordinance bars a person from entering the incorrect bathroom. But Garcia didn’t show nor did we find similar no-entry restrictions in place statewide or in other cities.

Nancy Pelosi overstates Wall Street refusal to support Democrats
","During a town hall televised on CNN, an audience member said to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that Wall Street tends to support Democrats these days -- a belief that irritated the ""Reagan Democrats"" who work alongside him at a steel mill in the industrial Midwest. Pelosi was incredulous. ""They don’t support me!"" Pelosi said to laughter. She proceeded to thank the questioner and added that it’s a ""challenge"" to overcome the perception that the Democrats are captive to Wall Street. ""When you said, ‘Wall Street,’ I'm like, no -- Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election,"" Pelosi said. Is Pelosi correct about Wall Street giving patterns to House Democrats and Republicans? Partly, but she leaves out some important context. We turned to the opensecrets.org website of the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign-finance data. The group compiles donation data by industry sector, so we looked at the category ""securities and investment."" We looked specifically at dollars from PACs and individuals employed in the securities and investment sector that were given to Republican and Democratic House members. Here’s the rundown going back to 1990, the earliest year available in the database.   Election cycle To Democrats To Republicans More money given to Incumbent majority party 2016 $11.3 million $18.6 million R R 2014 $11.3 million $18.0 million R R 2012 $9.2 million $17.1 million R R 2010 $13.7 million $10.0 million D D 2008 $13.0 million $8.2 million D D 2006 $8.1 million $9.6 million R R 2004 $6.9 million $8.9 million R R 2002 $3.9 million $5.6 million R R 2000 $4.4 million $7.4 million R R 1998 $2.5 million $3.5 million R R 1996 $2.9 million $3.8 million R R 1994 $3.2 million $1.6 million D D 1992 $3.1 million $1.3 million D D 1990 $2.4 million $1.3 million D D We see two key takeaways. One of them supports Pelosi’s statement; the other doesn’t. The one that supports Pelosi’s statement is that the Republicans have received a majority of securities and investment money for three election cycles running, at a rate 60 percent to 80 percent higher than Democrats received. The one that doesn’t support her statement is that Wall Street fealty to the GOP is not preordained. The unshakeable pattern going back to 1990 is that the securities and investment sector has given to whichever party is holding the majority in the House at the beginning of the election cycle. Recently, that’s been the Republicans -- but for five previous cycles, that’s been the Democrats, including two when Pelosi herself served as speaker. In other words, contrary to Pelosi’s implication, Wall Street doesn’t have a firm ideological or partisan allegiance to the GOP. Rather, it has hedged its bets by disproportionately sending its money to whichever party holds the reins of power. Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist said it does seem like Wall Street has tended to support whatever party is in charge in the House. He dated that patten back to at least the 1980s, when then-Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., headed of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats’ campaign arm. In that position, Coelho ""made a concerted, and highly successful, effort to attract far more business money to the Democrats,"" Loomis said. ""One of his major talking points was that since the Democrats were going to run the House for the foreseeable future, business would be smart to support and invest in the majority party."" Loomis added that Coelho’s strategy worked until the election of 1994 -- when the GOP won control of the House for the first time in four decades. We’ll note that not all sectors have swung back and forth the way Wall Street has. For instance, for lawyers and labor unions, donations to Democrats have easily outpaced donations to Republicans in every campaign cycle going back to 1990. By contrast, donations from agribusiness and construction have been majority-Republican every cycle over the same period. For these industries, then, ideology or partisanship seems to play a bigger role in political giving than it does for Wall Street. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said the minority leader ""was referring to her own experience in fundraising since becoming part of leadership in 2002. She does a tremendous amount of fundraising from grassroots and individuals donors on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and that’s what she was referring to in response to the question at the town hall."" The data cited above includes money given to every member of the House. Our ruling Pelosi said, ""Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election."" She has something of a point if you only consider the last three election cycles. However, it’s important to note that in each of those cycles, the Republicans have held the majority in the House. When the Democrats were in control -- including two cycles in which Pelosi herself was speaker -- Wall Street has sent the majority of its money to House Democrats. We rate her statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFE4BC0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/01/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-overstates-wall-street-refusal-support-demo/
"['Global News Service', 'Foreign Policy', 'Rob Portman']","
How much does the United States contribute to the UN?
","The Donald Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would cut U.S. payments to the United Nations by as much as 40 percent. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, highlighted the substantial role the United States plays in funding the U.N. during the confirmation hearing for U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. ""When all of our taxpayers are paying roughly 22 percent of the budget, I think they do expect to see a more efficient and an organization that's more objective and more in keeping with our values,"" Portman said on Jan. 18, 2017. ""How do you intend to support U.S. national security interests, but also ensure that the U.N. is a more effective body toward promoting a more peaceful and less volatile world?"" The U.N. and U.S. budget documents show Portman’s number is correct, and if peacekeeping is included, the percentage gets even higher. The current U.N. regular budget calls for $5.4 billion over two years. By a formula based on the size of a country’s economy and other factors, America’s assessment is set at 22 percent, or about $1.2 billion. Based on the last Obama administration budget, the United States provided $1.2 billion to the U.N. over two years, and Portman is correct. But that’s just for the U.N.’s regular budget. There are over a dozen other U.N. agencies and operations that American dollars also support. The single largest is peacekeeping with a price tag of about $7.8 billion this year alone. The U.S. share of that cost is over 28 percent, or $2.2 billion. The next three U.N. agencies -- all roughly in the $100 million per year range -- are the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency. All told, the United States provides about $3.3 billion a year to finance U.N. activities. A 40 percent cut would save taxpayers about $1.3 billion out of the current $4.1 trillion U.S. federal budget. The impact on the U.N. would be substantial, although the precise effect would depend on how the cuts are spread around. Our ruling Portman said American taxpayers cover 22 percent of the U.N. budget. Budget documents from the U.N. and the United States confirm that. The percentage for peacekeeping operations is even higher.

Yes, Trump's 'Mexico City' abortion policy puts global health money at risk
","Among the flurry of policies President Donald Trump put in force in his first week was to reimpose a ban on taxpayer dollars going to overseas groups that have anything to do with abortion. The so-called Mexico City policy was born under President Ronald Reagan and since then, with partisan regularity, Republican presidents invoke it and Democratic ones reject it. On the Senate floor, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., warned that Trump’s version was even more extreme than those of his GOP predecessors. ""Previously, under President Reagan and the Bush administrations, this policy applied only to family planning funding,"" Shaheen said. ""But under President Trump's order, it applies to every program that falls under global health assistance. This means that it puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families."" We compared the policies of all four Republican presidents and found that on paper, Shaheen’s number is largely correct, but there’s uncertainty surrounding Trump’s policy. The first Mexico City policy Reagan administration officials announced a new U.S. family planning policy at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City. It required all nongovernmental organizations, foreign and domestic, receiving aid from the United States to agree that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other countries. This applied to U.S. family planning programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development. President George H. W. Bush left the Reagan policy in place. President Bill Clinton rescinded it, and President George W. Bush brought it back with the focus still on family planning through the U.S. Agency for International Development. But in 2003, Bush expanded the reach of the policy, instructing the secretary of state to apply it to ""all assistance for voluntary population planning."" Even as he did that, Bush excluded a number of groups and programs. ""Such organizations do not include multilateral organizations that are associations of governments,"" Bush wrote. ""This policy shall not apply to foreign assistance furnished pursuant to the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003."" With those words, Bush exempted some of the largest and highest profile global health programs. Those programs, experts told us, dwarfed any other programs at the State Department that Bush’s order might have affected. Trump’s presidential memorandum to reinstate the Mexico City policy is broader. In addition to the head of USAID, it is addressed to the departments of State and Health and Human Services. ""I direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent allowable by law, to implement a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated Memorandum to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies."" The operative phrase is ""global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies."" Trump’s order provides no exceptions. It’s unclear exactly how the Trump administration will interpret those words. We asked the White House press office for details and did not hear back. The experts we reached told us they too were in the dark. Comparing family planning and global health programs The pipeline of family planning and global health programs is more complicated than you might expect. Governments agencies often contract with nonprofits which in turn subcontract out to smaller organizations in countries around the world.  Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said this makes it difficult to know the real impact of the order. ""Not all of the organizations that directly or indirectly receive U.S. government global health support carry out the activities prohibited by the policy, but figuring that out will take some time,"" Kates told us. However, Kates said that in theory, Trump’s policy puts a lot more funding on the line. ""Whereas family planning assistance represents about $600 million per year, global health funding overall is close to $10 billion,"" Kates said. Data gathered by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation allows us to tease out exactly which programs Bush exempted from the Mexico City policy, but that Trump has included (see this IHME data graphic). Remember, Bush kept money for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis off the table, as well as U.S. support for programs involving multiple nations, the big ones being the Global Fund and United Nations programs. Add all of those up and you get $9.7 billion. That’s about 15 times as much money as the United States spends on family planning, which was the core program affected across all three previous Republican administrations. Shaheen said millions of women and families might be affected. In spending, the single largest global health program is the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. According to the latest report to Congress, PEPFAR treated 9.5 million people in 2015, at a cost of about $6.8 billion. Trump, along with his Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, has voiced support for PEPFAR. But in theory, since many HIV/AIDS programs include a family planning component, the programs that touch those people might be affected by Trump’s Mexico City policy. If the policy extends to malaria programs, the numbers climb dramatically. In 2015, American dollars protected over 16 million people with indoor spraying and many more through the distribution of nearly 30 million bed nets. Our ruling Shaheen said Trump’s Mexico City policy has a much broader reach compared to past Republican presidents, putting 15 times as much money ""at risk,"" as well as millions of women and families. On paper, the numbers support that comparison. Previous Republican administrations applied the abortion funding policy to family planning programs, which amount today to about $600 million. Trump included all global health spending, which is nearly $10 billion. There is no question Trump’s approach is broader and that millions more people could be affected. The White House has not clarified how it will interpret the policy. Its reach could be much narrower than the full scope of global programs, but Shaheen included the caveat that certain dollars were ""at risk,"" not that they definitely would be affected. It’s also true that organizations facing funding cuts could drop activities related to abortion and the funds would continue to flow. Given what we know so far, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d02c95c8-3f03-49cc-992e-bff8ad2d0a45",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDF4500>],/factchecks/2017/feb/01/jeanne-shaheen/yes-trumps-abortion-policy-puts-global-health-mone/

MOSTLY TRUE: Odds of fatal terror attack in U.S. by a refugee? 3.6 billion to 1
","President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration halts the admission of all refugees into the United States for four months as the federal government develops stronger vetting systems. It places an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. Trump has cited national security concerns as the reason for his order, and during his campaign he called Syrian refugees ""a great Trojan horse"" that could lead to future terrorist attacks. In addition to the refugee halt, his order also suspends immigration for citizens of seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days. They are: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Critics of Trump’s action say the notion that refugees represent a terrorist threat is false. They say the chance of being killed in a terror attack by a refugee is beyond remote. ""The chances of being struck by lightning TWICE is 1 in 9 million.  The chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion,"" California Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu said on Jan. 27, 2017 in a press release. ""These facts lead me to conclude that Trump's action is not based on national security, it is based on bigotry. Lady Liberty is crying."" We decided to fact-check Lieu’s claim that the ""chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion."" We interpreted his statement to apply to terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Before we start, here’s some background on refugees: The U.S. Code defines a refugee as any person outside of the U.S. that is of special humanitarian concern to the U.S. and ""has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,"" according to the Pew Research Center. America accepted large waves of refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia in the 1970s, followed by high numbers from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. More recently, refugees from Somalia, Burma, Bhutan and Syria have been granted refugee status and resettled in the United States. Refugees are the most heavily vetted of any people who enter the United States, facing an 18- to 24-month processing period, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Our research A spokesman for Lieu cited a September 2016 study by the Cato Institute called Terrorism and Immigration: A Risk Analysis, as evidence for the claim. Cato is a Washington D.C.-based think tank that advocates for limited government, free markets and greater immigration admissions. Its study does, indeed, conclude that ""the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year."" Here’s what the study reported: ""Of the 3,252,493 refugees admitted from 1975 to the end of 2015, 20 were terrorists, which amounted to 0.00062 percent of the total. In other words, one terrorist entered as a refugee for every 162,625 refugees who were not terrorists. Refugees were not very successful at killing Americans in terrorist attacks. Of the 20, only three were successful in their attacks, killing a total of three people."" To arrive at the ""1 in 3.64 billion per year"" statistic, Alex Nowrasteh, the Cato study’s author, told us he added up the nation’s population for each year between 1975 and 2015, and then divided the total by the three deaths. Lieu omitted the ""per year,"" portion in his claim, though we did not view this as an egregious oversight. In his study, Nowrasteh notes that a trio of Cuban refugees carried out the three fatal attacks in the 1970s. Not a single refugee, Syrian or otherwise, has been implicated in a terrorist attack since the Refugee Act of 1980 set up systematic procedures for accepting refugees into the United States, the report adds. The study draws on data from a Global Terrorism Database maintained at the University of Maryland, College Park. Origin of past terror attacks Trump’s executive action affects many categories of immigrants from students to employers to refugees. Refugees, however, have not been the primary perpetrators of any of the country’s major terror attacks that killed Americans in recent decades. A Somali refugee injured nine people in a knife and car attack in November 2016 on the Ohio State University campus before he was shot dead. None of the victims died. Many of the major terror attacks that have killed Americans were carried out by U.S.-born citizens or permanent legal residents from countries not included in the ban. Here’s a look at the origin of those responsible for major attacks in recent years: 9/11 terror attacks Of the 19 people who hijacked planes on Sept. 11, 2001, all entered the United States legally on a temporary visa, most on tourist visas. They were not refugees and they were not from any of the seven countries in Trump’s executive order. San Bernardino attacks Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others in December 2015 in San Bernardino. Farook was an American citizen born in Chicago. Malik was born and raised in Pakistan. She arrived in the United States on a fiancée visa and later became a permanent resident. Boston Marathon bombings Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, were born in Kyrgyzstan to parents from war-torn Chechnya. Three people were killed and at least 264 were injured in the attack. The Tsarnaev family arrived in the United States in 2002 and was granted political asylum. Asylum is typically granted to people already in the United States who have fled persecution in their home country. Refugees are generally people outside their home country, and have applied for resettlement. Orlando Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter was a U.S. citizen and son of Afghan immigrants. He shot and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others inside a gay nightclub in June 2016. Experts weigh in We asked experts on refugees and terrorism to evaluate the Cato study, and the claim at the center of this fact check. ""Having gone through the methodology they used, the figure of one in 3.6 billion is absolutely correct. It is a well-done analysis based on available data,"" said UC Irvine Professor Ruben Rumbaut, a leading expert on refugee resettlement in the United States. Joel Day, a visiting research scholar at the University of San Diego and expert on terrorism, said the Cato study draws from reliable sources, including the Global Terrorism Database, considered the best of its kind. Day said he agreed with the study’s methodology, adding ""I think their data is absolutely right."" Another expert, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration policies, said the ""one in 3.6 billion"" statistic from the Cato study includes too many qualifiers. Notably, he said, it excludes terrorist attacks by refugees that did not kill anyone and those ""we’ll never know about"" foiled by law enforcement. ""It’s not that it’s wrong,"" Krikorian said of the Cato study, but its author ""is doing everything he can to shrink the problem."" Kathleen Newland, a senior fellow and co-founder of the Migration Policy Institute, said she believes the Cato study is credible. Her own work, she said, has shown there’s ""vanishingly small probability,"" that an American would be murdered by a refugee in a terrorist attack. Newland said her only disagreement with the study is its designation of the three Cuban refugees as terrorists. In her evaluation, she said, the crimes they committed don’t strictly amount to terrorism. In opinion polls, Americans have expressed worry over accepting a large number of Syrian refugees. Newland said people tend to lump refugees in with all categories of immigrants, without considering the data showing how infrequently refugees are involved with terror attacks. ""I think people just don’t make the distinction between categories of people,"" she said. Our ruling California Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu recently said the ""chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion."" Lieu’s claim is backed by a September 2016 study by the Cato Institute. It’s important to clarify, however, that its study examined terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, something Lieu does not explicitly state. Also, the Cato study says the odds of an attack are one in 3.6 billion ""per year."" Without these words, Lieu’s claim could be viewed as slightly understating the odds, but we did not view his omission as egregious. Several experts on terrorism and refugees examined the Cato study and told us its methodology and conclusions were credible. One said the study had too many qualifiers, but did not dispute its data. A high-profile terror attack involving a Somali refugee took place in November 2016, after the period examined by the study. Nine people were injured in that attack, but there were no fatalities. This is a notable piece of information, but does not take away from the accuracy of the congressman’s claim regarding the ""chances of being killed by a refugee"" or the study he cited as its source. Lieu’s statement is accurate, though it needs a couple clarifications or additional information.   We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27a77628-e6d7-4170-98a6-a2078ecebdc5",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC9E0C0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/01/ted-lieu/odds-youll-be-killed-terror-attack-america-refugee/

McCain says Taliban 'murdered' people because of Chelsea Manning and WikiLeaks
","Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., opposes former President Barack Obama’s decision to shorten Chelsea Manning’s prison sentence — in part, he says, because her decision to release a large cache of government documents to WikiLeaks resulted in unnecessary deaths. In 2013, a judge sentenced Manning, a private in the U.S. Army, to 35 years in prison, an unprecedentedly long sentence for a leak of government information, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January 2017, Obama decided to commute her sentence. She will leave prison in May. In a Jan. 18, 2017, interview, Fox News Host Bill O’Reilly asked McCain for his reaction to Obama’s decision. McCain said he felt ""sorrow for the families of those individuals who identified in these leaks in Afghanistan that the Taliban went after and murdered. And rage because this president is basically endorsing a proposal that allows someone to go free who is responsible for the needless deaths of those people who are allies."" O’Reilly pushed back on McCain’s assertion that individuals identified in the leaks were killed by the Taliban. ""I just wanted to know if it was specific leaks that came to you as a Senator which showed what WikiLeaks did with Manning's help killed people that were helping the U.S.A.,"" O’Reilly said. McCain replied: ""Let me be specific. The information I received when I was there was that the Taliban went after these people. I assume, killed them."" The interview left us still wondering if people were killed because their names appeared in the documents that Manning leaked, so we decided to put McCain’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. McCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo said the Taliban has a history of retaliating against people who cooperate with United States forces. She pointed to a 2010 interview by British television station Channel 4 with a Taliban spokesman, who said the group would ""punish"" Afghan nationals working for the United States named in the WikiLeaks logs. ""If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them,"" said the spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. But we could find no evidence the Taliban acted on these threats. We scoured court documents, congressional hearing transcripts and media reports, and we found that the government has not named a single individual who was killed because he or she was named in the leaked files.  Not in public record In 2010, Manning — then known as Bradley Manning — was an Army analyst in Iraq. She downloaded about 700,000 government files and gave many of them to WikiLeaks, who made the files public. The records included diplomatic cables, reports about the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and notably a video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed civilians. The government was concerned that the Taliban or other adversaries might retaliate against foreign nationals named in the documents because the individuals cooperated with the United States. However, officials have never pointed to an example of someone actually getting killed because of the leaks. The closest call came in August 2013, during the sentencing phase of Manning’s trial, when the government tried to make the case that Manning’s leaks caused harm. Robert Carr, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general who led an investigation into the leak, testified that he knew of ""one individual that was killed"" by the Taliban as a result of the leaks. However, Carr conceded that the person killed hadn’t actually been named in the documents Manning gave to WikiLeaks. As a result, the judge decided to strike that testimony from the record. Here’s the relevant exchange (from an unofficial transcript provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation): Carr: ""As a result of the Afghan logs, I only know of one individual that was killed. The individual was an Afghan national. The Afghan national had a relationship with the United States government and the Taliban came out publicly and said that they killed him as a result of him being associated with the information in these logs."" Defense attorney Major Thomas Hurley: ""Ma'am, we may object again as to relevance. General Carr is going to going to talk about how this person wasn't listed in the WikiLeaks  disclosures. This individual's name wasn't listed among those names, among the hundreds of names he talked about."" Judge Denise Lind: ""Is this, what you're testifying  to, tied to the information in the disclosures in any way?"" Carr: ""The Taliban killed him and tied him to the disclosures. We went back and searched for this individual's name in all of the disclosures. The name was not there. It was a terrorist act on behalf of the Taliban threatening all of the others out there. But the name of the individual that was killed was not in the disclosures."" So the Taliban said they killed an individual because of the WikiLeaks logs, but the logs didn’t actually mention this individual. Carr said that he only knew of that example. In his closing argument at Manning’s sentencing trial, lead attorney for the government Ashden Fein only said the leaks put hundreds of people ""at risk of injury, incarceration or death as a result of the release of their names."" He didn’t argue that anyone actually died. We should note that part of Manning’s trial took place in a closed hearing in order to discuss classified information. So it’s possible that deaths caused directly by Manning’s leaks could have happened, and we can’t know unless that information was declassified. David Coombs, Manning’s lawyer, attended the classified hearings. He told us that the government didn’t present any evidence that showed individuals were killed as a direct result of the leaks. ""That information was never brought out because it doesn’t exist,"" Coombs said, calling McCain’s claim ""completely false."" Fein, the lead attorney for the government on the case, declined to talk to us on the record. If not deaths, what damage did Manning’s leaks do to national security? The government has repeatedly said the main impact is a ""chilling effect"" — meaning foreign officials and citizens are less likely to speak and cooperate with American soldiers and diplomats. But Obama administration officials have indicated the leaks didn’t actually cause a lot of harm. ""I’ve heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy described as a meltdown, as a game-changer, and so on. I think those descriptions are fairly significantly overwrought,"" said former Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2010, adding later, ""Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.’’ In a December 2010 interview on NBC, former Vice President Joe Biden said about WikiLeaks, ""I don't think there's any substantive damage, no. Look, some of the cables that are coming out here and around the world are embarrassing."" Our ruling McCain said, ""The Taliban went after and murdered"" people identified in the Chelsea Manning leaks. In the several years since WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of government documents leaked by Manning, the government has not publicly identified a single example of the Taliban killing someone because that person was named in the leaks. If someone had died as a result, it seems logical that the incident would have become public knowledge, either through Manning's trial or in media reports. At Manning’s sentencing trial, one Army witness said he knew the Taliban killed one person and blamed it on the WikiLeaks revelations. However, that person’s name doesn’t appear in the files, and the military has provided no additional information. We rate McCain’s claim Mostly False. Update: This article has been updated to include more information from McCain's staff.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9DB740>],/factchecks/2017/feb/01/john-mccain/mccain-says-taliban-murdered-people-because-chelse/

Joni Ernst on target describing '11th-hour' Obama rule affecting Planned Parenthood
","At this year’s March for Life -- the annual anti-abortion rally in Washington -- Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, decried a federal rule implemented in the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration. Ernst told the crowd on Jan. 27, 2017, that she would ""introduce a bill Monday to stop what some have referred to as ‘President Obama’s last gift to Planned Parenthood.’ "" Ernst referred to Title X of the United States Public Health Service Act, which covers family planning. She said that her effort, in cooperation with Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., ""would scrap the Obama administration’s 11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood."" We wondered if Ernst had accurately described the Obama administration’s action. Our conclusion: Ernst was essentially on target. About Title X Title X, as the federal rule notes, is the only federal program focused solely on providing family planning and related preventive services. In 2015, the rule says, more than 4 million individuals received services through more than 3,900 Title X-funded health centers. Planned Parenthood says its affiliates served approximately 1.5 million patients that year under Title X, about one-third of the federal program’s yearly total. Planned Parenthood has drawn criticism from anti-abortion advocates because in addition to providing uncontroversial women’s health services, the group also performs abortions. By law, abortions performed by Planned Parenthood are paid for by private money, not federal dollars. But anti-abortion advocates argue that money is fungible and that the federal government is effectively supporting a major provider of abortions. Supporters of Planned Parenthood counter that the money flows are separated and that barring federal dollars from being spent on Planned Parenthood would have dire negative consequences for women’s health, especially among poor Americans. The Obama administration rule On Sept. 7, 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a ""notice of proposed rulemaking"" -- the first step in formulating a new federal rule. The proposed rule would make clear that the decision to fund an organization under Title X cannot be based on ""reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services."" The effect would be that the fact of providing abortion services couldn’t be used against a group that seeks Title X funding. After the notice of proposed rulemaking was issued, the rule went through a series of required steps, including a public comment period. Ultimately, HHS acted to finalize the rule while the Obama administration was still in charge, but after Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election. HHS made the rule effective Jan. 18. Though the proposal was framed broadly, it was widely perceived as having a significant impact on Planned Parenthood. Both sides essentially agreed on that. After the notice of proposed rulemaking, Ernst and other lawmakers immediately expressed concern to HHS about its impact on Planned Parenthood. And after the rule was finalized, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a statement that ""President Obama has cemented his legacy as a champion for women's health. This rule protects birth control, cancer screenings, (sexually-transmitted infection) testing and treatment and other health care for millions of people."" Evaluating Ernst’s description So how well does Ernst’s characterization stack up? We’ll take her statement phrase by phrase. • ""11th-hour rule."" While all relevant procedures were followed in the formulation of the rule, the final rule did materialize quicker than many federal rules do, experts said. ""The rule was proposed in September and finalized in December,"" said Columbia Law School professor Gillian Metzger. ""In practice, that's a pretty fast turnaround."" And of course, by making the effective date Jan. 18, 2017, it took effect in the final 48 hours of the Obama administration. All told, Ernst has a strong case for calling it an ""11th-hour"" rule. • ""Entrenches federal family planning funding."" Experts told PolitiFact that the Obama rulemaking did make the policy harder to overturn, although either Congress or Trump’s HHS department could take steps to do so. ""I would not quibble about the use of ‘entrench’ in this context,"" said Boston University law professor Gary S. Lawson. ""Rules are not that easy to change. There are degrees of entrenchment, of course, depending on the procedures required for change, but if someone wants to apply the term to a substantive agency rule, I would let them do it."" Metzger agreed. ""As a practical matter, reversing a rule takes resources and time by the agency, and there would likely be a court challenge and the possibility that a court would repeal the reversal as arbitrary."" • ""For Planned Parenthood."" As we noted earlier, both sides in the abortion debate publicly linked the rule to Planned Parenthood. That said, the rule did not exclusively target Planned Parenthood. The rule itself does not mention the organization by name, although the accompanying material does mention the group specifically in a question-and-answer section summarizing public comments. ""While Planned Parenthood might be one of the affected applicants, the rule is actually written in a neutral manner,"" said Jeffrey S. Lubbers, an American University law professor.  Our ruling Ernst said the Obama administration issued an ""11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood."" It may be a slight exaggeration to use the word ""entrench,"" since there are ways to overturn the rule within a matter of months, and it should be noted that the rule would affect a variety of other health care providers, not just Planned Parenthood, Still, it’s hard to argue that this was not an 11th-hour rule, and in general we find that Ernst has characterized pretty accurately what the Obama administration did. We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE3D140>],/factchecks/2017/feb/01/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-target-describing-11th-hour-obama-rule-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'History', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Austan Goolsbee']","
Austan Goolsbee says manufacturing jobs growing fastest in almost 15 years
","
On the heels of a disappointing jobs report, Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Barack Obama, shined the best light he could on the administration’s economic record during the June 5, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

Two days before his appearance, the government announced that the economy had created a net of only 54,000 jobs in May -- a number well below expectations, and also below the number of jobs created in the previous few months.

Amanpour pressed Goolsbee on the issue:

""What would you do to get this off the slow burner?"" she asked.

Goolsbee responded, ""Well, I would say two or three things. The first is, the president has never stopped talking about jobs. For him, the growth strategy is the No. 1 issue. Now, we must live within our means. We have a moment that we can talk about long-run deficit reduction. And the vice president's leading an effort to do that, that the president has asked him to. But the president is getting up every day -- on Friday, he's going out to Ohio to talk about jobs in manufacturing, (and) manufacturing is having its best employment year in almost 15 years.""

We thought we’d check whether Goolsbee was right about manufacturing employment.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source for employment numbers. There are two ways to look at the issue. One is to look at manufacturing jobs for the first five months of the year over the past decade and a half. The other is to look at the full-year totals for manufacturing jobs, which means determining the total for 2011 by extrapolating a full year from the first five months’ data.

First, we’ll look at the January-to-May figures.

For 2011, the manufacturing sector has gained 76,000 jobs. To find gains that robust, you have to go back to 1994, when manufacturing gained 107,000 jobs from January to May.

So by this standard, it’s 17 years, and Goolsbee actually understates his point.

Now the full-year figures.

For 2011, manufacturing jobs -- if they continue at their current pace -- would increase by 182,000. That’s the most for any year going back to 1997, when 288,000 jobs were created over the full year. And that was 14 years ago, which fits Goolsbee’s statement of ""almost 15 years.""

At this point, we should note three bits of context.

First, despite the gains for the year, manufacturing jobs fell by 5,000 during the previous month, as Amanpour pointed out in the interview. (Goolsbee countered that durable goods manufacturing jobs went up, and they did, by 8,000. Durable goods are those designed to last for multiple years, such as cars and dishwashers.)

Second, despite the recent gains, over the past decade and a half, the manufacturing sector has shrunk -- consistently and inexorably.

Since January 1994, the manufacturing sector has shed 5,160,000 jobs, leaving today’s number of manufacturing jobs 31 percent lower than it was at the start of 1994.

And the actual shrinkage is even more stark than this statistic shows. Since January 1994, the labor force has grown by 18 percent. That means that simply maintaining its share of American employment would have required the manufacturing sector to increase by almost one-fifth since 1994, when in fact it declined by nearly one-third.

The continual slide means that when you look at figures for the past decade and a half, most periods have shown a net loss of jobs. Since 1994, manufacturing jobs only showed a net increase six times for the January-to-May period, and only five times for the full-year period.

In other words, it didn’t take much for the manufacturing job gains under Obama to stand out. On the other hand, it also means that the administration has some justification for citing the accomplishment.

Third, manufacturing jobs have increased for two years running (and two January-to-May periods running) -- but the combined gains haven’t come close to canceling out the manufacturing jobs lost during Obama’s first year in office.

In 2009, the economy lost more than 1.1 million manufacturing jobs. Counting the projection for 2011, the manufacturing sector will have rebounded by the end of this year by only 282,000 jobs, replacing only about a quarter of those lost since the start of 2009. While Obama isn’t solely to blame for this hemorrhaging -- the recession did start under his predecessor, George W. Bush -- this does make the overall assessment of the sector under Obama more downbeat than Goolsbee indicated on the show.

On balance, we feel that Goolsbee’s decision to highlight manufacturing jobs may be aimed at  downplaying the otherwise disappointing jobs numbers for May, but his facts are mostly on target, though he didn't provide the context of the large manufacturing job losses in 2009. Since assigning responsibility for the 2009 losses is a complicated business, we’ll lower Goolsbee just one notch and rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB99D440>],/factchecks/2011/jun/06/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-manufacturing-jobs-growing-fa/

Bob Graham says on ""Hardball"" that Florida bill prohibits docs from talking gun safety with patients
","
Former Florida Democratic governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham says current Gov. Rick Scott is upending years of progress in the state created by both Republicans and Democrats, and his abysmal poll numbers are evidence that Floridians don't like it.

Appearing on MSNBC's Hardball program on June 1, 2011, Graham said Scott is ""out of the mainstream of Florida."" (Scott's current approval rating is 29 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.)

""Remember, Florida has had Republican governors for the last 12 years. We have had Republican Legislatures for most of that time. And now we have a supermajority Republican Legislature,"" said Graham, who appeared on the show with former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, also a Democrat. ""So when the governor vetoes a budget and describes -- or line-item vetoes -- and describes things as frivolous and not in the public interest, he is not pointing at Democrats. He is pointing at his own party.""

""What happened with these Republicans?"" Matthews asked. ""People wanted to see some restraint on spending. They're worried about the economy. And these guys went in there and picked up on the old Republican agenda of labor bashing, of going after public employees -- I guess they are going after the trial lawyers next -- just the old Republican agenda that they could have done (in) any administration, and they are just out of touch with the people. What do you think, Governor Graham?""

Graham answered.

""Chris, I think you are absolutely right that what the people are really concerned with today are jobs and those things that are going to contribute to long-term economic well-being, such as an investment in education, protecting our environment,"" he said. ""And these governors have gotten off onto a very bizarre agenda of issues. We had one in Florida where we now are prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home. That's how far out of the mainstream our state government has gotten.""

The talk about a gun bill passed in Florida got laughter from Matthews, and then this response: ""Gun safety is a no-no, huh? You can't talk about that even with mothers.""

Because it was a focal point in the interview, we wanted to see if it was true.

About the gun bill

We've written about the bill in question, HB 155, twice before. The bill passed the Legislature and was signed into law by the governor on June 2. 
The original version of the bill created a firestorm -- and fodder for national television -- because it sought to punish doctors with imprisonment or fines up to $5 million for asking a patient or a patient's family about gun ownership and gun habits. House sponsor Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, said the bill was drafted partly as a reaction to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which encourage physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offering advice to avoid preventable accidents. The recommendations include mainly innocuous tips like ""Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children,"" and ""NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag."" Physicians also are encouraged to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play.

In another case, Brodeur said an Ocala woman was turned away from her pediatrician after she refused to say whether she owned a firearm.

The multimillion-dollar fines and possible prison time were stripped from the bill, and the final language was watered down as part of a compromise between the Florida Medical Association and the National Rifle Association.

Under the bill that ultimately passed:

* Health care providers cannot enter gun ownership information into a patient's medical record ""if the practitioner knows that such information is not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.""

* Health care providers cannot ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider ""believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others.""

* Health care providers cannot discriminate against patients because they own firearms.

* Health care providers should ""refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination.""

The penalties for violating the new rules could cost a doctor his or her license. Or they could face a fine up to $10,000.

While the Florida Medical Association supported the legislation, other groups of doctors -- including pediatricians remained in opposition, saying the law violates the free speech rights of doctors and ""also deprive patients of potentially life-saving information regarding safety measures they can take to protect their children, families and others from injury or death resulting from unsafe storage or handling of firearms."" (A group of doctors has since said they plan to sue over the law).

But the question for this fact check is whether the bill prohibits doctors from talking to their patients about gun safety in the home, as Graham said.

The answer is not explicit. The law prohibits -- in many cases -- a doctor from asking their patient or their family if they own a firearm. But the bill does not prevent doctors from discussing firearm safety.

So a pediatrician could counsel patients that if they own a gun, they should keep it stored away from small children. But they couldn't specifically ask if the patient owned a firearm, unless a doctor believed the information was relevant to the patient's medical care. They also could not ""harass"" a patient about gun ownership, according to the law.

The law doesn't define ""harassing"" or detail scenarios when a doctor is allowed to ask about gun ownership -- and that has some doctors worried.

 ""The law would virtually guarantee that some health care professionals who are simply following established protocol by informing patients of the lethal risks of firearms will be brought before a disciplinary board if a patient categorically objects to any discussion or inquiry on the subject of household firearms,"" attorney Bruce Manheim wrote in a letter to Scott urging his veto on behalf of the Florida Chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Practitioners and the American College of Physicians. ""Consequently, beyond imposing express prohibitions on protected speech, the legislation is also so vague, and its sanctions are so severe, that health care professionals will be chilled from freely engaging in speech with their patients.""

Graham said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida that the chilling effect generated by the bill could stop doctors from even talking about guns. ""I'm a hunter, have guns, etc., but I don't think you need to deny parents professional information about how to keep their children safe,"" he said. ""This law is an over-extension of what constitutes proper respect for people's Second Amendment rights."" 
Graham also had us speak to a Tallahassee pediatrician who has been fighting the law, Dr. Louis St. Petery. 
St. Petery told us that pediatricians have a long list of potential hazards they want to discuss with patient's families. That's why asking if a gun is important, because it helps focus discussions during the limited time doctors and families have. 
As a result of this law, St. Petery said pediatricians will withdraw from asking about or discussing guns. That will result in an increase in gun-related injuries and deaths, he said. 
""Sen. Graham is 100 percent correct,"" St. Petery said. 
Brodeur, the bill sponsor, provided the counter argument. He said HB 155 ""doesn't prevent the safety conversation at all,"" in a posting on Twitter.

Our ruling

On MSNBC's Hardball, Graham said the Florida Legislature had passed a bill ""prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home.""

The bill doesn't go that far.

HB 155 creates restrictions for doctors wishing to ask their patients (or families) if they own a gun, and says health care officials should ""refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination."" Doctors remain able to address gun safety in general, though some say the threat of getting in trouble may hinder or prevent that discussion from taking place. The difference here is asking about gun ownership versus talking about gun safety. We rate this claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB896AC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/06/bob-graham/bob-graham-says-hardball-florida-bill-prohibits-do/
"['Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
Republican group says Rep. Ron Kind and other Democrats spent so much that ‘their credit card is maxed out’
","
The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is dedicated to preserving the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, hammered Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., and 59 other House Democrats with a news release and e-mail on May 18, 2011.

Kind ""and his fellow Democrats,"" the committee declared, ""went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out.""

The committee was talking about government funds, not private credit cards.

So let’s flesh out the committee’s claim, particularly with regard to Kind, who has been mentioned as a possible candidate in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Herb Kohl.

Our colleagues at the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper who run PolitiFact Ohio have already assessed the Republican committee’s spending claim as it pertained to Rep. Betty Sutton, D-Ohio. It’s the same claim made against Kind, a 15-year congressman from La Crosse in western Wisconsin.

Here’s what PolitiFact Ohio found:

Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of nearly $14.3 trillion.

This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like, too.

For our item, the question is whether spending by Kind and his fellow Democrats are the reason the federal credit card has been maxed out.

PolitiFact Ohio went on to say that taxes are one part of the equation, spending the other. Here is there central analysis:

Tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and that were adopted during the presidency of George W. Bush were extended in December 2010 for two years under President Barack Obama. While some economists say the tax cuts were needed to give the economy a kick, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits.

Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the tenure of Bush, a Republican, and continue under Obama, a Democrat.

The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities posits that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for over $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 ""and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs.""

That’s deficits, but it applies to the debt (formed by cumulative and mounting deficits), says the center. The ""Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies,"" the center noted on May 20, 2011.

On the conservative side, Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said ""one could cherry pick"" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire debt problem. Unlike the liberal think tank, he said, ""one could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame.

So, spending, as the National Republican Congressional Committee argued in its news release, contributes to the nation’s debt. But Republicans as well as Democrats were responsible for key expenditures. And, by bringing in less revenue, tax cuts also add to the debt -- and members of both parties put tax cuts in place, too.

We asked the Republican committee for specific evidence to back its claim about Kind’s ""spending spree."" The committee cited his votes for Obama’s stimulus plan, a ""bailout"" plan for the states and the 2010 federal budget resolution. The committee also cited his votes in 2009 and 2010 to raise the debt limit, but those measures did not authorize spending.

Kind’s staff, meanwhile, cited Bush’s ""two unfunded wars,"" in Iraq and Afghanistan, for contributing to the debt -- although Kind voted for that spending. His staff said Kind voted against against the Bush tax cuts and against another Bush spending proposal, which created the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

Where does all of this leave us?

In a reference to the nation’s debt limit, the National Republican Congressional Committee said Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind and 59 other House Democrats ""went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."" It’s true House Democrats including Kind backed measures that contributed to the debt, but so did House Republicans. And the debt is a result of tax cuts as well as various spending measures, and both Democrats and Republicans supported such measures.

"['Georgia', 'Redistricting', 'Robert Brown']","
Georgia Democrats left out of process, lawmaker complains
","
It’s important, it’s done once a decade, and many observers can’t wait for it to end.

It is the spectacle of reapportionment, the process Georgia lawmakers use to decide the boundaries of each district in the state House of Representatives and Senate, and congressional districts.

A slight shift of boundary lines could result in changes to how a district votes, thus a lawmaker could lose his or her job and the political tides in, say, the Georgia Legislature could shift on some important issues.

Democrats and Republicans often fight over the boundaries like football players during a fumble. Republicans have the advantage since they hold majorities in both chambers of the Georgia Legislature.

With such stakes in mind, the leader of the Senate Democrats complained about some aspects of this year’s reapportionment at the first public hearing May 17 in Athens.

""We in the Democratic Party had no input into the locations of these hearings, nor did we have input into the process,"" Brown said.

Sen. Mitch Seabaugh, who is co-chairman of the Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee, countered that he has repeatedly asked Democrats for ideas and suggestions.

""Legislators have had ample opportunity to give whatever input in the process,"" said Seabaugh, a Republican from Sharpsburg.

So is Brown off base here? Or is he right about Democrats being shut out of the reapportionment process?

Reapportionment is based primarily on U.S. census counts taken at the beginning of each decade. For more than a century, Georgia Democrats dominated the process because they held majorities in both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office. This year is the first time Republicans will hold voting sway over reapportionment. Democrats and government watchdog groups such as Common Cause Georgia are suspicious of the Republican plan. The GOP has hired a law firm to, said state Rep. Roger Lane, R-Darien, advise them on the legal compliance of the maps.

Brown, who was sworn in to office in 1991, said there are many examples to back up his argument about the process. He said that traditionally state legislators are allowed to ask questions at public hearings. This year, he said, they cannot. Legislators also sit in the audience, which gives them less opportunity to take questions from voters during the public hearings.

Another problem with the process, Brown said, was the lack of discussion about the committee schedule during the recent legislative session that ended in April. Brown said there was ""no planning"" during the session. Speaking about a meeting he had in April with Seabaugh and others, Brown said ""that is not involving you in the process"" since it was a private meeting. Brown said the planning for the public hearings should have been done through the Legislature’s committees.

Seabaugh forwarded us two letters he sent to all senators requesting meetings to discuss their districts and the reapportionment process. Seabaugh also said committee leaders asked legislators for potential locations for the public hearings. He wrote a memo on March 4 to senators requesting locations for the hearings and wanted their replies by March 10. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives responded, Seabaugh said. Senate Democrats did not until the list was approved, he told us.

Seabaugh said he and Lane, also a co-chairman of the Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee, chose the sites from the cities suggested by lawmakers that ""we felt covered the state of Georgia.""

Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta, said some Democrats proposed additional sites for the hearings. He forwarded us a letter from Seabaugh that the committee would not add any locations.

""It makes me question whether they are really interested in any Democratic input into the process,"" Fort said.

Seabaugh’s response: ""They had a form on their desk. They had an opportunity to participate. I can’t make them fill out a form and hand it in on time.""

House Democratic Whip Carolyn Hughley of Columbus confirmed to PolitiFact Georgia that lawmakers were asked for suggestions to hold the hearings. But like Fort, she complained about some sites that weren’t selected. She also told us that Seabaugh wrote a letter to lawmakers telling them not to ask or answer questions from the public at reapportionment hearings.

""The public hearings are opportunities for us as legislators to hear from the public,"" Seabaugh wrote.

Hughley said that ""raises key questions about transparency and fairness."" Seabaugh’s letter said it is standard practice for lawmakers not to ask or answer questions at joint committee public hearings.

Veteran University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock offered some perspective on Brown’s complaints.

""I would take all Democratic screams of outrage with a grain of salt,"" said Bullock, who contends that Democrats gave Republicans no input into reapportionment a decade ago.

We have trouble with Brown’s comment that Democrats had ""no input"" in location of the hearings because all members of the Georgia Legislature were asked for suggestions of sites. Some of the sites are in largely Democratic terrain such as Atlanta, Albany, Columbus and Macon.

As for Brown’s point about being left out of the process, his argument is based on not being asked to speak at the hearings and how Seabaugh has asked other lawmakers for input. Seabaugh did ask lawmakers not to ask or answer questions. Seabaugh has written letters to lawmakers asking them for their ideas or concerns about reapportionment.

Brown’s claim and argument ignore some critical facts we believe will give the casual reader a different impression of this issue.

State Rep. Jason Isaac says per diem costs taxpayers $27,300 per day

","
After a Democrat’s filibuster derailed legislation considered essential by the Republican-steered Legislature, state Rep. Jason Isaac said the gambit had a cost. ""Back to work tomorrow. Per diem alone costs taxpayers $27,300/day,"" the Dripping Springs Republican tweeted May 30. 
Nearly $30,000 a day? 
As legislators started the 30-day special session immediately called by Gov. Rick Perry, Ellen Troxclair, Isaac’s chief of staff, told us Isaac based his figure on information from the Texas Ethics Commission. 
Some background: A provision in the Texas Constitution provides for each legislator and the lieutenant governor, who presides over the Senate, to receive a $600 monthly salary, mileage reimbursements and the per diem, which is a stipend intended to ease lawmaker living expenses while they’re in Austin on state business each day during regular and special sessions. The commission, established in 1991, sets the per diem and also may recommend raises for legislators to voters, though that’s not happened. 
According to information on the commission’s website, the current legislative per diem is $150. 
So, counting the 150 Texas House members, 31 senators and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, 182 lawmakers qualify for the payment each day lawmakers are in session. Total potential daily cost: $27,300. 
According to the Texas State Historical Association, the Constitution of 1876 set a legislator’s compensation at $5 per day for the first 60 days of a regular session and $2 for each day after. A 1930 constitutional amendment changed the per diem to $10 for the first 120 days of the session and $5 after. During special sessions, the per diem was $10. A 1954 amendment raised the per diem to no more than $25 for the first 120 days of the regular session, while a 1960 amendment greenlighted paying legislators an annual salary of up to $4,800 plus a $12 per diem during the first 120 days of each regular session and each day of the special session. 
Per diem amounts inched up in later years with the commission setting the rate at $168 in January 2009, according to a Nov. 12 2010, news story in the Austin American-Statesman. But after the commission proposed authorizing the same rate members of the 2011 Legislature, Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus called for the rate to be lowered to $150 in a Nov. 29, 2010 letter stating the move would help the state tighten overall spending. 
Do lawmakers ever pass up the per diem? 
Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, told us that no senators have declined the payments since 2003 when Senate Democrats fled to New Mexico to impede the passage of redistricting legislation. 
Steven Adrian, executive director of the House Business Office, told us no representatives have submitted a request to withhold or reduce per diem payments this session. 
Isaac’s statement adds up to True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8AAB80>],/factchecks/2011/jun/06/jason-isaac/state-rep-jason-isaac-says-diem-costs-taxpayers-27/

 State senator says two states’ bottle bill systems went broke after they raised deposit rate
","
The Oregon Senate recently gave final approval to a bill that widely expands Oregon’s iconic bottle bill. Among other things, the legislation increases the sorts of beverages covered and leaves room for a possible increase from the current nickel deposit to a dime.

It’s that last bit, the five to ten cents bit, that drew the strongEST rebuke from dissenting senators. The increase happens only if the return rate in Oregon dips below 80 percent two years in a row. Distributors don’t think that will happen. In fact, they’re so sure they can keep rates high that they endorsed the bill.

But some Republican senators didn’t see how that made any sense. If proponents were so certain redemption rates wouldn’t fall, why bother including that provision in the bill at all?

Sen. Jeff Kruse was among those who spoke against that piece of the expansion.

""We have some unintended consequences that may come in with this increase to a dime … I would point to a couple states -- Michigan and Massachusetts -- that increased their redemption value and what happened in both of those states is they could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there,"" he told his colleagues.

His reasoning as far as we could tell -- and he later confirmed -- was that those states had such high redemption rates, the deposit money mostly got refunded and that left the states no money to run their programs.

That’s a pretty dire prognosis: The program could work so well that it would eliminate its own funding stream.

PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. First up was Michigan. We talked to Terry Stanton, the spokesman for the state’s Department of Treasury.

Michigan’s deposit, he said, was indeed 10 cents -- the highest in the nation -- and the return rate was nearly 97 percent. (For comparison, Oregon is just under 80 percent.)

Does the high redemption cause problems? Is the Michigan system going broke?

At first, Stanton didn’t seem to understand what we were asking. The idea that the bottle redemption program was a way to raise funds and not to encourage recycling just didn’t seem right.

""I don't know,"" he said. ""That wasn't the purpose of the program … This was initiated really to clean up the road waste.""

Right, we said. Same with Oregon. But here, the unclaimed deposits help run the system. If there aren’t any, the system might face problems. We asked again: Is that happening in Michigan.

He checked and sent us this e-mail:

""First, as noted on the phone, Michigan's bottle deposit law was put in place in the 1970's, to help cleanup roadsides, etc., that were becoming cluttered with bottles and cans.  The deposit has been at 10 cents since inception.  Michigan's program, which was approved by a vote of the people, was not designed to be a revenue generator but to keep roadsides and the environment clean. ...

""As for the unredeemed cans, the Michigan Bottle Deposit Law states that of the unclaimed deposits that revert to the state, 75 percent is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund and 25 percent is returned to the retailers. ...  

""I'm not sure what the individual in Oregon is claiming as far as ‘not having the money to operate.’  As far as I'm aware, Michigan's program is not experiencing problems.""

Well, that didn’t seem to match very well with what Kruse had said. So, we gave him a call and asked where he’d heard that Michigan was going broke.

""I don't have documentation,"" Kruse said, adding it came from ""a discussion we were having.""

""The logic behind it is that the program pays for itself by those (deposits) that aren't returned. So, if you get to the point where you're getting 100 percent"" there’s no fuel for the program, Kruse said. ""I guess i was trying to make the point that this move, if we got back to the dime, could come back to bite us in a way that we did not anticipate.""

Then, he added that the deposit might be even higher in Massachusetts -- even a quarter. Maybe there were issues there.

We did some Googling (we’re hi-tech here) and couldn’t find anything about a quarter deposit there. We did find a few articles about an expansion included in the Massachusetts governor’s proposal, but that dealt only with the types of containers included. There wasn’t a word about an increase from a nickel to a quarter.

But we like to be complete in our fact-checking, so we gave the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection a call. We talked to Edmund Coletta, the spokesman for the department, about the latest on the state’s deposit system.

The bottle deposit, he confirmed, was still a nickel. The governor recently pushed to get more beverage containers included under the program, he said, but neither the state’s House nor Senate included the changes in their budget proposals.

What’s more, he added, increasing the current nickel deposit is ""definitely not in the governor’s proposal.""

For a final word on all this, we decided to give John Anderson a call. He’s the president of the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, the group that’s helping to expand redemption centers through the state. We asked him whether Kruse might be on to something. Could an increased deposit lead to a collapse in Oregon’s system?

While it’s true, he said, that unredeemed deposits ""are the major funding for the system"" it’s unlikely that, even with a dime, we’d hit Michigan’s 97 percent return rate.

Part of that has to do with the fact that Michigan is surrounded by major out-of-state population centers. That ""Seinfeld"" episode about Kramer taking empties from New York to Michigan for the double deposit? That actually happens.

But Oregon only has Vancouver nearby. So even at 10 cents, ""we end up about in the high 80s, that's my estimate,"" Anderson said. ""I think we lose on redeemed deposits, but I don't think we go into a crisis mode.

""I don't think that's a problem that we really need to spend a lot of time on.""

This case seems pretty open and shut to us. Kruse tried to persuade his Senate colleagues that too-high deposits in Michigan and Massachusetts were crippling those programs. But Michigan says that’s not the case and Massachusetts doesn’t even have a higher deposit rate. Kruse doesn’t have any evidence to back up his claim. The statement is not just false -- it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB64B80>],/factchecks/2011/jun/06/jeff-kruse/state-senator-says-two-states-bottle-bill-systems-/
"['Ohio', 'Taxes', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says Ohioans carry the seventh heaviest tax burden
","
Out on the stump, Gov. John Kasich loves talking taxes—specifically about how he thinks people in Ohio pay too much in them.

During his successful run for governor against Democrat Ted Strickland in 2010, Kasich claimed that Ohio was one of the most heavily taxed states in a television ad that got major airplay around Labor Day.

And the Republican governor was talking again about tax burdens at a May 24 event in Dublin, a Columbus suburb, as part of a discussion about his state budget proposal and the need for Ohio to stay competitive with other states.

The state, he said, has given local entities, like schools and libraries and governments, the tools to keep their costs down, and they shouldn’t be going to voters for tax increases to offset cuts from the state.

""If we don’t lower our taxes, we’re not competitive,"" Kasich told a GOP-friendly crowd inside a local ice cream parlor. ""We’re the seventh highest taxed state in America. And that’s not just state, it’s local as well.""

Politifact Ohio gave Kasich a Half True rating for when he called Ohio one of the most taxed states last fall. But the governor’s now getting more specific about how he defines ""taxed"" by placing it in the context of Ohio’s combined local and state tax burdens. And he’s got a ranking — seventh in the country. So we decided to give this issue another study.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols pointed to a study from the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, which crunched state and local tax data and found Ohio to be seventh-highest among the 50 states. This ranking was most recently referenced by the group in a release entitled Fiscal Fact #207, dated Jan. 7, 2010.

But the numbers have been updated since Kasich made his claim last fall and that data is no longer the most current from the Tax Foundation.

A more recent Feb. 23, 2011 report from the group, entitled Special Report #189, ranks Ohio 18th in tax burden among the 50 states and suggests Ohio hasn’t been as high as seventh in tax burden since 2005. So why did a Jan. 2010 report from the group say Ohio was currently seventh?

Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison said the methodology used by the group is ""tweaked"" from report to report slightly and that updated, more accurate information is applied to back years which changes the rankings for multiple years from one report to the next.  

Additionally, there is an ongoing debate in taxation circles over whether the methodology employed by the Tax Foundation to determine a state’s local and state tax burden is correct. That’s because the group adjusts raw census data in certain ways to include considering taxes Ohioans may pay in other states before diving a state’s total tax collections by total personal income.

In contrast, the Federation of Tax Administrators, sticks with the raw census data without making any adjustments. Their numbers had Ohio 16th in percentage of personal income paid to tax collectors in 2008. They haven’t yet crunched any numbers for 2009.  

Ron Alt, research economist for the Federation of Tax Administrators, said he thinks Ohio is getting close to the middle of the pack when it comes to tax burden around the country. ""My judgment is that it’s close to the median in ranking,"" he said. ""I would say it’s a pretty typical tax burden.""

So where does that leave Kasich’s claim?

Kasich said Ohio had the seventh highest state and local tax burden in the country, relying on a study of the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation study. However, that figure was for 2005 and the study has been updated with the most recent set of rankings showing the state to have the 18th highest state and local tax burden.

Another tax ranking, compiled by the more neutral Federation of Tax Administrators, showed Ohio 16th in state and local tax burden in 2008.

No matter which set of rankings you use, Ohio clearly no longer has the seventh-highest tax burden.

Kasich needs to update his talking points, and start giving his fellow Republicans a little credit for the full impact of the income tax cuts they began delivering to Ohioans back in 2005.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim as False.

"['Elections', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Fred Risser']","
Wisconsin state Sen. Fred Risser says Senate President Michael Ellis broke Senate rules by cutting him off during debate over a photo ID bill
","
Wisconsin’s state Senate has probably generated more headlines in the past four months than any time in state history.

Democratic senators skipping town for weeks, warrants issued for their arrest, recall elections for up to nine senators and the disintegration of decorum for even routine business. And this is in the Legislature’s more formal, ""deliberative"" body.

Take, for instance, the May 19, 2011 vote on a bill to require voters to present photo ID at the polls. Long-sought by Republicans, bitterly fought by Democrats, the measure was certain to stir an emotional debate.

And it did.

The vote ended with a shouting match about the rules of the Senate between the state’s two most veteran lawmakers: Sen. Fred Risser, D-Madison, vs. Sen. Michael Ellis, R-Neenah. Between the two of them, they have a more than 90 years experience in the Capitol.

But only one of the two -- Ellis -- held the gavel.

And that meant the upper hand.

In the heat of the debate, Risser became angry when Ellis, the Senate president, started a roll call vote while Risser was speaking on the Senate floor.

""You’re not following the rules, Mister President,"" Risser yelled.

Ellis shouted back: ""Read the book!""

He hammered the gavel and the roll call vote was taken, over shouts of foul play from Democrats. The bill passed 19-5 and was signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker.

But what of Risser’s claim that Ellis violated the Senate rules? Let’s open up that book Ellis was talking about.

Senate rules govern ""such things as committee activities, bill introductions, order and conduct in debate,"" according the Senate chief clerk’s website. But they are not permanent. Senators meet at the beginning of the two-year legislative session and set the rules for their body. What’s more, the rules allow some things, such as terms of the debate, to be set along the way.

""The rules are extremely important to preserve the decorum and the dignity of the Senate,"" said former Senate President Alan Lasee, R-De Pere, who retired last year after 36 years in the Legislature.

""It’s the difference between anarchy and order,"" said former Sen. Mordecai Lee, D-Milwaukee, now a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

On May 17, 2011, the Senate opened 13 hours of debate on the bill -- largely Democrats speaking against the bill. It ended in the early morning of May 18. The next day, May 19, the measure was up for a final vote. On that morning, Republicans changed the rules for that single bill, about an hour before debate began. They voted to end debate after one hour. Senators were aware of that rule change before the debate began.

The Senate convened and Democrats took turns speaking against the bill, with the clock running and being carefully watched by Republicans. Shortly before the hour was up, Risser was recognized and took the floor. He was reminded by Sen. Neal Kedzie, R-Elkhorn -- who was temporarily serving in the chair -- that he had four minutes left.

Risser gave a meandering talk, discussing a change of address issue with his own driver’s license and appeared to be killing time. With 15 seconds to go Ellis, back in the chair, gave the warning: Time is almost up.

At the stroke of 11, Ellis ordered the roll call be taken, even though Risser was still speaking.

""You’re out of order. Take your seat,"" Ellis told Risser. ""Continue the roll call.""

After the vote, Risser declared in a news conference: ""Never in the 55 years that I have served have I seen the type of procedure, or lack of procedure, that has been followed in this house.""

""In the middle of someone’s talk, they decided to shut me off,"" he said.

So, that’s what happened. Now lets get back to the rules.

Debate has been limited only two other times in recent Senate history. It last happened in 2003 on the state budget and 1995 on welfare reform, according to Senate officials. Republicans were in charge both times -- but both parties agreed to limit debate.

""It’s incredibly unusual to amend the rules for one day,"" Lee said.

He also said it’s rare that a senator is cut off when he is speaking from the floor.

""He did have the floor legally,"" Lee said. ""I think what Mike (Ellis) did was unusual and arguably wrong.""

But the fact something is unusual does not necessarily mean any rules were broken.

""He knows the rules,"" said Lasee of Risser. ""Everything I learned about being Senate president, I learned from Fred.""

In an interview, Risser backed away from his claim that Ellis violated the Senate rules.

Rather, he said,  Ellis violated a less-precise set of rules -- the rules of common decency.

Said Risser: ""I can’t remember any time when there was an arbitrary time limit to stop discussion and to stop a person from discussing.""

But that’s not what Risser claimed at the time -- and Emily Post was not available for a consult on manners.

Indeed, if she were, there would be plenty more to look at:

Risser said Ellis also broke the rules by ignoring a motion to adjourn shouted out by Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton. Under the Senate rules, that motion takes precedence over all others. There was one problem with that tactic: Ellis never ""recognized"" Erpenbach to give him the floor and the motion was not formally made.

""You had nine guys yelling at me and no one got recognized. How do you recognize nine guys?"" Ellis said.

He had his own list of violations committed by the Democrats: shouting during a roll call, refusing to vote and leaving the Senate floor during a vote.

For his part, Ellis said it was no accident that Risser, the longest-serving lawmaker in the nation, was speaking when the hour was up: ""They wanted the 40-year veteran in the chair -- me -- versus the 50-year veteran. How dare you cut him off?""

What’s the bottom line?

Risser’s claim that Ellis broke the rules made for some drama after the voter ID bill passed, but the vote result itself was a foregone conclusion. When he was asked later, Risser pointed to the unwritten rules of common decency.

But his claim focused on the written rules of the Senate, which allow for the parameters of debate to be set by a majority vote. It’s rare, but permissible. And that’s what happened here.

We rate Risser’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB5B340>],/factchecks/2011/jun/05/fred-risser/wisconsin-state-sen-fred-risser-says-senate-presid/

GOP activist says government runs a background check on you every time you buy a plane ticket
","
Urging state lawmakers to revive a proposal barring airport security personnel in Texas from touching passengers’ private parts, an Austin member of the State Republican Executive Committee said federal authorities already know plenty about those who fly.

""The fact is, every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you,"" Don Zimmerman said in a May 31 press release from the Texas Republican Freedom Coalition. ""They know who you are before you board the plane.""

Pre-flight background checks on me, you and even Mrs. Olsen down the street?

After asking Zimmerman for his backup information, we turned to the agency that oversees the security checks of air passengers, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.

Online, we found a November 2010 TSA press release in which Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Homeland Security, announced that passengers on flights within or bound for the United States were now being checked against government watch lists, in keeping with ""a key 9/11 Commission recommendation.""

The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required Homeland Security to compare passenger information to watch lists kept by the government, according to an administration web post. That job, previously handled by airlines, was fully implemented by late November 2010.

The agency’s program, Secure Flight, checks each potential passenger’s name, birth date and gender against terrorist watch lists, the release says, before passengers receive boarding passes. According to information on another administration web site, TSA matches the name, gender and birth date submissions by passengers against government watch lists to identify known and suspected terrorists; prevent individuals on the government’s ""No Fly List"" from boarding and Identify individuals on the ""Selectee List"" for enhanced screening.

According to an undated post on the agency’s site, fewer than 50,000 people are on the lists, which consist of individuals ""identified by law enforcement and intelligence entities as legitimate threats to transportation who require either additional screening or are prohibited from boarding an aircraft.""

Separately, Fox News in December 2009 quoted an unidentified senior administration official saying more than 400,000 individuals are in the Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB), which Fox called the main identities database within the government for international terrorism. Those names are taken from the list of 550,000 individuals in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), described in the news report as the intelligence community’s central repository of information on known and suspected international terrorists.

Fox News said less than 4,000 of the names in the TSDB are on the ""No Fly"" list and another 14,000 names are on the ""Selectee"" list, which mandates calls for mandatory secondary screening.

The agency says the lists are kept by an FBI entity, the Terrorist Screening Center, which quotes a Homeland Security directive stating that ""only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism"" are supposed to be on the watch lists. U.S. citizens are included on the list, it says, if there is a reasonable suspicion that they are known or reasonably suspected of terrorism. However, the center says in another online post that 95 percent of the individuals on the watch list are not U.S. citizens or legal residents and the ""vast majority"" are not even in the U.S.""

The release says that under Secure Flight, ""99 percent of passengers are cleared to print boarding passes at home or at a self-serve kiosk."" Individuals ""found to match watch list parameters will be subject to secondary screening, a law enforcement interview or prohibition from boarding an aircraft, depending on the specific case.""

Is checking watch lists equivalent to doing background checks?

Nope, said Dallas-based TSA spokesman Luis Casanova. ""Bottom line,"" Casanova told us by email, ""we compare against watch lists, we do not conduct background checks (unless you are coming to work with us).""

Zimmerman guided us to the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, whose executive director, Marc Rotenberg, said in an interview that after 9/11, the government sought to require full-fledged checks of passengers, but those plans were cancelled in 2004. He called the current comparison of passenger information to names on watch lists ""streamlined background checks.""

Law professors with expertise in this area said the use of watch lists isn’t the same as background checks.

Matthew Finkin of the University of Illinois, who specialties include privacy issues, said background checks, most often invoked by prospective employers, commonly consider someone’s credit worthiness, outstanding criminal charges and civil litigation, bankruptcies, driving and marital records -- even their use of social networking. He said he’s not heard of airlines running background checks of all passengers: ""The airlines are not going to spend that kind of money. Why would they care if you have a speeding ticket?""

Counter-terrorism legal expert Gregory Maggs of the George Washington University Law School similarly said background checks occur when individuals apply for government jobs or seek a security clearance. Doing them for every airline passenger would be unmanageable, he said: ""Too many people buying airline tickets.""

Zimmerman said by email that the FBI and TSA are ""large, powerful bureaucratic organizations with very significant resources to check on travelers. It would also make sense that they would not divulge all the depth of details of what they do.""

Upshot: Every airline passenger must hurdle a check of basic personal information against a federal database before stepping onto a commercial flight. But these do not constitute actual background checks. We rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC022CC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/05/don-zimmerman/gop-activist-says-federal-government-runs-backgrou/

State Sen. John Tassoni says the Central Falls school system paid $100,000 for a time clock
","
State Sen. John Tassoni Jr. is waging an aggressive campaign to oust the leadership of the embattled Central Falls school system

In a news release, he called for the immediate resignation of Supt. Frances Gallo, saying that management of the state-funded district is ""erratic at best and incompetent at worst. … State money is being used to operate the schools, and some of that money is being wasted and used irresponsibly.""

We’re not about to wade into a controversy over who should be leading the school system. Gallo and the schools have made national news for reform efforts that have kept administrators and the teachers locked in a nasty fray for more than a year.

But we were curious about one example Tassoni gave of questionable financial decisions. In his press release, he stated that ""he has learned that the department spent $100,000 on a time clock.""

Really? Could a time clock cost that much?

Without punching in, we got right to work on this one.

When we met with Tassoni, he showed us three Central Falls school district documents that he  called ""purchase orders."" He noted that each made reference to a time clock and that each had a different total: $40,543.64, $55,414.68 and $5,581.68.

So he added them up. Grand total: $101,540.

""That $100,000 disturbed me -- $100,000 for a time clock?"" he said.

A first glance at the documents, however, reveals that there’s a great deal more to the purchase than a ""time clock."" Two of the documents specify the order was for  ""TimeClock Plus 6.0 Professional."" There’s enough detail to make clear it’s a computerized system.

""It’s not just a clock. It’s a whole system,"" Gallo said when we contacted her. ""It’s automated and has brought us out of antiquity into a truly networked system.""

We pictured Fred Flintstone ending his day at Slate Rock and Gravel Company by simply  sticking his time card into a dinosaur’s mouth. And we recalled those classic wall-mounted clocks, the kind Moocher, in the movie ""Breaking Away,"" smashes with his fist when his boss  says,  ""Don’t forget to punch the clock, Shorty.""

What can the new system do better? And how does it work?

No one sticks a card into a clock in Central Falls schools anymore. Hourly employees place a finger on a scanner to record their arrival and departure. Their fingerprints are checked to verify their identity. Forget punching in for a friend who hasn’t shown up for work.

The clocks relay employees’ hours to payroll systems, reducing the time staff must spend processing cards and avoiding human error that could result in payment mistakes, according to Giovanna Venditti, the School Department’s director of finance, and Kathy Gaouette, director of human resources.

The system can notify administrators when employees are approaching overtime. TimeClock can also ease record-keeping by tracking which hours should be paid out of the general fund or from an account set up for a specific grant, they said.

Of the 500 full- and part-time employees who support the 2,800-student district, only 182 mostly non-salaried employees -- including maintenance workers, crossing guards, bus monitors and drivers -- use the new system. But the district wants its 340 teachers to agree to use it, too.

Now back to those documents that Tassoni used to support his $100,000 claim. Only two are actual purchase orders, said Venditti.

One for $55,598.68, dated March 15, 2010, was for hardware, software, licensing fees, training and systems support. The purchase included 11 time clocks -- not one -- for nine school buildings.

The other purchase order, for $5,581, dated Feb. 23, 2011, was to renew a technical support agreement  for the TimeClock system for another year.

And that third document, the one with the $40,539 total? It’s just a packing slip. Unlike the other two documents, it does not say ""purchase order"" at the top in large bold letters or include any similar information, such as a  ""P.O. date"" or ""P.O. issued to.""  Data Management Inc., of San Angelo, Texas, simply included it in a shipment of items it sent to Central Falls. The packing slip didn’t total $55,598, the amount of the purchase order, because the $13,442 fingerprint scanning equipment and one other item were shipped separately.

So Tassoni, by simply adding the totals of the three documents, counted some items twice, inflating the original purchase of $55,598.68 (excluding the systems support renewal) by nearly 75 percent.

""It is not $100,000,"" said Venditti,  the finance director.

TimeClock was recommended by UniFund, the New Hampshire company that sold Central Falls its BudgetSense financial software, which helps the schools meet state financial reporting requirements. The programs are compatible.

Like Central Falls, Barrington purchased TimeClock at the advice of UniFund. The town paid only $18,996, said Ronald Tarro, director of administration and finance -- a lot less than Central. Falls. But Barrington bought two fewer clocks and decided not to pay extra for the fingerprint technology. Barrington schools use badges instead.

Barrington’s costs are also substantially lower because only 25 non-salaried maintenance and custodial staff are using TimeClock. Data Management charges a fee based on the number of users--$15 for each of the 500 employees that Central Falls wants to use the clocks.

With the clock still running, where does this leave us?

For starters, Tassoni could have asked school officials about the documents he was shown. Instead, the senator -- who publishes a union newspaper and is a former union administrator -- simply added up the totals on the three documents to push his case against the school leadership. That’s flimsy backup for saying he ""learned"" of a $100,000 expenditure and, then, choosing two words out of context, calling the purchase a ""time clock.""

It clearly was not just a time clock. And it didn’t cost $100,000. The total was just over half that (plus the annual support contracts which are typical of software purchases).

When he turned over the documents to PolitiFact, Tassoni even admitted, ""I could be all wet.""

He IS all wet. But not to worry. We’re going to flame-dry his Dockers with a Pants on Fire!

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Michael Sullivan']","
Michael Sullivan says lawmakers increased public school funding while cutting budget by $15 billion
","
Michael Sullivan, who exhorted legislators to hold the line on the 2012-13 state budget, suggests things aren’t as terrible as critics say. Specifically, Sullivan said in a May 26 tweet: ""State budget being cut $15bil by #TxLege, but public education is getting more money than last biennium.""

Is that the deal?

Some background: The Republican-steered Legislature dealt with a $20 billion-plus shortfall by writing a budget that appropriates $172 billion, which is down $15 billion from what the 2009 Legislature appropriated for 2010-11, as Sullivan says.

Gov. Rick Perry and others have noted the new budget doesn’t require tax increases and also doesn’t tap the rainy day fund, which is projected to hold more than $6 billion by the end of August 2013.

The same budget whittles programs, though. It’s $4.8 billion shy of covering projected Medicaid costs--a gap that leaders hope the economy closes before the 2013 Legislature confronts budgetary issues. The budget also gives school districts $4 billion less than what they would have gotten under existing funding formulas intended to cover enrollment growth.

All told, the budgeted $53.83 billion in public education spending tops--by .2 percent--the $53.7 billion budgeted for public education the previous two years, according to Legislative Budget Board summaries. That $125.2 million increase derives from a $3 billion increase in state spending on public education minus a nearly $2.8 billion decrease in federal spending.

So, total spending is going down $15 billion and public education spending is (narrowly) up.

Anything missing from this picture?

Lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include an alliance of big school districts, told us that while Sullivan’s figures hold up, the implication that schools stand to gain from this budget is incorrect, given that districts will get $4 billion less than they were due under existing law.

We asked Sullivan, president of Empower Texans, a group advocating limited government and less taxation, how he characterizes that $4 billion difference. He replied by email: ""So many numbers tossed around by so many folks about so many things, I could not possibly characterize something so vague . . . How one might wish to characterize those (not enough, too much, just right) is outside this discussion about my tweet noting that the new budget DOES have more dollars in it than the last for public education at the same time over all spending is being cut.""

Historical note: Four of the five previous budgets signed into law by Perry included increases in public school funding. And unlike the 2012-13 budget awaiting his consideration, all five budgets gave schools the aid due them based on state funding formulas. According to the budget board, the overall public education two-year funding increases were 2 percent in 2002-03, 3.3 percent in 2004-05, 7.5 percent in 2006-07 and 34 percent in 2008-09. Funding dipped .9 percent in 2010-11.

Spending on public education is higher in the pending budget than the current one. But Sullivan’s implication--that Texas schools are sitting pretty--obscures reality. The new budget doesn’t cover projected enrollment growth. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB54240>],/factchecks/2011/jun/04/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-lawmakers-increased-public-s/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says Virginia is among few state heading towards budget surplus
","
While touring Asia to drum up business for Virginia, Gov. Bob McDonnell boasted about the Old Dominion’s prudent state government.

""We’re headed towards another surplus this year, unlike most states,"" McDonnell said in a Skype interview from Beijing with NBC 12 reporter Ryan Nobles.  

After years of budget cutting in Richmond and other state capitols, is Virginia really among an elite group of states in the black?

We decided to find out.

Like many states, Virginia has cut spending in recent years. McDonnell and his predecessor, Tim Kaine, worked with legislators to overcome about $6 billion in budget shortfalls. Virginia, like just about every state, is required to have a balanced budget.

About $2.34 billion of the shortfall was mended through budget cuts. The rest of the shortfall was closed with federal stimulus money, transfers from the state’s ""rainy day"" fund and other one-time bookkeeping maneuvers, including the deferment of $850 million in contributions to the state retirement system. In addition, the state required businesses to pay one month of sales tax revenue early.

Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30. Last summer, McDonnell announced the state closed the 2010 budget with a $403 million surplus. About $175 million came from lower-than-expected spending by stage agencies. The rest came from tax revenues that were higher than projected.

So with one month left in the 2011 fiscal year, is another surplus on its way?

Finance Secretary Ric Brown estimated that state tax revenues in fiscal 2011 would be 3.5 percent higher than the prior year. But through 10 months, receipts have actually climbed by 4.5 percent. That extra money, if it holds, would yield  a surplus in the state’s $15.4 billion general fund which pays for education, health programs and public safety. The McDonnell administration has not publicly estimated of the amount of left-over money it expects.

But that doesn’t mean Virginia is back to full financial health. The 2010 surplus, even if supplemented by a 2011 windfall, is far smaller than the cuts made by Virginia during past years. And the $1.9 billion in federal stimulus money used by the state won’t be in future budgets. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Virginia’s general tax revenues peaked in at $17 billion in 2008 and probably won’t return to that pre-recession high until 2013.

So Virginia is indeed on track to post its second consecutive surplus. But the state will also need to make up deferred pension contributions in future budgets. Robert Vaughn, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, said the pension retributions will be made over a number of years and won’t necessarily match the $850 million in contributions Virginia skipped during the recession.

What’s the story in other states?

Todd Haggerty, a fiscal policy analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said most states expect 2011 revenue to climb from 2010. Despite the growth, he said all states except North Dakota are still below their peak revenue levels, which most reached in 2008.

A majority of states are not expected to return to peak revenues until 2014 or later, according to a study. Michigan does not anticipate hitting that mark before 2020 -- at least seven years after Virginia.

Haggerty pointed out that states try to match spending to revenue as closely as possible, and posting a surplus means those estimates were off. Still, he said, it is ""better to be off towards a surplus rather than a deficit.""

In March, the NCSL said 21 states were reporting that personal income taxes were coming in above estimates, while 17 more said the receipts were on target.

The National Association of State Budget Officers came up with similar numbers in a June 2 report. The group said that fiscal 2011 tax revenues are exceeding projections in 22 states, on target in 11 states, and below estimates in 17 states.   

That may sound like good news, but NASBO says there is more to these possible surpluses than meets the eye.

""While any surplus is a positive sign, such surpluses are more likely the result of cuts in spending from previous fiscal years as well as conservative revenue forecasts,"" the group said in its June report.

Let’s review our findings.

McDonnell said, ""We’re heading towards a surplus this year, unlike most states.""

With 10 months of revenue data in hand, Virginia is on track to post a surplus in the 2011 fiscal year. That would follow a surplus in 2010, but state revenue is still below pre-recession levels.

McDonnell seems correct that a minority of states are heading towards surpluses. The NCSL said in March that 21 states were reporting personal income tax revenues were exceeding projections. In June, NASBO reported that overall tax revenues were coming in over estimates in 22 states.

Even with a surplus, Virginia will be working for years to make up for contributions it withheld from the state pension fund to balance the budget during the recession. The state has also relied on federal stimulus dollars that will not be available in the future. So it’s reasonable to question whether the state is really in the black.

For that reason, we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF47D40>],/factchecks/2011/jun/04/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-virginia-among-few-state-heading-to/
"['Oregon', 'Energy', 'Gas Prices', 'Jeff Merkley']","
Jeff Merkley says oil production costs are flat year over year
","
For all of you who’ve watched the spinning numbers at the gas pump, PolitiFact Oregon offers a new challenge -- calculating the cost of finding oil and bringing it to the surface.

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley believes he’s cracked the code. He claimed as much in a May 16, 2011, speech on the Senate floor in which he urged his colleagues to pass legislation that would strip $2 billion in annual tax subsidies from the five biggest oil companies. (The bill failed.)

""So the companies are able to sell oil that costs no more to produce today than it did one month ago, no more to produce today than it did three months ago, when oil was much lower, no more expensive to produce today than one year ago, when it was $3 a gallon,"" he said, noting that the price of oil as he spoke  was $100 a barrel.

With the economics of oil in constant flux, we will focus on the last part of Merkley’s assertion, that oil is ""no more expensive to produce today than one year ago.""

The ultimate price is derived from a complicated -- and dense -- synthesis of fixed costs, the financial markets, geopolitical developments (Libya, for example) and global economics. That includes actual fixed costs such as transporting and refining oil in addition to a highly fluctuating value added by commodity traders.

That’s why members of Congress, including Merkley, have been asking so many questions of late about the role of market speculators who by some estimates can add $20 or more to the cost of a barrel of oil.

To back up his claim, Merkley cites a report by Democrats on the Finance Committee that finds production costs roughly the same from year to to year. That number, however, includes oil from old and very large fields that is much cheaper than oil from new and smaller deposits.

He also points to testimony by ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to the Senate Finance Committee on May 12, 2011.

Tillerson, who was actually responding to a question about the impact of speculators, seemed to corroborate Merkley’s suggestion that the production cost has been stable.

Noting that it’s hard to judge, Tillerson estimated the cost at $60 to $70 a barrel. That includes all production costs, but not the additional costs added by the financial markets.

John Felmy, the chief economist for the oil industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, argues that Merkley is ""flat out wrong.""  The costs fluctuate, he says, based on location, competition for crews and equipment and a host of other factors.

There’s also this: The true cost of finding oil and bringing it to the surface, which is known as the ""lifting cost,"" is directly tied to the size of the deposit. The bigger the reserve, the lower the cost. That’s a problem these days,Felmy says, because oil ""is getting progressively harder to find,"" which means the deposit is usually smaller and the overall cost higher.

Tillerson also raised the point that the costs of finding oil and bringing it to the surface increase as supplies dwindle. But he  said that the industry has become more efficient and used improvements in technology to keep costs lower, making total production costs roughly the same.

It’s also worth noting that the ""finding costs"" are only a fraction of the total cost of a barrel of oil.

The Energy Information Administration, a federal department that independently collects and synthesizes data about energy production and costs, also shows production costs roughly the same from 2006 to 2009. Those are the most recent years for which data has been collected and published.

While the total price of oil is known each day, EIA economist Neal Davis said, data on the production of oil lags more than a year behind. For that reason, he said, it’s impossible to conclusively say whether Merkley’s assertion is correct or not. He also said that costs vary from year to year so it is difficult to draw conclusions on future costs based on a previous year.

Because no absolute answer can be given until new data is available, we think Merkley’s statement needs clarification. But his fundamental point -- that total production costs haven’t changed much in recent years -- is largely correct. Even Exxon CEO Tillerson says total production costs are relatively stable. We rate Merkley’s claim: Mostly True.

NRCC robocall claims four Democrats demanded vote on raising debt limit without spending cuts
","
A House vote on May 31, 2011, on whether to raise the federal debt ceiling -- without dramatic federal spending cuts included -- was seen by many political observers as little more than a vehicle for political posturing. The bill was resoundingly defeated, 318 to 87, with a unanimous Republican caucus joined in opposition by 82 Democrats, some of whom accused Republicans of using the vote to try to score political points.

Indeed, two days after the vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee launched a series of robocalls aimed at 11 Democratic House members, accusing them of wanting to raise the federal debt limit without making any spending cuts.

Actually, there were two versions of the robocalls.

Here's the first: ""The national debt is now 14 trillion dollars, and Congressman Jim Himes just voted for two trillion dollars MORE debt….without any budget cuts.""

That one went out to constituents of John Garamendi, D-Ca., Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., Jim Himes, D-Conn., Rush Holt, D-N.J., Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., Brad Miller, D-N.C., and John Yarmuth, D-Ky..

The second version went like this:

""After spending recklessly and maxing out the nation's credit card, (Rep. David) Cicilline demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts.""

That one went out to constituents of Democrats Leonard Boswell (Iowa), Russ Carnahan (Mo.), David Cicilline (R.I.) and Mark Critz (Pa.),

Catch the subtle difference there? Yeah, neither did we at first.

The group of legislators targeted by the first version actually voted for the bill to raise the debt ceiling. The second group voted no.

So how can the NRCC claim in the second version that the four House Democrats ""demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts""?

NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said that refers to a letter penned by Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and signed by the four targeted House members, which calls on Congress to pass a ""clean extension of the debt ceiling.""

""The debt ceiling vote is about one thing: affirming that America pays its bills,"" the letter states. ""It does not authorize new taxpayer obligations; it affirms to the world our commitment to pay obligations already incurred. To do otherwise, or to threaten to do so, or to leverage our duty to pay our bills to achieve a partisan advantage in budget disputes, jeopardizes the full faith and credit of the United States of America.""

So if the those four Democrats signed the letter, why did they vote against the debt ceiling bill this week?

In a written statement explaining his vote, Carnahan said the vote was ""a political stunt, and I voted no because we’re not going to fall for it.""

""Once silly season is over, I look forward to sitting down with Democrats and Republicans, having a serious discussion about reducing the deficit and setting aside our differences to get this done,"" Carnahan stated.

We doubt that most people getting the carefully-worded robocall would pick up on the nuance that, while the targeted legislators ""demanded that Congress vote"" on the bill, they didn't actually vote for it.

The calls also misled by accusing the Democratic congressmen of ""spending recklessly and maxing out the nation's credit card."" Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio examined a similar claim from a  recent NRCC news release that said Rep. Betty Sutton, D-Ohio,  ""and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."" They rated the claim Barely True, noting that, although Democrats have certainly voted for increased spending over the last two years, it ignores all the other previous spending and borrowing that factored into the debt, such as the war and the Bush tax cuts. They also pointed out that, since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling 10 times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama.

The NRCC later earned a Pants on Fire ruling for claiming PolitiFact Ohio confirmed its contention that Betty Sutton ""maxed out federal debt.""

Sam Drzymala, a spokesman for Carnahan, said the NRCC's robocalls also distort Democrats' position on spending cuts.

""Congressman Carnahan has always called for cuts that would put our financial house in order,"" he said. ""It's a matter of priorities.""

When House Republicans passed their budget, Carnahan’s office released a statement April 12, 2011, highlighting the different approaches the two parties have taken with regard to proposed cuts.
 
""I’m deeply disappointed in the extreme proposal put forward by my Republican colleagues,"" Carnahan stated. ""They lack the courage to end taxpayer giveaways to the oil industry, millionaires and profitable companies sending jobs overseas. But –- shockingly –- Republicans want to pay for these handouts by gutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

""Both sides have agreed to serious budget cuts –- but the choice is between responsible cuts and extreme cuts that endanger our fragile recovery and scapegoat our seniors.""

Drzymala further noted that in 2009, 174 Republicans objected to attaching a debt limit increase to a defense spending bill.

""Apparently they wanted a clean vote then,"" Drzymala said. ""Why have they flip-flopped? Because they are playing political games. This is not about substance.""

A spokeswoman for Cicilline, Jessica Kershaw, said Cicilline's support for the Welch's letter calling for a ""clean"" debt ceiling bill didn't mean he wasn't committed to cutting federal spending.

""Congressman Cicilline believes we have to be serious about cutting government spending and the obligation to pay our bills,"" Kershaw said. ""There is a serious bipartisan effort underway led by the vice president to determine the best way of reducing our nation’s debt, and the congressman believes we should allow that process to proceed. He did not think this week’s vote was a serious effort to tackle the debt because, for example, it assigned responsibility for the entire debt to the president’s FY ’12 budget –- which the House hasn’t even considered.""

Our fact-check here is whether the four Democrats targeted by the robocall ""demanded that Congress vote to increase the nation’s debt limit without making any spending cuts."" Again, none of the four actually voted for the bill to raise the debt ceiling. All four did sign a letter in April that sought a ""clean"" vote on raising the debt ceiling -- one that wasn't directly tied to spending cuts. However, all of the congressmen have gone on record in support of spending cuts independent of the debt ceiling vote. Republicans and Democrats have disagreements about how and where to cut and how much, but that's different than not wanting to make spending cuts at all. We rate the NRCC's claim in the robocalls Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB918680>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-robocall-debt-ceiling-spending-cuts/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Barack Obama ""traveled around the globe to apologize for America.”
","
During the formal announcement of his presidential candidacy on June 2, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney repeated a shot at President Barack Obama that he had taken in the title of his 2010 book, No Apology.

""A few months into office, (Obama) traveled around the globe to apologize for America,"" Romney said during his kickoff speech at a farm in Stratham, N.H.

Did Obama really do that much apologizing? 
We published a fact-check of a similar charge by Romney on March 15, 2010. Here’s the claim from Romney’s book that we checked back then:

""Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined,"" Romney wrote. ""It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them.""

In the book, Romney specifically named the speeches he was referring to:

""In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy.""

At the time, we rated the claim False. Seeing Romney make the charge again during his announcement speech, we thought it would be worth seeing if what he said this time was any more or less accurate. (His staff did not answer a request for comment.)

Let’s first recap our findings from March 2010.

What Obama said

For starters, as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: ""sorry."" Merriam-Webster defines an apology as ""an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret.""

We read the seven Obama speeches cited in Romney’s book and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now.

At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together.

At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States ""has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive."" But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a ""casual"" and ""insidious"" anti-Americanism. ""On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated,"" Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, ""I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust.  Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country.  Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.""

At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. ""Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable,"" Obama said. ""I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world.""

At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply ""move forward."" Here are his exact remarks: ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.  Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.  This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.""

Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in the fact we're checking. Typically, Obama would say that the United States must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama ""unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year."" (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; we’ve rated it a Promise Broken.)

Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were  at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, ""our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions."" He also said that the Guantanamo prison ""likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies.""

Did Obama apologize?

We sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing.

• Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, ""Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower.""

""Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies,"" Gardiner said. ""It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership.""

He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the United States has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. ""There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation,"" he said.

• John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.

""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" Murphy said. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret.""

Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. ""There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will,"" Murphy said. ""The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that.

• Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it.

She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words ""sorry"" or ""regret."" ""I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there,"" Bloom said.

Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy.

""Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal,"" Bloom said. ""For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable.""

• Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery.

""To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent,"" Howard-Hassman said. ""A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it.""

Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said.

""Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society, and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect,"" she said. ""But a gesture of respect is not an apology.""

Other presidential apologies

Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. ""The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well,"" Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.""

Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. ""The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong,"" Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. ""To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry.""

Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. ""My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over,"" he said. ""The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all.""

Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. ""We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America,"" Bush said. ""I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America.""

Obama's praise and motivations

While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledged as much when he wrote that Obama, ""always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there.""

In Cairo, Obama called the United States ""one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world."" At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, ""What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history.""

And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: ""Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.""

What’s new from the announcement speech

The two statements we’ve checked -- the one from Romney’s book in 2010, and the one from his announcement speech in 2011 -- are similar, but not identical.

They share substance -- a portrayal of Obama’s comments in his early months in office as ""apologies."" But we note an added emphasis in the announcement speech that sharpens Romney’s charge. He said Obama ""traveled around the globe to apologize for America,"" which suggests that the apologies didn’t merely happen during Obama’s travels, but that the travels were undertaken for the specific purpose of apologizing.

Some of the Obama speeches that Romney cited in the book certainly laid out the newly inaugurated president’s foreign policy ideas, and it seems fair to say that a less confrontational approach was among Obama’s goals. After all, Obama had made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued.

Still, we think it’s incorrect for Romney to portray these early speeches as part of a global tour undertaken ""to apologize for America."" Using Romney’s standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an ""apology"" for the previous policy.

Our ruling

On the substance of Romney’s charge, we believe that what we wrote in March 2010 still stands. While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch. And on the new angle he added -- that the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries -- we think it’s a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter. So we rate Romney’s statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACBB800>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-traveled-around-glob/
"['Jobs', 'Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Cantor says stimulus ""failed to get people back to work.""
","
The Democrats’ massive stimulus program passed two years ago was a dud, according to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

""They (Democrats) passed a nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill which failed to get people back to work,"" Cantor, R-7th, said in a May 26 news conference of House Republican leaders.

Cantor is referring to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in February 2009.  Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states. It adds $830 billion to the budget deficit between fiscal years 2009-2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Let’s turn to the crux of the majority leader’s assertion -- that the measure failed to get people back to work. How does Cantor justify that statement?

In an e-mail, Cantor spokeswoman Megan Whittemore characterized his statement as a broad  proclamation that the stimulus failed. She noted that the unemployment rate is higher now than when the stimulus passed, that there are more discouraged workers and that private sector growth in May was much slower than expected, she said.

""Of course, when the government spends that much money it’s able to hire additional government workers, but it failed to spur real private sector growth,"" Whittemore said.

Cantor didn’t specify in his statement what kinds of jobs he was talking about -- public or private. So we won’t give him the benefit of his staff’s elaboration after the fact.

Also, the economic statistics Cantor’s office cited don’t address whether there were people who returned job rolls as a result of the stimulus.

Cantor simply said the stimulus ""failed to get people back to work.""

Is that true?  We decided to check.

The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus.

Virginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans.

White House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools.

Even so, the statistics suggest a benefit to Cantor’s constituents in suburban Richmond counties, many of whom work for the state government. The data shows 178 full-time equivalent jobs arising from the stimulus were located in Cantor’s district.

The Government Accountability Office has criticized the White House tallies, noting in a November 2009 report that there were ""significant reporting and quality issues""  in how the figures were compiled.

For more insight, we contacted the Virginia Department of Education. Charles Pyle, a spokesman, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money.

In a report released March 18, 2011, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.

Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional budget office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found:

*CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. 
*IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.

*Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.

*Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.

Many conservative economists balk at the methodology of these studies, which they say depends on assumptions that government stimulus automatically generates a net gain in economic activity. Conservatives have argued government stimulus doesn’t boost the economy, but merely shifts around dollars that could be better spent by the private sector. They’re also concerned deficit spending creates uncertainty for businesses looking to hire.

Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, is among those skeptical the stimulus is a net plus for the nation’s employment picture. In an Aug. 2, 2010 column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, he wondered how many private-sector jobs were lost or not created because he said the stimulus shifted money from the private sector to the government.

But does that mean that the stimulus failed to put people back to work?

In an interview, DeHaven said the stimulus program did create jobs, at least in the short term.

""On one hand, it creates jobs,"" DeHaven said. ""But at what cost?""

To sum up:

Cantor said the stimulus ""failed to get people back to work.""

A variety of national studies estimate the measure saved or created at least 1.3 million jobs. The reports do not break down how many of the positions were new and how many were existing jobs that didn’t get cut. They do not tell us how many of the jobs were in the private sector and how many were public ones.

But they do provide ample evidence that the stimulus did get people back to work. We rate Cantor’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC022C80>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/eric-cantor/cantor-says-stimulus-failed-get-people-back-work/
"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Mike Haridopolos']","
Mike Haridopolos claims Medicaid reform was bipartisan
","
Mike Haridopolos is eager to prove himself a worthier U.S. Senate candidate than his rivals. Contenders Adam Hasner and George LeMieux have spent the past few months out of office, but Haridopolos was spotlighted during the session as state Senate president. So why not tout his legislative victories? 
Haridopolos set out to do just that in an interview on Bay News 9's ""Political Connections"" show on May 22, 2011. Co-host and St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam Smith asked Haridopolos for his view on a plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to reform Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older. 
Ryan's plan, explained here in another PolitiFact fact-check, would basically shift Medicare's insurance responsibilities from the federal government to private insurance companies as a way of dramatically cutting costs, starting in 2022. Haridopolos neglected to answer if he would back the Ryan plan if he were a senator, but he commended Ryan for ""having an honest discussion with the American public."" Then Haridopolos steered the conversation away from the country's Medicare debate to Florida's problem with Medicaid -- and what he, as Senate president, has done about it. 
(Haridopolos caught heat about a week later when he tried to dodge the Medicare question again. A conservative radio host booted him off his show on May 31 for failing to say how he would vote on Ryan's plan if he were a member of the U.S. Senate. The incident prompted Haridopolos' campaign staff to say he would not vote for the plan as written.) 
But let's get back to Medicaid. Florida's Medicaid program insures about 3 million Floridians and eats up one-third, or about $22 billion, of the state budget. Haridopolos took on the issue ""aggressively,"" he said, which resulted in reforms passing the House and his chamber. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bills on June 2. 
""No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill (Medicaid) passed,"" Haridopolos said. ""We did in the Florida Senate because we listened to people for two years before we acted. Same thing with Medicare. We're going to take the input of the people and not have this top-down approach."" 
A bipartisan bill passed in the Florida Senate, eh? If true, that bolsters Haridopolos' argument that he can create policy with the blessings of competing parties. 
Sounds easy enough to check. 
Let's start by reviewing what the Legislature passed. The Medicaid package moves almost all management of Florida's Medicaid program to state-approved HMOs and health care networks. It's a departure from the old system, in which the state pays doctors for procedures they perform. Among other effects, the plan requires managed care companies to share profits and allows recipients to obtain vouchers for private health insurance. The overhaul needs approval in the form of a waiver by the federal government, which pays for more than half of the state program. Republicans say it will improve care, reduce fraud and save the state money as the program's costs threaten to escalate. 
Now to examine the votes. First, remember the makeup of the Florida Legislature, where Republicans hold veto-proof majorities. The House numbers this session were 81-39 GOP, and the Senate was 28-12 GOP. So passage of a Republican-backed bill didn't need bipartisan votes. 
Florida's Medicaid reform package required the House and Senate to vote on two bills: HB 7107 and HB 7109. In the House, both passed along party lines. In Haridopolos' Senate, HB 7107 passed by 28-11, with all the ""yea"" votes coming from Republicans, and all the ""no"" votes from Democrats -- a strict party-line vote. HB 7109 passed the Senate 26-12, and the the only bipartisan moment occurred when Republican Sen. John Thrasher voted against the measure, on the side of united Democrats. 
But even that was short-lived, as Thrasher changed his vote to ""yea"" immediately after the vote, according to the vote history. 
So there were no traces of bipartisan votes in Medicaid reform that passed both chambers. 
We asked Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop to explain what Haridopolos meant by ""bipartisan"" Medicaid reform. Bishop pointed us to two committee votes on the Senate's version of Medicaid reform, SB 1972. This bill never reached the Senate floor, though, because it was replaced by the House bills. 
That said, it did earn a few Democratic votes -- three, to be exact -- in two committee stops. Here's a recap: 
We followed up with Sobel about her two ""yes"" votes. Would she call the Senate's Medicaid reform bipartisan? She offered this explanation via e-mail: 
""The Senate Medicaid reform proposal was a work in progress during the committee process. I was hopeful that a final product would benefit Floridians, but compromises with the House of Representatives resulted in something that would hurt the poorest of Floridians. I opposed the final version of the bill and voted 'no.' "" 
Sobel added: ""The final version of the Medicaid reform bill was by no means bipartisan."" 
We asked Sen. Nan Rich, the Senate's minority leader, for her thoughts. Before the May 6, 2011, vote, she said, Senate Democrats took a caucus position to oppose Medicaid reform. The Democrats felt the Republican-led measures would undermine the quality of care for recipients, among other concerns, she said. 
""I can promise you that it was not bipartisan,"" she said. 
So where does that leave our ruling? Haridopolos claims the Senate passed ""bipartisan"" Medicaid reform this session. But the final, official tallies in the Senate were both strict party-line votes. Democrats even agreed in their caucus that they would oppose Medicaid reform, and they remained united on that. Haridopolos' spokesman points out a couple Democrats who voted for reform in committee -- but the version of the bill they voted on never reached the Senate floor and was not the version that passed. We looked for bipartisanship but didn't find it here. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB35700>],/factchecks/2011/jun/03/mike-haridopolos/mike-haridopolos-claims-medicaid-reform-was-bipart/
