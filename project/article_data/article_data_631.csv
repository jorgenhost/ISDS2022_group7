A claim that viruses and other pathogens always evolve to become less lethal is false
","As scientists work to uncover the characteristics of recently discovered COVID-19 variant omicron, social media posts are claiming that it represents a diminished risk to the public. ""Pathogens evolve to become less, not more, virulent over time,"" says one Facebook post. ""If pathogens evolved to become more virulent with time they’d destroy their hosts which they depend on to live and you wouldn’t be here to read this."" The post cites HIV in Uganda and Ebola as examples of viruses that have become less virulent with time. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim makes a broad generalization about pathogens that’s not supported by science. It has been well-documented that pathogens can evolve to be more virulent. And many viruses, including HIV and Ebola, have in fact become more lethal over time. ""You can’t just say it’s going to become nicer — that somehow a well-adapted pathogen doesn’t harm its host,"" Andrew Read, an evolutionary microbiologist at Penn State University, said in an interview. ""Modern evolutionary biology, and a lot of data, shows that doesn’t have to be true. It can get nicer, and it can get nastier."" Viruses, which are composed primarily of genetic material encased in either a protein or lipid shell, can’t replicate on their own. They rely on their hosts to provide the machinery to copy their genetic material and produce the proteins they need to propagate. During that process, mutations may be introduced into their genetic material that can make them more or less effective at surviving and spreading. These mutations also affect the virus' virulence, or its capacity to harm its host. Viruses that are given enough time to replicate and spread are more likely to develop a mutation that aids their survival. Which types of mutations are helpful to a virus, however, can be difficult to predict. What scientists want to understand about any given pathogen are the selective pressures, or external factors that affect their ability to survive, that push them to become more or less infectious and harmful over time. The claim on Facebook aligns with a theory attributed to the late-19th-century pathologist Theobald Smith, who observed that cattle repeatedly exposed to a tick-borne pathogen developed more moderate infections compared to first encounters. A subsequent theory, the trade-off model, posits that pathogens evolve by balancing their need to propagate using host resources against the risk of doing too much harm to their hosts. These models, however, are subject to debate among evolutionary biologists, and available studies provide only partial support for them. Other factors, including vaccines and how many hosts are available to be infected, further complicate the external pressures that determine how a virus might evolve. HIV, for example, adapts very quickly to local conditions — while it may be weakening in one area of the world, it may become more lethal in another. Many viruses have gotten deadlier over time. Some, including influenza and HIV, have developed drug-resistant variants. Others, including Ebola and Zika, have adapted to human hosts by evolving in ways that maximize their ability to infect people. Even the myxoma virus, a rabbit pathogen often cited as an example of declining virulence, has been shown to become more lethal over time. A virus doesn’t necessarily need to keep its host alive in order to continue spreading and replicating its genetic material. And notably, the virus that causes COVID-19 is most transmissible before symptoms set in, so its harmfulness to its host may not be as strong an influence on how it evolves as the trade-off model suggests. ""The virus, speaking anthropomorphically, just wants to spread and have its genes replicated,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, in an interview. ""If the best way for it is to spread by causing severe symptoms, it will continue to do that."" A Facebook post claims that pathogens evolve to become less virulent over time, because otherwise, ""they’d destroy their hosts which they depend on to live."" Viruses can evolve to become both more or less virulent over time, and do not necessarily require the survival of their host to maximize their transmission. This post cherry-picks examples to make a generalization that ignores the wide swath of epidemiological and laboratory evidence showing that pathogens can evolve to become more lethal.

European leader did not say the Nuremberg Code should be disregarded

If you’ve been quiet and politely compliant, it’s past time to be bold and end this evil!""  During a Dec. 1, 2021, press conference, von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called for a discussion about mandatory COVID-19 vaccination within the European Union, as a way to increase vaccination rates. The Post Millennial story falsely equated those comments with a willingness to disregard the Nuremberg Code, a post-World War II treaty which includes the principle that humans should not be involuntarily subjected to medical experiments. But von der Leyen did not say the Nuremberg Code should be disregarded and did not mention the treaty during the press conference. A spokesperson for von der Leyen said it was not true that she called for throwing out the Nuremberg Code, and referenced video footage of the press conference. Beginning at the 12:22 mark in the video, a reporter from the Greek Press Agency asked von der Leyen what her position is on mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. The commission president answered that it is ""pure member state competence,"" which means the decision rests with member states of the European Union. She noted that one-third of the entire population in the European Union — 150 million people — are not vaccinated, though some are not eligible, such as very young children. Then, at the 14:12 mark, von der Leyen said, ""I think it is understandable and appropriate to lead this discussion now, how we can encourage and potentially think about mandatory vaccination within the European Union. This needs discussion, this needs a common approach, but it is a discussion that I think has to be led."" The Post Millennial story’s reference to the Nuremberg Code appears to stem from false claims that COVID-19 vaccinations are a violation of the Nuremberg code. After World War II, some people were charged under the treaty with carrying out forced medical experimentation. Experts have said such claims are based on a false premise that COVID-19 vaccinations are medical experiments. The vaccines were tested on volunteer participants in clinical trials that met acceptable legal and ethical standards.

Do U.S. families have more money in their pockets now, despite inflation?
","Despite overseeing strong showings in employment and economic growth, President Joe Biden’s public standing has been weakened by inflation levels not seen in decades. During Dec. 3 remarks on the most recent jobs report, Biden said that some of the economic achievements on his watch have allowed Americans to keep a step ahead of inflation. ""Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year,"" Biden said. When we took a closer look, we found that Biden has a point. To zero in on how much Americans have ""in their pockets"" despite inflation, we turned to a statistic calculated by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis: Per capita, inflation-adjusted disposable personal income. When we inquired, the White House confirmed to PolitiFact that this was the statistic Biden had in mind. Disposable personal income refers to wage and salary income, plus government transfer payments like Social Security and unemployment insurance, minus taxes. It’s the net of what Americans have left over to pay for all of their needs after they’ve paid their taxes. The figure we used is adjusted for inflation and calculated on a per capita — that is, a per person — basis. During the coronavirus pandemic, this metric has been unusually volatile. That’s because the federal government enacted several massive bills that provided cash payments, expanded unemployment insurance, business loans, and liberalized child tax credits to help the nation cope with an unprecedentedly sudden economic shutdown after the virus emerged. In the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 — the quarters that included some of the most intensive federal relief efforts, including the cash payments — personal disposable income rose significantly higher than usual. Smaller but tangible bumps were also evident in the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Beyond these anomalous quarters, though, the data shows that personal disposable income has risen fairly steadily since the first quarter of 2016.    This means that, even setting aside the unusually high quarters, per-capita, inflation-adjusted personal disposable income was higher in the third quarter of 2021 — at $47,188 — than it was in the fourth quarter of 2020, when it was $46,682, as well as every month prior to the pandemic. (These are ""annualized"" rates, which means that the amount of disposable income for a quarter is multiplied by four, to show what it would look like over the course of a whole year.) One way to look at this is that we’re simply following the gentle upswing in personal disposable income that’s been under way for years. But economists say that would be misleading, since staying on that trend line was no foregone conclusion once the pandemic hit.  ""It's honestly quite surprising to look at the personal income data and not see a deep gash in income,"" said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. ""To continue a long-term trend of growing personal income when the economy was getting hammered is a pretty impressive feat of policy."" To see a decline in gross domestic product of more than 30% between the first and second quarters of 2020 is akin to ""a Great Depression in one quarter,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. ""But there was enough cash coming out of the government that you don’t see it in the personal disposable income data. It’s stunning."" Part of the reason for larger disposable incomes is government payments, but another part is the reality that Americans were unable to spend what they would have on many services, including restaurants and tourism during the pandemic. One clear sign of that is the personal saving rate. For four years prior to the pandemic, personal saving as a percentage of disposable income usually hovered between 7% and 9%. But after the pandemic struck, it initially spiked to 26% and has remained higher than the pre-pandemic average ever since.   This has been echoed in a different metric, as well. JPMorgan Chase research found that median cash balances — the amounts of money Americans have in the bank — were more than 50% higher at the end of July 2021 than they were at the end of July 2019.  Biden and his policies deserve a share of credit, experts say, but not all of it. The CARES Act, passed early in the pandemic, was a broadly bipartisan bill that was signed by then-President Donald Trump. Trump also signed a series of smaller bipartisan relief bills. Biden’s biggest contribution, the American Rescue Plan, was passed with only Democratic support. ""You can argue how much credit Biden and the American Rescue Plan deserve, as opposed to Trump and the CARES Act,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. But both efforts, he said, were a ""big deal."" Biden said, ""Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year."" Since the start of the pandemic, there has been unusual volatility in the metric used for this purpose — per capita, inflation-adjusted personal disposable income. But even setting those quarters aside, the country has seen steady growth in disposable income since before the pandemic hit. Not all of this has to do with organic economic growth. The expansion of disposable income is partly due to changes in Americans’ spending behaviors during the pandemic, but it has a lot to do with the emergency fiscal measures that were passed under both the Trump and Biden administrations.

Oncologists' claim that Build Back Better Act will slash cancer care funding omits key details
","An advertisement from the Community Oncology Alliance, part of a $1.6 million campaign running both on radio airwaves and in print, attacks a proposal in the Democratic-backed Build Back Better package approved by the House last month and now headed to the Senate.  The ads, which started on Nov. 29 and are set to run through Dec. 12, say parts of the legislation would have ""serious unintended consequences"" for cancer patients — specifically, that ""an independent analysis shows that payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45%, causing cancer clinics to close and massively raising your healthcare costs."" The alliance is an advocacy and lobbying organization representing physicians and clinics involved with cancer care. The Build Back Better plan is the Biden administration’s legislative proposal that includes an array of health provisions, from plans to curb prescription drug costs to expansion of Medicare coverage. The provision targeted by the alliance’s ad would empower the federal government to negotiate prices for a small set of yet unnamed expensive drugs, including cancer treatments, with the aim of lowering prices, an important campaign promise by both President Joe Biden and numerous congressional Democrats.  That got us wondering: Would the plan really result in reduced payments for cancer care and higher health care costs, as the ads claim? Because drug pricing and negotiations — as well as the Senate action on the proposal — are such hot news right now, we took a closer look. The experts we talked to expressed no doubt that certain provisions of the Build Back Better proposal, if passed into law, would reduce some payments to oncology offices. But we found that the advertisement leaves out key details about the scope of those cuts, an omission that could mislead people who hear or see the ads.  The oncologists’ ad is just one of many ads in recent weeks seeking to sway opinions as Congress considers legislation that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, something it currently cannot do. At the root of the ad’s claim is the way Medicare pays for drugs administered in doctors’ offices. These payments are particularly important to some specialists, including oncologists. Lower prices paid by the government for these drugs also result in less administrative revenue for physician offices. Oncologists and other specialists provide injections or infusions in a medical office, covered by Part B of Medicare. Medicare reimburses physicians for the cost of the drug based on its average sales price, plus a 6% ""add-on"" payment, which is meant to cover the cost of overhead, staffing and the effort that goes into purchasing the drug. (Pre-pandemic, those payments were reduced to 4.3% under a complicated budget sequester process but were reinstated at the higher level for the duration of the health emergency.) The percentage-based payment formula has the unintended consequence of incentivizing expensive drugs over lower-cost options: A 6% add-on to a $10,000 drug translates to a lot more money than for a $1,000 drug. Over the years, pharmaceutical companies and physician groups, including the Community Oncology Alliance, roundly criticized attempts to change the formula and succeeded in killing proposals. The Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House, would have Medicare negotiate prices for a small number of high-priced drugs, including those used by oncologists under Part B, starting in 2025. At first, only 10 drugs would be selected, and the list would grow to 20 in 2028. There would be an upper limit on price, called the Maximum Fair Price, which is expected to be lower than average sales prices. That would save Medicare and taxpayers money on those drugs. Patients, too, might save money because their copays are set as a percentage of the cost of the drug. Oncologists would still get a 6% add-on fee for overhead and administration, but that 6% would be on a lower price, hence the decrease in revenue that concerns the doctors. We reached out to the Community Oncology Alliance to ask about the ad’s assertions that payments for cancer care would be cut by 45%. It provided a number of reports, including one it commissioned by consulting firm Avalere Health, that calculated the possible revenue loss, and a separate study that tracks mergers, acquisitions, closures and financial matters affecting oncology practices. For its report, Avalere chose 10 drugs it thought were likely to make the administration’s list, then calculated the likely negotiated price and the resulting add-on payments. While it varies by specialty, the overall average reduction in add-on revenue would be 39% for those specific 10 drugs, with physician offices seeing a 44.2% drop, and hospitals seeing a 36% decline, said Milena Sullivan, a principal with the health policy team at Avalere and the report’s lead author. But the wording in the ad — ""payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45%"" — glosses over the specifics of that finding. It seems to suggest overall revenue for community cancer clinics would be cut 45%, whereas the reduction identified in the study affects only a segment of their revenue: the add-on payments for some of the drugs that clinics and physicians provide. ""They commissioned an analysis that did not look at the total impact on community oncology practice finances. They looked just at drugs affected, which wildly inflates impact,"" said Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an expert on drug costs. Without details on what percentage of a practice’s revenue comes from the add-on payments for a specific set of drugs that has yet to be defined, ""we don’t know how much this is going to reduce oncologists’ income,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow in health care policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Ted Okon, executive director for the alliance, defended the wording, saying, ""You can only say so much in an ad."" ""Those are the biggest drugs out there,"" Okon said. ""If you take a hit of 42.9% on 70% of your practice, or even 60%, you are dead in the water."" However, the alliance didn’t have specific data on the overall percentage of revenue that the add-on payments represent. Okon argues that the revenue hit will be substantial enough that it would lead some practices to close, others to merge and still others to be sold to hospitals. The new maximum prices in Medicare would also affect how private insurers calculate their payments, he said, possibly adding to the revenue woes. Already, financial pressures have led to closures, mergers or financial difficulty for more than 1,700 community practices over the past 12 years, shifting a portion of cancer care ""from independent practice settings to hospitals,"" he said. He thinks that reduces patient choice and could also lead to higher costs for Medicare and patients, because they then seek care at hospitals, which are more expensive. Joseph Antos, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, expressed doubts. He said that the Avalere analysis looks correct and that practices will lose a chunk of revenue from add-on payments. ""The impact would be pretty substantial,"" he said. ""But that doesn’t mean this business about clinics closing is right."" The advertisement says an independent analysis shows that under the Build Back Better bill as it’s currently written, ""payments for cancer care will be slashed by close to 45% causing cancer clinics to close and massively raising your healthcare costs."" The advertisement leaves out important context about the analysis. For one, the cuts it cites are to an unspecified portion of oncologists’ revenue, the add-on revenue for administering certain drugs. Secondly, it isn’t yet known which drugs will be affected. The cuts may well prove substantial for some practices, particularly those that use a lot of the treatments ultimately selected for price negotiation.  As to closures, even without this change, some clinics will face financial stress leading to mergers, or sales to hospitals, mirroring what is happening in other sectors of the health industry. The argument that fewer clinics could lead more patients to get cancer care in hospitals — at higher costs to them, to Medicare and to private insurers — is economically plausible. But lower cancer drug costs in Medicare would mean savings for patients, since the program limits copayment amounts for patients who don’t have supplemental insurance to cover those costs.

Article misleads on dangers of omicron variant using UK virus and vaccination data
","An article claiming that the omicron COVID-19 variant will be most dangerous to fully vaccinated people is circulating on social media.  ""Only the Fully Vaccinated should fear the New ‘Worst Ever’ Covid-19 Variant; data shows they already account for 4 in every 5 Covid Deaths,"" reads the headline, which we found screengrabbed and shared on Instagram.  The alarming story was published by The Daily Expose, a U.K.-focused site that has published COVID-19  misinformation before. The article purports to take readers ""on a journey"" through months of COVID-19 data from the U.K. Health Security Agency. The blog post lists statistics and percentages about the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, making comparisons between those who are vaccinated and those who are unvaccinated.  According to the article, the data shows, ""why, if the rumours are true, the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about, but the vaccinated population have everything to fear."" This is inaccurate and misleading. The Health Security Agency, the U.K.’s public health arm, has repeatedly warned against misrepresenting and misinterpreting the available COVID-19 data in this way. The posts sharing this article were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that suggests only those who are fully vaccinated should fear the newly discovered omicron variant. Studies show that the available vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death.  The Daily Expose cites the Health Security Agency’s Nov. 25 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report as the source of its data, but it was unclear how the numbers referenced in its article were reached.  The article claims that there were ""833,332 recorded Covid-19 cases, 9,094 Covid-19 hospitalisations and 3,700 Covid-19 deaths from October 25th to November 21st.""  From there, it proceeds to provide the percentages of those individuals who were unvaccinated vs. those who were vaccinated. ""Of these the unvaccinated accounted for 39% of all cases, 34% of all hospitalisations, and 19% of all deaths,"" the article reads. ""Whilst the vaccinated accounted for 61% of all cases, 66% of all hospitalisations, and 81% of all deaths.""  Presumably the percentages were calculated by dividing the number of people in each group who tested positive for COVID-19 by the total number of cases and multiplying the outcome by 100, and then repeating the same process for COVID hospitalizations and deaths.  Calculations aside, presenting the data in this way is misleading, because it fails to account for the U.K.’s high overall vaccination rate and differences between vaccinated and the unvaccinated populations that may skew the numbers.  The Health Security Agency report emphasized that in a number of ways. Early on in the report, the following warning is provided:  ""We present data on COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status. These raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness as the data does not take into account inherent biases present such as differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations."" In the interpretation section of the report (Page 27), just before the vaccine data breakdown is provided, the agency warns that the ""vaccination status of cases, inpatients and deaths should not be used to assess vaccine effectiveness because of differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated population.""  ""The case rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are crude rates that do not take into account underlying statistical biases in the data,"" reads the report.  The report goes on to point out potential examples of ""systematic differences"" between those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated, such as:  People who are vaccinated may be more health conscious, and therefore more likely to get tested for COVID.  People who were first in line for vaccines were those at higher risk due to their age, occupation or underlying health conditions. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people may have different levels of exposure to COVID because of the ways they behave. Then, once again, the agency warns people to interpret the data provided with careful consideration. Each table says, ""These data should be interpreted with caution,"" and directs people to a footnote:  ""In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective."" Beyond those warnings, the Health Security Agency published a blog post of its own to explain why claims like the ones made in The Daily Expose’s article are misleading.  ""A simple comparison of COVID-19 case rates in those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated should not be used to assess how effective a vaccine is in preventing serious health outcomes,"" the agency wrote in a Nov. 2 blog post. ""This is because these figures are susceptible to a number of differences between the groups, other than the vaccine itself, and these biases mean that you cannot use the rates to determine how well the vaccines work.""  The agency noted that when simply comparing the numbers of cases in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, ""the rate of cases in the vaccinated people appears higher for many age groups."" (The bold emphasis is ours.) ""This is because there are key differences in the characteristics and behaviour of individuals who are vaccinated compared to those who are unvaccinated,"" the agency explained. ""The rates therefore reflect this population’s behaviour and exposure to COVID-19, not how well the vaccines work."" The agency went on to explain how it controls for those factors when assessing the effectiveness of the vaccines. In the vaccine surveillance report, the Health Security Agency indicates on page 10 that the vaccines are highly effective against the widespread delta COVID variant.  For example, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is 95%-99% effective at preventing hospitalization with a high degree of confidence and 90%-99% effective at preventing mortality with a medium degree of confidence.  The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which is approved in the U.K., is similarly 90%-99% effective at preventing hospitalization with a high degree of confidence and is 90%-95% effective at preventing mortality. ""We believe that transparency — coupled with explanation — remains the best way to deal with misinformation,"" the agency wrote.  An article claimed, ""Only the Fully Vaccinated should fear the New ‘Worst Ever’ Covid-19 Variant; data shows they already account for 4 in every 5 Covid Deaths.""  This is inaccurate and misleading. Without controlling for outside factors, data for U.K. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and vaccinations appear to indicate that a higher percentage of vaccinated people have contracted COVID-19 and experienced serious health outcomes compared to unvaccinated people. But experts have repeatedly warned that interpreting the available COVID-19 data this way is misleading. There is no evidence that only those who are fully vaccinated should fear the omicron variant. Studies show that the available vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death — at least in variants that have been researched.

","On Dec. 2, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted a video encouraging people to get their COVID-19 booster shot, writing: ""I’ve just got my booster jab."" But some people are skeptical that it really happened.  ""Boris Johnson getting boosted today by a nurse without gloves and a needle with the blue lid still on LMFAO,"" reads a description of a photo of the British Prime Minister that’s being shared on Facebook.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the photo posted on Facebook, as well as in others photos and videos of the prime minister receiving his booster, the part of the syringe that’s pressed against his arm is blue — but it’s not the needle’s cap.  Images of such a shot can be seen alongside news coverage of COVID-19 vaccines in publications including Insider, the Guardian, and Forbes. The needle extends past the blue plastic. That’s especially clear in this Associated Press photo of a health care worker preparing a Pfizer shot.    But it’s also apparent in other photos and videos of Johnson getting his booster. BBC reporter Alistair Coleman tweeted one such picture in a thread debunking claims that the booster shot scene was staged. So did the Associated Press. And the needle is visible from several angles in this 51-second video posted on YouTube by Bloomberg.   The AP reported that the blue part of the needle that some people are mistaking for the cap is actually called the ""hub,"" and it connects the needle to the barrel of the syringe.

That image with a dressed-up Trump is not his official Christmas card
","People are decking their social media feeds with a viral Christmas card of former President Donald Trump.

La Palma volcano eruption does not pose major tsunami threat to US
","The ongoing eruption of a volcano on La Palma in the Canary Islands — about 3,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern U.S. coast — has triggered claims that a catastrophic volcanic collapse and tsunami could be in the cards. A viral video features an unidentified man saying, ""I’m showing a map of the East Coast of the United States … all the way up into Canada. Because if that land mass breaks off from La Palma volcano, there would be no tsunami sirens, there will be no notification because the Biden administration doesn’t want to tell anybody."" It included text that said, ""Flood map for East Coast in 50 meters = 160 foot wave."" The video originated on TikTok but was shared via Facebook, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Government scientists say the claims in the video exaggerate the threat to the U.S., and we found no evidence to back the claim that the Biden administration is withholding necessary warnings. The eruption on La Palma is not evidence that the volcano might collapse. Eruptions of Canary Island volcanoes are not uncommon, and the La Palma volcano also erupted in 1949 and 1971. Even if the volcano collapsed, the resulting waves along the eastern coast of the United States would likely be 3 to 7 feet high, similar to a common storm surge, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, part of the Department of the Interior. And those waves would occur only if the collapse happened all at once and very quickly, which scientists say is unlikely. Collapses typically occur in ""incremental or piecemeal fashion,"" according to the USGS. In general, volcanic collapses on the Canary Islands are rare, ""occurring on timescales of hundreds of thousands of years,"" the USGS said. The Canary Islands are governed by Spain and located off the coast of northwest Africa. The volcano on La Palma island began erupting on Sept. 19 and has continued since, with some brief pauses. The idea of a ""mega tsunami"" originating in the Canary Islands and encompassing an entire ocean dates to a 2001 academic paper that suggested if La Palma collapsed, the east coasts of North and South America could experience tsunami waves up to 80 feet high. But USGS scientists say the hypothesis ""doesn’t carry water."" Technology for modeling tsunamis is much more advanced now than in 2001. The newer technology was used to more accurately estimate the maximum wave height  — 3 to 7 feet — that would be expected in a worst-case scenario. The National Tsunami Warning Center also weighed in on Sept. 19 to say, ""There is NO tsunami danger for the U.S. East Coast at this time, following the eruption of Cumbre Vieja volcano, La Palma, Canary Islands. The National Tsunami Warning Center is monitoring this situation, and based on all available data, including nearby water level observations, there is no tsunami hazard for the U.S. East Coast."" The warning center said tsunami alerts are disseminated through National Weather Service and broadcast through official emergency alert channels. The claim that the Biden administration would withhold any warning is unsupported. A video shared on Facebook shows an unidentified man warning of a major tsunami threat resulting from the La Palma volcano eruption, with a 160-foot wave and no warnings. The National Tsunami Warning Center said that it’s monitoring the volcano and that there is no tsunami hazard for the U.S. East Coast from the La Palma volcano. Volcano collapses are rare and unlikely to happen all at once. If La Palma were to collapse quickly, the eastern coast of the United States would likely experience waves between 3 and 7 feet high, similar to common storm surge. We rate this claim False.

No, drinking water isn’t testing positive for COVID-19 in rapid tests
","A video shows a man unwrapping a rapid COVID-19 test, applying a few drops of tap water and waiting as a portion of the device slowly turns pink. A line forms next to the ""C"" on the test and the portion above it turns a darker shade of pink. There is no narration on the video, but some users on social media have been posting that it shows that tap water is testing positive for COVID-19. In a tweet on Dec. 5, a Canadian doctor wrote, ""Tap water is testing positive for Covid! Rapid antigen tests should be recalled immediately. Asymptomatic testing for any respiratory virus has no proven benefit but leads to lost income, lost jobs or even incarceration of you and your loved ones in ‘voluntary’ isolation sites."" However, Abbott Laboratories, the company that makes the test in the video,  said the rapid test device shown in the video was not designed to be used with liquids. Meanwhile, the doctor who wrote the tweet was recently accused by health authorities in Canada of spreading misinformation about COVID-19. Dr. Patrick Phillips, who wrote the tweet, was called ""incompetent"" in September by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which accused him of spreading misinformation about the pandemic, according to the CBC. The group barred Phillips from providing people exemptions for masks, COVID-19 vaccines and testing, and from prescribing certain drugs like ivermectin, to treat the virus, the CBC reported. The video has been making the rounds on social media since at least June of 2021 and has been debunked by fact checkers at AFP. An Abbott spokesperson said in an email to PolitiFact on Dec. 6 that its device is not meant to be used with water or other liquids. ""The Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is for use with samples collected with a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab inserted into a person’s nostrils,"" the spokesperson said. ""When used as intended, it is a highly accurate test that is helping to detect COVID-19 across the world and can significantly improve efforts to control transmission. Spreading misinformation with deliberate misuse of a medical product during a pandemic is misleading and irresponsible."" Instructions from Abbott show the process for using the test, which is far more complex than dropping tap water on it. Test results are determined after 15 minutes, the instructions show, not the little over two minutes shown in the video. COVID-19 is not transmissible through water, said Dr. Sylvie Briand, the director of the World Health Organization’s Department of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, in a September 2020 interview. The CDC said on its website that ""the virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19."" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agrees, saying on its website that it ""recommends that Americans continue to use and drink tap water as usual.""  Similar claims that Coca-Cola tested positive COVID-19 in Austria have been debunked by numerous fact-checkers, including PolitiFact. A tweet said that Abbott’s rapid COVID-19 test showed tap water testing positive for the virus. The Abbott test, however, was not used correctly, as it was not meant to be used with liquids. Meanwhile, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been detected in drinking water. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/dec/06/tweets/no-drinking-water-isnt-testing-positive-covid-19/

Pritzker says Illinois’ unemployment rate dropped more than other big states
","Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker frequently praises Illinois’ economic progress, unlike his predecessor, who often complained the state was falling behind. So it was no surprise when Pritzker devoted part of his 2020 State of the State address to highlighting Illinois’ recent employment gains. ""We’re wresting the public conversation in Illinois back from people concerned with one thing and one thing only: predicting total disaster, spending hundreds of millions of dollars promoting it, and then doing everything in their power to make it happen,"" Pritzker said. ""I’m here to tell the carnival barkers, the doomsayers, the paid professional critics the state of our state is growing stronger each day."" To back that up, Pritzker pointed to Illinois’ record-low unemployment rate and the job growth it saw last year across the state. He also made a broader comparison that caught our attention.  ""Over the past year, Illinois has reduced its unemployment rate more than all of the top 20 most populated states in the nation — and more than our Midwestern peers,"" Pritzker said. We hadn’t heard Illinois had bested all those states in reducing joblessness last year, so we decided to check it out. Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh told us the governor was relying on seasonally adjusted data from December 2018 compared with the same data from December 2019, which are the latest available figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  A BLS economist confirmed it’s appropriate to compare the current December unemployment rate using seasonally adjusted data to that of the same month a year ago, noting that ""over the year"" is commonly used to reference that timeframe. BLS data show Pritzker is correct that Illinois saw a greater drop in its over-the-year unemployment rate than any of the other states he referenced. It saw its rate fall from 4.3% in December 2018 to 3.7% a year later, amounting to a 0.6% reduction.  But it’s worth noting those states saw very similar changes in their unemployment rates. Georgia, the state that saw the second-largest reduction, dropped its rate by 0.5%. In fact, the reductions seen by the top 10 states on the list were all clustered within less than 0.5% of one another.  Economic experts we spoke with also cautioned that unemployment rate declines don’t say much about a state’s overall stability. ""If they really go way up, that’s clearly a problem,"" said Michael Hicks, an economist at Ball State University in Indiana. ""But the unemployment rate could be fairly low and we could still have significant problems. For example, there could be a retreat of men and women from the labor force.""  Hicks also said it takes time for meaningful shifts in the labor force to emerge. ""Saying that you’ve done better than other states is kind of taking out all the context about those states,"" said Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which maintains a database on state economic indicators. ""Some states have high unemployment, some states have low unemployment and they’re just consistently high or consistently low."" Even though Illinois tops the list for reductions over the past year, it still has a higher unemployment rate than 12 of the states Pritzker cited in his comparison.  For instance, Iowa saw an increase in its unemployment rate last year. But at 2.7%, it still has the second-lowest unemployment rate on the list. And although Texas’ rate fell by just 0.2%, it started out at 3.7% last December — the rate Illinois has just now achieved. ""This is one of the types of statistics that is true but ultimately not that illuminating,"" Auxier said. Pritzker said ""over the past year, Illinois has reduced its unemployment rate more than all of the top 20 most populated states in the nation — and more than our Midwestern peers."" Federal data back that up. However, the differences between those states’ reductions are minimal, and Illinois’ unemployment rate remains higher than 12 of the states included in that comparison.

Texas is the second most populous state in the nation and PolitiFact has checked a number of claims about its residents in the past. Most recently, we rated False a claim that a third of Texas has seen a ""20-25% population loss in the last 5 years."" But what about White’s claim that 10% of all children in the United States live in Texas?

Ten percent of U.S. children are Texans. So goes Texas, so goes the world. He included a link to a video showing a public interview he did with Raise Your Hand Texas, a non-profit education advocacy organization, about educational development of teachers in his district. Looking at the data When we asked White, a Republican from Hillister, for the source of his claim, he pointed us to a 2016 report from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, titled ""State of Texas Children."" The report said: ""More than 7 million children live in Texas today, representing nearly 1 in 10 children living in the U.S."" PolitiFact Texas checked a similar statement in 2017: ""One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas."" We rated that claim True, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about annual births. But White’s claim is a bit different, as it focuses on total population, not annual births. For this check, we turned to two sets of data from the Census Bureau measuring population by age and location. There are about 73.4 million people in the United States under the age of 18, according to 2018 population estimates. There are about 7.4 million in Texas — about 10% of the total population of people under 18 in the United States. Texas makes up the second largest share of people under 18 in the U.S., after California, which is home to about 12% of the population under 18 years old. Within Texas, the population under 18 made up about 26% of the state’s population in 2018. In California, minors made up 23% of the state’s population in 2018. Our ruling White said: ""10% of U.S. children are Texans."" White’s claim checks out. There are about 73.4 million minors in the United States and about 10%, or 7.4 million, live in Texas.

Sen. Rick Scott’s Iowa ad misleads about Joe Biden and prosecutor in Ukraine
","Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., isn’t running for anything in 2020, yet he’s paying for a television ad in Iowa that calls the impeachment case against President Donald Trump a ""charade"" while targeting Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. The ad contains the same misleading allegations about Biden that have been supplied by Trump’s most ardent defenders. ""The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with,"" says Scott, looking into a camera.""Vice President Biden threatened a foreign country and forced them to fire a prosecutor who was investigating a company paying his son $83,000 a month. Biden got away with it, and his son got paid."" The facts: Biden did pressure Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, but there is no evidence it was in connection with his son’s role as a board member with the Ukranian gas company Burisma. Biden’s position wanting the prosecutor removed was the same as official U.S. foreign policy, and mimicked the positions by governments and anti-corruption organizations throughout Europe. The prosecutor Scott portrays as a corruption fighter was, in fact, believed to be ineffective and failing to pursue corruption cases. We asked the Scott for Florida campaign for any new evidence but did not get a response. News reports say the first-term senator and former governor has future presidential aspirations. RELATED: Rand Paul’s false equivalence about Trump, Biden on Ukraine RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Does a video show Joe Biden confessing to bribery? No Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy toward Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing the country. Viktor Shokin became top prosecutor in 2015. Many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, viewed Shokin as corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute anybody of significance, and for protecting members of the ruling class. The International Monetary Fund’s managing director warned in early 2016 that ""without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful"" in Ukraine. A frustrated Biden in December 2015 threatened that the United States would withhold $1 billion unless Shokin was fired, in hopes that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Biden, it worked. At a Jan. 23, 2018, event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden recounted his threat to Ukrainian leaders. ""I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,"" Biden recounted. ""If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, told PolitiFact that ""virtually everyone"" he knew in the U.S. government and among experts on Ukraine ""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired.""  Scott’s ad said that Shokin was fired while investigating Burisma. Scott offers no evidence of that to be the case, and news reports cast doubt. Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky placed Hunter Biden on the Burisma board in the spring of 2014. Zlochevsky had faced accusations of financial wrongdoing for some time. In 2014, the British government froze $23 million in his bank accounts in England, though the court later ordered them unfrozen, suspecting him of laundering money that belonged to Ukrainian taxpayers. The American ambassador to Ukraine criticized Shokin’s office and said it never sent the British the records it needed to make its case against Zlochevsky. Worse, the ambassador said, Shokin’s office told Zlochevsky’s lawyers ""that there was no case against him.""  A Ukraine court seized Zlochevsky’s homes and a Rolls Royce. But the National Anti-Corruption Bureau in Ukraine ultimately closed the criminal proceedings related to Zlochevsky, according to AnTAC, the Anti-Corruption Action Center. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, tweeted in May 2019 that Shokin’s firing was not about protectin Hunter Biden’s company.  The firing ""was obviously not because the prosecutor wanted to investigate Burisma & Zlochevsky,"" she wrote. Shokin claimed in a written statement Sept. 4, 2019 — after Biden was running for president and Trump began targeting Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma — that Shokin’s refusal to formally close the investigations led to his ouster. But Vitaliy Kasko, who served as Shokin’s deputy overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg that, under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma remained dormant. Kasko said the matter was ""shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015,"" and Bloomberg reported that documents backed up his account. Scott said, ""Vice President Biden threatened a foreign country and forced them to fire a prosecutor who was investigating a company paying his son $83,000 a month."" There is no evidence that Biden’s call for Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general was because of his son’s position with Burisma and an investigation. Western leaders wanted the prosecutor, Shokin, ousted because they considered him ineffective and corrupt, not because he was pursuing sensitive investigations into a company associated with Biden’s son.  We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2020/jan/30/rick-scott/sen-rick-scotts-iowa-ad-misleads-about-joe-biden-a/

A few weeks before she launched her U.S. Senate campaign in 2019, her state campaign accepted a $250 check from the CSX Corporation Good Government Fund. CSX is a railroad company. In 2018, she accepted donations from PACs for AT&T, CVS Health, Charter Communications, Duke Energy, Merck (a pharmaceutical company), the NC Homebuilders Association and the NC Realtors PAC, just to name a few. In fact, the News & Observer reported that Smith accepted $13,000 from corporate PACs between her 2016 election and her US Senate launch in 2019.  Smith told the N&O that a $3,000 donation from Duke Energy was tied to her position as chair of North Carolina’s Legislative Black Caucus.  When we asked Smith to explain her other PAC donations, she acknowledged that her Twitter account was wrong about her fundraising history. ""My campaign’s social media account is managed by staff who overstated the date of my pledge, and for that I take full responsibility that the wrong information was provided in a Twitter response,"" Smith said in an email to PolitiFact.  ""I have taken small contributions during my time as a state senator but after seeing the pervasive culture of corporate lobbying in the legislature, I made a commitment to running a US Senate campaign that is free of corporate money,"" she added. Smith also noted that her campaign hasn’t taken any corporate PAC money in her US Senate race.  PolitiFact scoured her federal campaign finance records. We also consulted the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations.  ""Based on all the filings we have, she has not taken any PAC money,"" CPR spokesman Brendan Quinn told us in an email. A tweet by Smith suggested she hadn’t accepted any campaign donations from corporate PACs dating back to 2016. As Smith acknowledges, that’s not true.

Are dead people among the names in Wisconsin voter roll purge?
","The debate over whether to purge more than 200,000 names from the Wisconsin voter roll continues to bounce around the Wisconsin court system. An Ozaukee County judge has repeatedly ordered the names be removed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, but the latest order was stayed by an appeals court. With the matter in limbo, two members of the divided Elections Commission took to the airwaves to make their cases. The six-member board is evenly split between Republican and Democratic appointees, leading to a series of deadlocked votes on the next steps. Asked if there was any middle ground, Republican appointee Bob Spindell said the voter roll needs to be updated. ""These are people that are probably alive, but they’ve moved, I’m sure some have died,"" Spindell said in the Jan. 19, 2020, appearance on WISN-TV’s ‘UpFront’ program. ""This could be a very close (2020 presidential) election, and we don’t have any room for having huge numbers of people on the voting rolls that should not be there.""  So, in framing his argument, Spindell is saying the fact dead people may be among the 230,000 is a primary reason to move ahead with the full purge.  Democratic appointee Ann Jacobs, appearing with Spindell, objected immediately, saying the list had already been culled for people who had died.  Let’s sort this out. This controversy dates to October 2019, when the Elections Commission sent mailers to 230,000 people saying it believed they may have moved, asking them to update their voter registration or confirm if they lived at the same address. The commission planned to remove people from the roll in 2021 if the resident took no action. But three voters — represented by Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty — filed a lawsuit arguing the state had to remove the names from the roll faster. Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy agreed and ordered the names be stricken from the voter roll. When the commission twice deadlocked on whether to immediately remove the names — all Republicans for, all Democrats against — Malloy found the Democratic members in contempt and fined them each $250 per day until names are removed. An appeals court then stayed both the fines and the order to remove the names. To be sure, anyone removed from the roll would still be able to vote by re-registering ahead of the election or even at the polls on Election Day. Doing so would require providing proof of residence, however, which critics say creates an unfair burden and would lead to people being unable to vote if they couldn’t provide the documents in time. The Elections Commission maintains a statewide voter registration system, which municipal clerks use to manage their local voter rolls. Clerks enter new voter registrations and are responsible for activating and deactivating local voters. Here’s how it works for people who have died: The county coroner issues a death certificate, which is then sent to the state Department of Health Services. Once a month, DHS sends a file to the state Elections Commission with a list of people who have died, and the commission then alerts municipal clerks to verify the deaths and deactivate the voters, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Elections Commission. (These updates are made more frequently as elections get close.) Clerks can also on their own deactivate voters who have died based on information from family members, obituaries or other reliable sources. Municipal clerks also update voters lists for a variety of other reasons, including when someone has registered to vote in another state, been convicted of a felony, been declared incompetent by a court or moved, Magney said. In October, the commission used various data sources to flag 232,000 people they believed may have moved, which would require them to re-register at their new address before voting again. The names came from a database already culled through the normal process for people known to have died, registered elsewhere, etc. But several months have passed since then. As of the week Spindell made his claim, 21,802 people who received the mailers in October had been deactivated by their municipal clerk, Magney said. That included 934 deactivated due to death. Spindell’s reference on ""UpFront"" didn’t clarify if he was referring to the original mailing list or the current list with some names removed. In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, he said he was referring to dead people who had since been removed through the process Magney described. But his phrasing was in the present tense, saying ""these are people."" And he raised the issue of dead voters during a discussion of what to do with the people who remain at risk of having their names removed from the voter roll — in other words those who are still on the list. Anyone known to have died wouldn’t be on the list anymore, since the normal process is set up to address that situation and it has continued during the legal battle. The only dead people on the list are those who have died since the latest regular update, and their names would be removed through the processes already in place. Spindell said the controversial list of names up for purging from the voter roll includes people who have died. But people who died were removed before the original inactive voters list was created in October, and others who have died since then have been removed as part of the ongoing monthly updates. That doesn’t line up with Spindell’s present-tense claim that names at risk of removal include people who have died. So there’s an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jan/30/robert-spindell/dead-people-among-names-wisconsin-voter-roll-purge/

Warren is right. Presidents have the power to address drug pricing without congressional help
","On the presidential primary campaign trail in Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., brought out a favorite talking point: ways the president can bring down drug prices without waiting for Congress. It’s not the first time Warren and other candidates have referenced this alleged power. In this case, she pointed to insulin, EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs as possible targets. We asked the Warren campaign for the basis of her claim and they directed us to her ""Medicare for All"" transition plan. It identifies two legal mechanisms ― ""compulsory licensing"" as outlined in 28 U.S. Code Section 1498 and the so-called march-in rights provision of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act. We spoke to legal and pharmaceutical policy experts about whether those mechanisms could be used to bring down drug prices, as Warren described. The answer? Yes. But it’s complicated and controversial. The legal mechanisms Of the two legal levers, Section 1498 is perhaps more straightforward.   The law says the government can intervene to take over patents without a company’s permission, if the price is too high. The government can then create competition to bring down prices by importing those products from abroad, or manufacturing them. The original manufacturer can sue for damages but cannot stop Washington from breaking the patent. ""What they would do is announce they are taking other bids from other companies to supply the product"" to government programs such as Medicare, said Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who researches drug pricing laws and has written extensively about Section 1498. The provision has been used before ― in the 1960s to procure cheap generic drugs ― and was invoked as recently as 2001, as a threat to get a better price on Ciprofloxacin, a high-powered antibiotic used to treat anthrax. It also was used in 2014 in non-pharmaceutical contexts, such as by the Defense Department to acquire lead-free bullets. Invoking this part of the U.S. code wouldn’t necessarily apply to all drugs, said Jacob Sherkow, a professor at New York Law School. But products such as the ones Warren mentioned ― insulin and EpiPens, for instance, which are patented in the United States and abroad, and cost far less in other countries ― would qualify. And that could send a message to other drug manufacturers. ""If you’re a particularly aggressive president, you can find some low-hanging fruit, and use 1498 to show other pharmaceutical companies you’re damn serious,"" Sherkow said. There are other caveats. Sherkow noted that licensing a competing drug is only part of the equation; competition often brings down drug prices, but not always. In addition, not all drugs have equivalent patents here and abroad, which complicates importation. But many of the technical obstacles are surmountable, argued Amy Kapczynski, a professor at Yale Law School. The march-in rights authority a little trickier. Bayh-Dole, the law that created march-in rights, suggests the government can ""march in"" when a drug isn’t available amid concerns over public health, such as an epidemic. It applies only to pharmaceuticals for which the government holds all the patents because it funded the research that led to their development. An example could be Truvada for PrEP, the HIV prevention pill, Kesselheim said. Unlike Section 1498, march-in rights have  never been used to negotiate a lower price ― despite multiple petitions to the National Institutes of Health, the federal agency that would approve and oversee the process. The question is whether high prices can constitute both a barrier and a public health concern having rendered  a drug unavailable. Sherkow, for one, expressed skepticism. NIH has historically opted against making this determination. For one, its directors have typically argued that cost isn’t within their area of expertise. And, for another, they have suggested that ""marching in"" would discourage pharmaceutical companies from using government-funded research ― ultimately leading to fewer breakthrough drugs being developed. ""That is a matter of culture, and I think a president could alter that perspective,"" Kesselheim said. Doing so, though, would require political capital. Even though Congress isn’t required to vote on the matter, the president would have to, for instance, appoint officials willing to change the NIH perspective ― and those leaders do require Senate confirmation. ""You’d probably have to defend it in court,"" Kesselheim added. Finally, these mechanisms would also draw sharp pushback from the pharmaceutical industry. Given the fervor over the drug pricing debate, neither Section 1498 nor march-in rights should be used ubiquitously, Kesselheim said. ""It is a complicated enough and politically charged enough procedure, that it’s something that should be reserved as a safety net for real public health emergencies,"" he said. ""I think Sen. Warren is identifying some of those cases."" They’re all talking about it Warren’s proposals are part of a larger pattern ― Democratic presidential candidates including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ― have talked about ways to bring down drug prices without congressional action. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also referenced such action during the January presidential primary debate. ""I have a plan of 137 things I found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal. And one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other parties,"" she said.  According to Klobuchar’s campaign, she was referring to a list she published on Medium in June 2019 in which she wrote that she would use ""existing Food and Drug Administration authority to grant a waiver that allows people to import safe prescription drugs for personal use from countries like Canada to decrease drug costs for seniors and all Americans."" Sherkow said this is indeed another example. Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the HHS secretary to order the importation of specific drugs if it would impose no additional risk to the public’s health and safety and would result in a significant cost reduction. But this example also highlights the complexities involved and why it is not necessarily fast or easy.   He pointed out that the president would have to nominate a candidate for secretary, get that person confirmed, then have the secretary make this order in respect to specific drugs, certify that the drugs are safe and would result in cost reduction ― then have the importation take place.  ""Kudos to anyone for trying that in the first 100 days,"" Sherkow said.   Our ruling Warren said, """"The president of the United States already has the legal authority to reduce the price of many commonly used prescription drugs."" Multiple presidential candidates have talked about ways to bring down drug prices without new legislation. We focused on Warren’s argument: that the president already has this legal authority for many drugs, and that the power stems from Section 1498 and the march-in rights provision of a 1980 law. On these points, she is on firm ground.y Legal experts agreed that laws on the books do, in some cases, give the president that executive power ― and the cases Warren outlined are viable candidates, especially for ""compulsory licensing."" The same experts also pointed out that even with this authority, the politics and logistics could be tricky, and that using these mechanisms wouldn’t address the entire drug pricing issue.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The reference is to Virginia House Bill 1627, which was introduced Jan. 16 by Delegate Jeffrey Bourne, D-Richmond. The bill has been referred to a state House of Delegates committee. A simple reading of the measure shows the attack is way off. Here is the official summary of the bill: ""Threats and harassment of certain officials and property; venue. Provides that certain crimes relating to threats and harassment may be prosecuted in the City of Richmond if the victim is the Governor, Governor-elect, Lieutenant Governor, Lieutenant Governor-elect, Attorney General, or Attorney General-elect, a member or employee of the General Assembly, a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia. In addition, threats to damage property may be prosecuted in the City of Richmond if the property is owned by the Commonwealth and located in the Capitol District."" So, the bill addresses threats and harassment — not mere criticism — of certain state officials.  More specifically, that includes threats, oral or written, ""of death or bodily injury to a person or member of his family,"" which would be a Class 6 felony. And it includes the use of a computer ""with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person"" in order to ""communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act."" A Class 6 felony carries a prison term of one to five years; or, up to one year in jail and/or fine of not more than $2,500. The article claims that language in the bill ""explicitly criminalizes free speech,"" calling it unconstitutional.  But, in fact, that portion of the bill addresses one’s use of a computer to harass or make threats.  Here is the language in the bill cited by the article: ""If any person, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act, he shall be is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor."" A Class 1 misdemeanor is punishable by up to one year in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500.

No evidence that Mike Pompeo has publicly defended Marie Yovanovitch
","An interview between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and NPR’s Mary Louise Kelly ended shortly after she asked him about Ukraine and his treatment of Marie Yovanovitch after her removal as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. ""Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology?"" Kelly asked him. Pompeo said he had ""defended every State Department official."" ""Sir, respectfully, where have you defended Marie Yovanovitch?"" Kelly asked. ""I've defended every single person on this team,"" Pompeo said Jan. 24. ""I've done what's right for every single person on this team."" Kelly asked him to point to remarks where he’d defended Yovanovitch. Pompeo did not do that. Yovanovitch was the point person for American anti-corruption policy in Ukraine and later became the target of smears by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Trump also disparaged her foreign service history. We rated Trump’s inaccurate claims about her as Pants on Fire. RELATED: Who is Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine removed by Trump? We wanted to know if Pompeo had defended Yovanovitch. So we reviewed more than 120 State Department transcripts of interviews Pompeo had with online news agencies, TV, radio, and newspaper reporters since May 2019, the month that Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in Ukraine. We found no record of Pompeo publicly defending Yovanovitch. When asked, he broadly spoke about defending all State Department employees without defending anyone in particular. We found no indication of Pompeo defending her to the press at conferences or while traveling to events. The Twitter accounts for Pompeo, the State Department, and the department’s press secretary also don’t show a defense of Yovanovitch. The State Department did not respond to our queries asking for evidence for Pompeo’s claim. Here are some typical interviews where Pompeo was directly asked about Yovanovitch and his lack of a public defense for the former ambassador. In an extensive back-and-forth, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Pompeo whether he was aware of Giuliani’s push to get rid of Yovanovitch. Pompeo said ""she's a foreign service officer in good standing,"" that ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president, and it’s in everyone’s best interest for ambassadors to leave their post if the president has lost confidence in them. ""I'm not going to get into personnel matters inside the State Department. I’ve not done it and I’m not going to do it for you here this morning,"" Pompeo said. Stephanopoulos said many foreign service professionals believe Pompeo had a duty to speak up for her and protect her in that position. ""George, in good time all of the facts surrounding each of these incidents will become clear. But it's not appropriate for me to comment on all of the things that happen inside of personnel decisions,"" Pompeo said. ""None of our foreign service officers would welcome the Secretary of State talking about why someone stayed, why someone was removed, why someone was transferred. It wouldn’t be appropriate."" Nancy Amons of WSMV in Nashville told Pompeo that career diplomats had publicly expressed frustration over what they saw as Pompeo’s failure to stand up for government employees. ""Did you do enough to defend the ambassador, privately and publicly, against the smear campaign that was being waged against her, and will you speak to that now?"" Amons asked. ""Well, ma’am, you have some of your facts wrong, so you should be careful about things you assert as facts before you state them,"" Pompeo said. He went on to say he was proud of the work done by the State Department. ""I’ve supported every mission that the State Department’s been engaged in and will continue to do that,"" Pompeo replied. Jason Lamb of WTVF in Nashville also interviewed Pompeo that day. Lamb told Pompeo that Democrats in a letter had accused him of remaining silent regarding Yovanovitch. ""The letter says it’s incumbent on you not to further the president’s damaging and unfounded attacks, but to send a simple message to everyone who works at the Department of State: you have their backs,"" Lamb said. ""What is your message to everyone at the Department of State?"" ""I have their backs,"" Pompeo said, without saying anything specific about Yovanovitch. On Nov. 18 at a State Department press briefing, Pompeo was asked why he had not made statements of support for employees testifying in the impeachment inquiry. ""I’m not going to get into the issues surrounding the Democrat impeachment inquiry. I’m just not going to do it today,"" Pompeo said, according to a State Department transcript. A reporter asked again: ""But no defense of your employees?"" ""I always defend State Department employees,"" Pompeo said. ""It’s the greatest diplomatic corps in the history of the world. Very proud of the team."" The New York Times on Jan. 26 reported about an unpublished manuscript for a forthcoming book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton. The New York Times said Bolton in his book wrote that Pompeo acknowledged privately to him that there was no basis to Giuliani’s claims that Yovanovitch was corrupt and that he believed Giuliani may have been acting on behalf of other clients. PolitiFact is unable to verify whether that private conversation took place and we’ve seen no public confirmation from Pompeo about Bolton’s manuscript. When asked if he’s defended former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Pompeo said, ""I've defended every single person on this team."" The public record does not back his claim. We reviewed Pompeo’s media interviews, remarks to the press, and Twitter feed. The most specific thing he said was that Yovanovitch was ""a foreign service officer in good standing,"" which defines her status as an employee. We found no instances of him defending Yovanovitch’s performance or reputation, especially against allegations made by Trump and his allies. The State Department did not provide material to back Pompeo’s claim. We rate Pompeo’s claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jan/29/mike-pompeo/no-evidence-mike-pompeos-claim-hes-defended-ambass/

Two-pronged attack on Democrats over Social Security wrong on both counts
","A lengthy meme that regularly makes the rounds on Facebook attacks Democrats on Social Security.  We’re focusing here on two of the claims in the question-and-answer formatted post, which has been shared more than 450,000 times.  The Democratic Party ""took Social Security from the independent ‘Trust Fund’ and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it,"" the post claims, and ""eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s wrong on both counts. Social Security was signed into law by Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935 to, according to the law’s preamble, ""provide for the general welfare by establishing a system of Federal old-age benefits, and by enabling the several States to make more adequate provision for aged persons, blind persons, dependent and crippled children, maternal and child welfare, public health, and the administration of their unemployment compensation laws."" Now a $1 trillion-a-year program, it helps more than 63 million retirees and the disabled, plus their families, pay the bills.  The federal government faces a major challenge: Social Security’s $2.9 trillion in its combined trust funds, or reserves, will run out by about 2035. The program will continue to pay benefits, but without additional taxpayer dollars, it could only afford to pay between 70% and 80% of the benefits people expect. Social Security is often the object of inaccurate statements that stir fear or anger. We previously rated as False a claim on Facebook that Congress rejected a $336-per-month increase in Social Security and disability benefits but approved an $8,872-per-month pay increase for itself. As for the post we’re checking now, the Social Security Administration includes both parts of the claim in a ""Debunking Some Internet Myths"" section of its website. The first part alleges the Democratic Party ""took Social Security from the independent ‘Trust Fund’ and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it."" The Social Security Administration says: ""There has never been any change in the way the Social Security program is financed or the way that Social Security payroll taxes are used by the federal government. … From its inception, the Trust Fund has always worked the same way. The Social Security Trust Fund has never been ‘put into the general fund of the government.’ ""Most likely this question comes from a confusion between the financing of the Social Security program and the way the Social Security Trust Fund is treated in federal budget accounting. Starting in 1969, the transactions to the Trust Fund were included in what is known as the ‘unified budget.’ This means that every function of the federal government is included in a single budget. ...This budget treatment of the Social Security Trust Fund continued until 1990 when the Trust Funds were again taken ‘off-budget.’ This means only that they are shown as a separate account in the federal budget. But whether the Trust Funds are ‘on-budget’ or ‘off-budget’ is primarily a question of accounting practices — it has no effect on the actual operations of the Trust Fund itself."" While the Social Security trust fund balances weren't affected by the accounting change, ""what economists and other policy analysts were concerned with is whether combining Social Security's surpluses with the on-budget's deficits encouraged policymakers to run larger deficits in the non-Social Security part of the budget,"" said American Enterprise Institute scholar Andrew Biggs, a former deputy commissioner with the Social Security Administration. ""For example, let's imagine that the public demanded that budget deficits be no more than, say, $100 billion per year. If they exceeded that amount, voters would consider Congress to be fiscally irresponsible and punish them at the next election. But if Social Security were running a $100 billion surplus, then Congress could run a $200 billion deficit in the rest of the budget while still reporting only a $100 billion unified budget deficit,"" Biggs told us. ""Most research has concluded that this is pretty much what happened: surpluses in Social Security encouraged Congress to run larger deficits in the rest of the budget, either by taxing less or spending more."" The second part of the claim is that the Democratic Party  ""eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding."" This too is inaccurate. ""There was never any provision of law making the Social Security taxes paid by employees deductible for income tax purposes. In fact, the 1935 law expressly forbid this idea,"" the Social Security administration says.  A frequently circulated Facebook post says the Democratic Party ""took Social Security from the independent ‘Trust Fund’ and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it"" and ""eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding."" Both parts of the claim are so common that the Social Security Administration rebuts them on its website. The Social Security Trust Fund has never been put into the general fund of the government and there was never any tax deduction.

Buttigieg on point that majority of Republicans support background checks
","Pete Buttigieg is running in the Democratic primary for president, but he said a lot of ""future former Republicans"" are coming to hear his ideas.  ""I am proposing things that most Americans even in conservative states think we ought to do,"" including gun control, Buttigieg said Jan. 26 at a Fox News town hall in Des Moines.  ""More than 80% of Republicans think we ought to at least be doing universal background checks,"" the former South Bend, Ind., mayor said. We’ve fact-checked multiple claims about support for expanding background checks among the general public and NRA members. So what about support for universal background checks among Republicans? Many Democrats running for president have called for universal background checks, which would extend such checks to private sales, including at gun shows. The House in 2019 passed a bill to ban the private transfer of firearms without a background check, but it hasn’t been heard in the Senate. RELATED: Do gun background checks work? What the research shows Buttigieg’s campaign pointed to two polls that backed up his point. Both followed the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton in August 2019. While one could argue that such timing could affect the public’s willingness to support stricter measures on guns, we found support was also above 80% before those mass shootings. A Politico/Morning Consult poll in August 2019 found that 90% of Republicans said they would back background checks for all gun sales.  A Washington Post-ABC News poll in September 2019 found that 83% of Republicans support requiring background checks for all potential buyers. We looked at other polls in recent years and found that between 82% and 95% of Republicans stated support for background checks for all buyers. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll in July 2019 found that 84% of Republicans said it was a good idea to require background checks at gun shows and private sales. Gallup found in 2017 that 95% of Republicans supported background checks for all buyers after the Las Vegas shooting. (Gallup didn’t include the statistic specifically for Republicans in their original press release because there wasn’t a significant difference between parties, but a spokeswoman gave us the information.) Quinnipiac polls between 2013 and 2019 showed that between 86% and 92% of Republicans supported background checks for all buyers. Pew Research Center found in a September 2019 poll that 82% of Republicans favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. The National Rifle Association has pointed to the results of background check referendums in Maine and Nevada in 2016 that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls suggest.  In Maine, 52% rejected a background check measure. In Nevada, a background check question just barely passed with about 50.5% of the vote. Leading up to the election, polls showed higher support for the measures.  The gist of the NRA’s argument is that when people are asked a generic question by a pollster, that leads to a different result than when they actually face a question on a ballot that could affect their own rights. Pew Research Center found in 2013 that support for expanded background checks isn’t necessarily the same as support for specific legislation. Pew’s poll found 81% of Republicans supported expanded background checks, but when asked if they supported a U.S. Senate bill that included such legislation, Republican support dropped to 57%. That still suggests strong support, though by a smaller margin. Some respondents expressed concerns that the bill included restrictions beyond background checks or would lead to a ""slippery slope."" ""People may support background checks in general, but become more skeptical when gun rights groups highlight specific complications or unintended consequences that could arise when these laws are implemented,"" said Kristin Goss, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University. Also, it’s possible that some respondents who say they want background checks for all sales may not realize that it is not current federal law -- a point backed up by a 2013 poll done for the Democratic National Committee. Of the 50% of people who said they preferred enforcement over new laws, 48% said they thought federal law prohibits gun purchases privately or at a gun show without a background check. Another 10% disclosed that they didn’t know the rules. ""Most people don’t have a very good grasp of what our gun laws are,"" Goss said. ""To be fair to Americans, gun laws are complicated and vary greatly state by state."" Buttigieg said, ""More than 80% of Republicans think we ought to at least be doing universal background checks.""  Buttigieg cited two polls that showed Republican support for background checks for all sales at 83% and 90%. We found additional polls in the same ballpark.  The support in polls doesn’t necessarily translate to support for specific legislation or ballot measures, and it’s possible that some respondents are unaware of current laws. That said, there are plenty of polls to back up Buttigieg’s statistic. We rate this statement True.  ",/factchecks/2020/jan/29/pete-buttigieg/buttigieg-point-majority-republicans-support-backg/

The FDA has warned mercury teeth fillings could harm some, but this claim goes too far
","Facebook users have been sharing a story that warns the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""finally admits dental fillings are toxic."" This post, which was published on Principia Scientific on Dec. 12, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The story says that, as part of a lawsuit settlement with consumer groups, the FDA was forced to publicly admit that ""all ‘silver’ dental fillings are poisoned with mercury.""  It’s referring to dental amalgam, a filling material dentists use to fill cavities. According to the FDA, its primary component is elemental mercury. Amalgam fillings are also known as ""silver fillings"" because of their silver-like appearance. The agency says such fillings have been used in hundreds of millions of patients around the world for over a century, and are beneficial because they’re strong and less likely to break than those made of other materials. But there are also risks. Amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor that can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.  High levels of mercury vapor exposure can harm the brain and kidneys. The FDA says it reviewed scientific evidence to determine whether low levels of mercury vapor from dental amalgam fillings were cause for concern. Based on the evidence, according to the agency, the FDA considers them safe for adults and children 6 and older.  But fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the ""neurotoxic effects of mercury vapor,"" according to the FDA. It says there is ""very limited to no"" clinical data on the long-term health outcomes for pregnant women, their fetuses and young children, and advises concerned patients to talk to their dentists. The agency also discourages patients from removing their dental amalgams if they’re in good condition and there’s no tooth decay under the filling because, in part, it could expose that person to additional mercury vapor released during the removal process. Though the Principia Scientific story was published in 2018, it uses an FDA statement from 2008 to show that the agency ""was finally forced to admit"" amalgam fillings are toxic. It was then, Reuters reported in June 2008, that the FDA settled a lawsuit with several consumer advocacy groups, including Consumers for Dental Choice and Moms Against Mercury. The group sought to ban mercury fillings from the U.S. market. As part of the settlement, according to Reuters, the FDA agreed to alert consumers about the potential risks on its website and to issue a more specific rule about fillings that contain mercury. In a notice on its website — and this is what the Principia Scientific story quotes — the FDA said that amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses. ""Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury microburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner,"" the FDA said. At the time, a lawyer for Consumers for Dental Choice described the FDA’s statement as a major shift.  ""Gone, gone, gone are all of the FDA’s claims that no science exists that amalgam is unsafe,"" he said. The Associated Press, reporting on the settlement, said that ""silver dental fillings contain mercury, and the government for the first time is warning that they may pose a safety concern for pregnant women and young children."" It described it as a victory for ""anti-mercury activists."" But the report also notes that the warning isn’t aimed at everybody — just two groups of people who are already urged to limit mercury from seafood because too much can harm a developing brain. Our ruling The story we’re fact-checking claims that the FDA finally admitted that ""dental fillings are toxic."" That’s not quite right, and it’s old news — not from 2018, when the story was posted, but 2008, when the FDA settled a lawsuit with consumer groups. It’s true that as part of the settlement the FDA warned that a type of dental filling, amalgams, may have neurotoxic effects on some people — pregnant women, fetuses and young children. But it didn’t declare without caveats that dental fillings are toxic, full stop.  We rate this story Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jan/29/blog-posting/fda-has-warned-mercury-teeth-fillings-could-harm-s/

Schumer accurately says public supports calling witnesses in Senate impeachment trial
","A reporter asked Sen. Charles Schumer how Senate Democrats would convince enough of their Republican colleagues to join them in calling for witnesses to testify at the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. The New York Democrat replied, ""the American people are overwhelmingly with us.""  Schumer said during a Capitol Hill news conference that ""four Republican senators can step forward and say that we need witnesses and documents, and there are 12 or 13 who have never said a bad word about witnesses and documents."" The Senate has already rejected calls for more documents and witness testimony, but the question of whether the Senate will call witnesses, such as John Bolton, the former national security adviser, continues to loom over the trial. We wondered if Schumer is correct.  Several polls have been conducted on this topic, with varying levels of support, though all polls showed a solid majority of public support for calling witnesses to testify in the Senate trial.  Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a poll released on Jan. 21, found 57 percent of survey respondents support the ability of House impeachment managers to introduce new evidence in the Senate trial. ""Public opinion on allowing new evidence and compelling witness testimony in the Senate trial breaks sharply along partisan lines,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, based in New Jersey. ""But it is interesting that solid majorities in every partisan group would like to see Trump and members of his administration at least asked to appear."" A Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted Jan. 17-19 found that 57 percent of respondents said the Senate should call additional witnesses. Support was lowest among Republicans, with 37 percent, while 53 percent of independents and 77 percent of Democrats think new witnesses should be called.    On Jan. 20, CNN released a poll that found that 69 percent of Americans think that new testimony should be taken from new witnesses who did not testify in the House inquiry, including 48 percent of Republicans.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Jan. 17-22 showed even more support for calling witnesses to testify in the Senate trial. About 72 percent of people surveyed agreed that the trial ""should allow witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the impeachment charges to testify,"" including 84 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of Republicans. A poll released Jan. 22 by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 68 percent of respondents said that Trump should allow his top aides to testify.  Not included in this analysis is an ABC News/Washington Post poll, because it was released a few hours after Schumer made his statement. In that poll, 66 percent of those surveyed were in favor of calling witnesses, including 45 percent of Republicans, 65 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats.   Schumer said ""the American people are overwhelmingly with us"" in calling for witnesses to testify in the Senate impeachment trial.  Not everyone may agree on what constitutes ""overwhelming"" support. But poll after poll shows that the majority of Americans - in some cases as high as 69 percent and 72 percent - support calling witnesses during the Senate impeachment trial.   We rate Schumer’s claim True. ",/factchecks/2020/jan/28/charles-schumer/schumer-accurately-says-public-supports-calling-wi/

No, Barack Obama’s lawyers didn’t admit his birth certificate is fake
","A 2012 story about former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate is, somehow, getting new traction as Facebook users share it. But we reluctantly welcome it to our archive of mistruths about the 44th president’s citizenship.  The story, posted on Occupycorporatism.com, has this headline: ""Obama’s lawyers officially admit birth certificate is fake."" It goes on to say that ""lawyers for the Obama Administration announced that Barack Obama’s long form birth certificate was a forgery"" and ""Alexandra M. Hill, representative defense attorney for Obama, made comments that brought the Tea Party members to question the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This inaccurate story seems to stem from coverage of a 2012 lawsuit filed by two New Jersey residents challenging Obama’s eligibility to appear on the state’s presidential primary ballot. Plaintiff’s attorney Mario Apuzzo got to the heart of the complaint during an April 2012 court hearing:. """"What evidence does New Jersey have that this person who is running for president is who he is?"" Apuzzo said, according to an April 10, 2012, story in the Home News Tribune, a daily paper serving Middlesex County. .  Presiding at the hearing, Judge Jeff Masin indicated how he would rule in the case, according to the Tribune, by saying that past court rulings determined that children who are born in the United States but have parents who are not from the United States are considered natural-born citizens. Masin said he would consider whether Hawaii-born Obama, whose father was not from the United States, needed to do more to prove to the state’s elections division that he qualifies to run for president. But he forwarned he would not be considering the authenticity of the birth certificate the president posted online as he made his decision. The Obama campaign sent a lawyer, Alexandra Hill, to that hearing.  Describing Hill’s statements during that hearing, conservative columnist Diana West wrote later that month that Hill ""couldn’t have been more adamant about not citing the online birth certificate as a means of proving the president’s identity in this recent challenge."" ""Indeed, she called the Internet image ‘legally irrelevant,’"" West wrote, ""arguing that New Jersey law doesn’t specifically call for a birth certificate to quality a presidential candidate for the ballot."" But we couldn’t find any evidence that Hill admitted Obama’s birth certificate was fake, as the story we’re fact-checking claims. And this is already well-trodden territory. Back in 2012, Snopes debunked the allegation that Obama lawyers said his birth certificate was a forgery. Because — one more time now! — it’s not. Obama is not a Muslim from Kenya. According to the president and independent biographies, he’s a Christian who was born in Honolulu. And we’ve carefully documented his Hawaii birth certificate.
