Ernst says gas prices are rising under Biden; they were going up under Trump, too
","Americans have shared plenty of complaints about gas price increases and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst is among them. Ernst, R-Iowa, opened a March 19 newsletter email blast claiming gas prices have continued to rise since President Joe Biden’s first day in office back in January 2021: ""President Biden wants Iowans and Americans to believe that skyrocketing prices at the pump are all Vladimir Putin’s fault — but gas prices have been going up since the president’s first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline."" U.S. gas prices have risen under Biden, data shows, but Ernst’s claim suggests that Biden’s policies and his action on Keystone were a driving factor. Yet, gas prices already were on the rise before he took office, due, energy analysts say, to a change in demand following the easing of pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile,  the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of war in Ukraine.  PolitiFact reported in December that there is no evidence that Biden’s canceling of the Keystone XL oil pipeline caused an increase in U.S. gas prices.  The Pew Research Center found in spring 2020 that the COVID-19 pandemic dropped the average retail gas price by 27% from late February to late April. Gasoline demand was down considerably during many stages of the pandemic. As people returned to more normal daily activities demand — and prices —went up. In an email to PolitiFact Iowa, Ernst spokesperson Brendan Conley wrote that regular gas was priced at $2.36 per gallon during Biden’s first day in office. During the fourth week of March 2022, the prices were $4.24, Conley wrote.  Conley wrote that Ernst used U.S. Energy Information Administration data to back her claim. ""As the senator was pointing out in the newsletter, the increase in gas prices was happening well before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" he wrote. That’s accurate as far as it goes, but it ignores that the data from the Energy Information Administration shows an increasing trend since April 2020, when gas prices dipped to a low of $1.77 per gallon. That was nine months before Biden took office. West Texas Intermediate grade crude oil reflects a similar trend, with prices increasing from $16.94 per barrel on April 19, 2020, to $110.94 on March 20, 2022. These costs are paid before the oil is refined into gasoline.  While the cost has dipped slightly at certain times — including in November 2020 and August and November 2021 — the overall trends have been up. In the past year, the low price per crude oil barrel has been $57.63. The high reached $130.50.  AAA found that March 11 was the highest recorded average retail price for gas in the U.S., at $4.33 per gallon of regular unleaded fuel. Diesel reached $5.14 at its peak on March 12. Iowa’s average cost per gallon was $3.88 on March 24, according to AAA. The state had the seventh lowest average gasoline cost then, the association said. On July 14, 2008, gas reached its most recent peak prior to 2022 at $4.11, Energy Information Administration data show.  PolitiFact previously reported a broad expert consensus that gas prices are not high as a result of  of any U.S. shutdown of oil production under the Biden administration. Oil production is on par with production levels during former President Donald Trump’s term.  PolitiFact also has reported that claiming the most recent, and most severe,spike in gas prices is largely due to Putin and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  Ernst said that ""gas prices have been going up since the president’s first day in office, starting with his move to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline."" She has a point that gas prices, as well as crude oil prices, have been on an upward trajectory for essentially all of Biden’s tenure. However, she ignores that prices started to rise when Trump was president, which experts say stemmed from increased demand for fuel after COVID restrictions eased. Gas prices did not simply turn upward on a dime after Biden took office or after he canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. We rate the statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D03740>],/factchecks/2022/mar/30/joni-ernst/ernst-says-gas-prices-are-rising-under-biden-they-/

The Space Foundation didn’t revoke honors from Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
","In 1961, Soviet Union pilot and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made history when he became the first person in the world to travel to space. Now, Gagarin’s name has been thrust back in the spotlight as social media posts claim that he was ""stripped"" of his honors due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. ""The Space Foundation has stripped honours from Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to ever be in space,"" read the caption of a Facebook post shared by the Post Millennial, a conservative Canadian online magazine. The post features an article that talks about how Gagarin’s name was removed from a fundraiser event hosted by the foundation.  ""The Space Foundation has erased the honors previously bestowed on Yuri Gagarin, the first man to ever be in space. His name was stripped ‘in light of current events.’ The Foundation’s annual ‘Yuri’s Night’ was replaced with ‘A Celebration of Space: What’s Next?’"" another Facebook post said.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The Space Foundation, a nonprofit space advocacy organization based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, did remove Gagarin’s name from the annual event amid the war in Ukraine.  The organization did not, however, rescind any honors or awards from Gagarin, and he will still be mentioned in the event’s programming. The fundraiser, slated to take place on April 3 to kick off the 37th Annual Space Symposium, was originally named ""Yuri’s Night"" but was changed to ""A Celebration of Space: Discover What's Next"" in early March 2022.  The organization said it decided to change the event’s name ""in light of current events,"" according to an archived version of the symposium’s agenda.  Rich Cooper, a spokesperson for the foundation, told PolitiFact that Gagarin will still be honored at the event and that the foundation hasn’t revoked any formal honors from the cosmonaut.  ""This has been a disinformation campaign as (the) Space Foundation has not stripped Yuri Gagarin of any honors,"" Cooper wrote in an email. ""Yuri Gagarin will still be recognized and celebrated at our April 3 program … alongside a number of other notable space achievements and current happenings."" The organization deleted the agenda note and released a full statement about the change on March 19, saying that it started to receive negative social media comments about Russia shortly after it began posting notices about the event in late February, then still called ""Yuri’s Night."" ""Wanting to ensure the focus of the evening remained on our goals — the kickoff of the 10th anniversary of Space Foundation Discovery Center and raising funds for our education programs — we made the decision to change the name to ‘A Celebration of Space: Discover What’s Next’,"" the statement said, adding that the event will highlight Yuri’s flight, the anniversary of the Space Shuttle, and other space milestones. The derogatory online comments prompted the organization to pause its advertising for the program and discuss how to address the situation. ""Not wanting to have any of our social media pages be a platform for hate or anger, and to keep the focus on our event and its goals, we made the decision to change the name,"" Cooper said.  The foundation also hasn’t altered any exhibits related to Gagarin, including a bust of the cosmonaut displayed in its gallery. A Facebook post claims, ""the Space Foundation has erased the honors previously bestowed on Yuri Gagarin, the first man to ever be in space.

Budd exaggerates role of McCrory appointee in NC redistricting case
","Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory may be Republican, but he indirectly helped Democrats in a recent North Carolina redistricting case, according to one of his political opponents. McCrory is one of several Republicans hoping to replace Republican Sen. Richard Burr when he retires at the end of his term this year. McCrory tweeted on March 21 that, if elected to the Senate, he would reject any ""radical activist"" judicial nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. His comments came the same day   U.S. senators began confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson..  McCrory’s tweet evoked a response from one of his Republican challengers, U.S. Rep. Ted Budd. ""He’s hoping NC Republicans will forget that when he was Governor, [McCrory] appointed the ‘Republican’ judge who sided with Democrats in the partisan Democrat lawsuit/power-grab over redistricting,"" Budd tweeted. The tweet refers to the legal drama over North Carolina’s voting lines. State legislators drew new congressional and legislative districts last year, as required by law. Voting rights groups then sued legislative leaders, claiming they gerrymandered the maps to give the Republican Party an unconstitutional advantage. State courts ultimately approved maps with more districts that were more favorable to the Democratic Party than previous iterations of the maps.  So is it true that McCrory appointed a Republican who sided with liberal plaintiffs in the case?  It’s true that McCrory appointed one of the Republican judges involved in the case. However, Budd’s tweet omits a lot of context and could mislead readers who are not well versed in the court system’s structure. And while the McCrory-appointed judge played a role in the maps that were ultimately enacted, he was not part of the state Supreme Court contingent that struck down the maps that were initially challenged. Let’s review the major decisions that happened as the redistricting case worked its way through the courts. Superior Court: A three-judge panel of two Republicans and a Democrat decided in favor of Republican legislators, ruling on Jan. 11 that they hadn’t violated state law by drawing election districts that offered their party a partisan advantage.  The panel included two Republicans, including A. Graham Shirley, who was appointed by McCrory in 2015. Judges in North Carolina are typically elected, but seats can be filled if a vacancy arises. McCrory appointed Shirley to fill the vacancy left by retiring Judge Howard Manning Jr., according to The News & Observer.  The panel’s ruling was appealed. North Carolina Supreme Court: The Democratic-majority high court ruled 4-3 on Feb. 4 to overturn the lower-court’s decision, ordering Republican legislators to redraw new districts because, in the majority’s view, they violated state law during last year’s mapmaking process. No Republicans voted in the majority. The ruling placed the three Superior Court judges in charge of reviewing the new map proposals.  New voting maps enacted: This is where Budd’s claim comes in. After Republican legislators redrew both the legislative and congressional maps, the Superior Court panel accepted the revised legislative districts but rejected the Republicans’ proposed congressional map.  Instead, the lower court judges recommended congressional maps drawn by independent redistricting experts. The state Supreme Court signed-off on both plans.  Budd’s tweet describes Shirley’s involvement in a way that could give readers the wrong impression about his level of influence in the case. The tweet says McCrory appointed ""the"" Republican judge who sided with Democrats.  The Superior Court’s decision to use the consultants’ congressional map, instead of the Republican proposal, was unanimous — and Shirley wasn’t the only Republican on the panel. Judge Nathaniel Poovey is also a Republican.  Budd’s campaign stood by Budd’s tweet.  ""This unanimous decision handed over two, or possibly more, congressional seats to Democrats,"" Budd spokesman Jonathan Felts said. ""Governor McCrory is making a big production of what he says he would do if elected to the U.S. Senate as it relates to judges, so let’s see … how those McCrory appointments are working out for conservatives in North Carolina."" After McCrory appointed Shirley in 2015, Shirley the next year ran unopposed to retain the seat and was elected. U.S. Supreme Court: Republican legislators have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to get involved in the state’s redistricting case. The high court, which has a conservative majority, already voted 6-3 to reject Republican legislators’ request to halt the congressional maps drawn by consultants. Republican legislators are now petitioning the court to review the state Supreme Court’s actions to see if it violated the U.S. Constitution. Budd said McCrory appointed ""the Republican judge who sided with Democrats in the partisan Democrat lawsuit/power-grab over redistricting."" Budd accurately points out that McCrory appointed one of the Superior Court judges involved in a recent redistricting case, and that the judge signed off on congressional districts that are expected to elect more Democrats than previous maps would have.
However, Budd’s tweet excludes so many key details that it could give readers an inaccurate impression about the case and McCrory’s appointee. When the redistricting case came before the Superior Court panel that included Shirley, he ruled with his colleagues that the process that led to the GOP-drawn maps didn’t violate the state constitution. In other words, he ruled in favor of Republican legislators. After the state’s highest court ordered legislators to redraw election maps—and for the Superior Court panel to rule on those maps—Shirley rejected one of the Republicans’ redrawn maps. But he wasn’t the only Republican judge to do so—and he didn’t cast a deciding vote. Finally, Budd’s tweet omits the fact that Shirley is currently serving at the will of North Carolina voters. He won an election in 2016, after McCrory appointed him. Budd’s tweet has an element of truth. But it leaves out a lot of context and could give people the wrong impression about how the case played out. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4128C0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/29/ted-budd/budd-exaggerates-role-mccrory-appointee-nc-redistr/

Has New York state lost 99% of its historical range of wetlands?
","New York state Sen. Sean M. Ryan, who represents a district that runs north and south of Buffalo, recently wrote an op-ed that urged increasing conservation protections for wetlands.  ""New York's wetlands are important to nearly every living being in our state,"" Ryan wrote in the op-ed, which originally appeared on March 3 on the website of the conservation group Ducks Unlimited. ""They provide critical habitat for species like ducks, deer, and turkeys – and you may already know that they are home to nearly half of the threatened and endangered species in the state."" Ryan added that other benefits of wetlands range ""from absorbing flooding and storm surge, to filtering water of pollutants and acting as one of the most effective carbon sinks,"" which helps mitigate climate change. In the op-ed, Ryan outlined the scope of wetland losses in recent decades.  ""Despite all of these benefits, our wetlands are constantly under threat,"" Ryan wrote in the op-ed. ""New York state has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands."" The 99% figure seemed high, so we checked with Ryan’s office. Cody Meyers, Ryan’s chief of staff, acknowledged to PolitiFact New York that the figure was mistaken. Meyers said the 99% figure referred to the percentage of wetland habitat losses since 1600 in New York City, rather than New York state. After we contacted Ryan’s office about the percentage, they changed the figure in the op-ed to 60%, where it remains. But what about the 60% figure? Is it accurate? The figure stems from a 1991 report titled, ""Wetlands: Status and Trends in the Coterminous United States, Mid-1970s to Mid-1980s."" The report was co-authored by two specialists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency. The report determined that New York state had lost 60% of its wetlands by the end of the 1980s. It was one of 22 states that had lost at least half of their wetlands by then, the report said. The 60% figure also appears in another federal report from 1990, ""Wetlands: Losses in the United States, 1780s to 1980s."" However, these reports are more than 30 years old. In fact, in his op-ed, Ryan acknowledges the difficulty of using old data: He writes that one of the shortcomings with current state wetlands law is that it only protects wetlands ""12.4 acres and larger that appear on a set of jurisdictional maps. These maps were created in the 1970s and 1980s with outdated technology, leading to nearly 1 million acres of wetlands lacking any state-level protection."" So we checked with independent experts to see if any more recent data existed. Tom Langen, a professor of biology at Clarkson University, told PolitiFact New York that he wasn’t aware of any comprehensive studies in the last two decades.  One study published in 2000, ""Wetlands Status and Trend Analysis of New York State Mid-1980’s to Mid-1990’s,"" found a net gain of 17,619 acres of wetlands from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s in five geographic zones in New York state. The gains were largely due to farmland abandonment, beaver proliferation, and restoration efforts.  However, these increases accounted for less than 1% of the state’s existing wetlands acreage, They also didn’t encompass the entire state, making it hard to draw broader conclusions. Overall, Langen said, he’s doubtful that there’s been a substantial change from the 60% figure.  Nicholas A. Robinson, an emeritus professor of law at Pace University who specializes in environmental law, agreed that it’s unlikely that there’s been a significant change in wetland cover since the studies in the early 1990s, and that 60% is likely still a safe figure to use.  The scale of historical losses is so significant, Robinson said, that ""measures are needed to curb that rate of loss."" Ryan said, ""New York State has already lost 99% of its historic freshwater wetlands.""  New York state has not lost 99% of its wetlands. Ryan’s office acknowledged that they had mistakenly used the figure for New York City, and they changed the figure to 60% after we inquired. The 60% figure dates back to federal studies published in the early 1990s. That means their data is more than 30 years old. However, the limited studies that have been conducted since then have found only modest changes in wetland cover, and several experts said they do not expect that the percentage of wetland loss has changed dramatically during the past three decades. We rate the original 99% figure Mostly False. CLARIFICATION, March 30, 2022: The version of the op-ed that was published in Ducks Unlimited always included the 60% figure. Only the version published on Ryan’s Senate site initially used the 99% figure, according to his office. Our rating remains unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACF800>],/factchecks/2022/mar/29/sean-ryan/has-new-york-state-lost-99-its-historical-range-we/

Georgia’s David Perdue said elections were stolen from him and Trump. Pants on Fire!
","Days after Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., lost his race against Jon Ossoff in January 2021, he conceded. But now as the Trump-backed candidate in the governor’s race, Perdue has a different account of what happened in his own race. ""Most people in Georgia know that something untoward happened in November 2020,"" David Perdue told conservative radio host Brian Pritchard March 25. ""I’ll just say it, Brian. In my election and the president’s election, they were stolen. The evidence is compelling now."" What was his ""compelling"" evidence? Perdue suggested that a judge found merit in a case filed by plaintiffs seeking to inspect ballots in Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold. But the case, filed after the presidential election, was ultimately dismissed by the judge.  In his primary battle against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, Perdue is running on a campaign of echoing Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election. The Republican winner will face off May 24 and the winner will face Democrat Stacey Abrams.  Perdue said the evidence is ""compelling"" of stolen elections. It isn’t. It would involve an improbable massive felonious conspiracy for multiple election officials to break the law and steal an election on behalf of a candidate. The argument also fails to explain how a scheme to elect Biden and Ossoff would allow Republicans to win House seats, including Andrew Clyde and Marjorie Taylor Greene.  We contacted a spokesperson for the Perdue campaign to ask for his evidence that the presidential and Senate runoffs were stolen and did not get a response.  The presidential election in Georgia, where Biden won by about 12,000 votes, was not stolen. Democrats had been making inroads in recent years in Georgia, a state with an increasingly diverse electorate. Trump, who had to defend his record amid a pandemic, lost. Courts rejected lawsuits filed on Trump’s behalf, including the U.S. Supreme Court which declined to review a case that alleged Georgia and other states exploited the pandemic to make election procedure changes.  The presidential election was counted three times by Georgia, and the results each time showed that Biden won. Republican statewide election officials said that they found no evidence of systematic voter fraud. State officials certified the results on Nov. 20, 2020. When the state’s top elections official, Brad Raffensperger, certified the results, he said that ""numbers don’t lie."" ""As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct. The numbers reflect the verdict of the people, not a decision by the secretary of state's office or of courts or of either campaign."" Evidence of fraud in Georgia is so isolated that it would not have changed the outcome of the election. The AP found that officials in 24 Georgia counties identified 64 potential voter fraud cases, representing 0.54% of Biden’s margin of victory. Of those, about half were determined to be an administrative error or mistake. The AP found similarly small numbers of potential fraud cases in other battleground states.  The state elections board in Georgia referred 35 cases to prosecutors in February 2021, including four to the attorney general. Of those four, three were settled administratively and one remains pending.  Some allegations remain under investigation. In Georgia, it is illegal to collect and submit multiple mail ballots. True the Vote, a conservative group, has alleged ballot harvesting. Last year, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said there wasn’t enough evidence to proceed on the allegation, but the group has since said it has a witness.  It has yet to reveal who that is.The State Election Board voted March 16 to issue subpoenas to the group, to obtain the name of their witness.  In the Jan. 5, 2021, Senate runoff race, Democrat Jon Ossoff won about 50.6% of the vote while Perdue won 49.4%. (Democrat Raphael Warnock also beat Republican Kelly Loeffler.) Perdue conceded three days later. ""I want to congratulate the Democratic Party and my opponent for this runoff win,"" he said.  The runoff was not within the 0.5% threshold to merit a statewide recount. On Jan. 19, 2021, Raffensperger certified the results, affirming that the returns ""are a true and correct tabulation of the certified returns received by this office from each county."" Kemp also had to sign off on the certification. Analyses by reporters at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and by Georgia Public Radio found that Ossoff beat Perdue with strong turnout among Black voters. Ossoff ran TV ads showing how the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately hurt Black Americans and showing his support for racial justice protests.  The only evidence Perdue cited during the radio interview pertained to a court case filed after the presidential election. The lawsuit does not prove that the election was stolen. Garland Favorito, a longtime critic of Georgia’s election infrastructure, filed a motion in December 2020 claiming fraudulent mail ballots had been counted in Fulton County. Favorito sought to inspect the ballots.  Henry County Superior Court Judge Brian Amero issued an order May 21 to unseal the ballots but he later dismissed the case saying that the voters who filed the case lacked standing.  State officials investigated the lawsuit’s allegations of counterfeit ballots and found they lacked evidence. That’s not to say the elections in Fulton County were smooth. A consultant in 2021 found that Fulton County elections had ""myriad problems"" with the processing of absentee ballots, such as failing to sufficiently protect rejected ballots in the mail room. But the consultant found no ""dishonesty, fraud, or intentional malfeasance."" Perdue filed a case in December similar to the dismissed lawsuit seeking to inspect the ballots. The case remains pending.  Republicans seeking inspections of ballots in Democratic or battleground jurisdictions has become part of the strategy of Trump allies who make allegations of voter fraud. While such quests for ballot reviews have not changed any outcomes, they have added fuel to the efforts by state Republican lawmakers to pass new restrictive voting laws.  Perdue says his 2021 Georgia Senate runoff and the 2020 presidential election ""were stolen."" Perdue lacks evidence that either contest was stolen. He is mimicking the evidence-free claims by Trump and his allies about the presidential election, and now extending them to his own loss even though he conceded last year.  Courts have rejected lawsuits alleging election wrongdoing and state election officials in Georgia — Republicans — said the presidential election was secure. State officials for both contests certified the results which showed that Biden beat Trump and that Perdue lost to Ossoff. The elections of 2020 and January 2021 in Georgia are over, and they were not stolen — they were won by Democrats.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Barrett was one of three judges ruling on a Wisconsin county’s financial liability
","Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record on the sentencing of sex offenders became the target of Republican criticism during her U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings late March. In light of that, a Facebook post said Republicans should be reminded of an old ruling by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2020 during the Trump administration. ""Don’t EVER let Republicans who are attacking Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson forget this…,"" began a March 24 Facebook post. ""Amy Coney Barrett overturned a $6.7M verdict after a prison guard repeatedly raped a 19-year-old inmate who was 8 months pregnant. 4 days after she gave birth, the guard demanded oral sex. Amy Coney Barrett reversed the lower court’s decision to award the victim money."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post refers to a 2018 ruling by the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Coney Barrett served on that court at the time, before becoming a Supreme Court justice. But the post leaves out some key context. Barrett, who was one of a three-judge panel, was not ruling on the $6.7 million jury award itself, but rather whether a Wisconsin county was liable to pay the damages. The award itself was not overturned, as the Facebook post implies, but the panel’s decision likely means the plaintiff will never see the money. Xavier Thicklen, a prison guard at the Milwaukee County Jail, was charged in 2014 with five counts of second degree sexual assault of a pregnant 19-year-old inmate. He denied those allegations and eventually pleaded guilty in 2014 to a lesser charge of misconduct in office, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The woman who accused Thicklen won a civil lawsuit against the guard and Milwaukee County in the matter and in 2017 was awarded $6.7 million in damages, to be paid by the county under Wisconsin’s indemnification law, according to various news reports.  Milwaukee County appealed the verdict and the case was heard by Barrett’s court in Chicago. The three-judge panel unanimously ruled that the county was not liable for the damages. Under Wisconsin’s indemnification law, local governments are required to cover damages incurred while employees are acting within the scope of their jobs. But the court found the guard’s alleged actions were outside of his job duties and contrary to his training by the jail, so the law didn’t apply.  The judgment against Thicklen, who was not party to the appeal, still stands, though the court seemed to acknowledge the plaintiff would likely not collect the award. ""We have sympathy,"" for the plaintiff, the judges wrote, ""who loses perhaps her best chance to collect the judgment."" But Wisconsin law ""does not make public employers absolute insurers against all wrongs,"" the decision said. In a similar case before the appeals court in 2020, Barrett sided with the majority, finding that a different Wisconsin county, Polk, was responsible for damages because the jail didn’t properly supervise or train a guard convicted of rape. A Facebook post claims that Barrett, while serving on an appeals court, reversed a decision to award $6.7 million in damages to a pregnant inmate raped by a jail guard in Wisconsin.

Recount of Biden’s resistance to Vietnam War efforts lacks context
","Last summer, when President Joe Biden evacuated the remaining U.S. troops out of Afghanistan — ending the longest war in the country’s history — many felt it paralleled President Gerald Ford’s exit from Vietnam. More recently, Biden’s stance on the Vietnam War when he was a senator has been circulating on social media. A March 8 Facebook post claimed that in 1975, then-U.S. Sen. Biden opposed efforts by President Ford to aid South Vietnam and evacuate refugees. ""President Ford went to Congress for a relief package to allow American personnel and our allies to evacuate. However, there was ONE US SENATOR who opposed any such support,"" the post claimed. ""THAT SENATOR WAS JOE BIDEN."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post cites the source for this claim as the 2018 book, ""When the Center Held: Gerald Ford and the Rescue of the American Presidency,"" written by Donald Rumsfeld, who served as Ford’s secretary of defense. In a chapter about the Vietnam War, Rumsfeld mentioned a meeting Ford had in April 1975 with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including Biden, about extending aid to South Vietnam. ""Repeatedly, a number of Senate Democrats dissented, including the young outspoken Senator Joe Biden (D-DE). In the heat of the discussion, I detected a difference in the attitudes of some members of Congress toward the Vietnamese,"" Rumsfeld wrote in the book. However, Rumsfeld himself was not present at this meeting, according to a meeting transcript that does not name him among the participants. He did not become Ford’s defense secretary until November 1975. His second-hand recollection of the meeting also does not completely capture Biden’s stance on Ford’s efforts in Vietnam. During the meeting, Ford, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and the group of senators discussed emergency funding to evacuate U.S. citizens and Vietnamese refugees and provide military aid to South Vietnam. Biden pushed back against tying funding for military aid and the continued deployment of U.S. troops with evacuating U.S. citizens and Vietnamese refugees. Biden felt evacuation should be the priority as the situation in Vietnam worsened. ""We should focus on getting them out. Getting the Vietnamese out and military aid for the GVN (Government of South Vietnam) are totally different,"" Biden said at the meeting, according to a declassified transcript from the Ford Library Museum. ""I feel put upon in being presented an all-or-nothing number. I don’t want to have to vote to buy it all or not at all. I am not sure I can vote for an amount to put American troops in for one to six months to get the Vietnamese out. I will vote for any amount for getting the Americans out. I don’t want it mixed with getting the Vietnamese out,"" Biden also said during the meeting. A little over a week after this meeting, Biden voted against the Vietnam Contingency Act of 1975, which would have provided emergency funds for evacuation and aid in Vietnam. Along with Biden, 16 other senators from both parties opposed the measure, which passed in the Senate. (A majority of the House of Representatives voted against the final version of the bill, so it failed to become law.) In a speech on the Senate floor before the vote, Biden expressed concerns that the legislation would be used to fund military aid, rather than evacuate refugees. ""There is no question in anybody’s mind … that the bill’s section 2, containing $100 million, labeled as a ‘contingency fund’ may not be, but clearly could be, used for military aid to the South Vietnamese government,"" he said. Biden argued that the contingency fund was not a ""diplomatic channel"" and could even further aggravate the situation between North and South Vietnam. Ford’s funding proposal received criticism from many members of Congress, not just Biden. ""The pushback from Congress, and this was from the majority of Congress, especially the Democrats, was not about funding the evacuation, but rather it was a wish not to throw good money after bad in support of the Saigon regime that was clearly going down in defeat,"" said James Willbanks, a military adviser to the South Vietnamese in 1972 who has written several military history books on the Vietnam War. After Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese military at the end of April 1975, Biden did support a resolution welcoming the first 130,000 refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to the U.S. Around the same time, Congress approved and Ford signed a separate measure authorizing funds to assist refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia. Biden was not present to vote on this bill, but did give it a ""favorable recommendation."" A Facebook post claims that in 1975, then-U.S. Sen. Biden opposed efforts by Ford to aid South Vietnam and evacuate refugees. This claim is based on a second-hand account from Rumsfeld’s book that lacks context about Biden’s stance at the time. Biden stated at the time that his priority was evacuating U.S. citizens and Vietnamese refugees from South Vietnam. He expressed concerns over funding that could be used to provide military aid to South Vietnam, instead of evacuating U.S. citizens and Vietnamese refugees.

Dr. Oz claimed that GOP Senate rival McCormick ‘bragged’ about offshoring jobs. That lacks evidence
","The race for the GOP nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania has been marked by attacks exchanged between two of the leading Republicans, Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick. Ads from Oz, the physician and talk show host, have targeted the business record of McCormick, who is the former chief executive of the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund. One Oz TV ad begins with the narrator saying: ""David McCormick fired Pennsylvanians and bragged about shipping their jobs to Asia."" At the same time, text on the screen says, ""bragged about ‘helping companies to move work offshore’"" and cites as its source an Oct. 12, 2005 Tribune Review article. The ad portrays McCormick as a Wall Street insider who ""will sell us out."" It includes a clip of Oz speaking at his own campaign event, saying that he, like former President Donald Trump, ""came from outside politics.""   Similar claims about McCormick and outsourced jobs have also been featured in TV ads launched by the Oz campaign and by a super PAC supporting Oz. Oz’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back up the claim. The article cited in the ad does not prove Oz’s claim. In 2003, a former Pittsburgh-based software company named FreeMarkets cut 50 Pittsburgh jobs, according to local news reports. McCormick was the company’s CEO at the time.  A few weeks after the cuts, a local news report said McCormick announced that the company would open a facility in India employing more than 100 people. A company spokesperson said, according to the article, that the new center would not affect the employment at the Pittsburgh headquarters, which had about 650 people after the 50 layoffs.  A McCormick campaign spokesperson told PolitiFact: ""Any jobs created in India or outside of the U.S. were completely separate of any decisions and organizational job layoffs in Pittsburgh."" In the 2005 article cited in Oz’s ad, McCormick is not quoted about the company or the layoffs.  That article was about McCormick’s appointment to a top Commerce Department post in President George W. Bush’s administration. The article made one reference to offshoring.  ""McCormick said his experience as a corporate CEO helping companies to move work offshore, and as a platoon leader in the Army during the first Gulf War, will serve him well in his new post,"" the article said. McCormick was the under secretary for export administration and headed the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which worked to advance U.S. national security, foreign policy and economic interests, according to a White House statement at the time. The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  The other major GOP candidates include conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos and Carla Sands, who served as President Donald Trump's ambassador to Denmark. The major Democratic candidates include Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb. The primaries are May 17. Overall, the Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. An Oz campaign ad said McCormick ""fired Pennsylvanians and bragged about shipping their jobs to Asia."" In 2003, McCormick was the CEO of a Pittsburgh company that cut 50 jobs. That same year, the company announced plans to open a center in India. In a 2005 news article cited by Oz’s ad, McCormick does not mention the company or the job cuts. The article paraphrased him as saying that his work in ""helping companies to move work offshore"" and his military leadership service would help him in a new position with the U.S. Commerce Department. Oz’s ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Bob Good invents a position for Ketanji Brown Jackson on late-term abortions
","Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., recently said Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson ""detests the constitution"" and essentially thinks there should be no restrictions on abortion. ""Here’s someone…who believes in abortion on demand up to the moment of birth,"" Good said during a March 22 interview on the The John Frederick Show, a conservative broadcast. Good, a self-described ""biblical conservative,"" represents Virginia’s 5th Congressional district spanning from Danville north past Charlottesville to Warrenton. A fact-check of Good's statement reveals he's invented a position for Jackson that she's never taken. The chief problem centers on his use of the phrase ""abortion on demand.""  The landmark Roe v. Wade court ruling doesn’t grant the right to an abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. It basically protects the right until a fetus can survive outside the womb, often at the 23rd or 24th week of pregnancy. After that, states may ban abortions, but they must leave an exception if a doctor determines one is needed to protect the life or health of a mother.  In other words, Roe and subsequent Supreme Court decisions upholding Roe did not establish an unfettered path to rare late-term abortions, let alone to ""abortion on demand up to the moment of birth."" Jackson has ""a scant record"" on abortion and has ""never ruled on an abortion case,"" according to the American Bar Association’s journal.  Like many other judicial nominees, she won’t say whether she thinks Roe and other Supreme Court precedents were properly decided. ""I have a duty to refrain from critiquing the law that governs my decisions,"" she said in 2021 when Roe came up in her confirmation hearings for a U.S. Court of Appeals judgeship. In this year’s hearings, Jackson has indicated that she’d be reluctant to tinker with Roe. She said Roe and other Supreme Court rulings affirming it are ""settled law, "" and ""all precedents of the Supreme Court must be respected."" We asked Good to back his claim that Jackson supports ""abortion on demand up to the moment of birth."" His office sent us four talking points. None of them offers an opinion or statement by Jackson on Roe nor shows a desire by her to allow unrestricted abortions until the moment of birth. Here are Good’s points: Jackson clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in 2000 when he wrote the majority opinion in Stenberg v. Carhart. The court struck down a Nebraska law that banned ""partial-birth"" abortions because its penalties created an undue burden on a ""woman’s right to choose."" Also, the law did not have an exception for when a mother’s health was endangered. Good’s office wrote, ""At no time has Judge Jackson repudiated that opinion as one she disagreed with."" As a private-practice lawyer in 2001, Jackson co-wrote an amicus brief supporting a successful defense by women’s groups of a Masachussetts law barring protestors from blocking the entrances of abortion clinics. Good’s office noted that one of the groups behind the suit was pro-abortion-rights NARAL and said Jackson’s brief advocated banning ""pro-life Americans from exercising their free speech rights to protest."" Jackson’s brief, however, specifically notes that the ban is content-neutral; its provisions apply to any protestors who block free entrance into clinics regardless of what they are protesting. ""NARAL endorses Judge Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court,"" Good’s office noted. ""In her testimony…(Jackson) affirmed her commitment to the right to an abortion as created by Roe v. Wade and refused to provide any opinion on what viability is or whether that ‘line’ could move based on medical science,"" Good’s office wrote. Jackson did decline to answer a question on moving the line, noting that a Mississippi case pending in the high court - which she might have to rule on - raises that issue. In October 2020, PolitiFact gave a False rating to then-Vice President Mike Pence’s claim that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support abortion ""up to the moment of birth."" The Democratic running mates hadn’t made that statement and said they supported Roe.  Good goes beyond Pence’s claim. He says Jackson ""believes in abortion on demand,"" which means all abortions sought - anytime in pregnancy - would be granted.  Jackson has never said that. She’s never ruled on abortion rights. She won't say whether she thinks Roe v. Wade was properly decided.  What she has said is that Roe and other Supreme Court rulings affirming it are ""established law,"" and she will respect high court precedents in all of her decisions.  Roe allows states to ban rare late-term abortions and ""partial-birth abortions"" if they provide exceptions when a doctor determines a mother’s life or health is endangered by her pregnancy. The most we know is that Jackson will respect that precedent. Good’s statement says, with no credible evidence, that Jackson wants to scuttle precedents allowing late-term bans.  We rate Good’s statement Pants on Fire!      ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C467F40>],/factchecks/2022/mar/29/bob-good/bob-good-invents-position-ketanji-brown-jackson-la/

Are wages finally growing faster than health insurance costs?
","Even if you’re not a direct beneficiary of Obamacare, you’ve reaped its benefits, said President Barack Obama in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding elements of the Affordable Care Act. ""By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance. That hasn't happened in 17 years,"" he said on June 25. Obama’s point is that employers have been spending more and more on health care, so they couldn’t increase wages. Now, he says, health care costs are reined in, which means workers can get more in their paychecks. We wanted to know if Obama was right that this was the first time this has happened since 1998. The White House told us Obama got his numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in employee compensation over time. The data shows that, in the past 17 years, wages grew faster than health care in just one 12-month period, and it was recently: from March 2014 to March 2015. Health care costs grew by 2.5 percent, compared to a 2.6 percent rise in wages.  Obama’s claim was specific in looking at the growth in employer health care costs from year to year. Other measures have found similar trends when looking at changes over longer periods of times and employee share of the insurance tab. Bloomberg, for example, bookended a 25-year period and found that health costs for business almost quadrupled from 1987 to 2012, while wages doubled. According to a report from the health care think tank the Commonwealth Fund, between 2003 and 2013, average family premiums jumped 73 percent, while median family income increased by 16 percent. While Obama’s numbers are accurate, experts had a few words of caution. First, it’s too early to tell how big of a role Obamacare played in curbing health care costs. Beyond legislation, experts also count the recession and a slowdown in medical advancements as potential reasons. ""I don't think people know the exact relationship between health care costs and Obamacare,"" said Janet Currie, a professor of labor and health economics at Princeton University. ""I think (the claim) is true now. Whether it'll be true next quarter is another matter."" Second, because wages and health benefits are typically a zero-sum game, Obama’s purported impact on paychecks could go both ways. ""Because of the (law’s) increasing binding tax or penalty on the ‘Cadillac’ insurance plans, some employers may scale back on the generosity of plans and shift compensation towards wages,"" said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Small firms may be pushed the other way, he said: ""If their insurance packages fall short, firms in that position would need to increase benefits and maybe take from wages."" Third, less expensive health care isn’t necessarily something to cheer about. It could reflect more bang for your buck and a more efficient system, but if the price reflects the quality of care or access to it, cheaper doesn’t mean better, said Clemens. Our ruling Obama said, ""by one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance"" for the first time in 17 years, and he credited the Affordable Care Act. His claim is backed by numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compare change in costs over a 12-month period: Wages grew faster than health care costs for the first time since 1998 between March 2014 and March 2015. Experts say Obama used the BLS data accurately and reasonably. They did caution that the law's role in this dynamic is still uncertain, and more data may show different results.

Gun advocate criticizes Obama's statement, cites murder rates in Brazil, Russia
","Following the mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama claimed that ""mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly False. The next day, Obama slightly altered his wording to make his claim more accurate. During a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Obama said that ""you don’t see murder on this kind of scale, this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on Earth."" Still, Obama’s words were not without criticism. We flagged one claim from John R. Lott, Jr., founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a pro-gun research group. ""The thing that most disappoints me with regard to the president is he just keeps on putting out information that is clearly false,"" Lott said on Fox News June 24, 2015. ""I mean, in the clip that you had, the United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. ""You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States. There are other countries which are similar to us."" PunditFact decided to take a closer look at his claim. We found Lott referenced the same information in an article published in the New York Daily News that same day. ""Among developed countries … the U.S. isn’t anywhere close to having the highest homicide rate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the arbiter of which countries are considered industrialized, ranks Russia and Brazil far ahead of the U.S., with homicide rates that are respectively 2 1/2 to five times higher than ours. Our rate was tied with Chile’s, and just slightly above the average for developed countries."" Lott’s claim has a couple areas worthy of fact checking. First of all, do Russia’s and Brazil’s crime rates match what Lott said? And second, are Russia and Brazil even considered to be developed countries as Lott seems to indicate? Just the numbers PunditFact reached out to Lott for more information about his claim. Lott cited data gathered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). According to the report (which includes statistics for 2011, the latest available year), the United States has a homicide rate of 5.2 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparatively, Russia has a homicide rate of 12.8 murders, and Brazil has a rate of 25.5 murders. With these numbers, Russia’s rate comes out to be 2.46 times greater than that of the United States, and Brazil’s murder rate comes out to be 4.90 times larger than that of the United States. Lott mentioned Chile in his op-ed in the Daily News. That country’s murder rate is 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, which is actually less than the rate of the United States. Other sources largely support the OECD research, and Lott’s use of the numbers. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime’s study, in 2011 the United States had a homicide rate of 4.7 murders per 100,000 people, Russia’s murder rate was 9.6 per 100,000 people and Brazil’s rate was 23.4. According to this data, Russia’s murder rate was 2.04 times higher than that of the United States, and Brazil’s was 4.97 times greater. That’s close to what Lott said. Developed or Developing? Now comes the trickier part of Lott’s claim. Lott was reacting to Obama’s use of the word ""advanced"" to describe a group of countries, and saying Obama was providing false information. Lott described a group of counties with the word ""developed"" and included Brazil and Russia. Those words are important, and whether you consider Brazil or Russia advanced and/or developed makes all the difference. The OECD is currently comprised of 34 member countries and lists Brazil and Russia as ""key partners."" But just because the OECD includes these 36 countries when compiling its Better Life Index does not mean that they are all automatically classified as developed nations. The OECD’s member countries ""include many of the world’s most advanced countries but also emerging countries like Mexico, Chile and Turkey."" PunditFact reached out to OECD’s Better Life Index to inquire what criteria was used to distinguish between ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ countries, but did not hear back. However, other experts shed some light on the issue. According to Massimo Morelli, Columbia University professor of political science and economics, Brazil and Russia are considered intermediate countries. They are not ""developing"" nations, but not quite considered ""advanced/developed,"" either. ""The so-called BRIC countries  (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are those who moved from developing to developed very fast due to fast growth rates, but they are definitely not advanced yet,"" Morelli said. However, he did note that out of the four intermediate countries, both Russia and China may be considered advanced in some respects. Leonid Peisakhin, assistant professor of politics at New York University in Abu Dhabi, agreed. ""There is no hard definition for what an advanced country is. There are different markers having to do with human development levels, levels of industrialization, income per capita, size of the services sector, etc. Russia is a tricky case, as it is, in fact, highly industrialized; however, Russia does not have very high income or human development levels. Brazil is less ambiguously a developing economy,"" he said. However, even some of these factors are not always clear cut. ""If you define ‘advanced’ countries based on something simple such as per capita real GDP, I think that you are going to have a hard time including countries such as Chile, Poland, Greece, Portugal, and many others, but not include Russia,"" Lott said in a follow-up statement to PunditFact. The World Bank uses GNI (Gross National Income), and not GDP, as its prime indicator. (The total national income is divided by the population of the country to determine the GNI per capita.) In 2013, Brazil’s GNI per capita was $11,690. Russia’s was $13,850. Using the World Bank definition, Brazil is classified as having an upper-middle-income economy, which places it under the category of a developing nation. Russia is ranked as a high-income nation, and is not labeled as ""developing."" For comparison the U.S. GNI in 2013 was $53,470. Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization allows members to decide for themselves how to classify themselves, although other member countries can dispute the decision. ""Setting aside these ambiguities, there can be no doubt that the U.S. should be compared to other countries with similar levels of income and development and a similar historical trajectory: Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. These are all highly advanced and developed economies with similar historical trajectories and consequently functional rule of law systems,"" said Peisakhin. One final note: Out of the nations observed, the United States’ murder rate was only exceeded by three countries in the study: Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. (Mexico is considered emerging or developing by most organizations, including OECD.) Our ruling Lott said that the ""United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States."" Although the specific murder rates vary across different sources, Lott’s statement about Russia’s and Brazil’s murder rates did match up with the information the OECD had. What didn’t quite match up was the consensus on how to classify Brazil and Russia. They are advanced on some fronts, especially Russia, but not as developed as others. Ultimately, they may not be the best choice when comparing murder rates in the United States and other ""developed"" nations. Lott’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974BA100>],/factchecks/2015/jun/30/john-lott/gun-advocate-refutes-obamas-statement-cites-murder/

Bobby Scott says U.S. income disparity is widest since 1920s
","U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott voted against a sweeping trade in agreement with Asian nations earlier this month, in part because he thinks it will depress U.S. wages.   ""Entering into another large-scale trade deal at a time when income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s is not the best course of action for our nation,"" Scott said in a June 12 statement explaining his votes against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.   We wondered if pay inequality between the very top earners and the rest of workers really is the highest since the Roaring 20’s. Similar claims have been sounded this year from both sides of the political aisle and uttered by two presidential candidates who, otherwise, are light years apart: Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas.   Scott’s office backed the claim by referring us to two reports. The first, published earlier this year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is a guide to statistical studies on income inequality published by other organizations, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office. All of the studies showed that disparity in the U.S. has been climbing steadily since the 1970s. But there was a problem: most of research didn’t go back much further in time and to get to the bottom of Scott’s claim, we had to travel back nearly 100 years.   One such time machine exists and the second document referred directly to it. Research by Emmanuel Saez -- an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and recipient of a 2010 genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation -- traces U.S. pay disparity since 1913. Saez and other economists built a database that compiles historic disparity statistics from 30 nations using data from millions of individual tax returns filed over the years.   In 2012, the top 1 percent of U.S. earners made 18.88 percent of the total pre-tax income of the nation’s tax filers. That was the highwater mark since 1928, when top earners pulled in a record 19.6 percent of all income.   Saez says the 2012 share may have been a slight aberration, in part because many high earners cashed investments to avoid an increase in the capital gains tax that took effect the following year.   In 2013, the top percent’s share of income was 17.54 percent of total earnings. While that was a slight decrease, it still was the 16th highest mark over the 101 years measured in data base. It’s also the latest year available.   The data shows the top earners had at least a 16.68 percent share of total income every year since 2005. The figure was exceeded only one time between 1928 and 2005 -- top earners pulled in 17.64 percent in 1936..   The 16 years in which the top 1 percent had the greatest share of U.S. income are: While Saez’s work has become a popular source for politicians to cite when discussing income disparity, some economists are critical of his measurements.   Gary Burtless, an economist with Brookings, a Washington think tank, told us as well as PolitiFact Texas that Saez’s data understates income growth of the bottom 99 percent. He noted that Saez’s income data is limited to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains.   What’s missing, Burtless said, are other forms of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans.   These unmeasured benefits, which almost entirely began in the 1940s -- and, in some cases, decades later -- ""are far more important for low and middle-income Americans than they are for the very well-to-do,"" Burtless said.   The CBO, which has been measuring income disparity since 1979, uses a broader statistical formula than Saez. It computed the top 1 percent’s income at 13.3 percent in 2009 and 14.9 percent in 2010 -- the latest years available. Saez, in comparison, computed the disparity at 16.7 percent and 17.5 percent for the same two years -- an average of about 3 percentage points higher than the CBO.   Average income disparity during the 1930s was less than two percentage points below the average from 2010-2013. So if all forms of income were computed for each era, it’s possible that that the actual disparity was greater 1930s than it is today.   Our ruling   Scott said, ""Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s.""   The one database that goes back that far backs up Scott. It shows that, with one exception, the sixteen highest years of disparity between the top one percent of earners and others occurred before 1930 or after 2004.   But it’s worth noting that the data tends to understate income because it doesn’t consider major government and employee benefits that weren’t offered until the 1940s or later. So it’s very possible that bottom-line disparity would have been greater in the 1930s than it is today.   For that reason, we rate Scott’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973DA980>],/factchecks/2015/jun/30/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-us-income-disparity-widest-1920s/

Bernie Sanders: U.S. 'only major country' that doesn't guarantee right to health care
","The U.S. Supreme Court’s recent ruling on Obamacare subsidies kept the program rolling, and Sen. Bernie Sanders was totally celebrating.  Still, the independent from Vermont who is running as a Democrat for president told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos that the nation was far from out of the woods on health care. ""We still have 35 million Americans without insurance,"" Sanders said on June 28, 2015, during an interview on This Week. ""We need to join the rest of the industrialized world. We are the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right."" We wanted to check Sanders’ claim that the United States is ""the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right."" This is a common theme for Sanders but the words he used this time muddied his message on two fronts -- which countries and what guarantee? A spokesman for Sanders, Michael Briggs, said Sanders was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We’re not sure Sanders made that entirely clear (for instance the OECD doesn’t include China or Russia, which many people would consider a major country), but we’ll put that aside for the moment. Anyway, Briggs directed us to a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lack universal health care coverage. ""However, Mexico passed a law in 2004 with the goal of establishing universal coverage, and they're currently at 90 percent,"" Briggs said. ""The ACA was never intended to establish universal coverage, and according to the January CBO estimate, 90 percent is about as good as it's going to get."" We checked and Briggs is close on his numbers. In Mexico, as of 2013, public insurance reached about 86.7 percent of the people. That’s actually not much different from where America stood, if you combine public and private coverage. The figure in the United States was 84.9 percent. However, in 2015, the CBO estimated that 89 percent of American residents -- excluding undocumented immigrants -- have coverage. The number drops to 87 percent if you include undocumented residents. The median income in Mexico is so low, about a third that in the United States, that some would not group it with the stronger OECD countries. In fact, Mexico is often referred to as an emerging or developing economy as opposed to an industrialized or developed one. But since Sanders’ spokesman included it, we thought it only fair to include it, too.   Beyond the raw numbers, Sanders statement highlights the tricky questions that come up when you start talking about a right to health care. Is it defined as universal coverage, or a legal right to care? The two are not identical. The gold standard Europe covers both bases. Nearly every European nation has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. That treaty’s section on health care casts health care as a right. ""The system of health care must be accessible to the entire population. To that end, states should take as their main criterion for judging the success of health system reforms effective access to health care for all, without discrimination, as a basic human right."" Countries follow different paths to make good on that promise. Great Britain has its national health service where the government runs the hospitals and pays the doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complicated mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in America, a law that makes insurance mandatory for everyone. Those European nations score 100 when it comes to universal coverage. But so does Australia, and Australia operates under no legal claim that health care is a right. The government’s Attorney General’s Department posted on its website ""there is no Commonwealth legislation explicitly enshrining the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."" That doesn’t stop the Aussies from running an extensive system of public hospitals and a robust public health insurance program. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and it too lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a substantial body of Japanese health care law, but it has to do with creating various government programs and setting the rules of the game. A weak guarantee There are several international treaties and conventions that speak of the obligation of countries to provide for the health of their residents. The list includes the World Health Organization constitution and the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States signed and ratified the former, but is literally one of a handful of countries that has not ratified the latter. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a landmark document that comes very close to asserting health care as a right. The treaty’s language is ambitious. It speaks of ""the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."" Countries that get behind it promise that they will  aim to create the ""conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness."" But the convention’s legal heft is considerably less than its stated goals. It pushes no country to spend beyond its ""available resources,"" a quantity that could be whatever the leaders say it is. Lawrence Gostin is the director of Georgetown University’s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Gostin said the convention lacks teeth. ""These international obligations are vague and unenforceable so really don’t translate into a ‘right’ in all states,"" Gostin said. For Gostin, the test of a nation’s commitment should be measured by the facts on the ground. ""Does it provide even reasonably fair access to the entire population, and is there a way to enforce or implement the right,"" Gostin said. ""By those measures, the U.S. has many entitlements to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes there are many left out but that is true in lots of countries, including China that provides a minuscule amount of health dollars to rural residents."" Whether China is an industrialized country of the sort Sanders mentioned is a matter of debate, but China helps illustrate the difference between a right in law and a right in practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On top of that, its Constitution commits the state to provide health services and facilities ""all for the protection of the people's health."" But the record of the world’s most populous nation is checkered to say the least. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy group, wrote about the evolution of health care in China. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Blumenthal wrote that about 95 percent of the population has access to modest coverage. ""The government has decided to provide all Chinese some protection against the cost of illness, not necessarily as a matter of right, but as a matter of fact,"" Blumenthal told PolitiFact. Ake Blomqvist, a health care economist at Carleton University in Canada, has a dimmer view of the connection between China’s legal promises and what it delivers. China might have signed that UN convention but that has had limited effect. ""In reality the majority of people in China are at risk of not being able to receive even urgently needed health care if they are unlucky enough to require something that is expensive,"" Blomqvist said. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn’t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Sanders was a bit vague about which countries he was comparing to America, but his office clarified that he was thinking of the group that belongs to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. Mexico also has not achieved universal coverage, but Mexico is also a much poorer country and not always considered an industrialized or advanced economy. As for a guaranteed right to health care, Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don’t. He should have talked about universal coverage, but he didn’t. Sanders’ statement lacked some much needed clarity.

"['Civil Rights', 'PunditFact', 'Juan Williams']","
Juan Williams: Whites think blacks are less intelligent, trustworthy, patriotic
","Fox News' Juan Williams made an interesting claim about the continued existence of racism in the wake of the Charleston, S.C, shootings. ""The polls indicate this, that white people think that black people are less intelligent,"" Williams said on the June 22, 2015, edition of The Five. ""They think they’re less trustworthy, less patriotic. At some point you’ve got to deal with these root issues."" We reached out to Williams to better understand his statement but did not hear back. We think you could interpret his words two ways. You might think that a majority of white people believe black people are less intelligent, trustworthy and patriotic. Or you could hear Williams' claim and think that within the white population, you’re more likely to find people who think poorly of blacks. You could have that trend even if most whites don’t think that way. The difference in interpretation makes all the difference, polls show. What the polls show about race To make sense of racial attitudes, pollsters ask whites and blacks the same set of questions about their own group and the other group. Then they compare the results. A 2012 survey from a partnership of the Associated Press, the GfK polling firm, Stanford University, the National Center for Opinion Research (NORC) and the University of Michigan attempted to answer questions about how one race thought of the other. The series of questions followed the pattern of, ""How well does each of these words describe most blacks/whites?"" Words included ""intelligent at school,"" ""smart at everyday things,"" ""law abiding,"" ""good neighbors"" and ""dependable."" The possible responses were Extremely well, Very well, Moderately well, Slightly well and Not at all well. Josh Pasek, a researcher at the University of Michigan who worked on the project, broke down the results for us to help analyze Williams' claim. ""Intelligent at school"" and ""smart at everyday things"" are approximations for intelligence. ""Law abiding,"" ""good neighbors"" and ""dependable"" work as stand-ins for trustworthy. (Alas, the survey did not ask about patriotism.) This approach lets you tease out how many whites have negative opinions of whites, and how many whites have negative opinions of blacks. And you can compare that to black perspectives on whites and blacks. The results: A majority of whites don't hold negative views of blacks. But you will find a group of whites who view blacks more harshly than whites. And that group is bigger than the fraction of blacks who see blacks negatively. The following chart shows the negative opinions of whites. The green bar is the percentage of whites holding a negative opinion of blacks. The brown bar is the percentage of whites holding negative views of other whites. The higher the column, the more negative the feeling. The clear pattern is that whites are more likely to have a negative view of blacks than of whites. To round out the picture, the fraction of blacks who hold negative views of blacks is about half that of whites. Additional study results We looked at other studies in this area, including one that looked at people's views on patriotism. Intelligence. A group of researchers led by Harvard University sociologist Lawrence Bobo looked at recent trends in white attitudes about blacks. That research shows that since 1990, the fraction of whites who think that whites are more intelligent and more hardworking than blacks has declined.   Tom Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center (NORC), told us that ""racial differences have decreased over time, but many whites still rate blacks more negatively than they rate whites on various traits."" Smith said in the 2014 survey, one quarter of whites rated blacks as less intelligent than whites. Trustworthy. Angie Maxwell, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, told us that the 2012 Blair Center national poll found that about a fifth of whites (20 percent) say that blacks are untrustworthy. Generally negative views. Vincent Hutchings at the University of Michigan pulled responses from the American National Election Study to assess the impact of race on the 2008 election of Barack Obama. Hutchings didn’t report how whites answered specific questions but he wrote that overall, a ""slight majority of Latinos and Whites indicate that they view Blacks more negatively than they do Whites."" Patriotism. Spencer Piston, a political scientist at Syracuse University, directed us to the American National Election Study, which added patriotism to its questionnaire. Piston ran the numbers for us and found that for whites: 46 percent rate blacks less patriotic than they rate whites; 49 percent rate blacks equally patriotic to how they rate whites; 5 percent rate blacks more patriotic than they rate whites. A final note The connection between these survey results and overt racism is far from straightforward. Pasek at the University of Michigan said the connection between outcomes is even more complex. ""If you look at the series of recent incidents, from Trayvon Martin to Ferguson, Mo., those are not necessarily cases where people would have actively espoused racist attitudes,"" Pasek said. ""But there could be an internal racial predisposition that would lead them to act in prejudicial ways, and social science suggests that most of us harbor these implicit biases."" Our ruling Williams said polls show that white people think that black people are less intelligent, less trustworthy and less patriotic. The veracity of Williams' claim hinges on how you interpret his comments. One way: That whites are more likely to hold negative opinions of blacks (than they do of fellow whites or blacks do of blacks), is largely accurate. But a second way: That a majority of whites hold negative opinions of blacks, is inaccurate. On the question of patriotism, the data are thin. But what we have suggests that Williams is wrong. Williams’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Scott Walker says most Americans support voter ID laws, which make it easier to vote harder to cheat
","In Scott Walker and Hillary Clinton's perfect world, at around this time next year each will be preparing to participate in the 2016 presidential debates. For now, they will have to be content exchanging jabs from afar. The latest exchange began June 4, 2015 when Clinton, who is the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Walker and three other GOP contenders in a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston for their support of voter ID laws. She claimed Walker had cut back early voting in Wisconsin and made it harder for college students to vote. We rated that Mostly True. Walker responded to Clinton’s attack with a statement and then through a series of tweets. In his statement, Walker said, ""Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans."" Is Walker right that a strong majority of Americans support photo IDs to vote? And do those requirements make it ""easier to vote and harder to cheat""? Polls and photo ID The thrust of Walker’s claim was that photo ID laws are exceptionally popular among voters, and that Hillary Clinton’s view opposing them is out of step. So we will start there. According to the polls we examined, Walker is on target about public support. A Rasmussen Reports poll published June 3, 2015, showed 76 percent of respondents believe voters should be required to show a form of photo identification before being allowed to vote.  Even 58 percent of respondents who identified as Democrats supported voter ID laws. The poll included  952 likely voters and had a margin of error of 3 percent. A 2012 Washington Post poll found 74 percent of respondents said they believed voters should have to show government-issued ID before casting a ballot. Again, the support crossed demographic groups: 78 percent of white respondents supported voter ID laws; as did 67 percent of non-whites, 65 percent of blacks and 64 percent of Hispanics. The poll included 2,047 adults. The margin of error was 2.5 percent. We looked at several other national polls, and all had similar numbers: between 70 percent and 80 percent of voters support requiring a photo ID to vote. Meanwhile, a 2014 Marquette University Law School poll of 1,409 registered Wisconsin voters found 60 percent of respondents supported requiring a photo ID to vote. The margin of error was 2.7 percent. ""It gets overwhelming public support,"" said Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""Depending on which poll, you might get 60 to 80 percent support. ""The reason you get that level of support ... most of the people who vote have an accessible voter ID."" Easy to vote, hard to cheat There are two other elements embedded in Walker’s claim -- that photo ID laws make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. On these points, there is great partisan disagreement and dug-in views on both sides. Critics of ID laws -- mainly Democrats -- say the amount of voter fraud is small and that the laws can disenfranchise poor and elderly voters who may have difficulty obtaining a photo ID. Supporters note the law includes provisions to address access to IDs and argue that any amount of fraud is too much. ""It doesn’t matter if there’s one, 100 or 1,000,"" Walker said in a 2014 gubernatorial debate. ""Amongst us, who would be that one person who would like to have our vote canceled out by a vote that was cast illegally?"" In 2011, Walker signed Act 23, the law that requires Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID before receiving a ballot. Provisions of the law were quickly challenged in court. Thus the law has only fully in place been for the 2012 spring primary -- a nonpartisan contest that had only eight judicial races on the ballot, plus three local special elections. It has yet to be tested in a statewide race. That will change in 2016, with the spring elections. In March 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the law, meaning it now stands. What changed? Before the 2011 legislation, an already-registered voter had to simply state his or her name and address to a poll worker in order to receive a ballot. Under the new law, a voter must also show an acceptable form of photo ID and sign the poll book before receiving a ballot. When asked for evidence that photo ID laws make it easier to vote, a Walker aide pointed to a modest increase in voter turnout in Wisconsin since the law was passed. But that ignores the many other factors at play in driving turnout, including the candidates on the ballot and how close the race is perceived to be by voters. And, as noted, the law has not yet been fully in place for a statewide election, so to say it increased turnout is a stretch at best. Indeed, some studies, such as one from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, suggest photo ID laws may have contributed to a decrease in voter turnout in some states. In 2012, more than 9 in 10 registered Wisconsin voters were estimated to have a valid form of photo ID. That left around 300,000 registered voters without a photo ID at the time. Mayer, who conducted the estimate, said it is unknown how many unregistered voters may lack the proper documents to obtain a free, state-issued ID. The bottom line: At least some voters will have to go to extra steps to obtain a valid ID. That makes it more difficult to vote, not easier. As for the ""harder to cheat"" portion, Mayer conceded photo ID laws could be effective against in-person voter fraud. But he and others note that there have been few documented cases of in-person voter fraud. ""It makes it harder for kangaroos to vote, but kangaroo voter fraud is not a problem,"" Mayer said. That argument, though, goes to the whether the law itself was even needed. Walker’s claim was on the impact of the changes. The new law adds an extra verification step at the polling place before votes can be cast. That clearly makes it harder to cheat, as Walker claimed. When it comes to voter fraud, the most common type is voting by felons who are not allowed to vote, said Reid Magney, a public information officer for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. A felon is not allowed to vote if he or she is still ""on-paper,"" meaning he or she is on parole, on extended supervision or on probation. Once a felon is ""off-paper"" he or she can vote again after re-registering. Felon voting has been a problem before in Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation from 2008 identified ""at least 278 cases where felons may have improperly voted.""   But voter ID laws would not prevent this type of voter fraud; many felons can still get driver's licenses. The state catches illegal felon voters by cross referencing a list of voters to a list of felons ""on paper"" with the Department of Corrections. Our rating  Walker said, ""Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans."" Walker is on point with the main thrust of his claim. Polls show strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats. The other elements of the claim -- easier to vote and harder to cheat -- amount to a split. It’s clearly not easier to vote if the extra step of obtaining a photo ID is added. Likewise, it is harder to cheat if there is an extra verification step at the polling place. On balance, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F99580>],/factchecks/2015/jun/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-most-americans-support-voter-id-/

Trump: Pro-choice polling numbers declining
","Donald Trump, who in 1999 said he ""was strongly pro-choice,"" says he's now against abortions and will nominate Supreme Court justices who share his stance.  During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Trump suggested his shift in position mirrors the feelings of the American public. ""In terms of polling, the pro-choice (support) is going down a little bit,"" Trump said. ""It’s very interesting."" Is that true? The most recent polling we could find comes out of Gallup. In May of this year, the polling group found 50 percent of Americans identify as pro-choice, compared to 44 percent of Americans who identify as pro-life. That's actually up, not down. The gap is outside the margin of error, the first time the pro-choice position has a statistically significant edge since 2008. If anything, the pro-choice position is gaining ground, not losing it in recent years. In 2012, 50 percent of people identified as pro-life, Gallup found, compared to 41 percent who identified as pro-choice. Here's a chart showing the Gallup results since 1996:  Between 1997 and 2008, people identifying as pro-choice hovered around 50 percent, and the pro-life group stayed in the mid 40s, according to Gallup. Between 2009 and 2014, the pro-life group occasionally surpassed the pro-choice group in the polls. According to the report, some shifts in public opinion on abortion have coincided with political events, such as related legislation or Supreme Court decisions. But because of an increasing percentage of Americans who say their views are primarily liberal, it’s possible the pro-choice group will maintain its edge. Other research has found that public opinion on abortion has remained relatively stable. According to Pew, 51 percent of adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while with 43 percent say it should be illegal all or most of the time. Those percentages have been near the same level for more than 20 years. The divide has stayed ""remarkably stable"" as far back as 50 years, according to researchers out of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., who assembled data from several polls and published an article in The Atlantic about a year ago. The article points out that in both 1975 and 2013, 54 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in certain circumstances. For some additional context, the AEI research found that far fewer Americans consider abortion policy a high priority than you might expect, given the attention paid to the issue. In fact, only 1 percent of Americans polled by Gallup mentioned abortion as the most-important issue facing the country. The authors also pointed out that Americans are conflicted on abortion -- noting a 2013 study that found many Americans identified as pro-life and pro-choice. ""Pro-life and pro-choice activists don't see the shades of gray that most Americans see on the issue,"" the authors wrote. ""Neither their actions nor court decisions have altered public opinion in any significant way since Roe was decided more than four decades ago."" We reached out to Trump through a spokesperson but did not hear back by our deadline. Our ruling Trump said, ""In terms of polling, the pro-choice (support) is going down a little bit."" There was a significant dip in the number of people who identified as pro-choice in 2012, but that number has rebounded during the last three years, according to a Gallup survey. Other research shows the percentage of people who identify as pro-choice or pro-life split has stayed relatively stable for at least the past 20 years.

Greg Abbott says $1 billion in gold bullion headed to Texas from Federal Reserve
","Uncle Sam’s loss will be Texas’s golden gain, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared after signing a proposal into law creating the Texas Bullion Depository. ""The law,"" Abbott’s office said in a June 2015 press release, ""will repatriate $1 billion of gold bullion from the Federal Reserve in New York to Texas."" Repatriate, per Merriam-Webster, means to send money back to your country. ""The bullion depository will serve as the custodian, guardian and administrator of bullion that may be transferred to or otherwise acquired by the State of Texas,"" the governor’s office said. A reader asked us to check Abbott’s description of the about-to-travel bullion, which generally can refer to bars made of gold or another precious metal. In his announcement, Abbott said he signed House Bill 483 into law ""to provide a secure facility for the State of Texas, state agencies and Texas citizens to store gold bullion and other precious metals. With the passage of this bill, the Texas Bullion Depository will become the first state-level facility of its kind in the nation, increasing the security and stability of our gold reserves and keeping taxpayer funds from leaving Texas to pay for fees to store gold in facilities outside our state."" We emailed Abbott aides per his Federal Reserve claim and didn’t hear back. Similarly, the author of the legislation, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, did not engage. News stories on $1 billion in bullion But we spotted news stories characterizing the possible boon to Texas once the depository is set up. Early in 2015, Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman wrote that not long ago, a University of Texas unit had a billion dollars in bullion stowed in New York, though Herman made no mention of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The reserve bank in New York has a vault in Manhattan, it says online, where it secures bullion for the U.S. government, foreign governments, other central banks and official international organizations--though evidently not U.S. state agencies. Herman wrote: ""The bullion storage business is centered in New York City and Delaware. And that gets us to the second part of the profit deal here. Texas now pays to store its gold in NYC. When Capriglione checked in 2013,  the University of Texas Investment Management Company paid to store its 6,643 gold bars--worth around $1 billion--in what he calls the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank in New York. ""Says UTIMCO CEO Bruce Zimmerman: The gold holdings now are down to about $725 million. He was not immediately sure how many gold bars that is. They're stored in Manhattan at HSBC Bank,  which charges an annual fee of less than one-tenth of 1 percent per year. ""HSBC is a British multinational bank that started as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp."" Later, a May 2015 Houston Chronicle news story on Capriglione’s proposal quoted the Senate sponsor, Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, specifying UTIMCO in March 2015 had 5,610 gold bars in its portfolio, an investment worth $645 million, and was being charged a storage fee of $108 per bar by a bullion depository in New York, a total storage cost of more than $605,000 a year. ""New York will hate this,"" Kolkhorst said of the proposal. ""To me, that and the fact that it will save Texas money makes it a golden idea."" A May 30, 2015, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story noted the intended change in law would allow, rather than require, bullion deposits. That story and news accounts published the same week by the Associated Press and the Dallas Morning News each aired the billion-dollar figure. In fact, the AP and Star-Telegram accounts said the state had more than $1 billion in gold stored elsewhere. Fiscal analysis of legislation We didn’t confirm a billion-plus figure. And a state financial projection did not mention the potential value of any bullion likely to shift to Texas--from any location. The May 30, 2015, fiscal note by the staff of the advisory Legislative Budget Board said: ""Depending upon the number of depository transactions and the amount of fees that could be assessed to depository agents, there could be an indeterminate fiscal impact to the state."" The analysis concluded that at this time, how much money the state makes from ""depository activities"" could not be estimated. Generally, the fiscal note said, the Texas Bullion Depository, directed by an appointee of the state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, ""would hold certain bullion and specie acquired by the state or a political subdivision of the state; could receive and hold such deposits for private entities; and would use depository agents, as described in the bill, to conduct retail transactions on behalf of the depository with current and prospective depository account holders,"" the fiscal note said, with deposits and related assets not available for legislators to spend. UT: $650 million in bullion in a New York bank About that billion: To our inquiry, a UT System spokeswoman, Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, emailed us a statement from UTIMCO’s Zimmerman: ""At one time over the past few years, UTIMCO did in fact have an investment of approximately $1 billion in gold bullion. As of today, the investment is closer to $650 million in gold bullion. ""UTIMCO also has investments in gold financial futures,"" Zimmerman said. ""We do not know what any other Texas-related investment fund may or may not own. Also, UTIMCO may buy or sell gold bullion or gold futures at any time so future ownership cannot be predicted."" Currently, he said, the gold is held in storage in a vault located in New York ""and is part of a bank, and therefore under the auspices of the Federal Reserve System, but it is not owned or controlled directly by the Federal Reserve."" Zimmerman said UTIMCO will ""seriously consider"" moving its bullion to the Texas depository if it’s created and is a ""robust member of the COMEX (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) which facilitates and eases buying and selling of gold bullion by having it fully integrated with the gold financial futures marketplace"" and if, he said, UTIMCO’s ""costs are equal to or less than what is now being paid."" LaCoste-Caputo, by email, said the precise value of the gold bars, as of June 24, 2015, was $661,424,610. Potentially of note, she said, the UT System Board of Regents would need to approve moving the gold. She said the likely scenario is that UTIMCO would make a recommendation for the board to consider. Next, we checked with other agencies including retirement systems and the comptroller's office and did not identify additional state-owned bullion that might could be shifted to the Texas depository. Our ruling Abbott said the new law ""will repatriate $1 billion of gold bullion from the Federal Reserve in New York to Texas."" We see a thread of truth here in the law creating a Texas depository that could field bullion deposits. But the statute doesn’t repatriate any bullion. In addition, UTIMCO has around $660 million in gold bullion (not $1 billion) and it's stored in a New York bank, not the Federal Reserve. We rate Abbott’s statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Did Abraham Lincoln plan to send ex-slaves to Central America after the Civil War?
","The debate over whether states should allow the Confederate battle flag in close proximity to their state capitol -- reignited by the June 17 killing of nine African-American worshippers in a historic church in South Carolina -- has intensified discussion of slavery and the Civil War on social media. A reader recently asked us to check out claims repeated in a variety of places on the Internet that offer a revisionist history of the Civil War, with a sympathetic spin on behalf of the Confederacy. Here, we’ll focus on one of the claims from those sites -- one that calls into question whether President Abraham Lincoln was really ""the Great Emancipator"": ""Martyred President Abraham Lincoln was fervently making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the war was over,"" the Internet posts say. ""Knowing that African society would never allow the slaves to return back to Africa, Lincoln also did not want the slaves in the U.S. He thought the jungles of Central America would be the best solution and conducive to the freed slaves best interest. The only thing that kept this from happening, was his assassination."" We wondered whether mainstream historians believe that Lincoln was ""making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the (Civil War) was over"" and that ""the only thing that kept this from happening was his assassination."" The short answer is that Lincoln had long favored the ""colonization"" option, though as a voluntary option rather than a mandated removal. Moreover, his issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, rendered even that voluntary option effectively dead -- and since that was more than two years before the end of the war on April 9, 1865, his assassination didn’t stop it from happening. Lincoln never spoke publicly of colonization after issuing the proclamation, and apparently did little behind the scenes to advance the idea after that date, focusing instead on creating a post-war society that included both blacks and whites. ""The post is preposterous,"" said Michael Burlingame, a historian who holds a distinguished chair in Lincoln studies at the University of Illinois at Springfield. The notion of re-colonizing slaves in Africa had a long history. The main group supporting the idea, the American Colonization Society, was founded in 1817. ""The goal was the charitable and restorative ideal of un-kidnapping people from their homeland in Africa by offering to use private funds to transport them back voluntarily, for any who so wished,"" said James M. Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln collection at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Ill. Monrovia, Liberia, was founded in the 1820s by former American slaves, and by the early 1850s, Lincoln and like-minded politicians were supportive of that approach. But by the mid 1850s, the anti-slavery movement shifted toward stopping the spread of slavery to newly admitted states in the Great Plains and the West. In his book The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery, historian Eric Foner writes that by 1862, Lincoln, as well as politically moderate members of Congress, saw colonization as at least a piece of the policy puzzle. ""Both the law providing for abolition in the District of Columbia and the Second Confiscation Act included provisions for the colonization of those willing to emigrate. During 1862, Congress appropriated a total of $600,000 to aid in the transportation overseas of African-Americans,"" Foner wrote. Policy entrepreneurs of varying trustworthiness offered colonization proposals in such far-flung locales as Brazil, Colombia, and the Caribbean island of St. Croix. But most black Americans weren’t buying. Seeking their support, Lincoln met with a black delegation at the White House on Aug. 14, 1862, and made the case for colonization. It was widely considered a failure. Lincoln offended his visitors, and others who read the after-the-fact newspaper coverage, by saying such things as, ""It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated"" and that for blacks to refuse to colonize elsewhere would be ""extremely selfish."" Undeterred, Lincoln continued to tout colonization when addressing Congress in December 1862 and asked lawmakers to offer funding. ""I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization,"" he said. Yet within weeks, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which offered an entirely different model for post-Civil War America. One of the key elements of the proclamation was that it opened the door to military service for freed slaves. Cornelius noted that Mark Neely, in the Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia, published in 1982, wrote that ""when Lincoln accepted freedmen as soldiers on Jan. 1, 1863, he guaranteed a biracial future for the country, because no president could ask a man to fight for his country and then tell him it was no longer his country."" Foner agreed, writing that ""Lincoln still retained an interest in colonization. But he would never again publicly advocate this policy. ... Putting some black men into the military and asking others to labor for wages implied a very different vision of their future place in American society than plans for settling them overseas."" Instead, political attention turned to passage of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. The idea of colonization faltered further when news of disastrous attempts at settlement filtered back to Washington. ""By 1864,"" Foner writes, ""although Lincoln still saw voluntary emigration as a kind of safety valve for individual blacks dissatisfied with their condition in the United States, he no longer envisioned large-scale colonization. ... The idea of white America did not die with the Civil War, nor did blacks' own emigration efforts. But colonization as an official policy was dead."" And that was well before Lincoln’s assassination on April 15, 1865. ""His views, like those of millions of other Americans before and during his lifetime, evolved over the course of roughly 30 to 40 years,"" Cornelius said. Our ruling A widely shared bit of text on the Internet says that ""Lincoln was fervently making plans to send all freed slaves to the jungles of Central America once the (Civil War) was over. … The only thing that kept this from happening was his assassination."" This is incorrect on many levels. Even when he was arguing for voluntary colonization during his first two years as president, Lincoln did not envision forced deportations of ex-slaves. Moreover, historians agree that the idea of large-scale, voluntary colonization was effectively dead by the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on Jan. 1, 1863 -- more than two years before Lincoln’s assassination. We rate the claim False.

We summarized some of their findings here but decided that our original False rating stands.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1B0EC0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/26/blog-posting/did-abraham-lincoln-plan-send-ex-slaves-central-am/

Jim Steineke says Wisconsin was broke when Republicans took power in 2011
","Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke frequently uses Twitter to spar with political opponents, and a recent exchange got more heated than usual. The Kaukauna Republican criticized Democrats, liberals, the proposed Milwaukee streetcar and high speed rail in a vigorous exchange June 18, 2015. In the midst of the discussion, he tweeted: ""WI was literally broke when we got here. Been cleaning up your mess ever since."" That is an oldie but goodie on the PolitiFact Wisconsin jukebox. We rated the ""broke"" claim False when Gov. Scott Walker made it in early 2011. Nevertheless, we asked Steineke -- who like Walker was elected in November of 2010 -- for  backup for the claim. We did not hear back and soon after the request, the tweet was deleted. But it lives on in the archives, and in various retweeted versions. Walker’s claim came Feb. 21, 2011, as protests got underway against the budget repair bill, which later became Act 10. The bill curtailed collective bargaining rights for most public employees and required them to pay more toward health care and pensions. The governor declared he would not negotiate on the bill: ""We are broke in this state. We have been broke for years."" He repeated the mantra in his budget speech: ""The facts are clear: Wisconsin is broke and it’s time to start paying our bills today -- so our kids are not stuck with even bigger bills tomorrow."" A spokesman said Walker was referring to $58.7 million plus interest owed to Minnesota under a discontinued tax-reciprocity deal and at least $200 million owed to the Patient's Compensation Fund after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision. Other factors cited included the Medicaid and corrections deficits, as well as the state’s ""structural deficit"" which at the time was estimated at $3.6 billion. When we cracked a dictionary to look up the word ""broke,"" we found listings that included: ""having no money; bankrupt"" and ""without money; penniless."" But numerous experts told us the state wasn’t teetering on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency and, under federal law, could not make such a declaration. In January 2011, Moody’s -- which studies and rates debt issued by governments and corporations -- had said Wisconsin fared well when compared with other states. What’s more, the state had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans. Indeed, by law, each Wisconsin budget must be balanced -- that was what the budget repair bill was aimed at fixing. Walker would go on to repeat the ""broke"" claim in a Sept. 2, 2011 fund-raising appeal. We declared that claim Pants on Fire, because at that point the state had passed a balanced budget with a structural surplus that Walker had celebrated as fiscally sound. Our rating Steineke tweeted that Wisconsin was ""literally broke"" when he and other Republicans took office in 2011. When Walker made the ""broke"" claim, we rated it False.

Hillary Clinton says you can vote in Texas with a concealed-weapon permit, but not a student ID
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, campaigning in Texas, called for citizens to be automatically registered to vote at age 18. Speaking at Texas Southern University, Clinton also lashed out at the Texas law reached by the Republican-steered Legislature in 2011 requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls. Rick Perry, the state’s governor into 2015, ""signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters,"" Clinton said. Mostly True, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. recently found, noting that a federal judge had aired that conclusion, though the judge’s ruling that the law is unconstitutional remains under appeal. A reader asked us to consider another Clinton charge from that Houston appearance. According to a New York Times account of her speech, Clinton said young Texans had been disenfranchised by the voter ID law. ""If you want to vote in this state,"" she said, ""you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough."" This claim took just a few key strokes and help from a state office to confirm. Prior to the change in law, Texas law didn’t require anyone to present a photo ID to vote. However, Alicia Phillips Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, confirmed by email that student ID’s previously could have been presented to help officials pin down someone’s identity for the purposes of voting though the law did not require anyone to present more than a voter registration card. The old law broadly said a voter could present a ""form of identification containing the person’s photograph that establishes the person’s identity."" The Texas secretary of state’s office says on its Frequently Asked Questions web page that the current ID mandate enables a registered voter to cast a ballot at a poll during early voting or on Election Day with one of seven types of a photo ID: So, yes to voting in Texas with a concealed handgun license but no-go for someone presenting a student ID. Nationally, the National Conference of State Legislatures said in March 2015, 14 of 34 states with laws requiring voters to show identification at the polls included a student ID option, including three states — Mississippi, Virginia and Wisconsin — that, like Texas, were described by the group as having ""strict"" photo ID voting laws. Wondering if a student ID element was ever part of the legislation that became the Texas law, we reviewed the varied versions of Senate Bill 14, authored by Sen. Troy Fraser of Horseshoe Bay and fellow Republicans that advanced in the 2011 legislative session. We found no ""student"" mentions. Language permitting a state license to carry a concealed handgun to be offered at the polls wasn’t in the original Fraser proposal; it was added, though, before the Senate sent the proposal to the House, legislative records show. Voting by mail We’ve noted before that Texas maintains a no-ID element for voting by mail, in 2013 rating True a claim the Texas law doesn’t require a person voting by mail to present a photo ID. That’s so, we found, for all but first-time voters who did not present a photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when registering to vote. Those voters who seek to vote by mail can expect to be asked for a copy of their photo ID, yet even they don’t have to do so if they are disabled, in the military or living overseas. A registered voter wishing to ballot by mail must say she or he will be out of her or his home county on Election Day and during the early-voting period or she or he is sick or disabled or will be 65 or older on Election Day or confined in jail though still eligible to vote. Our ruling Clinton said: ""If you want to vote in"" Texas, ""you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough.""

Jeb Bush did not appoint a guardian for a rape victim's fetus, but he fought for one
","A political group has highlighted a controversial fight over fetal rights that former Gov. Jeb Bush mounted years ago, but it went too far in its description of what the current presidential candidate did. Ultraviolet, a women’s rights group, posted an image on Facebook on June 15, 2015, with the title ""5 things you should know about Jeb Bush."" The first item read, ""Appointed a guardian for the fetus of a rape survivor."" We checked into all five of the claims listed on the image and found this one was not accurate. (Read our story on the rest here.) In May 2003, a severely mentally handicapped woman identified only as J.D.S. had been raped in a group home at 22 and was six months pregnant. J.D.S., who was abandoned at birth and raised in foster care, suffered from severe mental retardation, cerebral palsy and autism, with the mental capacity of a 4- or 5-year-old. But Bush actually didn’t appoint a guardian, because he didn’t have that power. What he did was order state lawyers to ask the Orange County Circuit Court in Orlando to appoint a representative for the fetus. Though Bush opposes abortion, he said the court case was not about that. ""This is a question of protecting an innocent life,"" Bush told the Miami Herald. ""And it will be the policy of our government in the case of a woman who is incapacitated or cannot make decisions for her child, that there should be a guardian."" The Florida Department of Children and Families had already asked the court to appoint a guardian once the baby was born. No parties involved had suggested aborting the fetus. But Judge Lawrence Kirkwood did not consider the guardian request, saying he had to follow state statute. Appointing a guardian for the fetus would be ""a clear error,"" he wrote. ""A trial judge must follow the law as written,"" Kirkwood said. ""Many had expected this court to blaze new territory and write new law for the facts beyond the Florida statute."" The issue moved forward, even after a healthy girl known as Baby S was born in August 2003. Kirkwood appointed her a guardian at birth. In January 2004, a three-judge panel in a Daytona appeals court ruled against Bush in a 2-1 decision. Kirkwood had adhered to a 1989 state Supreme Court ruling that said appointing a representative for an unborn fetus would be ""clearly improper."" A fetus was not a person under state law, and was therefore without the same rights as a person. Judge Emerson Thompson noted in the majority opinion that fetal rights were not mentioned anywhere in state statutes about guardianship. Bush continued to hold his position after the appeal ruling in Daytona. ""I do think that a child that could be brought to term, as this child was, in the case where a mother has little or no capabilities in representing the child's interest, a legal guardian should be appointed,"" he said. Our ruling Ultraviolet said Bush ""appointed a guardian for the fetus of a rape survivor."" Bush asked a judge in 2003 to name someone to act in the interests of the fetus of a mentally disabled woman raped in a group home. But the judge did not, because state law does not give a fetus the same protections as a person. An appeals court upheld the judge’s compliance with a 1989 Florida Supreme Court ruling. To be clear, Bush did not appoint anyone as a representative for the fetus, but he did want one.

Jeb Bush did say women should 'find a husband' to get off welfare -- in 1994
","A women’s rights group took presidential candidate Jeb Bush to task in a social media post, dredging up a 21-year-old quote that makes him sound behind the times. In a June 15, 2015, Facebook post, political group Ultraviolet listed ""5 things you should know about Jeb Bush."" The fourth item: ""Said low-income women should ‘get their life together and find a husband.' "" We looked at all five items in a separate story (which you can read here) and found a few inaccuracies. In this case, Bush did say it -- way back in 1994, during his failed first run for governor. During that campaign, Bush pushed for two-year limits on receiving benefits from a federal welfare program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which ended in 1996. ""If people are mentally and physically able to work, they should be able to do so within a two-year period,"" he said. ""They should be able to get their life together and find a husband, find a job, find other alternatives in terms of private charity or a combination of all three. That is the first step, to redefine the role of government. It will be hard. There will be lots of screaming and hollering."" Bush’s GOP primary opponents seized on this widely reported quote -- particularly former Florida Attorney General James Smith, who used part of the quote in an attack ad. Bush called the ad unfair, and said Smith took ""a fragment of a quote from me on welfare reform totally out of context in an attempt to portray me as a sexist who is insensitive to women."" The Orlando Sentinel quoted Bush as saying marriage ""is one of many options, and if people are honest about the welfare system we have today, how you get on welfare is not having a husband in the house."" CNN reported that Bush added, ""Let's be honest here. Men are not on welfare, that's the point. That's the point -- men are not on AFDC."" A state official noted that a small percentage of men did get benefits from the program, as did some families with both men and women as heads of the household. Bush lost the 1994 gubernatorial election in a close race with Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles. Bush’s past statements about shaming single mothers have been in the news quite a bit during this campaign after media outlets began highlighting comments from his 1995 book Profiles in Character. ""One of the reasons more young women are giving birth out of wedlock and more young men are walking away from their paternal obligations is that there is no longer a stigma attached to this behavior, no reason to feel shame,"" Bush wrote. ""Many of these young women and young men look around and see their friends engaged in the same irresponsible conduct. Their parents and neighbors have become ineffective at attaching some sense of ridicule to this behavior. There was a time when neighbors and communities would frown on out-of-wedlock births and when public condemnation was enough of a stimulus for one to be careful."" The same Ultraviolet Facebook image also referenced the so-called ""Scarlet Letter"" law that passed while Bush was in office. That 2001 bill included a provision that required unwed mothers who didn’t know who fathered their child to publish weekly notices describing dates, places and partners with which the women had had sex prior to putting the child up for adoption. Bush let it pass without his signature, but it was ruled unconstitutional two years later and repealed. Bush told an attendee at an Iowa event on June 17, 2015, his real goal had been to focus on the responsibility those absent men bore. ""I'm not in favor of shaming women. What I'm in favor of is shaming men who abandon their children,"" Bush said. ""Women who bring up children by themselves do it heroically, they do it against all odds. Men who don't feel responsible for being part of their child's life create real strains on that family."" Our ruling Ultraviolet claimed Bush ""said low-income women should ‘get their life together and find a husband.’ "" He did say that, back in 1994 during his first gubernatorial run, when the quote also was used against him by opponents. He was talking about putting a limit on a particular welfare program and doubled down on the concept that women would not be on welfare if they were married. The meme omits context and that the comments are more than 20 years old. But Bush did say that.

In defense of Confederate flag, frequent Fox News guest claims Civil War wasn't about slavery
","The erratic anti-feminist and purposefully politically incorrect Gavin McInnes added his take on the Confederate flag controversy. McInnes, a frequent Fox News guest, tweeted to more than 50,000 followers on June 23, 2015, that the Confederate flag should continue to fly. Why? Because, ""The Civil War wasn't about slavery,"" he wrote. ""It was about secession."" In a companion tweet, McInnes said anyone, like Northerners, who think the Civil War was about slavery should go to Google. ""Look it up,"" said McInnes, who was born in England and grew up in Canada. So we did. We typed in ""causes of the Civil War."" The first hit was History.net which told us, ""The burning issue that led to the disruption of the union, however, was the debate over the future of slavery. That dispute led to secession, and secession brought about a war in which the Northern and Western states and territories fought to preserve the Union, and the South fought to establish Southern independence as a new confederation of states under its own constitution."" The second link on Google was to PBS and its History Detectives series. There we read, ""What led to the outbreak of the bloodiest conflict in the history of North America? A common explanation is that the Civil War was fought over the moral issue of slavery. In fact, it was the economics of slavery and political control of that system that was central to the conflict."" No. 3 on the Google hit parade was Americanhistoryabout.com. That page offered five main reasons and the first one was ""Economic and social differences between the North and the South."" And what were those differences? Well, slavery. ""With Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became very profitable. This machine was able to reduce the time it took to separate seeds from the cotton. However, at the same time the increase in the number of plantations willing to move from other crops to cotton meant the greater need for a large amount of cheap labor, i.e. slaves. Thus, the southern economy became a one crop economy, depending on cotton and therefore on slavery."" In fact, most of the causes listed on that page, four out of five, revolved around slavery, including the growth of the abolition movement, the fight over allowing slavery in new states, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, who was seen as anti-slavery. The fourth link on Google was from the Civil War Preservation Trust. The trust wrote ""The Civil War was the culmination of a series of confrontations concerning the institution of slavery."" Just in case the Internet led us astray, we also reached out to a pair of experts on the history of the Civil War. They, too, said McInnes got it fundamentally wrong. Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University, used the words of secessionists themselves as proof of their intentions. ""Read South Carolina's Declaration of the causes of secession,"" Foner said. ""It is all about protecting slavery."" Indeed, the first sentence refers to slaveholding states, and throughout, the institution of slavery is the pivot point around which all else turns. Historian Stephanie McCurry at the University of Pennsylvania points to Mississippi’s declaration of secession. Sentence two begins, ""Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery."" So just to be clear: Slavery led to secession, which led to the Civil War.  Our ruling McInnes said that the Civil War wasn’t about slavery. McInnes’ preferred research method, Google, proved him wrong. In the words of the seceding states themselves, the South wanted to secede because it wanted to preserve slavery. That, in turn, started the Civil War. McInnes’ Twitter profile shows a man staring intently with eyes crossed, which captures the accuracy of tweet. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A76E40>],/factchecks/2015/jun/25/gavin-mcinnes/tweet-civil-war-was-about-secession-not-slavery/

American schools are 'more segregated than they were in the 1960s,' says Hillary Clinton
","Speaking at a black church near Ferguson, Mo., Hillary Clinton applauded efforts to remove Confederate flags before challenging America to own up to its racist past and confront ""hard truths"" about bigotry in the present. The shooting in Charleston, S.C., was no isolated incident, but an extreme manifestation of institutionalized racism, she said. ""The truth is equality, opportunity, civil rights in America are still far from where they need to be,"" Clinton said on June 23. ""Our schools are still segregated, in fact, more segregated than they were in the 1960s."" The Supreme Court declared segregation ""inherently unequal"" and unconstitutional in its landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Sixty years later, have we really regressed and resegregated? It’s important to note that modern school segregation is not the same as the government-sanctioned social system that the Supreme Court struck down in 1954. Segregation today refers to the level of isolation of minority students, which can be measured in a variety of ways. Clinton's comment omits a lot of nuance.  Not quite Jim Crow The Clinton campaign pointed us to a passage in a 2014 study by UCLA Graduate School of Education’s Civil Rights Project that tracked the amount of southern black students attending white schools in the South. By that yardstick, schools are slightly less integrated now than they were in 1968. That’s the year the Supreme Court mandated the enforcement of desegregation in Green vs. County School Board and diverse classrooms really started to become reality.   Clinton, however, bookended the 1960s as the point of comparison and her claim doesn’t hold true for the better part of the decade. Jim Crow laws were still in place until the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and despite the Brown decision, most black students in the South still didn’t attend white schools,""the kind of schools that provided strong potential opportunities for diverse learning experiences,"" according to the study. In 1967, one in 100 black students went to a white school. In 1960, it was one in 1,000. ""It’s true that segregation for blacks is worse today than it was in 1968, but it’s certainly not worse than 1964 and before,"" said Gary Orfield, a UCLA professor of education and lead author of the study Clinton cited. Even if we take 1968 to represent the 1960s, Clinton’s claim has issues if we look at different ways of measuring segregation. The UCLA report also considers how many black students are isolated in overwhelmingly black schools. Across the United States, fewer black students attend these schools now than they did in 1968 (four in 10 versus six in 10), signalling a decline in segregation. A separate study by Charles Clotfelter, a professor of public policy and economics at Duke University, measured the potential for black and white students to interact. According to that data, segregation has been declining since the 1970s, albeit at a slower rate in the past decade. Rainbows here, black and white there Clinton’s blanket statement also leaves out regional and demographic nuances in the UCLA study. According to that data, the South is now the least racially divided region in the United States when it comes to school segregation, and no state in Dixie is among the top five most segregated by any yardstick. For example, a third of black students are isolated in black schools in the South, compared to half of black students in the Northeast and 40 percent on average. How did the South surpass the rest of the nation in diversity? It’s a mixture of the judicial mandates in the 1960s and modern geography. ""The South is really the only place where we seriously enforced desegregation,"" said Orfield, the lead author of the UCLA study. ""Large school jurisdictions,"" added Clotfelter, the Duke professor. ""That means that it's not possible to slice up into such small bits, like a metropolitan area where the districts dramatically differ."" In contrast, the densely populated cities of the Northeast and West are becoming more and more segregated. On the Pacific coast, Clinton’s claim is on the money: Latino students are now more isolated than black students and ""more segregated than they’ve ever been,"" according to Orfield. ""Latinos have increased more than five times over in the number of students since the 1960s,"" he said. ""Demographics is the largest factor (in their segregation) but there’s a lot of history as well. There was never was much of a desegregation effort for Latinos."" Two steps forward, one step back Clinton does have a strong point that American schools have relapsed into monochrome. Classrooms were the most diverse from the 1970s through the early 1990s. At peak integration, four out of 10 black southern students attended a white school, while less than a third of all black students attended black schools. ""We’ve lost a lot of the progress we gained, no doubt about that,"" Clotfelter said. Experts say the backslide was the consequence of a series of judicial decisions, beginning with Milliken vs. Bradley in 1974, a relatively unheard of but seminal case in the desegregation saga. Criticized by some as ""one of the worst Supreme Court decisions"" ever, Milliken dealt with Detroit’s plan to integrate students by busing them from the intercity to the suburbs. The court ruled that such a plan was unconstitutional, arguing that black students had the right to attend integrated schools within their own school district, but were not protected from de facto segregation. ""That decision … said the racial disparities across districts would remain outside the reach of policymakers,"" Clotfelter wrote in piece exploring the impact of Milliken. ""The maximum amount of interracial contact one could strive for, then, would be limited by the two remaining factors: balkanization of jurisdictions and household choices about where to live."" Court-mandated desegregation was dealt its own deadly blow by three rulings from the Supreme Court between 1991 and 1995. According to the court, integration was only a temporary federal policy and after the historical imbalance was righted, school districts should reclaim local control and were released from desegregation orders. Since then, school segregation has been intrinsically tied to the racial gaps in housing and income, leading to the re-emergence of the color line. Economic segregation, which disproportionately affects black and Latino students, is increasing, pointed out Orfield. He noted that in California, Asian and white students are 10 times more likely to go to a high-quality school than Latinos and therefore dramatically more likely to attend college. ""We’ve lost something very vital,"" he said. ""Inequality is very related to the double segregation of low-income racial minorities and (their) isolation from the middle class, from the best teachers, the best curriculum. That has become very profound."" Our ruling Hillary Clinton said, ""In America today, our schools are more segregated than they were in the 1960s."" Overall, experts say and the data shows that the United States has taken two steps forward and one step back, but hasn’t quite reverted to pre-Civil Rights levels of segregation. Clinton would have been more accurate setting her time frame a little later. But she has a strong point that the country has fallen back from the high levels of diversity that existed from the 1970s to the early 1990s. On the whole, we rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B0AD00>],/factchecks/2015/jun/25/hillary-clinton/american-schools-are-more-segregated-they-were-196/

How many hate crimes are there in the United States each year?
","After the Charleston church shooting, residents of the South Carolina city came together to rally behind the families of the nine victims. One notable moment came during suspect Dylann Roof’s arraignment, when a relative of one of the dead told him, ""You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people. But God forgives you. I forgive you."" Some pundits see the response as proof that race relations in the United States are improving; others are more skeptical, with many pointing out that the number of hate crimes committed has remained stubbornly steady and worryingly high. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks falls firmly into the latter category. ""The level of hate crimes in this country has remained constant over years,"" he said on Face the Nation. ""We have to allocate resources to address these hate groups and these hate crimes. The fact of the matter is, the Justice Department underestimates the degree of hate crimes in this country because they have to rely on self-reporting. That is a challenge. And the fact that we have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year is unconscionable and inconsistent with our values as Americans."" Brooks’ claim about the number of hate crimes surprised us, so we decided to see if we could confirm the number. Conflicting collections Written for the purpose of collecting statistics on the phenomenon, the Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as ""crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity."" There are two main programs for data collection on hate crimes in the United States. The first is the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, known as UCR, which aggregates voluntary data from law enforcement agencies around the country. The agencies reported 5,796 hate crime incidents for 2012, much lower than the amount Brooks claimed. But the UCR program relies solely on crimes that are reported to the police. In an attempt to account for crimes not reported to the police, the federal government instituted the National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973. This household survey, currently conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, asks nearly 160,000 people annually whether or not they have been the victims of crime. In 2012, the survey estimated that 293,800 hate crime victimizations occurred, well in line with Brooks’ statement. So, what accounts for this surprising discrepancy? For one, the two methods simply approach the problem differently. The FBI program asks the police to report the number of hate crimes they have logged in a year, while the survey asks possible victims if they have experienced a hate crime. Beyond that, however, there are serious questions about how the methodology of each study affects its results. To begin with, the UCR program is generally considered highly susceptible to underreporting as a result of agency non-participation. ""There is a structural and institutional problem, which is that a lot of agencies aren’t participating,"" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. ""For instance, states with the highest percentage of African-Americans are participating least in the program, but 31.3 percent of victims are African-American. They’re the single largest group victimized."" Levin also cited the unbelievably low numbers of reported hate crimes in states such as Alabama (six) and Mississippi (four) as proof that agencies frequently fail to aggregate and report the number of hate crime incidents they process. The FBI’s participation rates further corroborate Levin’s assertion. The Anti-Defamation League compiled a table from the FBI data showing that in 2013 there were 85 cities with populations greater than 100,000 that either reported no hate crimes, or failed to report at all: notable cities on the list include Miami, Tulsa, Tampa, and Honolulu. (Hawaii’s police agencies have not reported a single incident in the past two years.) Furthermore, local police officers may be incapable of properly identifying hate crimes when they are reported to them. A study on crime classification errors by James Nolan of West Virginia University found that officers undercounted hate crimes by 67 percent. Finally, experts told us some victims are reluctant to report incidents to the police. Immigrants, for example, can oftentimes perceive the language barrier as insurmountable, while other victims have grown up in an environment where reporting a crime to the police is not socially acceptable. For its part, the National Crime Victimization Survey avoids many of these issues, since it simply asks victims of a crime whether or not they think they were targeted because of bias related to their membership in a protected category (those listed in the law). On the other hand, that means the survey may overcount the incidence of hate crimes; Levin suggests that respondents ""might be reporting biased incidents that aren’t crimes, or crimes that they think are prejudice-related but aren’t."" Nevertheless, the general consensus among experts is that the survey numbers come much closer to telling the truth than the FBI reports. Our ruling Brooks said, ""We have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year."" Looking at the National Crime Victimization Survey does confirm his claim, with a 2012 report finding nearly 300,000 estimated victims of hate crime. And while the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, an alternative method of data collection on hate crime, only found around 6,000 reported hate crimes in 2012, experts said it’s widely accepted that crimes are underreported with this method, mainly because of police non-participation and miscategorization. Admittedly, the survey does carry its own flaws related to possible overcounting, but experts tend to agree that it comes closer to accurately estimating the total number of hate crimes.

Stanley McChrystal: ISIS reaches 100 million people a day through social media campaign
","We’ve analyzed ISIS’s infamous ability to reach people on social media before, and found the claim that ISIS posts 90,000 social media messages each day to be Mostly True. Retired U.S. Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal upped the ante recently on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show.   McChrystal, former commander of the U.S. and International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan appeared on Hewitt’s show to discuss his new book, Team of Teams: New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World. At one point, McChrystal talked about the successes of ISIS's strategy. ""ISIS, I think, is a 21st Century manifestation of information technology. Think about their agility on the battlefield … but think about how many people they influence every day with their information operations. They reach about 100 million people a day through various things. They only have (to) recruit a tiny percentage of those to have a real impact."" 100 million people? That’s more than the population of Germany. On a daily basis. PunditFact attempted to reach McChrystal through his book publisher, his consultancy and through Twitter but did not hear back. However, according to experts, 100 million seems to be giving ISIS a little too much credit. Earlier this year, PunditFact reached out to J.M Berger, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution, to comment on ISIS’s Twitter posts. During that interview, Berger referenced a study he and his colleague, Jonathon Morgan, had been working on. Since then, the full study has been published. In the ISIS Twitter Census, Berger and Morgan uncovered an estimated 46,000 Twitter accounts tied to ISIS supporters. These accounts were found in a time period from September to December 2014. The study also includes that each account had an average of 1,004 followers. In PunditFact’s previous article, Berger placed the estimated total number of tweets per day at about 200,000 (including retweets). In theory, if ISIS-backed accounts sent up to 200,000 tweets a day, and each went to 1,000 people, that would be more than 200 million people reached. But that’s not how it works. For starters, many of the followers overlap. Second, just because someone posts a tweet doesn’t mean it reaches every follower. Lastly, Twitter has been trying to identify and suspend ISIS-supported accounts. The New York Times reported in April that Twitter had suspended 10,000 ISIS accounts ""for tweeting violent threats."" ""A whole lot of those followers overlap, so you can't draw a really reliable conclusion,"" Berger said. ""Also that data is from October, and tens of thousands of accounts have been suspended since then. The numbers are wildly different now."" VOICES from the Blogs, a spin-off of the University of Milan, also confirms this. In its study, Luigi Curini, associate professor of political science, Stefano M. Iacus, professor of probability and mathematical statistics and Andrea Ceron, assistant professor of political science, have tracked ""the aggregate level (of) sentiment toward ISIS by monitoring (Twitter) posts written in Arabic language."" ""Assuming that the followers of each ISIS Twitter account are completely unrelated to each other ... is quite unrealistic,"" said Curini. Curini also pointed to the importance of considering the content of the tweets issued by these accounts. ""Some of those tweets are jokes, personal conversations, or contain content that does not express any opinion. That is, not all the 100,000 to 200,000 tweets per day on average are tweets of ‘ISIS propaganda.’ "" Berger also acknowledges that not all tweets influence people. He describes a metric called ""impressions,"" which are a count of ""how many people have a message cross their timeline or how many times a message is otherwise seen or glimpsed. ""It is feasible that ISIS could rack up to 100 million impressions a day, but it's not certain. … Scoring an impression is not the same thing as reaching or influencing an audience member,"" Berger said, ""but impressions are how people discover content, so they do count for something. But not necessarily a one-to-one impact; impressions can include the same person returning to content repeatedly."" So not only do followers’ accounts overlap, but the content of messages might not even leave an impact the user who sees it. McChrystal, in his quotation, seemed to be talking about the actual influence ISIS exerts via social media. But what about other social media accounts? ""ISIS has a presence on virtually every social media network that is worth having a presence on, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, VKontakte and Google Plus, in significant numbers. They even pop up with the occasional odd account on LinkedIn,"" said Berger. Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be data available yet to measure just how much of an impact ISIS has on these other sites. ""Getting data on the presence of ISIS supporters on other social networks is for a number of reasons more complex,"" said Curini. ""According to our monitoring (of Arabic public profiles), Twitter weights between 80 percent to 90 percent of the total presence of ISIS discussion on the net. And we also know that on the other channels on the net, the average support for ISIS is considerably less than on Twitter."" Our ruling McChrystal said ISIS reaches ""about 100 million people a day through various things."" ISIS certainly has taken its war to social media, and experts agree that their strategy has some bite. But saying ISIS social media posts reach 100 million people a day is, at best, a high-end guesstimate, researchers say. And there are lots of caveats to consider. Thousands of ISIS social media accounts have been shut down in recent months. Followers of ISIS accounts often overlap. And not all the messages sent actually reach every follower, or leave a lasting impression. McChrystal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FD4DC0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/25/stanley-mcchrystal/stanley-mcchrystal-isis-reaches-100-million-people/
