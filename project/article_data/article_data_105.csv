Rick Perry says ""Romneycare was model for Obamacare""
","
 While Texas Gov. Rick Perry was debating rivals for the Republican presidential nomination on Oct. 11, his campaign was righting ""wrongs"" uttered by the other candidates through a Twitter account called ""PerryTruthTeam."" 
During the debate, PerryTruthTeam sent out a familiar message: ""Romneycare was model for Obamacare."" 
The Perry campaign has hit that idea hard. On Oct. 10, Perry posted an online video linking the health care plan that Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, signed in 2006 for his state (dubbed Romneycare by critics) and the one that President Barack Obama signed in 2010 for the country (dubbed Obamacare by critics). 
We checked whether the Perry campaign’s five-word tweet was on the mark. 
Perry’s tweet implies that the White House used the Massachusetts law to build its own national law. We’ll begin our examination by noting that even if you’re just looking at the two laws from the outside, without knowing any behind-the-scenes information, they seem pretty similar. 
Generally, both laws leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance for some workers and their families, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. Also, both laws require people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" Both laws also seek to reduce the number of people without health insurance by expanding Medicaid and offering tax breaks to help moderate-income people buy insurance. Finally, companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business. 
Some other shared elements:
    • Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans provide for voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.   
    • Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, the subsidies flow to adults living at 150 percent to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, depending on their household size. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the poverty level. 
Still, there remain differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law. Two of the biggest:   
    • Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to private insurance plans offered through Medicare, known as Medicare Advantage plans. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue.   
    • Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drug makers, medical device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do these things. 
So, the laws, while not identical, share many core elements. Next, we wondered if the federal law was indeed based on the Massachusetts law. 
Again, it’s difficult to know what people in Congress and in the White House looked at as they drafted the final health care law. But according to independent reports, they consulted people who worked on the Massachusetts law. 
On its website, the Perry campaign pointed to an NBC News news story published online Oct. 11, 2011, under the headline ""White House used Mitt Romney health-care law as blueprint for federal law."" The report refers to White House visitor logs showing that three health care advisers and experts ""who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in 2006"" had a dozen meetings with senior White House officials in 2009, including one with the president. 
One of the experts, Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News that ""the White House wanted to lean a lot on what we’d done in Massachusetts."" 
""They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model,"" Gruber said. 
Gruber received a $380,000 contract from the Obama administration in 2009 to help Congress draft the federal health care law based on the Massachusetts plan, according to the story. He earlier had been hired by the Romney administration to do computer modeling of the costs of various approaches to expanding health-care coverage, the story said. 
Gruber’s biography on the MIT website says he ""was a key architect of Massachusetts’ ambitious health reform effort and in 2006 became an inaugural member of the Health Connector Board, the main implementing body for that effort."" 
Romney, asked at an Oct. 11 news conference about the NBC report that three of his ""aides"" had advised Obama on health care, disputed that characterization of the experts, saying they were ""consultants,"" not ""aides."" 
""I’m sure the president got lots of ideas (on health care reform),"" Romney said, ""but the one person he should have talked to, that he never talked to, was me."" Romney said he would have told Obama that ""the plan he was crafting wouldn’t work"" because the nation couldn’t afford more federal spending. And he said that if he were elected president, he would push for the repeal of the federal health care law. 
Romney’s campaign has also played down Gruber’s influence, telling Politico for an Oct. 11 news story that he was not an adviser to Romney and that Romney’s administration hired him only to run econometric models. However, the Politico story also says that ""it is well known that Obama’s health care plan was in part modeled after Romney’s 2006 reforms."" 
We also reviewed an article in the June 6, 2011, New Yorker magazine on the development of the Massachusetts and federal health care laws. 
Like the NBC News piece, the New Yorker article notes that people who worked on the Massachusetts law were also consulted by the White House. One was Jon Kingsdale, a former insurance executive whom Romney had hired to implement the Massachusetts law, according to the article. ""The policy in Massachusetts was real,"" Kingsdale told the New Yorker. ""We were very, very influential. I testified a lot. The congressional staffers would constantly ask, ‘Well, how do you handle this? How do you handle that?’ We were the go-to people."" 
The article also describes a meeting in 2008, before Obama had decided to support an individual federal mandate, that was attended by people who would later become ""the key brokers"" of the final deal on the federal health care law in 2010. Among those organizing the meeting was John McDonough — a Massachusetts advocate for universal health care during Romney’s governorship who had since been hired by U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. 
During the development of the Massachusetts law, McDonough ""was named by Romney aides as a ‘stakeholder’ to represent consumer interests,"" according to the NBC News article. 
At the October 2008 meeting, McDonough laid out three health care policy options that the next president could adopt, one of which he called ""Massachusetts Avenue"" and was based on Romney’s plan, the New Yorker article says. Fifteen of the 20 people at the meeting — representatives from hospital associations, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, the labor movement and groups advocating universal health care — backed the ""Massachusetts"" option, the article says. 
The following year, Obama health care adviser Nancy-Ann DeParle sent a memo to the president recommending that he support a mandate like the one in Massachusetts, according to the New Yorker article. A few weeks later, Obama told congressional leaders he would back a requirement that every American buy health insurance. 
Finally, it’s important to note that some of the key ideas in the federal law had been circulating before the Massachusetts law was written. For example, scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven — an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations — with popularizing the idea of health insurance exchanges as many as three decades ago. 
And at least one previous Republican proposal on health care has included an individual mandate, a plan put forward by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., during the Clinton administration’s unsuccessful push for universal coverage in the early 1990s. 
So, what of Perry’s tweet? 
Although the federal law isn’t an exact replica of the one in Massachusetts, the plan signed by Romney certainly served as a model.

"['Oregon', 'City Government', 'Water', 'Eileen Brady']","
Eileen Brady says that because of Portland City Hall ‘inaction,’ we may need to spend $500 million to cover and treat our drinking water
","
In announcing her campaign for Portland mayor, Eileen Brady called out City Hall for its lack of leadership in fighting a controversial federal mandate to treat Portland’s drinking water.

""Many people I’ve talked to are angry that because of City Hall inaction we may have to spend a needless $500 million to cover and treat our pure drinking water,"" she said in a kick-off speech posted on her campaign website.

Longtime critics who love Portland’s drinking water just the way it is have complained for years about commissioners’ seeming inability to protect Bull Run water from the heavy bureaucratic hand of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Brady is one of those people. So we can see where she might be less than impressed with City Hall’s response to the EPA. But is it accurate to characterize what’s happened in Portland as ""inaction""?

Let’s recap: In 1993, scores of people in Wisconsin died from a cryptosporidium outbreak from their drinking water. In response, the federal government began drafting new regulations, releasing the rule in 2006. The rule required the city of Portland to cover its open-air water reservoirs and to treat its drinking water.

The city filed a lawsuit in federal court. The court dismissed the challenge in 2007.

In addition, the City Council passed a resolution promising to seek alternatives to the rule. They met with or contacted EPA officials seeking outs for the city. Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees the bureau, said he talked to Oregon’s federal delegation, only to be told that there was slim hope of legislative relief.

So Portland wasn’t storming the gates in Washington, D.C., but that didn’t sound like ""inaction"" to us. We turned to Brady.

She said that she didn’t mean inaction as in no action. She meant inaction as in not enough action to shield Portland’s ""elegant"" drinking water.

""Our ratepayers are going to have to pick up the bill for a $400 million project that we probably could have worked more aggressively to find alternatives for,"" Brady said, referring to the amount of money needed to replace five open-air drinking water reservoirs at Mount Tabor and Washington parks with covered storage. (The other $100 million is to build a UV treatment plant.)

Brady wants Portland to be like Rochester, N.Y., which spent a mere $9 million on compact treatment plants allowing the city to preserve two open reservoirs. New York City won a reprieve on a $1.6 billion cover until 2028. Portland’s Water Bureau says our system is too old and too different to compare with other cities. That’s beside the point for Brady.    

""Portland could have taken the same aggressive stance that New York did, which was to provide a significant case as to why this was unduly burdensome,"" she said. ""They made the case that Portland could have made had we been proactive about it.""

This summer, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained about the rule’s one-size-fits-all nature and asked the agency to review. Surprisingly, EPA agreed. Leonard requested the Oregon’s delegation’s help in finding out how an EPA reconsideration could affect Portland. (Apparently we were Portland polite; they were New York loud.)

We asked state Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Ore., for her take on the issue. She represents the east Portland neighborhoods that have been the most vocal about leaving the water alone. Has the city been on the inactive side of the equation? ""It’s not as black and white. I think there was a feeling initially that we’ve done everything we can, and now"" after Schumer’s intervention, she said, ""I think the city is pushing really hard.""

Portland has spent about $1.2 million on the legal challenge, and nearly $1.4 million to date to get a variance on the treatment portion. In December 2009, the EPA denied the city’s request for a variance for the reservoirs.

We understand that Brady is running for office, and that she made a politically charged statement in a campaign speech. Had Brady said City Hall had done a lousy job fighting the federal government, we would not have troubled ourselves. Had she said that City Hall had been ineffective on this issue, we would have stayed away.

But she called it ""City Hall inaction"" and to the average person, that is not accurate. The city sued. City officials met with and sought answers of federal bureaucrats, and they sought help from the congressional delegation. The statement is False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/21/eileen-brady/eileen-brady-says-because-portland-city-hall-inact/

Obama says his payroll tax cut would mean ""$1,500 in your pocket""
","
President Barack Obama barnstormed Virginia this week, hoping to galvanize support for his proposals to create jobs and further cut payroll taxes.

""What we are proposing,"" he told an estimated crowd of 1,300 at a high school in Emporia, ""is that the payroll tax we passed in December gets extended, gets expanded, and that will mean an extra $1,500 in your pockets compared to if we do nothing.""

An extra $1,500 could come in handy. So we decided check out the president’s statement.

First, a little background. The payroll tax is a federal levy taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It’s mainly used to fund Social Security and Medicare.

For two decades, the payroll tax meant a 6.2 percent deduction on annual earnings for most workers. There were limits to the total amount individuals could be required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share.

Last December, the levy was cut to 4.2 percent for workers as part of an agreement Obama worked out with Congress to extend income tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration that critics say favors high earners. The payroll tax reduction is in effect for the duration of 2011.

Last month, Obama proposed slicing the payroll to 3.1 percent for workers next year as part of a $447 billion bill to spur to spur the economy called the American Jobs Act. To help employers, the president also proposed a 50 percent tax cut in the first $5 million of payroll costs for most small businesses.

Obama is accusing congressional Republicans of blocking his package, which would be paid for by increasing taxes on people earning more than $1 million a year. He has vowed to pull out proposals in the Jobs Act -- including the payroll tax reduction -- and send them to Congress as individual bills.

Now, let’s look into Obama’s statement that his payroll tax cut ""would put an extra $1,500 in your pocket.""

We can do  a rough assessment with some basic math. Our calculations will be based on median income -- the income level that’s exactly in the middle when all incomes are ranked from smallest to largest -- because, unlike the mean (or average), it’s not significantly influenced by a small number of very high earners.

The median U.S. household income in 2010 -- the most recent year available -- was $49,445. Reducing payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent would mean a $1,533 savings next year compared to the levy they paid in 2010, when there was a 6.2 percent rate. That’s a little bit higher than the president’s estimate.

The savings would be greater in Virginia, where the median household income in 2010 was $60,363. Such a family would pay $1,871 less next year than they did in 2010.

If Congress doesn’t act on the payroll tax, then, as Obama noted, the rate will return to 6.2 next year.

Now that we’ve made our computations, we’ll note two reasons why they’re imperfect.

First, not all income is subject to the payroll tax, including interest income, dividends, capital gains, inheritances and Social Security benefits.

Second, not all households include people who are working, and therefore, not all qualify for a payroll tax cut. This includes individuals and couples who are unemployed or retired.

To gauge the impact of these factors, we turned to estimates by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. It concluded that the average national benefit for households that qualify for this year’s payroll tax cut, with rates set at 4.2 percent, is $934. The center did not do computations for Virginia.

Robertson Williams, an economist with the center, told us the average national savings would increase to $1,446 per qualified household if the rate is dropped to 3.1 percent next year.

According to the center, just under 78 percent of households -- are subject to payroll taxes and eligible for relief. The remaining 22 percent would see no benefit at all.

""I think the president’s figures are reasonable,"" Williams said.

Our ruling:

Obama said this proposed payroll tax cut ""will mean an extra $1,500 in your pocket.""

Since early September, he’s been using that number to describe average national savings for households that pay the levy. An economist at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center computes the actual savings would be $1,446.

Of course, Obama was speaking to a crowd in Virginia, where incomes are higher than the national average and the savings from a payroll tax cut would be greater. The president’s statement is certainly in the ballpark and we rate it True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/21/barack-obama/obama-says-his-payroll-tax-cut-would-mean-1500-you/

Chris Christie says “Jersey Shore” cast members are from New York
","
The cast members of the ""Jersey Shore"" may live by three words -- gym, tan, laundry -- but Chris Christie has just one to describe their show: bad.

The New Jersey governor in a recent radio interview slammed the MTV show, repeating one of his favorite criticisms of its cast. The roommates in the Seaside Heights beach house aren’t from New Jersey.

""Here's the deal, let's remember something for the people who are listening in your audience, these 'Jersey Shore' folks, they're from New York,"" Christie said Wednesday on 77 WABC’s ‘The Joe Crummey Show’. ""They parachute these New Yorkers into Seaside Heights, New Jersey, and they try to make the whole country think this is New Jersey. It's not. It's bad for New Jersey. It's bad ... because it's a mischaracterization of who the people are here in New Jersey and so I've said all along that I think ‘Jersey Shore’ is bad.""

Christie last month vetoed a $420,000 tax credit -- dubbed the ""Snooki subsidy"" -- for the MTV show, saying the program ""does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the State and its citizens.""

There are eight fist-pumping housemates who are the target of Christie’s scorn.

Of them, two are New Jersey natives, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Samantha Giancola, or Sammi, and Deena Nicole Cortese were born and raised in New Jersey. Giancola hails from Hazlet and attended William Paterson University, where she was a midfielder on the women’s soccer team.

Cortese is from New Egypt and attended Brookdale Community College in Lincroft. She joined the cast in season three, replacing Staten Island, N.Y.-native Angelina Pivarnick.

Five of the six other cast members are New York natives.

Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino was born in Staten Island but grew up in Manalapan. His publicist said Sorrentino still lives in New Jersey, but he also conducts business in Miami. Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley also grew up in New York, but now lives within Jersey’s borders, according to an MTV spokesperson.

Vinny Guadagnino, Ronnie Magro and Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi are from New York. Rhode Island-native Paul DelVecchio is the only cast member from outside the tri-state area.

An MTV spokesperson declined to comment on Christie’s remarks. But Polizzi spoke with The Star-Ledger in August.

""It’s the 'Jersey Shore.' We’re not trying to represent Jersey,"" she said then. ""Even if you’re from Africa, you’re gonna come here.""

Our ruling

The governor said the cast members of the ""Jersey Shore"" are from New York and misrepresent ""who the people are here in New Jersey.""

Sammi and Deena are true Jersey girls -- born and raised. ""The Situation"" was born in New York, but grew up and still lives in New Jersey. We think he deserves some Jersey cred.

Four New Yorkers -- one of whom, ""JWoww,""  has since moved to New Jersey -- and a Rhode Island-native round out the rest of the crew.

Kent: Immigration board can prosecute with Attorney General's help
","
Critics of conservative activist Phil Kent have accused him of being a ""nativist."" Now that Gov. Nathan Deal has appointed Kent to a new board to crack down on illegal immigration, critics say he’s distorting the truth.

They point to a speech Kent made before the North Fulton and Friends Tea Party on Oct. 4 where he explained the authority of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board. The state General Assembly created it when lawmakers passed House Bill 87, legislation that aims to get tough on illegal immigration.

Kent’s appointment to the board created controversy. The Anti-Defamation League asked Deal to reconsider Kent's appointment, saying he has a history of making ""deeply disturbing"" comments about immigrants. Kent said his critics are left-wing extremists pushing their own agenda.

Kent told the tea party group that all the review board does is take complaints about possible violations of state laws on immigration. The board can subpoena witnesses, hold hearings and review or investigate possible violators.  

""And yes we can actually prosecute, and get them into jail, if we bring in the attorney general,"" Kent said.  ""That’s what the open borders, anti-enforcement people don’t like.""

Immigrant rights activist Erik Voss, who videotaped the speech, cried foul. The review board has no authority to bring in the attorney general, much less prosecute or jail violators, he told PolitiFact Georgia.

We thought Kent’s statement was worth a closer look. Can the immigration board call in the attorney general’s office and prosecute?

We looked into the law. The Immigration Enforcement Review Board was created by Section 20 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011, also known as House Bill 87.  

The seven-member review board fields complaints that Georgia governments or agencies have violated any of three state laws. One bans them from establishing policies that give illegal immigrants safe harbor. A second requires them to check the legal status of applicants for public benefits such as food stamps. The third mandates that their contractors and subcontractors file affidavits saying they use a federal database that checks whether employees are in the U.S. legally.

Some of the violations the board has the authority to investigate can be considered criminal offenses.

Agency workers who purposefully violate the law requiring them to check the legal status of those seeking public benefits commit a misdemeanor, and the attorney general has the authority to investigate. Those who knowingly file false affidavits about their use of the federal database violate felony fraud laws.   

Local governments that give safe harbor or sanctuary to illegal immigrants risk losing state funding. The board can issue sanctions such as fines as high as $5,000 if a local government doesn’t fix its problems by deadline.

The section of HB 87 that established the immigration board makes no mention of bringing in or collaborating with the attorney general’s office, except to say that the law does not prohibit the state’s top lawyer from ""seeking any other remedy available by law.""  

We asked the state attorney general’s office for its understanding of the law. A spokeswoman said that the immigration board has civil enforcement authority, while the attorney general has the power to prosecute violators criminally. The immigration board can make recommendations to the attorney general’s office, which will decide whether criminal prosecution is appropriate.

The Association County Commissioners of Georgia and the Georgia Municipal Association, interest groups that represent local and county governments, have the same understanding of the immigration board’s powers.  

Kent told us that’s how he understands the law, too. If activists think he’s saying that the board has the power to criminally prosecute violators on its own, they’re twisting his words, said Kent, who is national spokesman for Americans for Immigration Control.  

""The panel could most certainly, if it felt warranted, ‘bring in the attorney general’ and recommend his office open an investigation with an eye toward prosecution,"" Kent said in an email.

Anyone has the power to tell the attorney general of a possible violation of the law, he told us in a telephone interview. ""The board can’t do it alone, obviously,"" Kent said.

We agree, but that’s not what Kent originally said.

Kent said that the board ""can actually prosecute"" violators, and ""get them into jail,"" if it enlists the help of the attorney general’s office.

Actually, the board cannot prosecute anyone or get them into jail.  

The board can bring a potential violation to the attorney general’s attention. So can any citizen. That doesn’t mean his office will investigate, much less prosecute.

Kent may have meant to convey that the Immigration Enforcement Review Board can only recommend that the attorney general open an investigation, but he gave the impression it has far more power than that. He therefore earns a False.",/factchecks/2011/oct/21/phil-kent/kent-immigration-board-can-prosecute-attorney-gene/

Dennis Kucinich says 57% of registered Dems in the new 9th District are from his old district
","
Slow population growth over the past decade has cost Ohio two of its 18 congressional seats this year to areas with faster growth. 

It’s the state legislature’s job to draw boundaries for the congressional districts, and  Republicans, who control both houses of the General Assembly, have approved a new district map. 

That map -- currently under challenge by Democrats -- would likely force a primary contest between Ohio’s longest-serving Democratic members of Congress: Toledo’s Marcy Kaptur and Cleveland’s Dennis Kucinich. 

Kaptur and Kucinich both live in a newly drawn 9th District that stretches from Lucas County along Lake Erie into Western Cleveland. The district is comprised of parts of Kaptur’s old 9th District, Kucinich’s old 10th and the old 13th, now represented by Democrat Betty Sutton. (The new map parcels out Sutton’s old domain into five different districts. She has not said where she might run.) 

Kucinich had worried that his Ohio district would be zeroed out. He even explored running for Congress in Washington state, which is expected to have several open Democratic-leaning seats next year. But when the new map was unveiled, he dropped those discussions and sent his supporters a triumphant email headlined: ""We Have a District!""

""In a stunning development, the redistricting gave most of the Republican part of my old district to three incumbent Republican congressmen and left most of the Democratic part of my district intact,"" Kucinich’s email said. ""As a result, about 57 percent of registered Democrats in the new district come from my old district. With your help I clearly have a good chance to be able to continue to serve the people of Ohio.""

In subsequent interviews, such as one with Truthdig Radio, Kucinich ratcheted down his estimate of his current Democratic constituents that would be in the new district.

""So 54 percent of the registered Democrats from my district are in a new district, and 34 percent are from Ms. Kaptur’s district, and 12 percent from Ms. Sutton’s district,"" he told Truthdig on Oct. 6. ""At this point, it looks like I’m headed for a primary against my friend from Toledo, Marcy Kaptur.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Kucinich’s claim. 

Plain Dealer Data Analysis Editor Rich Exner examined precinct-level voting records from all three former congressional districts. He found that roughly 75,000 voters in the new district identify themselves as Democrats, and 32,000 as Republicans. Roughly 50 percent of those Democrats come from Kucinich’s old turf, while 26 percent come from Kaptur’s district, and 24 percent are from Sutton’s area. 

Kucinich spokesman Nathan White says that when initial descriptions of the new district filtered out around Sept. 9, Kucinich’s campaign came up with its 57 percent figure by comparing Census data from the cities and townships in the new district with Board of Elections data from all five counties. He said Kucinich’s Sept. 14 email stipulated that the 57 percent figure was an approximation. After the redistricting bill was introduced in Ohio’s legislature, Kucinich’s campaign reexamined the statistics and came up with a number closer to 54 percent. That’s why Kucinich used the lower number in subsequent interviews and discussions, said White.

""Further refinements of the Democratic registration would necessarily depend on splitting the Democratic registration in precincts, and at that point, it’s guess work,"" White said in an email. ""The fact remains that the majority of the registered Democrats in the new district come from Congressman Kucinich’s longtime Democratic base in Cuyahoga County, which is the point that the Congressman has been making.""

By our calculations, Kucinich overstated the percentage of Democratic voters from his old district that will carry over into the new one. But he is pretty close and he is correct that the largest portion of the new district’s registered Democrats are part of his old 10th District territory. 

Whether that gives him an advantage in a primary contest remains to be seen.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Kucinich’s claim rates Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/21/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-57-registered-dems-new-9th-di/

R.I. Rep. Edith Ajello says half of pregnancies in U.S. are unintended
","
In a recent Providence Journal commentary, Rhode Island Rep. Edith H. Ajello and Sen. Rhoda A. Perry argued for the need for better preventive medicine, including ""the full range of reproductive health care.""

Until this year, health insurers could limit or even deny coverage to pregnant women if the insurer determined the pregnancy amounted to a so-called preexisting health condition. But that changed in March with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s overhaul of the health-care system.

And in August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services adopted guidelines for women’s preventative preventive care that include coverage for contraception.

""It’s about time!"" the legislators wrote of that measure. ""Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.""

Nearly half? That caught our attention, so we decided to check it.  

First, some background.  

In their commentary piece, they urged Rhode Island to support the creation of a health-insurance exchange, as all states are required to do under the Affordable Care Act.

The exchanges are intended to lower insurance costs by fostering competition among insurance providers.

In Rhode Island, legislation to create an exchange passed the Senate but died in a House committee. Perry cast one of six dissenting votes against the Senate bill, which had been amended to include a provision to prevent health insurers from using taxpayer money or subsidies to cover abortions. ( A House bill with no restrictions on abortion coverage was held for further study.)

Governor Lincoln Chafee issued an executive order in September to create an exchange.

Under the new federal rules, insurers will have to expand coverage for preventive care, including birth control. The expanded coverage is clearly a significant development if, as Ajello and Perry wrote, ""nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.""

So we asked the two lawmakers for their source in writing the piece.

The facts

Ajello directed us to The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization based in New York City, which does research and policy analysis about sexual and reproductive health.

The Guttmacher Institute has produced two studies about unintended pregnancies in the United States. The most recent, ""Unintended pregnancy in the United States: incidence and disparities, 2006’’ published in August 2011, states that  ""nearly half (49%) of pregnancies were unintended in 2006.""

The earlier study, ""Disparities in Rates of Unintended Pregnancy In the United States, 1994 and 2001,’’ also reported 49 percent of pregnancies in 2001 were unintended, a level unchanged from 1994.

The studies define an unintended pregnancy as one in which the pregnancy was either ""mistimed,"" meaning the woman did not want the pregnancy at the time of conception (even if she may have wanted to become pregnant at some future date), or which was ""unwanted,"" meaning that she did not want to become pregnant then or in the future.

(Unintended pregnancies are an important public health issue, the study says, because they are associated with ""a number of adverse maternal behaviors and child health outcomes, including inadequate or delayed initiation of prenatal care, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, premature birth and lack of breastfeeding, as well as negative physical and mental health effects on children."")

Of the 6.7 million pregnancies in the United States in 2006, about 3.2 million were unintended, the 2006 study reported. Of the 3.2 million, the study said, 29 percent were ""mistimed,"" and 19 percent -- or 608,000 -- were ""unwanted.""

The original study, as well as a footnote referencing the more recent one, were posted on the web site of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A CDC spokeswoman confirmed that the Guttmacher studies are based on data from the CDC’s National Survey of Family Growth, an ongoing survey of about 5,000 women each year whose responses are compiled in periodic reports that reflect the reproductive history of tens of thousands of women. The studies also rely on population data from the U.S. census.

Both studies reported that the share of total pregnancies that were ""unintended"" has remained unchanged at 49 percent.

Our ruling

Perry and Ajello stated that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Two studies based on data from the U.S. census and the CDC reported that the share of unintended pregnancies in the United States was 49 percent.

We rule this claim True.

Harry Reid says it's 'very clear that private sector jobs have been doing fine'
","
During an Oct. 19, 2011, floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., made the case for passing elements of President Barack Obama’s jobs agenda. He talked about recent patterns in job gains and losses. 
""The massive layoffs we have had in America today of course are rooted in the last administration,"" Reid said. ""It is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine. It is the public-sector jobs where we have lost huge numbers. That is what this legislation is all about."" 
We wondered whether Reid is right that ""it is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine."" 
We first turned to data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. 
We’ll start our analysis in June 2009, which represented the official end of the most recent recession -- the point at which job numbers typically begin to recover. 
Here are the net increases between June 2009 and September 2011 for three categories of jobs: 
Total jobs: increase of 841,000
Private-sector jobs: increase of 1,413,000
Government jobs: decrease of 572,000 
And here are the monthly averages for each category: 
Total jobs: increase of 30,035 per month
Private-sector jobs: increase of 50,464 per month
Government jobs: decrease of 20,428 per month 
Here are the same statistics for just the past year: 
Total jobs: increase of 1,319,000
Private-sector jobs: increase of 1,636,000
Government jobs: decrease of 317,000 
And here are the monthly averages for each category over the past year: 
Total jobs: increase of 109,917 per month
Private-sector jobs: increase of 136,333 per month
Government jobs: decrease of 26,417 per month 
So Reid is correct that the job growth in the private-sector has been much healthier than it’s been for government jobs. In fact, government jobs have actually decreased, becoming a consistent drag on the economy as a whole. 
But is the growth in the private-sector enough to bolster the economy? Many economists say no. -- that for the private-sector jobs to be ""doing fine,"" there would need to be more of them. 
Dean Baker, a liberal economist, estimates that the economy needs a net increase of 90,000 to 100,000 jobs a month simply to keep pace with population growth, based on extrapolations from Congressional Budget Office and BLS data. Factoring in the ongoing drag from government job losses, the economy is barely meeting that number over the past year, and is well below that number since the official beginning of the recovery in June 2009. 
Others put the monthly job gains needed to keep pace with population at 140,000 to 150,000. 
Still, even achieving that benchmark would essentially mean treading water, and ""doing fine"" would require more net jobs than that to be created every month. 
Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, checked the private-sector job creation numbers for the first 26 months after each of the last four recessions ended. He found that 1981-1982 recession was strongest, with an average increase of 289,000 per month. The recovery from the 1990-1991 recession was second strongest, at 76,300. The current recovery ranked third, with the post-2001 recovery actually losing jobs on average every month. 
In Burtless’ view, ""private-sector job growth falls far short of ‘doing fine,’"" especially given the size of private-sector job losses during the preceding recession -- nearly 8 million in 2008-2009. 
A Reid spokesman, Adam Jentleson, acknowledged that Reid’s statement ""could have been put more artfully."" He said Reid was trying contrast consistent job gains in the private-sector with consistent job losses in the public-sector. 
The comment, Jentleson said, was intended to rebut Republican claims that Democrats aren’t doing much to help private-sector job growth, when in fact the Obama jobs agenda includes multiple tax cuts for small businesses that are intended to spur growth. 
Our ruling 
We realize that Reid was taking some linguistic liberties, and we agree that he has a point that the biggest culprit in the anemic job market is the situation with government jobs, not private-sector jobs. 
Still, at PolitiFact, we often say that words matter, and the notion that ""private-sector jobs have been doing fine"" is not at all ""very clear,"" to use Reid’s characterization. Current levels of job growth are, at best, treading water, and perhaps not even that. For the economy to gain steam, it has to create, by some estimates, two to three times as many jobs per month as are currently being created. We rate Reid’s statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2011/oct/20/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-its-very-clear-private-sector-jobs/

Michele Bachmann links Obama relatives to immigration policy
","
It’s a time-honored tactic to bring up a political foe’s family foibles. Jimmy Carter’s alcoholic brother. Bill Clinton’s brother’s drug arrest.

Now the target is President Barack Obama and his Kenyan relatives, and the person taking aim is Michele Bachmann.

The Minnesota congresswoman who is running for president mentioned Obama’s family members in answering a question about immigration policy during a Republican primary debate.

""Well, I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama. It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens... who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal,"" Bachmann said, according to a transcript of the Oct. 18, 2011, debate.

Bachmann’s campaign didn’t respond when we asked what the basis was for this claim, but stories about Obama’s aunt and uncle have been in the news plenty this year.

In October 2008, the Boston Globe tracked down Zeituni Onyango, believed to be Obama’s paternal aunt, living in a public housing project. Obama’s presidential campaign soon confirmed their relationship. Onyango is the half-sister of Obama’s late father.

Then came the news, reported by the Associated Press, that Onyango had previously been ordered to leave the country by an immigration judge who denied her request, based on violence in her home country, for political asylum. That meant she was no longer in the U.S. legally. The Obama campaign responded that the candidate had no knowledge of Onyango’s immigration status.

Within days, Obama was elected president.

Onyango’s request for asylum was reopened in December 2008, and she won a 10-month reprieve. After several more court hearings, a judge granted her asylum in May 2010. The White House said it had not intervened in the case, while critics charged that such an outcome was rare for most illegal residents.

The Globe reported later that the judge had based his decision on the fact that Onyango’s immigration status had been leaked to the media, which exposed her to heightened threats of persecution in Kenya.

This year, it was an Obama uncle who made news.

Onyango Obama, the brother of Zeituni Onyango and the president’s late father, was arrested in August in Framingham, Mass., on a suspicion of drunk driving.

The Boston Globe, citing an arrest report, said Obama first told the officer he had not had anything to drink, then admitted to one beer and then to two beers. He failed three sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol level of .14, the paper said. The legal limit in Massachusetts is 0.08.

When offered a phone call, the paper quoted from the report that Obama replied, ""I think I’d like to call the White House.’’

He was also held on an immigration detainer. The Globe cited anonymous federal law enforcement sources who said immigration authorities discovered that Obama had been living and working in Massachusetts in violation of a 1992 deportation order. ""Uncle Omar,"" as the president knows him, first came to the U.S. in 1963 and enrolled in school in Cambridge, Mass., the Globe wrote.

After being held for about two weeks, the 67-year-old Obama was released from jail with little explanation from officials. A White House spokesman said the administration expected the case to be handled like any other and that the elder Obama would not receive any special help.

One of the elder Obama’s lawyers -- from the same firm who helped his sister -- said he planned to fight deportation.

""He's just been here for such a long period of time. He hasn't been to Kenya in forever. He was young when he came to the United States,"" attorney Scott Bratton told the Boston Globe.

Obama has pleaded not guilty in the drunken driving case, which is still pending.

Our ruling

Bachmann said, ""I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama. It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens... who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal.""

It’s true that the president’s aunt and uncle were both in the U.S. illegally at one time, But Zeituni Onyango was granted asylum in May 2010 and is no longer in the U.S. illegally.

Anti-gambling group says South Florida slots didn't meet $500 million tax revenue promise
","
Floridians have been duped by sky-high promises from the gambling industry in the past, says No Casinos. And that's why residents should be wary of any promises related to a new proposal for a massive casino in downtown Miami, suggests the group.

Resort operator Genting has proposed a $3 billion project on the current site of the Miami Herald that would include an 800,000-square-foot casino in addition to more than 50 restaurants and bars, hotel rooms, shops and other features. 

An Oct. 11, 2011, press release from No Casinos picks apart a bill in the works by two South Florida legislators -- Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, R-Fort Lauderdale, and Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami. The press release states that it's a myth that ""legalizing casino gambling will generate new tax revenue to meet important state needs…""

""In fact, the last time voters trusted gambling interests, they were promised $500 million per year for schools from taxes on slot machines in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. Promoters even signed a contract, saying that if the Legislature did not tax slot machines, they would cut a check directly to the school boards. So far, they have generated a paltry 20 percent of this figure – and recently they successfully lobbied the Legislature for a 30 percent reduction in their tax rate. Like the lottery, another promise broken.""

In this fact-check, we're not going to wade into whether casino gambling generates enough new tax revenue to meet the state's needs. Instead, we'll check what No Casinos calls a fact: that machine proponents promised ""$500 million per year"" for schools and only delivered about 20 percent of that.

The root of the $500 million figure 
In November 2004, voters statewide voted to allow Miami-Dade and Broward counties to put questions on the ballot about adding slot machines at facilities. The tax revenue from the machines would then go to schools statewide. On March 8, 2005, Broward voters approved the measure. Miami-Dade voters rejected slot machines in 2005 but approved them in 2008.

Then the Legislature, under the anti-gambling Gov. Jeb Bush, had to set the rules. The Legislature couldn't reach an agreement in the regular session and some GOP leaders, including Bush, talked about asking voters to repeal the amendment allowing slot machines. 

But in a special session in December 2005, the Legislature voted in favor of a bill that established the rules for slot machines.

The source of the $500 million figure comes from 2004, when the state was moving toward putting the question on the ballot. 

The state's Office of Economic and Demographic Research prepared an analysis of the revenue that would be generated from slot machines. State officials gathered information about slot machines in other states in addition to information from proponents. 

EDR wrote in a financial impact statement in 2004 that: ""If the Legislature also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from Miami-Dade and Broward counties combined would range from $200 million to $500 million annually."" A more detailed financial information statement from EDR stated that, ""It is estimated that by the third year of activity, the range of tax revenues raised would be from $250 million to $600 million, assuming that both counties pass the referenda, and that the Legislature taxes the activity at a typical tax rate between 30 percent and 50 percent...Should only Miami-Dade County pass the referendum, the estimated increase would be between $70 million and $200 million. If only Broward County passes the referendum, the estimated increase would be between $100 million and $300 million.""

That paragraph alone provides several warning signs: For starters, it explains that the tax revenues would hit the range of $250 million to $600 million by the third year. It also notes that revenues will be on the lower end if it only passed in one county. 
But gambling proponents often just used the higher figures in describing the financial benefit. 
Jim Horne, a former state education commissioner who became a consultant for a pro- slot-machine group, stated that the revenues would be ""roughly $500 million a year"" in a September 2005 Florida Times-Union article or in the Sun-Sentinel in 2004 ""$438 million after the first year alone."" 
A series of ads by pro-slots group Floridians for a Level Playing Field urging voters to support Amendment 4 also used the $500 million figure:

* This ad portrayed a woman as a school teacher saying ""Florida schools could get an extra $500 million a year.""

* This ad stated that the amendment ""could generate $500 million a year for all Florida schools"" from seven facilities.

* This ad stated that it was a fact that seven facilities ""could provide $500 million a year to supplement not replace school funding statewide.""

Some articles raised skepticism about the $500 million a year claim.

The Orlando Sentinel editorial board wrote Feb. 17, 2005 that although gambling interests said schools could reap up to $500 million, ""until the Legislature acts, those claims are pure fabrications.""

A St. Petersburg Times editorial on Feb. 22, 2005, stated that slots supporters were ""wildly"" promising up to $500 million for education ""In fact, nothing has been decided. If South Florida voters approve the referendum, the Legislature will determine how many slot machines are allowed, hours of operation, how much the gambling is taxed and how the revenue is distributed.""

The revenues that were actually generated 

The state's Department of Business and Professional Regulation tracks parimutuel revenues. The slot machine revenue is combined with net proceeds of the Florida Lottery and the Legislature annually appropriates the funds to education programs in school districts, state colleges and universities. 

Here is how much in net slot revenue (rounded) was actually transferred to the state Department of Education:

2006-07: $49.6 million (This wasn't a full year -- facilities opened part way through the year.)

2007-08: $120.6 million

2008-09: $103.8 million

2009-10: $138.1 million

2010-11: $125.1 million 

2011-12 (July - Oct. 2): $31.5 million 

The tax rate started at 50 percent but the Legislature approved dropping the rate to 35 percent starting July 1, 2010.

Looking at the first five years, the revenues add up to about $536.7 million -- or an average of $107.34 million per year. That's close to 20 percent of $500 million a year. If we discount that first year since the facilities were only operational part of the year and look at the next four years starting with 2007-08, it works out to about $122 million a year -- or about 24 percent of $500 million.

So what happened?

Dan Adkins, chairman of the Amendment 4 campaign Floridians for a Level Playing Field, and vice president of the parent company that owns Mardi Gras casino, told PolitiFact that the revenues were not as high as anticipated due to the tax rates, fees and restrictions set by the Legislature.

""Gov. Bush looked me in the eye and said 'you may have won a campaign. I'm going to make sure you fail,'"" Adkins said. ""The Legislature and the governor wanted us to fail and they were almost successful. ... We were smacked with every possible restriction you can have.""

Revenues also were lower because only five facilities opened, not the seven that were planned.

Adkins says slots proponents made a promise on a percentage -- that the parimutuels would provide 30 percent  of their gross revenues to local schools -- but not on actual dollars. ""How could you make a promise not knowing what the Legislature would do?"" Adkins said. ""That's why we entered an agreement based on the percentage."" 
But what about the repeated claims that the machines could generate $500 million? 
""We said under a 30 percent tax plan this is what we could generate based on two counties passing referendums and seven facilities under operation.""

Our ruling

No Casinos claimed that slot proponents promised the voters $500 million per year for schools and have generated a ""paltry 20 percent of that figure."" 

The ads that we saw stated that slot machines ""could"" generate $500 million a year. But at times Jim Horne, a key slots proponent, said it more strongly: ""we're talking roughly $500 million a year for our schools"" and ""Amendment 4 will inject public education with $438 million after the first year alone. This funding will increase to $2.3 billion over the next five years."" 

In reality, the amount of projected revenue at the time was more complicated and depended upon how many facilities added slots and whether it was in one or two counties and the rules set by the Legislature -- and proponents certainly didn't make those caveats clear in the ads we viewed although they did couch it with ""could."" The amount of revenue generated is about 20 percent a year of the $500 million. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/20/no-casinos/no-casinos-group-claims-slots-tax-revenues-are-pal/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Ryan says a 100 percent tax on millionaires would only fund government for four months
","
In the view of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the government should limit the subsidies given to the wealthy through Social Security and other entitlement programs.

But the House Budget Committee chairman is against slapping higher tax rates on millionaires -- the plan President Barack Obama and other Democrats are pushing in the name of tax fairness and deficit reduction. In early October, Senate Democrats backed the president’s 5.6 percent surcharge on income over $1 million.

Ryan argues some small businesses would get hurt by the approach because of the way they file taxes. And more taxes on the rich don’t add up to much when compared with the deficit and debt, Ryan said Oct. 9, 2011 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""

""If you took all the income from every millionaire in America today, it would run the government for about four months."" he said. ""I have a better idea. Instead of job-killing tax increases why don’t we just stop subsidizing wealthy people? Let’s go after the crony capitalism, the corporate welfare in the tax code, in spending. And why don’t we income adjust our spending programs so we don’t subsidize wealthy people as much? I think that’s a better idea to get more savings in the budget, and get our debt down without doing economic damage.""

That first sound bite -- discussing in hypothetical terms the impact of a 100 percent tax rate on people making $1 million a year -- drew some attention.

So we decided to take a look.

A critical bit of background: America’s millionaire-earners club has shrunk in size during hard times -- 235,000 tax returns listed adjusted gross income over $1 million in 2009, down 26 percent from the 320,000 a year earlier. (Editor's note: For clarity, we added the word ""earners"" to this paragraph. 10/21/2010)

So the year matters in Ryan’s comparison.

(PolitiFact Wisconsin has examined claims about the wealthy before. On March 10, 2011, we rated True a statement by liberal filmmaker Michael Moore that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Moore referred to net worth rather than income.)

We asked Ryan’s office for support for his claim, and were pointed to analyses by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization. Ryan based his math on one that used 2008 IRS numbers, while citing some arguments from another that was based on 2009 figures.

The 2009 data, which came out in summer 2011, is the latest available.

It shows $727 billion in income reported by the million-and-up set in 2009, based on the adjusted gross income line on the federal tax return.

In the same year, you could have run the $3.5 trillion federal government for about 2.5 months on that income, according to our calculations and those of the Tax Foundation’s David Logan, an economist whose work Ryan cited.

Ryan’s office said he was basing his statement on the now-outdated 2008 IRS data that showed about $1.07 trillion in income from people making more than $1 million. Run that into the $2.9 trillion federal budget for 2008 and you do get the four months Ryan mentioned.

(We found there’s another way to get to four months: Use a broader income measure favored by some researchers, including those at the Tax Policy Center, another Washington, D.C.-based research organization. That measure, though, goes beyond the ""adjusted gross income"" used on federal tax forms.)

So, settling the math:

By choosing 2008, Ryan was using outdated numbers … but also more conservative ones. His point would have been stronger with the new numbers, showing government could be run for an even shorter period.

Now, what about the way Ryan presents the statement?

Critics said Ryan’s quip falsely implied that some Democrat is actually proposing a 100% tax on millionaires to run the government.

We think that’s a bit too literal; Ryan is clearly raising a hypothetical to make a point. But what specific point was he trying to make?

Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert told us his point was that raising income taxes on higher-income earners ""would not address the federal government’s debt and deficits.""

Ryan uses a wildly hypothetical scenario. A 100 percent tax obviously would have negative effects and is a political non-starter.

But Ryan is using it to address a serious issue, so let’s take it at face value for a moment.

By our calculation, the U.S. government would have taken in $800 billion more in tax revenue if it had taxed people making more than $1 million at 100 percent, according to IRS data from 2008, the year Ryan used as his base point.

That doesn’t make much of dent in America’s $14 trillion debt, to be sure.

But if we’re talking about the deficit, which Ryan did on ""Meet the Press,"" that $800 billion would have wiped out the 2008 deficit -- with another $370 billion to spare.

Looked at that way, the number undermines Ryan’s larger point.

Our conclusion

Ryan conjures a hypothetical to make a point about the limits of taxation for budget savings, saying that that even a 100% tax on people making more than $1 million would run the government only for about four months.

He’s right, if you use slightly outdated data or adopt a measure that’s not as on point as the one he uses. Newer data tells a bit different story, even while somewhat bolstering Ryan’s point.

But he misfires in suggesting a limited budget impact from such a hypothetical tax. In the year he chose, the federal deficit would have been wiped out. So, Ryan is close to the mark on his math but the details work against his overall point.

U.S. Rep. James Langevin says foster children are more likely to be victims of identity theft
","
Real problem or not? That was the question we faced after we heard U.S. Rep. James Langevin (D-RI) speaking on the House floor about a proposal intended to protect foster children from identity theft.

""I, along with many others, was absolutely outraged to find that foster children are disproportionately victims of identity theft since their personal information passes through so many hands,"" Langevin said during a speech posted on YouTube on Sept. 21.

The bill, which has since become law and was the focus of a celebratory news conference Oct. 11, requires social service agencies to run a credit check on foster youth just before they become old enough to leave the system. The goal is to allow them to clear up any problems so they can begin their adult life free of identity problems such as fraudulent loans or credit card debt they know nothing about. The law also requires that they receive help in clearing up any credit problems.

But are children in state custody really more likely to be victimized?

The news release issued by Langevin's office linked to a report by the Children's Advocacy Institute at the University of San Diego School of Law, which bills itself as ""an academic, research, and advocacy law firm."" The 44-page report, called ""The Fleecing of Foster Children: How We Confiscate Their Assets and Undermine Their Financial Future,"" asserts in at least five places that identity theft is common, or a growing problem, or disproportionately affects foster children.

Then the report says, on the next-to-the-last page of the narrative: ""Currently, there is [sic] no available data on how many children have been affected by identity theft.""

If there are no data, how do you know if foster children are disproportionately affected?

Instead of offering real evidence, the report includes two footnotes citing one article in Newsweek magazine. It quotes the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego as saying that half of the 84,000 children in California's foster care system may have been victimized.

Newsweek also reported that the problem got so bad in California that the state passed a law in 2006 mandating credit checks for teens in its foster care system.

We called Langevin's office seeking data. We were sent links to other articles, some congressional testimony, accounts of individual cases of identity theft. All asserted that it was a big problem but none offered any reliable numbers. Many cited the Newsweek article as a  source.

When we called the Identity Theft Resource Center to ask how they know that half the foster children in California have been victimized, program director Karen Barney said the organization wishes the oft-cited article would just go away because the number is simply wrong.

How does she know?

As part of its effort to implement the 2006 California law, the state's Office of Privacy Protection checked the credit history of 2,110 foster children, tried to clear up any problems, and attempted to estimate how many children had been victims of identity theft. Its report on the effort was released in August 2011.

When the credit reporting agencies were queried, they reported that the Social Security numbers of 17 percent of the children had been used at some point.

But among 12 percent of all the children, the Social Security number wasn't really linked to anything, so it just could have been a clerical error or there's no name associated with it, so it wouldn't be part of the child's credit report and would be unlikely to affect the child's credit rating, according to the California report.

""We can say (the remaining) 5 percent of these kids had credit reports and that alone is of concern, because they shouldn't,"" said Joanne McNabb, chief of the office.

But even in that 5 percent group, the problem wasn't necessarily identity theft.

For example, three of the largest questionable accounts were for car loans and one was for a $217,000 home loan. But all four turned out to be the result of some type of error, not necessarily a case of identity theft.

""We were able to confirm that 1 percent [of that 5 percent] were errors"" that didn't involve identity theft, McNabb said.

That brings the ratio down to roughly 4 percent.

So are foster children disproportionately affected by identity theft, as Langevin said?

To determine that, you would need to know the extent of the problem among all children. We found only two studies that examined that. Both used data collected by Debix, a company that sells identity theft protection services -- a potential source of bias -- and analyzed at Debix' request.

One, released in 2008, tracked data from 500 children. It concluded that 5 percent -- 26 cases in all -- had problems with their credit file. Six appeared to be due to error, with no sign of fraud. That would bring the ratio down to 4 percent, the same as in the California study of foster children.

The other study of children was done by Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab, which looks at cybersecurity issues. It concluded that ""identity protection scans"" of 42,232 Social Security numbers of children showed that 7.8 percent showed evidence of identity theft -- an alarming number.

By that measure, foster children are only half as likely to be victims of identity theft -- not more likely, as Langevin said.

But both studies, even as they throw numbers around, emphasize that their numbers should not be used to estimate child identity theft.

McNabb agreed: ""Neither of those is an appropriate sample to draw big conclusions.""

Are foster children disproportionately victimized compared with adults?

Most sources put the rate of adult identity theft at about 3.5 percent. That may sound like it's in line with the childhood rate, but that's just over one year. The California study looking at foster children found that 4 percent had been victims of identity theft over their childhood.

Asked about our findings, Langevin’s spokesman, Jonathon Dworkin, said there’s another element to consider. Foster children, he said, are disproportionately victimized because, without family support, they may have more trouble clearing up their credit histories if they've been victims of identity theft.

Nonetheless, we think most people would interpret the context of Langevin's statement as meaning that identity thieves are more likely to victimize foster children.

Our ruling

Clearly identity theft is a big problem that often isn't recognized among children. Requiring the state to clear a foster child's credit history before he or she graduates from state custody seems like a good policy.

Representative Langevin said, ""Foster children are disproportionately victims of identity theft.""

The concept is apparently widely believed and asserted among child advocates.

But no study has directly compared identity theft rates between foster children and other children.

The California study is the only one to look at identity theft among foster children and it found a rate of roughly 4 percent.

Of the two studies we found that looked at overall childhood rates, one showed a rate of identity theft that was similar to foster children. The second found a rate that was higher than the rate seen in the study of foster children.

When Langevin asserts that foster children are disproportionately victims, he's making a claim based on evidence that is either scant, unreliable, or contradictory.

We rate the claim as False.

Sherrod Brown says 35 percent of China's exports land in U.S. markets
","
Bipartisan legislating  has not left the Senate.

Strong support from both sides of the aisle brought passage this month (Oct. 11) of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011 -- legislation designed to address China's undervaluation of its currency and consequent trade advantage.

The bill was sponsored and introduced by Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and supported by Ohio Republican Rob Portman, both of whom have acknowledged expertise on trade: Brown wrote a book on it (""Myths of Free Trade""), and Portman served a year as U.S. Trade Representative.

The legislation could lead to higher tariffs on Chinese imports that supporters say are priced artificially low. At a news conference after its 63-35 passage, Brown called it ""the largest bipartisan jobs bill"" to win approval in many months.

Opponents said they feared the legislation could spark a trade war with China at a time when the U.S. economy is already weak.

Brown responded: ""Ohio workers and Ohio manufacturers already know that we are, in fact, in a trade war, and the Chinese have done very well, thank you.

""The reason that this won't start the kind of trade war where the Chinese start being more aggressive even than they have been is we buy 35 percent of all Chinese exports,"" he said. ""They can't go to a trade war with a country that is such an important customer to them.""

The claim that more than one-third of China’s exports are sold in U.S. markets got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We decided to take a look.

Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, immediately told us that Brown ""misspoke when he said 35 percent. The figure is closer to 25 percent.""

She referred us to the most recent statistics from the World Trade Organization. They show that China's exports totaled $1.2 trillion in 2009, and the U.S. imported $310 billion of them, or 26 percent.

We looked further and found statistics from the U.S.-China Business Council, the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S Trade Representative that also showed the U.S. accounting for roughly 25 percent of Chinese exports.

They showed that the United States is China's largest export market by a wide margin, spending about 30 percent more than second-ranked Hong Kong, more than twice as much as third-ranked Japan and buying more than four times the volume of fourth-place South Korea.

The United States buys more than the next six countries in the top 10 combined.

By coincidence, we found that Portman made a slip of the tongue several months ago while discussing trade with China, just a Brown did here. We rated that claim Half True and said then that his underlying point remained.

In this case, Brown gave an incorrect number for the U.S. percentage of Chinese exports, which his staff readily pointed it out and corrected.  

Regardless of that slip, he is correct that the United States is China’s top export destination. A one-quarter share is not as hefty as a one third share would be, but either way, the United States remains the most significant market for Chinese exports.

But while PolitiFact Ohio isn’t looking to play Gotcha!, a key tenet is that words matter. In this case, Brown’s number is nearly 30 percent greater than the correct figure.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/20/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-35-percent-chinas-exports-land-/

Donald Trump off-base in claim about Michelle Obama ad against Hillary Clinton
","During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, Donald Trump tried to pull off the equivalent of making a bank shot while hanging upside down — that is, using the words of First Lady Michelle Obama to hammer Hillary Clinton. ""I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you,"" Trump said. ""And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary."" This assertion caught us off-guard, since Michelle Obama has campaigned vigorously for Clinton in this election cycle, including a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. We didn’t remember ""vicious"" attack ads from Obama during the 2008 campaign, either. So what’s going on? There are commercials out there showing Michelle Obama, but it’s not at all clear if she’s talking about Hillary Clinton. And the ads were made by a pro-Trump super PAC. What Michelle Obama said The Trump campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but he appears to be referring to comments made by Michelle Obama on Aug. 12, 2007, at a Women for Obama South Side Community Kickoff gathering at the Grand Ballroom, a historic venue in the Obamas’ hometown of Chicago. At the event, which took place during the 2008 primary contest, Michelle Obama said: ""One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it."" Initially, these comments didn’t attract much attention, though a clip of the event was aired on a local Chicago television newscast. However, Michelle Obama made a similar comment on the stump during a visit to Atlantic, Iowa. Here’s what she said: ""One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is, is he somebody that shares our values? Is he somebody that respects family? Is (he) a good and decent person? So our view was that, if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. So, so we've adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he's traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning, I get the girls ready, I get them off, I go and do trips, I'm home before bedtime. So the girls know that I was gone somewhere, but they don't care. They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night, and it keeps them grounded, and, and children, the children in our country have to know that they come first. And our girls do and that's why we're doing this. We're in this race for not just our children, but all of our children."" Michelle Obama’s comments in Iowa first attracted attention in an Aug. 23, 2007, dispatch by Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jennifer Hunter, who wrote that the comment ""could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons."" Hunter’s article was then picked up by the conservative Drudge Report, and from there various television networks and other news outlets followed up. Most reports mentioned the possibility that Michelle Obama was taking a veiled shot at the Clintons’ well-documented marital tribulations. Barack Obama rejected that interpretation, saying in a conference call with reporters that ""there was no reference beyond her point that we have had an administration that talks a lot about family values but doesn’t follow through."" He added that his wife often spoke about children and families in her remarks on the trail. It’s possible to see her words as a veiled shot at the Clinton’s marriage. It’s also possible that she was simply expressing pride in how her own family had arranged its affairs to make sure their young children weren’t left out. We will leave it to readers to decide which interpretation is closest to the mark. However, we are confident that Trump’s framing of Obama’s comments is incorrect. What ad is Trump referring to? Hearing Trump’s comments from the debate -- ""I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you"" -- it sounds as if he intends ""they"" to mean the Obamas. That would be a nice bit of opposition research for the Trump campaign. However, the Obamas never aired such commercials. Rather, an ad along those lines has been made by a pro-Donald Trump super PAC. The 30-second spot, titled, ""Can’t Run Your House,"" airs footage taken by a local television station from Obama’s 2007 appearance in Chicago. That was the event in which she said, ""One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it."" The ad was created by Make America Number 1, a group currently headed by Rebekah Mercer, whose father, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, initially supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the GOP primaries and then switched his support to Trump. Rebekah Mercer took over the top position at Make America Number 1 after veteran Republican strategist David Bossie left to join Trump’s campaign. By phrasing it the way he did, Trump implies that the Obamas ran ads against Clinton attacking their family life. In reality, it was a pro-Trump group that aired the ad in question -- and that makes a big difference in how powerful a point this is. Our ruling Trump said, ""I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary."" Trump is wrong to imply that Michelle Obama’s criticism came in an ad her husband ran against Hillary Clinton. Instead, it came from an ad made by a pro-Trump super PAC. And, the comments from Michelle Obama are somewhat oblique. They might be about Hillary Clinton, but they also might be simple pro-family sentiments.

Donald Trump incorrectly pins Benghazi criticism on Sidney Blumenthal
","At a Pennsylvania rally the day after the second presidential debate, Donald Trump energized the crowd by reading directly from a recent Wikileaks release of Democratic emails. The topic: the deaths of four Americans in a 2012 attack on a U.S. complex in Benghazi, Libya. ""Here's an interesting one: Sidney Blumenthal,"" Trump said to boos, referring to a longtime confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump, speaking in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Oct. 10, continued (at about the 44-minute mark.): ""Do you remember when Ambassador (Chris) Stevens in Benghazi was calling, and writing -- they were desperate for help. They say like 600 times, right? The only one she was speaking to is Sidney Blumenthal, who's a sleaze. He's a sleaze. In fact, Obama wanted her restricted (so) that she couldn't speak (to him). That's probably one of the reasons she wanted to have her private server, you know? Because she promised Obama that she wouldn't be talking to sleazy Sidney. ""So, Blumenthal writes a quote -- this just came out a little while ago. I have to tell you this. (Trump reads from paper.) ‘One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi’ -- this is Sidney Blumenthal, the only one she was talking to. ... "" ‘The attack was almost certainly preventable’ -- Benghazi. ‘Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect the United States personnel and an American consulate in Libya’ -- he meant Benghazi. ‘If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate.’ ""In other words, he is now admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi. This just came out a little while ago."" There’s a problem with what Trump said: Blumenthal didn’t write those words. Following the rally in Wilkes-Barre, Kurt Eichenwald, a Newsweek reporter, wrote an article in which he noted that he had written those words himself. ""Those words sounded really, really familiar,"" Eichenwald wrote. ""Really familiar. Like, so familiar they struck me as something I wrote. Because they were something I wrote."" Specifically, an article he wrote from Oct. 21, 2015, titled, ""Benghazi Biopsy: A Comprehensive Guide to One of America's Worst Political Outrages."" In general, the article criticized Republicans for politicizing Benghazi. It concludes in part: ""In the end, one thing is clear: This rabid partisanship or unmitigated deception or utter incompetence conflicts with everything this country stands for. Four men died serving their country; it is beyond disgraceful that their memories are used for cartoons and political buttons and television shows all for the purpose of advancing outright falsehoods just to gain political points. In their refusal to read documents or accept facts over fantasies, Republican conspiracy theorists have damaged this country in ways that cannot yet be fully comprehended."" However, elsewhere in the article, Eichenwald listed some areas of inquiry that he considered valid for investigation, and that were in line with investigations done after previous deadly attacks: ""One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi: The attack was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel at an American consulate in Libya. If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate."" The important thing to note here is that Eichenwald, a journalist, wrote those words, not Blumenthal. So how did Blumenthal get wrapped up in this? As it turns out, one of the emails leaked by Wikileaks was sent by Blumenthal to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email in question was sent on the same day the Newsweek article came out; it was addressed to ""undisclosed recipients."" In the email, Blumenthal forwarded Eichenwald’s article, with the header, ""Key Section. Then whole article below."" It includes both a link to the article and some text from it, including Eichenwald’s byline. Here's a screenshot:  
How Eichenwald’s words and Blumenthal’s became conflated is open to debate. Eichenwald pointed to Sputnik, a Russian website, which wrote an article that indicated that the words were Blumenthal’s. (The original Sputnik article has since been pulled from the Web.) Other observers, including BuzzFeed News’ Jon Passantino, have pointed to a viral tweet as the source instead. Either way, what is not in doubt is the inaccuracy of Trump’s comment. At most, one could say that Blumenthal had forwarded an article, without added commentary, to Podesta. But that doesn’t make those words Blumenthal’s, and it does not mean that this is a case of Blumenthal ""admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi,"" as Trump said. It’s much more plausible that Blumenthal, a Clinton loyalist, was forwarding the article to Podesta because of its overall, forcefully worded argument that the Republicans had turned Benghazi into a political football, not because of a couple cautionary sentences out of a 10,000-word article. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.. Our ruling Trump said that Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack ""was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel and an American consulate in Libya."" But Blumenthal didn’t write those words; Eichenwald did.

Mark Warner exaggerates in saying Donald Trump is 'OK' with nuclear proliferation
","U.S. Sen. Mark Warner had the back of Tim Kaine, his longtime Democratic ally and fellow Virginia senator, after last week’s vice presidential debate. ""I think that Tim clearly won the debate,"" Warner said in an interview with Fox News. He credited Kaine with confronting Mike Pence, the GOP vice presidential nominee, on some of the controversial statements made by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Warner said, ""What you had, though, is Mike Pence, and understandably, not being willing to answer, you know, some of the outrageous things Trump has said like, you know, nuclear proliferation is OK."" We took a look at whether Trump really has sanctioned nuclear proliferation. Warner’s office pointed us to a variety of Trump statements that PolitiFact has vetted in the past in examining other claims about the nominee’s view on nukes. His positions on proliferation sometimes seem contradictory, so we decided to lay them out. But reading through them, it’s clear that Trump thinks it might not be bad if South Korea and Japan developed their own nuclear weapons, given the threat they face from North Korea. ""Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons,"" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said. Here are some of Trump’s key comments this year about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons: March 27 The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump replied, ""At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem."" He added later in the same interview: ""If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us."" March 29 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, ""If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?"" In response, Trump seemed to indicate that he both opposes proliferation and that he wou ldn’t mind a few nations getting nukes for the first time. ""No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any,"" Trump said at one point. At another point, he said, ""I don't want more nuclear weapons."" But during the same segment, Trump contradicted himself. ""Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" he asked Cooper. Cooper asked Trump, ""So you have no problem with Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?"" Trump replied, ""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have … Cooper: ""Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?"" Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, absolutely."" Cooper: ""You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?"" Trump: ""No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us. Here’s the thing with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves."" Cooper: ""So if you said, ‘Japan, yes, it's fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well,’ and Saudi Arabia says ‘We want them, too?’"" Trump: ""Can I be honest with you? It's going to happen, anyway. It's going to happen anyway. It's only a question of time.""   April 3 Chris Wallace, host of ""Fox News Sunday,"" asked Trump, ""You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula?"" Trump: ""In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.""   Wallace: ""Understood."" Trump: ""It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would, in fact, be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.""   Wallace: ""With nukes?"" Trump: ""Maybe they would be better off - including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" Wallace: ""In South Korea, with nukes?"" Trump: ""South Korea is right next door, just so you understand."" Wallace: ""But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula."" Trump: ""You already have it, Chris. You already have a nuclear arms race."" May 4 CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, ""You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?"" Trump replied, ""I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world."" A final note: During the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence said Trump ""never said"" more nations should get nuclear weapons. PolitiFact National rated the denial Mostly False. Warner - in suggesting Trump sanctions proliferation - made a broader statement than Pence. Our ruling Warner said Trump has said ""nuclear proliferation is OK."" Trump hasn’t quite gone that far. He’s voiced his ""hate"" for nukes and said, ""I don’t want more nuclear weapons."" But Trump also repeatedly has said that the nuclear race is ""going to happen anyway,"" and that Japan and South Korea - both facing threats from North Korea - might be ""better off"" with nukes of their own. In discussing the issue, Trump has said the U.S. ""cannot afford to be the military and the police for the world,"" and that allies don’t pay enough for U.S. protection. So Trump certainly has said he’s open to proliferation by certain allies but isn’t sold on it.

After Donald Trump's campaign missteps, does Paul Ryan still endorse him, as Hillary Clinton says?
","One of the most vexing quandaries for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2016 has been whether, and how, to support the GOP’s presidential nominee. Finally, a month from election day, Ryan somewhat reluctantly agreed to make his first public appearance with Donald Trump, at a political rally in his southern Wisconsin district. But on the day before rally, a videotape of Trump talking crassly about women surfaced. In the 2005 video, Trump is caught on a live microphone saying ""I did try and f--- her. She was married."" He also uses graphic terms to describe the woman’s body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women and even grab their genitals. Ryan denounced Trump and said Trump would not be attending the rally. Three days after the video’s release, on Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan went further, declaring to fellow Republican House members he would not defend Trump, and instead focus on maintaining the GOP’s majority in the House. So, we wondered about a tweet issued the same day by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. She claimed: ""Ryan is still endorsing Trump."" Ryan’s position Ryan’s dilemma on supporting Trump was evident in May 2016, when we tested him on our Flip-O-Meter, which is used to see whether a politician has changed positions. We gave Ryan a Half Flip. At the time, just after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee with a win in Indiana’s primary, Ryan had said repeatedly he would support for president whomever won the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump. Yet in his first comments after Trump won in Indiana, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he was not ready to support him at that time. Then in June 2016, a month before Trump won the nomination, Ryan endorsed him, saying: ""It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement."" Clinton’s claim Early on Oct. 10, 2016, Politico reported that, according to sources, Ryan was discussing whether to revoke his Trump endorsement. Clinton sent her tweet several hours later, after Ryan held a private conference call with House Republicans that was later discussed publicly. Clinton’s campaign cited to us a same-day blog post from the Los Angeles Times about the call. The post was headlined: ""House Speaker Paul Ryan will not campaign with Trump, but still endorses him."" Other news accounts on the conference call were similar. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated Ryan ""stopped short of rescinding his own tepid endorsement of Trump,"" and quoted a Ryan aide as saying there is ""no update"" in his position on Trump ""at this time."" The New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement. As for Ryan himself, when we asked his campaign about Clinton’s claim, a spokesman simply reiterated what had been put out earlier, saying: ""There is no update in his position at this time."" Our rating Clinton says Ryan ""is still endorsing Trump."" As of the time when Clinton made the claim, Ryan’s endorsement of Trump for president remained in place. We rate the statement True.

Donald Trump confuses Eat’n Park with its famous Smiley Cookie
","Like many candidates, Donald Trump has spent some parts of his campaign stopping by local food institutions in the places where he’s stumping. That means he got a cheesesteak from Geno’s in Philly and, true to Western PA form, he went to get a Smiley Cookie (yes, that’s the name of something, and it’s trademarked) while he was outside Pittsburgh this week. After Trump left town, a post appeared on his Facebook page: ""Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy [Giuliani]."" However, the popular chain of diners headquartered in Homestead outside Pittsburgh is actually not called Smiley Cookie, despite its most famous food offering. No, the chain is actually called ""Eat’n Park."" Sure, this isn’t about foreign or domestic policy. But it’s important to Pennsylvania, so we decided to check Trump’s claim of swinging by a place called ""Smiley Cookie."" The GOP presidential nominee held a rally at Ambridge Area High School about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh Monday, his first since coming under fire following the release of audio from 2005 of Trump’s using offensive language referring to women. Local TV station WPXI reported that after the rally had wrapped up, Trump and members of his campaign traveled to Moon Township, where they stopped at an Eat’n Park. Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a top ally of the presidential nominee, reportedly bought a dozen Smiley Cookies while there. According to Eat’n Park’s corporate website, the establishment was founded in 1949 ""as the first Pittsburgh-area drive-in with carhops."" Today, it’s more like just a diner, but it has more than 65 locations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. The restaurants serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, but the most famous part is the bakery, where employees whip up pies, cakes and, of course, hand-frosted Smiley Cookies that are given to children who eat at the restaurant. They’re also available for purchase. Eat’n Park has been doling out the Smiley Cookies for the last 30 years, and the restaurant itself has become a western Pennsylvania institution of sorts, as it’s one of the only 24-hour joints still around. Some on social media reacted harshly to Trump’s mix-up, while others were more understanding. The Smiley Cookie is the most iconic part of Eat’n Park. Eat’n Park Hospitality Group and the Trump campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Our ruling Donald Trump posted on Facebook that he ""Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy."" We’ll leave deciding whether or not the cookies can be considered ""great"" to you. But this place is not called Smiley Cookie. It’s called Eat’n Park. And it has been called that for 67 years. The mix-up’s understandable, though, and Trump did purchase the Smiley Cookies in question.

Trump mangles facts on Clinton and Haiti jobs project
","Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for her role in facilitating the creation of an industrial park in post-earthquake Haiti that has been accused of displacing farmers and failing to live up to rosy job creation projections. Among the charges, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Clinton pushed aside regulations to create sweatshop-like conditions. ""Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti,"" Trump said Sept. 6, 2016. Clinton, as secretary of state, certainly lauded the project as part of a plan to revitalize Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, and the U.S. government financially supported it. But did she help a company create a sweatshop? The evidence is thin. The Caracol Industrial Park In 2010, Haiti’s leaders unveiled a plan to spur growth beyond the capital city of Port-au-Prince. One project that emerged was to build an industrial park on the country’s northern coast a little over a mile from Caracol Bay. It was going to bring tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, government officials said. Getting it off the ground took a collaboration among the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the government of Haiti, and a South Korean clothing maker, Sae-A Trading. Sae-A, under the name of S&H Global, would be the anchor tenant of the new industrial park, producing clothes for clients such as Target and Walmart. Bill and Hillary Clinton, champions of that vision, came to the park’s grand opening. In fact, both of them lobbied hard for the project. Bill Clinton in his role as special envoy to Haiti pushed for expanded garment making. Sae-A said Clinton herself invited the company to build a factory at the industrial park. The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $170 million to support the industrial park by building a power plant and improving the port. ""What is happening here in Caracol is already having ripple effects that will create jobs and opportunities far beyond this industrial park,"" Hillary Clinton said at the Caracol opening ceremony. But that really hasn't happened. The industrial park has been beseiged by criticism of millions of dollars wasted, displaced farmers and sluggish job growth. Today, four years, later, total employment is about 8,100. (The State Department told us after publication that new data show the facility now employs about 9,400 people.) That's the background. Now, we'll look at the specifics of Trump's claim. Clinton's role in environmental and labor rules  Trump said Clinton ""set aside environmental and labor rules"" to make the project a reality. The Trump campaign pointed to an article that appeared in the New York Times. That report cited environmentalists decrying the placement of the industrial zone near a sensitive marine habitat. The U.S. Treasury Department abstained from voting on the project due to concerns over the limited environmental impact studies that had been prepared. That's not the same as Clinton setting aside rules, and people involved with the project said Clinton played no role. Charles Krakoff, managing partner of the consulting firm Koios Associates, created the environmental impact report in an assessment for the government of Haiti and the Inter-American Development Bank. Krakoff told us that the Haitians, the development bank and USAID pressed for a quick turnaround, and he agrees that his firm did not produce a full long-term analysis. But he said he did address the immediate impacts and laid out the sort of studies needed later. The Inter-American Development Bank followed through. It commissioned a more comprehensive study in 2014, which was completed in August 2016. ""Environmental standards were not changed for this project,"" Krakoff said. USAID produced a separate environmental impact study for the power plant alone. Importantly, Krakoff said the key decision to place the industrial park in Caracol was made by the government of Haiti not Clinton. Whatever environmental issues that raised flowed from that point forward and Clinton played no role. ""We told them two other locations would be better, but the government wanted it in Caracol,"" Krakoff said. ""The Haitians and the Inter-American Development Bank had more say in this project than the United States."" Sae-A's record on workers' rights Clinton, as we already said, did play a part in getting Sae-A to Haiti, and Sae-A does not have a perfect record with workers. The company had a significant dispute with the union at a factory in Guatemala. The AFL-CIO accused it of anti-union repression including ""acts of violence and intimidation."" Sae-A ultimately abandonned that Guatemalan factory. But, in 2008, the International Trade Union Confederation highlighted the company as one of only three in Guatemala that had unions at all and met with union representatives weekly to discuss working conditions. We found an academic article that accurately described an episode when Sae-A managers at one plant in Guatemala used police to intimidate union organizers. The researcher cited a WikiLeaks cable from 2005 as proof, but failed to note that the cable went on to say that when the government and the company found out what happened, it fired all the managers involved and reinstated the workers with back pay. In Nicaragua, a 2013 investigation of a clash between union supporters and non-union workers found that Sae-A did nothing to prevent the unrest. So, the evidence that Sae-A violated workers rights is limited. The company had a dispute with its unions in Guatemala and allowed a fight to break out between union and non-union workers in Nicaragua. Is Sae-A running a sweatshop? Many factories in Haiti are subject to six-month inspections by Better Work Haiti, a project of the International Labor Organization. The latest assessment raises a few points of concern, but nothing that would in any way meet the definition of sweatshop conditions. On the contrary, the report lists several strengths, including providing ""free, first-class education to the workers’ kids."" The company provides paid sick and maternity leave, which according to the company, has been used in 6,336 and 220 cases respectively in 2016. There are three unions in the factory representing about 30 percent of all workers. Safety and health conditions passed muster in the assessment. The issues raised were isolated, or due more to workers not using safety equipment (ear plugs) that the company gave them (and trained them on why they should use them.) Inspectors and the company have a dispute on the legal definition for holiday, sick and maternity leave pay that has been referred to the government for resolution.Of workers who are paid based on how much they produce, only 41 percent make the government’s target minimum wage, which suggests much improvement is needed, although the inspectors did not say this made the company non-compliant with the law. Pay is a point of broader concern. The advocacy group Worker Rights Consortium issued a report in 2013 that accused Sae-A of ""ongoing theft of legally-earned wages."" But when we asked the executive director if this met the criteria of operating a sweatshop, he declined to comment. The AFL-CIO also failed to respond to questions about Sae-A. Our ruling Trump said Clinton ""set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti."" There is no evidence that Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules and Trump exaggerated about the record of the South Korean company in question. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction Oct. 12, 2016  Sae-A closed the Guatemala factory where it had a dispute with a union. A previously version of this fact-check incorrectly said Sae-A left the country entirely. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4e6663b3-a536-4892-b9a6-79688568959f",/factchecks/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-mangles-facts-clinton-and-haiti-jobs-project/

Patrick Murphy wants to ban 'commonly owned semi-automatic firearms,' NRA says
","The National Rifle Association is firing allegations at U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, saying the Democratic Senate hopeful wants to take away voters’ guns. The gun rights group’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, attacked Murphy in a mailer we received on Oct. 4, 2016. The flier listed several reasons why Murphy is against guns. ""Murphy supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense,"" one of the items read. That sounds like Murphy, now running against incumbent Marco Rubio for U.S. Senate, wants to make it illegal to own a wide range of weapons, so we zeroed in on that statement. ‘Military-style weapons of war’ Murphy has been an advocate of stricter gun control, especially in the wake of the June 12, 2016, mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others using a semi-automatic rifle and handgun. Murphy called for keeping ""assault weapons out of the hands of dangerous people."" In an August 2016 candidate survey, Murphy told the Tampa Bay Times he does not believe ""that civilians need access to military-style assault weapons."" In September, he told the Orlando Sentinel he agreed with the families of the Pulse victims who wanted Congress to ban weapons like the rifle Mateen used. Murphy said the government should ""keep military-style weapons of war out of our communities and out of the hands of criminals and terrorists."" Murphy’s campaign did not provide any specifics about what types of guns, other than to call them ""military-style assault rifles"" and ""dangerous weapons of war."" Technically there’s no true definition of what makes a particular rifle an ""assault weapon."" There’s no clear, legal interpretation of any of the descriptions Murphy and other gun control advocates are using, giving the NRA wide berth in its attack. Put simply, the term ""semi-automatic"" refers to any firearm designed to fire one bullet with one trigger squeeze, then automatically reload the chamber and be ready to fire again. This is different from an automatic weapon, in which squeezing the trigger once fires multiple times until the shooter lets go. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted in the United States since 1934. Regulations put in place in 1986 made it much more difficult for civilian buyers to get an automatic weapon. Experts told us that while legislators have struggled for decades to find a universal term that fits the mold, in general that means so-called black rifles that look like a soldier’s weapon. These include rifles that have pistol grips, high-capacity magazines, bayonet lugs to fix edged weapons, flash suppressors at the end of the barrel and so forth. The NRA-ILA told us Murphy and others usually are referring to rifles similar to the AR-15, which is a derivative of a rifle first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. (The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle, and does not stand for ""assault rifle."") There are somewhere between 6 million and 10 million of these semi-automatic rifles in circulation in the United States. The NRA routinely refers to this style of semi-automatic weapon — used in shootings in Aurora, Colo.; Roseburg, Ore.; San Bernadino, Calif.; and Newtown, Conn. — as a ""modern sporting rifle."" One of Mateen’s weapons in the Pulse shooting, a Sig Sauer MCX, is similar in style to an AR-15 but not the same design. Internally, however, the consumer versions of these rifles basically work the same as any other semi-automatic rifle. Cartridges are fed from magazines and are fired one at a time with each trigger pull. They are used for self-defense and recreational shooting, just as the NRA said. About half of all guns are semi-automatic. Handguns are far more prevalent in crimes. The 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, for example, were committed with two semi-automatic handguns, a Glock 19 and Walther P22, she said. Mateen also used a Glock 17 pistol. Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas at Dallas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, said many lawmakers resort to focusing on specific makes and models that usually are both semi-automatic and considered military in appearance. That’s what the 1994-2004 federal assault weapons ban did. Kovandzic said in the research he’s seen, these types of ""assault weapons"" are used in less than 2 percent of gun crimes. Of course, the NRA words the claim in such a way that there could be some confusion about Murphy’s wishes. While Murphy is focusing on rifles that are arguably only cosmetically different, his intention is a bit obscured by the mailer. ""He may want to ban some semi-automatic weapons,"" UCLA constitutional law professor Adam Winkler said, ""but he doesn’t want to ban all semi-automatic weapons."" Our ruling The NRA-ILA said, ""Murphy supports a gun ban on commonly owned semi-automatic firearms used for hunting, recreational shooting and self defense."" Murphy has called for a ban on ill-defined ""military-style weapons of war"" and ""assault weapons."" His campaign didn’t specify further which guns, but these political terms usually refer to rifles used in some mass shootings with mostly cosmetic differences from other semi-automatic rifles. These rifles, often based on the AR-15, are used by owners in the way the NRA describes. But the mailer could be construed as saying Murphy wants to take away most, if not all, semi-automatic firearms, which Murphy denies. Their statement is slightly off the mark, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/11/national-rifle-association/patrick-murphy-wants-ban-commonly-owned-guns-nra-s/

Super PAC yanks ad about Portman's climate change views
","ClearPath Action Fund, a conservative clean-energy and environmental PAC, cheered U.S. Sen. Rob Portman in a digital ad, calling him a ""clean energy champion."" The ad said of the Republican senator, ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" PolitiFact previously looked into how many Republicans in Congress say they believe that climate change is real, and caused by human activity. The Republican lawmakers we identified who affirm climate change included Rep. Michael Grimm, N.Y.; Sen. Susan Collins, Maine; Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tenn.; Sen. Mark Kirk, Ill.; Rep. Chris Smith, N.J.; Sen. Bob Corker, Tenn.; Sen. John Thune, S.D.; and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, N.J. Portman didn’t make PolitiFact’s list, so we wanted to clarify his climate change stance. We asked ClearPath Action Fund for the sources they used to champion Portman’s position, and a spokesman sent us three links. The first two were votes on amendments to the Keystone XL Pipeline Act in January 2015 (which was after PolitiFact did its roundup of Republicans who believe in climate change). The climate change amendments were only symbolic gauges of the ""sense of the Senate."" Portman voted ""yea"" on the first, introduced by Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ""to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax."" That amendment passed. Portman also voted in support of a second amendment by Republican Sen. John Hoeven, a Keystone bill sponsor, which said that human activity affects climate change, but still supported the passage of the pipeline bill. That amendment fell short of the required 60 by one vote, and Hoeven himself voted against it.   So far, so good for ClearPath Action Fund. Here's how one wrong word — ""significantly"" — pulls the PAC's praise for Portman's record into negative territory.  A Democrat, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, inched the global warming language a step further, calling for a vote on an amendment that stated ""human activity significantly contributes to climate change."" The adverb represents the crux of the partisan divide over climate change. The word ""significantly"" was significant enough for Portman to vote against that amendment, along with almost all of his fellow Republicans. Collins, Kirk, Alexander, Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) broke party lines and voted in favor.  Portman has explained in interviews that he doesn’t want to qualify the impact that human activity has on the climate because ""scientists have different views on that."" These word gymnastics are necessary for Portman because of his large constituency in Ohio coal country. Coal-burning power plants provide 44 percent of the electricity used in the U.S., but are the biggest contributor to air pollution, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.  ""Sense of the Senate resolutions are done for messaging reasons, either in an attempt to move the policy debate, or to provide political cover of some sort. I think you had both types in play with the Keystone vote,"" said David Jenkins, president at Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. More recently, Portman voted for an amendment proposed by Graham that stated, ""Climate change is real; human activity contributes to climate change,"" and that ""the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate change…(and) Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change..."" Absent, again, is the word ""significantly."" But it is in the language of the ClearPath Action ad: ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" ClearPath Action’s communications director, Darren Goode, responded immediately to PolitiFact via email, and said the group had made an ""honest mistake"" by including the s-word. ""We have already pulled that video down and will fix it to reflect that,"" Goode wrote.   While ClearPath Action confers ""clean energy champion"" status to Portman, at least two other environmental groups beg to differ. The National Resources Defense Council has regularly hammered Portman for sponsoring such measures as a budget amendment to allow states to opt out of the 1970 Clean Art Act and Clean Power Plan requirements for cutting carbon pollution. Likewise, the League of Conservation Voters gives Portman a low rating on their scorecard for his voting record on environmentally impactful measures. Our ruling An ad by ClearPath Action said, ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" While Portman did vote for a bipartisan bill recognizing climate change as a threat in need of action, that bill did not include the word ""significantly."" Portman has voted against other amendments when they include the word ""significantly,"" and has voted for amendments that do not quantify how much human activity affects climate change. ClearPath Action has since discontinued the ad, admitted the mistake and pledged to release a corrected version.

Trump says Clinton viciously attacked those who charged abuse by Bill
","Donald Trump said at the second presidential debate that his lewd 2005 comments were ""locker room talk,"" but what Bill and Hillary Clinton did was much worse. ""If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse,"" Trump said Oct. 9, 2016. ""Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."" Trump then criticized Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight."" Here we’re fact-checking Trump’s claim that Hillary Clinton ""viciously"" attacked women who say they were abused by Bill Clinton. What we found is that Hillary Clinton has been accused of threatening or shaming accusers of Bill Clinton. But all the accusations remain unproven, as do the specific allegations against Bill Clinton. In most cases, evidence Hillary Clinton intervened in any significant way doesn’t exist. An error in Trump’s counting Before we explain the case with each accuser, a small note. While Trump invited four women to the debate at Washington University in St. Louis, only three of them -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones -- accuse Bill Clinton of sexual assault. The fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, was a victim in a rape case. Hillary Clinton defended Shelton’s attacker while working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. You can read our fact-check related to that incident here. Hillary Clinton and Juanita Broaddrick In 1978, Juanita Broaddrick managed a nursing home in Arkansas. During the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Broaddrick came forward to say that he had raped her in her hotel room in 1978. Broaddrick also said that she believed Hillary Clinton knew about the rape and tried to intervene. She described an encounter to the conservative website Breitbart. Broaddrick said that soon after the alleged event took place, she went to a Democratic fundraiser that the Clintons attended. Broaddrick said Hillary Clinton approached her. Clinton said, ""I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do,"" Broaddrick recounted. Broaddrick told Breitbart, ""What really went through my mind at that time is ‘She knows. She knew. She’s covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.’"" Broaddrick did not go public with her story, even going so far as to deny that the rape occurred in a sworn deposition (as part of the Paula Jones case). Two decades later though, investigators with independent counsel Ken Starr approached her and she told it all. Ultimately, Starr’s team decided there was ""inconclusive evidence"" to press charges. We found no evidence of Hillary Clinton viciously attacking Broaddrick, as Trump claimed, nor is there independent confirmation of the exchange at the fundraising event. Also, in a 1999 interview with NBC News, Broaddrick was asked if Bill Clinton or anyone close to him had ever done anything to keep her silent. Broaddrick said, ""No."" Kathleen Willey In 1993, Kathleen Willey was a Clinton supporter and a volunteer at the White House. Willey said that when she went to the president to ask for a paid position, he groped her. Willey, now a Trump supporter, has said that Hillary Clinton ""wrote the book on terrorizing women."" Willey described what she believed to be efforts to intimidate her in an interview with the conservative website Daily Caller. That list included ""a dead cat found on her porch, a man she saw at night under her deck, and a stranger in her remote neighborhood inquiring threateningly about how her children were doing."" Willey also mentioned being told that Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal said about her, ""She may look good today … she’s not going to look good by Friday."" In the course of responding to a lawsuit in 1999, Blumenthal did say Hillary Clinton played some sort of role in the White House response to Willey’s allegations. She approved the public release of letters Willey had sent after the alleged event. The letters were characterized as ""friendly"" and, according to Blumenthal, Clinton thought they would undermine Willey’s credibility because the tone was at odds with the episode she described. We reached out to Willey to get more details but have yet to hear back. Paula Jones In 1994, Arkansas state worker Paula Jones accused Bill Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance. Clinton ultimately paid $850,000 to settle with Jones without admitting guilt. Jones has harsh words for Hillary Clinton. She said Clinton was out to discredit her. ""She don’t care nothing about women. Because if she did she would believe what I had to say,"" Jones told Breitbart. Jones said Clinton was an enabler of her husband’s transgressions. After Jones sued Bill Clinton, his legal team questioned her and looked into her background. But, again, we found no evidence Hillary Clinton attacked Jones. The closest was in 1998 when Clinton said she felt that Jones’ lawsuit was part of a larger political agenda. Other allegations Long-time Washington journalist Carl Bernstein wrote in his biography of Hillary Clinton A Woman in Charge that in the 1992 campaign Hillary Clinton directed a special ""defense team"" to deal with allegations about ""Bill’s history with the Selective Service System, women claiming to have had affairs with him, and other personal aspects of the Clintons’ lives."" One aide was sent to Little Rock, Ark., to dig for facts about the most worrying revelation from Gennifer Flowers, a woman who claimed to have had a long affair with Bill Clinton. The campaign hired a detective to look into the backgrounds of any women who had come forward. The Trump campaign pointed to a New York Times article that described the work of that detective. The newspaper reported that in a memo, the detective said he would impugn Flowers’ ""character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition."" Importantly, however, while Flowers claimed she had an affair with Bill Clinton, she did not claim she was abused. In a 1992 interview, Clinton herself called Flowers ""some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of resume to fall back on."" And on another occasion, she said if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, she ""would crucify her."" But the same New York Times article quotes a statement provided earlier this month by the Hillary Clinton campaign from James Carville, the 1992 campaign’s top strategist. ""Hillary wanted us to defend the governor against attacks,"" the statement said. ""It’s just ridiculous to imagine that she was somehow directing our response operation. That was my job, not hers."" ABC News host George Stephanopoulos served as the communications director in Clinton’s 1992 campaign. Stephanopoulos wrote in All Too Human, that when Connie Hamzy, one of the first women to claim a sexual encounter with Bill, came forward Hillary said, ""We have to destroy her story."" Hamzy said Bill Clinton propositioned her, but she didn’t object. Lastly, no account of Bill Clinton’s transgressions would be complete without mentioning one-time White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky aimed to get the attentions of the president and succeeded. When Lewinsky’s story came to light through the Starr investigation, Hillary Clinton forcefully rejected that there was any truth to it. Clinton basically wrote it off as part of ""this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president."" When Hillary Clinton said that, Lewinsky was still publicly denying her affair with the president. Our ruling Trump said that Hillary Clinton ""viciously"" attacked women who accused Bill Clinton of abuse. Bill Clinton certainly has been accused of sexual assault and having affairs. The record shows Hillary Clinton played a role in defending her husband, and that the Clintons’ first presidential campaign deployed tough tactics to defend against stories of consensual sex. But in the cases of alleged abuse by Broaddrick, Willey and Jones, Hillary Clinton was largely silent. The words she allegedly had with Broaddrick are subject to interpretation. Approving the release of Willey’s letters does qualify as an attack, but using a person’s words against them is a fairly tame tactic. And Clinton did not attack Jones directly. Overall, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-viciously-attack/

Kaine wrongly says Trump backs end of NATO
","Tim Kaine says Donald Trump would toss NATO in the trash. ""That’s why Donald Trump’s claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous,"" Kaine said Oct. 4 during his debate at Longwood University against Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee. Pence denied that. So we’ll examine whether Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, really has said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an ""obsolete"" alliance that should be disbanded. Sarah Peck, the communications director for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign in Virginia, pointed us to a series of Trump speeches and news articles about his comments on NATO. We found additional transcripts of the GOP nominee’s comments on the alliance. There are many instances when Trump said NATO is outdated and argued that it has failed to modernize beyond its original Cold War mission and instead should focus more on fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist threats. ""N.A.T.O is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!"" Trump said in a March 24 tweet. Trump made a similar statement July 21 during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. ""Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost,"" he said. So ""obsolete"" is a modifier Trump often attaches to NATO. But we couldn’t find evidence that Trump actually has called for ""getting rid of NATO,"" as Kaine says. In a July 22 interview with The New York Times, Trump was asked if the U.S. should continue putting as much money as it does toward NATO if other countries don’t increase their spending. ""I would prefer that we be able to continue (protecting them), but if we are not going to be reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting these massive nations with tremendous wealth. … We’re talking about countries that are doing very well. Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, ‘Congratulations, you will be defending yourself,’"" Trump said, according to The Times transcript of its interview. Trump has made many other statements that NATO countries that pay too little might not be defended. In an April 2 article in The New York Times noted that Trump told a crowd in Racine, Wis., that if countries don’t pay more toward their defense, they have to get out of the alliance. ""And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO,"" he said, according to The Times. Trump has made other statements that indicate he’s ambivalent about the alliance’s fate. ""I don’t want to get rid of NATO, but you always have to be prepared to walk. It’s possible,"" Trump said at an Aug. 3 rally in Jacksonville, Fla. During a March 27 interview on ABC, Trump said NATO has been ""disproportionately"" expensive for the U.S. ""And we should readjust NATO,"" Trump said. ""And it's going to have to be either readjusted to take care of terrorism, or we're going to have to set up a new coalition, a new group of countries to handle terrorism, because terrorism is out of control."" At a July 27 news conference, Trump raised the issue of NATO again. ""I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated, because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now,"" Trump said, according to The Washington Post’s transcript of the event. He added, ""I think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And - and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying."" During his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26, Trump said, ""I’m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also."" Our ruling Kaine said Trump has said ""that NATO is obsolete, and that we need to get rid of NATO."" The record is full of instances when Trump called the alliance ""obsolete,"" but that doesn’t means he’s called for its end. To the contrary, Trump has spoken of a future for NATO as long as other nations shoulder more of NATO’s costs and make other changes. If they won’t do so, then Trump has voiced ambivalence about the alliance’s future. But Kaine’s statement leaves the misleading impression that Trump is advocating for NATO’s demise. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/10/tim-kaine/contrary-kaine-claim-trump-hasnt-called-us-break-n/

Clinton says she was gone for the 'red line' in Syria incident
","Hillary Clinton was involved in a decision as secretary of state that ""was laughed at all over the world,"" Donald Trump said at the second debate between the two presidential candidates. Trump, referring to a ""line in the sand,"" brought up President Barack Obama’s so-called ""red line"" in Syria: That Obama would change his calculus on armed intervention in Syria if dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons. Assad later used chemical weapons, crossing the red line, but Obama did not intervene with force. Clinton ""was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand,"" Trump said, his statement abruptly cut off by Clinton. ""No I wasn’t. I was gone,"" she said. ""I hate to interrupt you, but at some point we need to do some fact-checking."" Trump replied, ""You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps sadly Obama probably still listened to you, I don’t think he’ll be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened."" Since there was a call for some fact-checking, we decided to find out who’s correct on the timeline — Clinton or Trump. Basically, Obama drew the chemical weapons ""red line"" in August 2012 when Clinton was secretary of state. But by the time the White House confirmed that Assad crossed it about a year later, she had been replaced by John Kerry. August 2012: Obama draws the ""red line."" Obama first made the ""red line"" comment Aug. 20, 2012, when a reporter asked Obama whether he envisioned using the military in Syria, ""if simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons."" Obama responded (emphasis added): ""I have, at this point, not ordered military engagement in the situation. But the point that you made about chemical and biological weapons is critical. That’s an issue that doesn’t just concern Syria; it concerns our close allies in the region, including Israel. It concerns us. We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people. ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation."" At this point, Clinton was secretary of state. She endorsed Obama’s position, specifically using the phrase ""red line"" in a Dec. 3 2012, press conference in Prague. ""We have made our views very clear. This is a red line for the United States,"" she told a reporter. ""I'm not going to telegraph in any specifics what we would do in the event of credible evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against his own people, but suffice to say we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to occur."" ""Our concerns are that an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons or might lose control of them to one of the many groups that are now operating within Syria,"" she said after a NATO meeting two days later. ""And so as part of the absolute unity that we all have on this issue, we have sent an unmistakable message that this would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account."" Rumors that Syria was mobilizing chemical weapons also began to emerge in Clinton’s last months in office, in early 2013. In a January 2013 interview, Clinton reiterated that ""the use of chemical weapons, President Obama has said, is a red line."" Clinton left her position as secretary of state in February 2013. August 2013: White House ""assesses with high confidence that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack."" Assad’s regime killed more than 1,400 people in this chemical weapons attack in the city of Damascus. Despite his earlier ""red line"" comment, Obama chose not to strike Syria and instead looked to Congress to authorize force. Eventually, through a deal with Russia, Syria handed over its chemical weapons, and no strikes were fired against Assad for crossing the red line. Clinton had handed the position of secretary of state over to Kerry in February 2013. However, Clinton publicly commented on the deal with Russia on Sept. 9, 2013, amid the negotiation process. She endorsed the White House position, saying, ""If the regime immediately surrendered its stockpiles to international control, as was suggested by Secretary Kerry and the Russians, that would be an important step."" ""This discussion that has taken hold today about potential international control over Syria’s stockpiles only could take place in the context of a credible military threat by the United States to keep pressure on the Syrian government, as well as those supporting Syria, like Russia,"" Clinton added, possibly alluding to the ""red line"" comment. She met with Obama earlier that day and had spoken with high-level members of his staff multiple times in the preceding days, according to Washington Post reports. She reiterated her support for Obama’s position on Syria again at a second speech that week. Trump’s phrasing — and the fact that Clinton interrupted him — makes it difficult to know exactly what time frame he’s referring to: Either when Obama first announced the red line or when Assad crossed the red line. However, Clinton was involved in both campaigns. Even though she was no longer part of the Obama administration when it confirmed Syria had crossed the ""red line,"" Clinton participated in the discussions about how to respond. And she advocated for Obama’s position publicly. So when Trump said, ""You were in total contact with the White House and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you"" — he had a point. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I was gone"" when there was a red line against Syria. Clinton was secretary of state in August 2012 when Obama said if the Assad regime were to use chemical weapons, that would cross a ""red line"" after which Obama would consider using military force in Syria. In the months following that statement, Clinton reiterated Obama’s position, using the phrase ""red line."" A year later, August 2013, the White House confirmed Syria had crossed this ""red line."" By this point, Clinton had left the State Department months earlier. However, in the days following that revelation, Clinton met with Obama and his staff several times and publicly endorsed the White House’s position on how to respond.

Donald Trump says ICE endorsed him
","Donald Trump boasted during the second presidential debate about support he’s received from agents who patrol U.S. borders and enforce immigration laws. ""ICE just endorsed me,"" the Republican nominee said Monday at the debate in St. Louis, Mo. ""They've never endorsed a presidential candidate."" Did a federal agency endorse Trump? No. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws and has more than 20,000 employees, according to its website. But Trump does have the support of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union that represents 5,000 federal immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. Trump posted a statement about the union’s endorsement on his campaign website Sept. 26. The first-ever endorsement was voted on by the membership, with Hillary Clinton receiving only 5 percent of the vote, said Chris Crane, president of the National ICE Council, in the statement posted on Trump’s website. ""America has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States,"" Crane said in the statement. ""We can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors America’s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives."" The National Border Patrol Council, which represents 16,500 agents, has also backed Trump. But that was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times. Our ruling Trump said, ""ICE just endorsed me."" He made it sound like a federal agency had taken the remarkable step of formally supporting him. But ICE, which enforces federal immigration laws and employs more than 20,000 people, cannot do that. He has the support of employee groups, but that’s vastly different than what he said at the debate. We rate his claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb80b3d3-b4d9-41b9-941a-51a97bb4eeba",/factchecks/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-says-ice-endorsed-him/

Donald Trump largely accurate that U.S. had biggest increase in murders in 45 years
","Donald Trump returned to a topic he’s been citing often in recent months -- rising crime. ""We have a very divided nation,"" he said. ""You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities. Chicago. You take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years."" Trump is largely on target that ""we have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years."" His staff didn’t respond to an inquiry, but Trump seems to be referring to a set of annual statistics released by the FBI. The most recent report came out in September. Those statistics showed that the number of murders and non-negligent homicides rose nationally between 2014 and 2015 by 10.8 percent. When we checked the numbers, we confirmed that this increase does rank as the biggest year-to-year jump in murders since 1970-71, when the number rose by 11.1 percent. That was exactly 45 years ago. In fact, Trump’s debate comment was stated more accurately than what one of his key surrogates -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- said earlier in the day on Meet the Press. Giuliani stated that ""last year, crime went up more than in the last 41 years."" Not only did Giuliani get the number of years wrong, but he also referred to ""crime"" generally, not to murders specifically. And that makes a difference. Violent crime did go up between 2014 and 2015, but by a significantly smaller percentage than murders did -- 3.9 percent. That rate of increase was smaller than several year-to-year increases since 1971, most recently an increase between 1989 and 1990 of 10.6 percent. In addition, between 2014 and 2015, property crime actually dropped by 2.6 percent. So Trump has a fair point. Still, we’ll note two caveats. First, his terminology was imperfect. The 10.8 percent increase represents an overall national figure -- not the figure for murders ""within our cities,"" as Trump phrased it. That said, murder rates within cities tend to be higher than for the country at large, as this chart shows. (The red line is the rate for cities over 250,000 population, while the blue line is the rate for the country as a whole.) So this flaw in Trump’s phrasing doesn’t strike us as especially problematic. A bigger problem for Trump is that he leaves out some important context -- that, as we have noted previously, crime rates were heading downward for a quarter-century before the most recent uptick, and that the recent increase is nowhere near big enough to erase those gains. Sticking to murder statistics for the moment, the following chart shows a zig-zagging rise in murders between 1970 and the early 1990s, followed by a fairly steady decline since then. To be precise, the number of murders declined by 42 percent between 1993 and 2014, even as the U.S. population rose by 25 percent over the same period. The same 25-year decline also shows up in the statistics for violent crimes more generally … … and for property crimes, too. After the newest FBI statistics came out, we asked several criminologists how much concern they place in the recent murder spike. They said it was definitely worth noting -- but that it also needs to be understood within a broader context. ""Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago,"" said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. ""A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20 year trend is downward,"" he said. ""If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase."" And James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist said that while ""crime rose, it is far from certain that it will continue. Such a large jump in homicide, the most volatile of crime figures, can easily be followed by a turn in the other direction. One year does not make a trend."" For a past example, look no further than an October 2006 report by the Police Executive Research Forum that cited an upward spike around 2005 that’s visible in our graphs above. The group warned of ""a gathering storm of violent crime that threatens to erode the considerable crime reductions of the past."" But starting in 2006, crime began falling again, and it stayed that way for most of the next decade. As Jeffrey Butts of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice recently told the Guardian, ""You lost 50 pounds. You gained back a couple. You’re not fat. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t look at your behavior, because the trend is not good."" Our ruling Trump said, ""We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years."" The number of murders nationally did rise by the biggest amount in 45 years, and criminologists agree that this is a development worth paying attention to. But they add that it comes after a steep, quarter-century decline, which suggests that it is not yet a cause for panic. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-claims-us-has-biggest-increase-murders-45-ye/

Donald Trump wrongly says Hillary Clinton laughed at a 12-year-old rape victim
","Donald Trump offered a confusing mashup of unsavory accusations during Sunday night's presidential debate as he lumped allegations against Bill Clinton with a claim about Hillary Clinton's attitude when she discussed her defense of a man accused of raping a child in 1975. Trump, asked about his offensive comments while taping a segment of Access Hollywood more than a decade ago, said, ""If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."" Trump continued: ""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight."" The alleged rape of a 12-year-old had nothing to do with Bill Clinton. Trump was suddenly, and without explanation, shifting gears to Hillary Clinton's successful defense of the alleged rapist after she was reluctantly assigned to the case. That's the part of Trump's claim we'll fact-check here. At the time, Clinton, 27, was working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. The accused man was indigent and specifically asked for a woman to represent him. He ultimately pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor, receiving a year in jail and four years' probation. When we asked the Trump campaign about the allegations, a spokesman referred us to a July 15, 2014, article in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, which uncovered audio recordings of Clinton, although it's not clear when the recordings were made. The Beacon says they date from 1983 to 1987. In the tapes, she calls it a ""terrible case"" and ""a fascinating case,"" for reasons that will become clear. The article notes that she can be heard laughing at several points on the tape, but it doesn't say she was laughing at the victim, as Trump claims. She is ""discussing the crime lab’s accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied (the accused man, Thomas Alfred) Taylor to the crime,"" destruction that led the prosecution to seek a plea deal on a lesser charge, according to the article. ​(For the record, DNA testing as we know it was years away, but labs did determine blood type in criminal cases in that era.) ""I plea bargained it down because it turned out they didn't have any evidence,"" Clinton says. In the tape, available on YouTube, Clinton says of the case, ""It's sad."" ""But you know what was sad about it was that the prosecutor had evidence,"" Clinton says. However, she recounts that the crime lab had taken a key piece of evidence — the accused man's underpants, which had blood on it — neatly cut out a piece, and then threw that piece away once testing was done, eliminating the ability to do independent testing. In this case, it's the interviewer, Arkansas journalist Roy Reed, who can be heard laughing, not Clinton. On the tape, in which Reed laughs a few more times at her story, Clinton can be heard chortling when she reports that the prosecutor didn't want her to see the underwear before it was presented at trial. Defense attorneys have the right to see all the evidence first. And when the judge is considering the plea deal, Clinton recounts that the judge wanted her to leave the room while he talked to the accused man. Clinton says she told the judge, ""Judge, I can't leave the room. I'm his lawyer."" The judge reportedly responded, ""I know, but I don't want to talk about this in front of you."" Again, Reed can be heard laughing after saying, ""Oh God. Really?"" It's not clear if Clinton is laughing as well. At another point, Clinton says of the accused man, ""I had him take a polygraph, which he passed — which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs."" She and the reporter laugh. And she laughs when she recalls telling the prosecution that she was prepared to bring in a top expert witness to testify ""to prevent this miscarriage of justice."" The reporter laughs as well. It should be noted that it's clear from the record that Clinton aggressively defended the man and did file motions questioning the victim's credibility. But there is no evidence, including this audio tape, that Clinton or Reed were laughing at the victim. Our ruling Trump said after Clinton helped a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, ""she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped."" Trump is referring to an audio tape in which she does respond with amusement at her recollections of the oddities of the case, which involve the prosecution and the judge. At no point does she laugh at the victim. We rate his claim False. CORRECTION, Oct. 18, 2016: This story was amended to note that the blood test referenced in the Washington Free Beacon story could not have been a true DNA match test. That technology was not available in 1975.",/factchecks/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-says-clinton-laughed-about-rape-case/

Clinton said terrorists use Trump's remarks about Muslims for recruitment
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton criticized Republican Donald Trump during their second debate for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Clinton questioned how such a religious test would be implemented, saying Trump’s comments have been ""extremely unwise and even dangerous."" ""And indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters,"" Clinton said at the Oct. 9 square-off in St. Louis, Mo. Trump has adjusted the temporary ban on Muslim immigrants he once proposed to say he would instead suspend immigration from regions with a ""proven history of terrorism."" Clinton has said before that Trump is being used ""to essentially be a recruiter"" for people to join the cause of terrorism. Earlier this year, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, issued a 51-minute video telling ""Muslims of the West"" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States. The video says the United States has a history of ""slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps."" It then shows a video of Donald Trump where he is calling ""for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" until United States representatives can figure out what is going on. Trump made that statement after the San Bernardino, Calif., attacks. The video calls for American Muslims to leave the United States and join the terrorist group, the Wall Street Journal reported. This spring, Newsweek also reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip of Trump speaking about Brussels. ""Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show,"" Trump says in the video, as ISIS lets the phrase ""absolute horror show"" repeatedly echo and fade. Clinton’s campaign sent us a Politico story about that video, pointing out that it also features ""English subtitles, musical accompaniment and a song of sorts, with the lyrics: ‘Brothers rise up! Claim your victory! Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go for jihad.’ "" Her campaign also pointed to Foreign Affairs and Time articles reporting that an ISIS spokesman wrote on ISIS-affiliated channel, ""I ask Allah to deliver America to Trump."" Trump’s campaign did not return requests for comment. Clinton is right about the Trump’s comments being incorporated into propaganda, but it’s difficult to know what effect his words have had on recruitment, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Obviously, we know less about how effective his comments have been as a recruiting tool -- reliable data is hard to come by,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""But that is how it's being used."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists' sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters."" An East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group has used a video clip of Trump in one of its videos, telling ""Muslims of the West"" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States and urging them to join the terrorist group, according to multiple news reports. While it’s difficult to determine how effective the videos are, at least one has featured Trump’s words.

Trump's Pants on Fire about his early-morning tweet on Alicia Machado
","During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump took issue with moderator Anderson Cooper’s description of an early morning tweet he had sent out about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Machado emerged up as an issue in the campaign during the first debate, when Hillary Clinton cited Machado’s allegations that Trump had called the Venezuela-born contestant ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping"" after she’d gained weight as Miss Universe. At the time, Trump was part-owner of the pageant. The next morning, Trump criticized Machado during a Fox and Friends interview. And Trump eventually brought the feud to Twitter. In the second debate on Oct. 9, Cooper cited the tweet in a question about whether Trump has the right temperament to be president. ""In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape,"" Cooper said. ""Is that the discipline of a good president?"" Trump responded, ""No, it wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just ‘take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout, who was no girl scout.’ "" Maybe that’s what Trump wanted people to read into it. But he did, in fact, direct his followers to check out a sex tape. In the tweet -- sent at 5:30 a.m. ET on Sept. 30 -- Trump wrote, ""Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?"" (For the record, no one has turned up a sex tape.)  Our ruling Trump said the tweet he sent out ""wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape’""  but rather to ""just take a look at"" Machado’s background.

Trump: Clinton won't use the term 'radical Islamic terrorists'
","In response to a question by a Muslim woman about anti-Muslim bias during the town hall presidential debate, Donald Trump said that the United States has a problem with ""radical Islamic terrorists,"" citing mass shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino. Trump then said that Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama won’t correctly define the problem. ""These are radical islamic terrorists and she won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,’"" Trump said during the Oct. 9 debate at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's radical Islamic terror."" In her response, Clinton used the phrase ""violent jihadist terrorists"" and said that the United States is not at war with Islam. ""And it is a mistake, and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are,"" she said. We’ve looked at Obama’s use of the term before; he doesn’t like to use it. For this fact-check, we will look at how Clinton describes radical Islamic terrorism. Clinton’s words The day after the mass shooting in Orlando, Clinton did a series of interviews in which she said she had no problem using the term ""radical Islamism"" or ""radical jihadist terrorism."" But she also said that the phrases were not ""magic words"" that would halt terrorism. ""From my perspective, it matters what we do more than what we say. And you know, it mattered we got bin Laden, not what name we called him,"" she said on CNN on June 13. ""Whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I'm happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing."" Clinton emphasizes a distinction between a ""distorted version of Islam"" and the religion itself. ""What I won't do, because I think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and, you know, declare war on an entire religion. That plays right into ISIS' hands,"" she said. ""We can call it radical jihadism, we can call it radical Islamism. But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion."" Clinton made similar comments in an interview on NBC Today. ""It matters what we do, not what we say. It mattered that we got bin Laden, not the name we called him,"" she said. ""But if he is somehow suggesting I don't call this for what it is, he hasn't been listening. I have clearly said that we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. And, to me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing. I'm happy to say either, but that's not the point."" On MSNBC's Morning Joe she said: ""I have clearly said many, many times we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them and we will. We have to defeat radical jihadist terrorism or radical Islamism, whatever you call it -- it’s the same. But we cannot demonize, demagogue and declare war on an entire religion."" We sent a spokesman for Trump a copy of Clinton’s remarks about ""radical Islamism"" and he replied ""has she said the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism?’ "" In a speech in Cleveland June 13, she stuck to the phrase ""radical jihadists."" Obama has said he doesn’t use the term because it would actually bolster into the narrative of ISIS and al-Qaida that the West is at war with Islam. ""If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims as a broad brush and imply that we are at war with the entire religion, then we are doing the terrorists' work for them,"" he said. This echoes what Obama has previously said about ISIS and isn’t all that different from former President George W. Bush’s language following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and at the onset of the war in Afghanistan. ""This great nation of many religions understands, our war is not against Islam, or against faith practiced by the Muslim people. Our war is a war against evil,"" Bush said in January 2002. Our ruling Trump said of Clinton, ""These are radical Islamic terrorists and she won't even mention the word."" After the Orlando shooting, Clinton said she had no problem saying ""radical Islamism"" which is similar but not the same as ""radical Islamic terrorism.""She has also said that leaders should be careful not to demonize the religion of Islam, and that the United States needs specific strategies to fight ISIS.
