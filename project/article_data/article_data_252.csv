Would Wisconsin's $3 billion to Foxconn be largest-ever 'gift' by any state to a foreign company?
","Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that when it comes to the $10 billion, 20 million-square-foot factory being promised to Wisconsin, some statements border on the extreme. Foxconn ""is bringing"" 13,000 jobs. Half True. 3,000 Foxconn jobs would cost Wisconsin $3 billion, or $1 million per job. False. Now comes a claim, made in response to a boast by Gov. Scott Walker, that the $3 billion incentives offer is the largest of its kind. The exchange occurred Aug. 7, 2017 exchange on Twitter, a week and a half after Foxconn, the maker of iPhones and other electronics, announced it would be coming to Wisconsin. Walker tweeted: Our bold reforms have prepared WI for Foxconn & thousands of jobs. Hard-working families will reap the benefits! #WIWinning One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, retorted: You are willing to give the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company. You got #foxconned, big guy. Wisconsin clearly isn’t offering a gift. The incentives are tied to Foxconn making investments in the plant and in payroll. But the best available source indicates the $3 billion would be the largest ever subsidy provided by a state to a foreign company. One Wisconsin Now’s evidence To back its claim, One Wisconsin Now cited June 2017 data from Good Jobs First, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that calls itself ""a leading monitor and critic of company-specific subsidy deals,"" and has called the the Foxconn deal ""a sure loser for Wisconsin taxpayers."" We checked with a number of experts on subsidies and none said they knew of any other compilation of subsidies. The experts include Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance; Jon Peacock, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project; and economists Michael Leeds of Temple University, Charley Ballard of Michigan State University, Jeffrey Michael of the University of Pacific in Stockton, Calif., Sean Snaith at the University of Central Florida; Ball State University’s Michael Hicks; and Tim Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. Hicks, who heads Ball State’s Center for Business and Economic Research, told us that while he hasn’t always agreed with analyses done by Good Jobs First, the group’s data on subsidies is solid. And Bartik said it is the best such database he knows. Here are the top 12 subsidies given to companies by states, cities or counties, according to Good Jobs First: Recipient company Parent company Subsidy (in billions) Year State City County Boeing Boeing $8.7 2013 WA Alcoa Alcoa $5.6 2007 NY Massena Boeing Boeing $3.24 2003 WA Everett General Motors General Motors $2.34 2009 MI Orion Township Oakland Ford Motor Ford Motor $2.3 2010 MI statewide Sempra Energy Sempra Energy $2.19 2013 LA Hackberry Cameron Nike Nike $2.02 2012 OR Beaverton Washington Intel Intel $2 2004 NM Rio Rancho Sandoval Intel Intel $2 2014 OR Hillsboro Washington Lake Charles LNG Export Company, LLC Energy Transfer $1.79 2015 LA Lake Charles Calcasieu Cheniere Energy Cheniere Energy $1.69 2010 LA Cameron Cameron Parish Royal Dutch Shell Royal Dutch Shell $1.65 2012 PA The top 11 subsidies are all for American companies. At No. 12 is the estimated $1.65 billion in tax credits Pennsylvania approved for Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in The Netherlands. That package of tax breaks over 25 years was aimed at getting the company to build an ethane refinery that would include a minimum investment of $1 billion and employ at least 2,500 people. Using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, $1.65 billion in 2012 was worth about $2.39 billion as of July 2017 -- so, still well below Wisconsin’s $3 billion offer to Foxconn. (The Good Jobs First database does not take inflation into account.) But there are at least two important points to consider. 1. The $3 billion wouldn’t be a gift, as One Wisconsin Now calls it. That’s the maximum amount the state would pay Foxconn, and only if the company spends roughly $18 billion -- about $9 billion for payroll and $9 billion in capital investments. 2. It’s difficult to calculate the value of the jobs that the various incentives are aimed at creating -- or keeping. Some jobs pay more than others, of course. And some businesses are more likely than others to attract suppliers that might, in turn, create more jobs in a state. Supporters of the Foxconn deal say Wisconsin would win a keystone manufacturer that would bring world-leading technology and attract suppliers that would create their own jobs. Critics say it amounts to a multibillion-dollar bet on a company that makes screens — a product subject to constant market-disrupting competition and innovation. Our rating One Wisconsin Now says Wisconsin's $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is ""the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company."" The $3 billion wouldn’t be given -- it would be paid, in increments, based on how much Foxconn spends on capital investments and payroll. But the only compilation of government subsidies we found shows that the Foxconn offer would exceed the highest subsidy provided to a foreign company -- $1.65 billion in 2012, made by Pennsylvania to Dutch Royal Shell, based in The Netherlands. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/15/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsins-3-billion-offer-foxconn-gift-and-it-lar/

Rick Baker PAC dramatizes Mayor Kriseman's inaction to candidate's 'go back to Africa' rant
","A TV ad in St. Petersburg’s contested mayoral election claims Rick Kriseman ""looked away"" when a fringe mayoral candidate made a racist statement, but the ad misleads about the specifics of the incident and ignores what transpired later. The ad paid for by a political action committee aligned with former Mayor Rick Baker, Seamless Florida, aims to contrast the ""virtue"" of Baker with that of Kriseman, comparing each man’s response to a racial tirade from longshot candidate Paul Congemi. Congemi told black activists at a July 18 candidate forum to ""go back to Africa,"" spurring widespread condemnation and negative national headlines. ""When Rick Baker heard that, he went after Congemi,"" the narrator in the ad says. ""Rick Kriseman, he just looked away. Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is."" The ad discusses an event that actually happened but distorts reality. We’ll explain why. On July 18, six mayoral candidates gathered in the City Council chambers to participate in a mayoral forum moderated by St. Petersburg’s League of Women Voters. The forum had a unique format that didn’t allow for debate. Some questions were addressed to all six candidates, and other questions were only addressed to half of the panel. If a question was only addressed to half of the panel, then a candidate who was not asked could wave a ""wildcard"" to signal that he or she wanted to answer the question. Candidates were given three wildcards and were told that there would be no opportunities for rebuttals. For the first 30 minutes, the forum went on without a hitch. That changed when Congemi used his wildcard to respond to a question about how to provide recreational activities for youth in the city. The question was only addressed to Theresa ""Momma Tee"" Lassiter, Kriseman, and Jesse Nevel, national chairman of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, which helps organizes white support for black-led community social justice.  ""Mr. Nevel, you and your people, you talk about reparations,"" Congemi said. ""The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama."" Amid boos from the crowd, Congemi added: ""My advice to you, my advice to you, if you don’t like it here in America, planes leave every hour. Go back to Africa, go back to Africa."" Kriseman was seated next to Congemi. As Congemi talked about reparations, Kriseman can be seen with sealed lips, looking around. Another angle shows Kriseman glancing at the crowd and then looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst.  VIDEO: Paul Congemi, cand for mayor of @StPeteFL tells activists in debate their ""reparations were Barack Obama"" and to ""go back to Africa"" pic.twitter.com/QlSmDhGAPw After Congemi’s remarks the crowd continued to bellow in opposition and Nevel called Congemi a ""nonfactor"", but it settled after candidate Anthony Cates III, who is African-American, used his wildcard. He did not address what Congemi said, talking instead about a charity he worked with that helped students. After Cates spoke, the moderator asked all six candidates how they would approach the homeless population. Kriseman was the first to answer, and he didn’t mention Congemi. Kriseman said his administration had invested money to help family homelessness in the community. The question then went to Lassiter and Nevel, who also didn’t mention what Congemi said (though Nevel did dismiss him as a ""nonfactor"" in the midst of Congemi’s rant). However, when it was Baker’s turn to talk, he called out Congemi. To reiterate my comments at the debate last night. I reject Mr. Congemi's offensive remarks. They have no place in the public discourse. pic.twitter.com/sqZ4wPLRLR ""I know we’re not supposed to respond to other things, but I first have to specifically reject the comments Mr. Congemi just made,"" Baker said. ""I just think in 2017 in St. Petersburg, Florida, I never would have dreamed we would've heard comments like that at a mayoral debate."" That night, Twitter erupted with video of Congemi’s remarks, and the Washington Post wrote about the situation early the next day. A little past noon on July 19, Kriseman rejected the racist remarks on Twitter, Facebook, and in a television interview. ""It is simply unacceptable to spew this kind of bigoted rhetoric,"" he said. ""Free speech should not compromise the dignity and respect of any person or community"" He said he didn’t want to bring more attention to the remarks at the time, adding that he regretted not speaking out then and there. ""I was reluctant to engage this candidate last night and draw even more attention to his disturbing message,"" Kriseman wrote on Facebook. ""I regret not doing so, though."" I was reluctant to draw even more attention to his disturbing message. I shouldn't have been. https://t.co/cCMHH5oGXV https://t.co/XuRrhsMfn3 Congemi’s last runs for mayor only garnered a few hundred votes. In 2009, Congemi referred to homosexuality as an ""abomination"" and spoke out against the St. Pete Pride festival. Kriseman’s campaign said he has a long record of standing up against discrimination and pointed to his record of denouncing President Donald Trump's decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military as well as his proposal during the campaign to ban Muslims.  Our ruling A television ad paid for by Rick Baker’s PAC said he condemned racist comments from another candidate while Kriseman ""just looked away."" Baker did speak up during the mayoral forum. In doing so, he acknowledged that he was going against the organizers’ rules by not sticking to the question at hand and revisiting earlier comments. Kriseman did not comment on what Congemi said that night. Neither did four other candidates at the forum. Kriseman waited until the next day, and was criticized for it. He said he did not want to bring more attention to the message in the moment but regretted not doing so. The admaker misleads viewers by neglecting to include Kriseman's later condemnation of what Congemi said. This ad is partially accurate but omits substantial information about what happened.

Charlottesville hit-and-run driver was anti-fascist activist, Internet post claims
","Internet posts claim an anti-Trump liberal was behind the wheel of the Dodge Challenger that drove into a crowd in Charlottesville, Va., killing one and injuring 19 others. But the posts are based on false, distorted and discredited information. The headline on an Aug. 12, 2017, PuppetStringNews.com post read, ""Friendly Fire … Charlottesville Car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter."" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to fight fake news. The PuppetStringNews.com story said someone named Joel Vangheluwe (pronounced ""vangelloway,"" with a hard g) — and not the suspect arrested, James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio — drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a ""Unite the Right"" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested. Soon after, PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said the Challenger had actually belonged to Vangheluwe, who was ""a known antifa/anti Trump supporter."" Antifa is shorthand for antifascist. It’s a catch-all term for demonstrators who organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence. The loosely coordinated movement has roots in antifascist groups in Germany, Italy and Spain before World War II, and has grown increasingly visible in its opposition to Trump and his ""alt-right"" supporters. PuppetStringNews.com alleged that Vangheluwe, whose Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home, drove the Challenger into the crowd to make it look like a Trump supporter had attacked the protesters. There’s no proof Vangheluwe was involved in any way. Ohio vehicle records showed the 2010 Dodge Challenger is currently registered to Fields, who was at the Charlottesville rally and arrested shortly after the incident. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, and was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14. The PuppetStringNews.com post included a batch of images of Facebook and Instagram posts from Joel Vangheluwe and registration information from SearchQuarry.com that showed Joel’s father, Jerome, had once owned the car: It appears these images originated on 4chan.org, an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories. But none of the so-called evidence showed anything proving Vangheluwe was a violent, left-wing extremist. One Facebook image dated July 4, 2015, that was posted on PuppetStringNews.com showed Vangheluwe did have a liberal bent: ""Nationalism is brainwash, we'll always be separated until we come together, shit man the world and its people are beautiful. Not just America, pro world,"" Vangheluwe’s caption read. Another image apparent in the PuppetStringNews.com post showed a June 15 Instagram photo of Vangheluwe wearing a shirt with Jimi Hendrix on it. Vangheluwe’s selfie was simply announcing two art shows in Detroit: The most outspoken post on any of his social media profiles looked to be from Jan. 24, when he wrote, ""If only Trump was aborted"" as a Facebook status: The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe. Sommerman said that Jerome Vangheluwe, Joel’s father, did own the Challenger years ago, and that Joel Vangheluwe did not like Trump, but any implications beyond that are, to use Sommerman’s word, ""nuts."" ""He said some negative things about Trump that aren’t nice,"" Sommerman said. ""He doesn’t support the president in everything he does."" PuppetStringNews.com said, ""Charlottesville Car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter."" Most importantly, the car used in the incident is registered to the man currently in custody, not Vangheluwe. The site made the implication based on Vangheluwe’s social media posts, but a closer look revealed that even those posts didn’t reveal very much. We pored over the examples PuppetStringNews.com cited and looked through Vangheluwe’s public profiles. There was evidence Vangheluwe did not support Trump, which his lawyer confirmed, but there was nothing to suggest he was a destructive radical bent on violence.

Post wrongly says Charlottesville police arrested wrong person in hit and run
","Police in Charlottesville, Va., arrested an Ohio man in connection with the hit-and-run death of a woman protesting a white supremacist rally, but an online post alleged authorities were covering up for the real culprit.

Police arrested James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio, after a 2010 Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a ""Unite the Right"" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested. PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said police had the wrong man.

""This James Alex Fields subject is simply being used to make it look like a Right Wing attack, when he has no ties to the Dodge Challenger that was used...Unlike the Vangheluwe family who owns the car,"" the post read. But the post, which appears to get its roots from an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories, is based on inaccurate information. Here’s what we know. A statement from the city of Charlottesville said the Challenger rear-ended a sedan, which in turn hit a minivan, pushing the minivan into an intersection filled with pedestrians. ""The Dodge Challenger fled the scene, but was located and stopped a short time later by Charlottesville Police,"" the statement read. Fields was identified by police as the driver and was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14. Fields was photographed at the Charlottesville rally, and news reports said he had told his mother in Ohio that he was going there. A former high school teacher also noted Fields had shown an unusual interest in Nazi history. But what about the car supposedly belonging to the Vangheluwes? We checked vehicle records and found that it did once belong to Jerome Vangheluwe, who bought it in 2009. Joel Vangheluwe had posted a photo of the Challenger on Oct. 16, 2011, with the caption ""My car when I turn 16."" But Jerome Vangheluwe sold the car in 2012. It then went to another owner for almost three years. It was sold again on May 13, 2016, and registered under its current Ohio license plate, GVF 1111, which has been shown in photos from Charlottesville. News reports concur the car is registered to Fields. After the posts blaming Joel Vangheluwe started appearing, he posted Facebook status updates on Aug. 12 denying he was the driver. ""im not the one, im from fucking michigan you idiots,"" he first posted. His Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home. Vangheluwe followed that with, ""i drive a 2009 chevy impala, not a challenger, fuck the internet"" The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe. PuppetStringNews.com said, ""Virginia Police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters."" The website alleged that the Vangheluwe family owned the 2010 Dodge Challenger used in the Charlottesville tragedy.

Democrats mislead in attack linking Florida Senate candidate to Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare
","Florida Democrats are trying to attach President Donald Trump to the Republican in a Miami state Senate race seen as a crucial battleground. Millions of dollars are expected to be spent on the race between former Republican state Rep. Jose Felix Diaz and Democrat Annette Taddeo for Senate District 40. The Sept. 26 special election was called to replace Sen. Frank Artiles, who resigned after using sexist and racist language. The Florida Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the state Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, released a new TV ad featuring Taddeo. It links Diaz to Trump’s support for repealing Obamacare — using a photo of Diaz and Trump together at the inauguration as more proof of their lockstep bond. ""Jose Felix Diaz supports Trump's every move including his plan to slash Medicare, charge older Americans an age tax and cut coverage for pre-existing conditions,"" states the ad. The ad is referencing Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare and is a nod to efforts in the U.S. House and Senate to repeal and replace the law. Diaz was a consistent vote against the Affordable Care Act as a statehouse member, even though his actions could not influence the federal law. But the ad exaggerates the support Diaz lent to the U.S. House and Senate legislation this year. He has mostly been quiet on the issue. The Democrats offered no proof of Diaz speaking in favor of the Obamacare repeal proposals that Congress debated and voted on in 2017. Diaz has avoided the topic in his bid for state Senate. That isn’t too surprising since if he wins, he would have no ability to vote on a federal replacement. We could not find any evidence in news archives or campaign literature showing Diaz weighing in on federal proposals in recent months to repeal or replace Obamacare. That’s a problem for the Democrats’ accusation. In the absence of any supportive Diaz comments, the Democrats detailed four anti-Obamacare votes Diaz took as a state representative in 2011 and 2012. Those votes were largely symbolic, and they had no connection to the specific policy advocated in the GOP repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress in recent months. (The risk to Medicare patients, an ""age tax"" and charging Americans more for pre-existing conditions were specific consequences of parts of those bills, as determined by health care analysts.) Resisting the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, was a persistent theme for the Republican-led Legislature when Diaz served. • In 2011, Diaz co-sponsored a bill to prohibit most individuals from being forced to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. Although the bill passed, it could not supercede federal law. In a debate on CBS4 Miami Aug. 13, Taddeo attacked Diaz for voting on a bill that ""essentially dismantled Obamacare."" Diaz responded: ""The state cannot dismantle anything so I’m not even sure what that means."" • In 2011, Diaz also voted for the ""Health Care Freedom Act"" bill to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban individuals from being forced to buy insurance or companies from having to provide insurance. Florida voters rejected it in 2012. • In 2012, Diaz voted in favor of a bill to urge Congress to repeal the federal health care law. It passed the Florida House but died in the Senate. • In 2012, Diaz voted for an amendment within an appropriations bill in support of providing funds to challenge the constitutionality of the federal law. (The amendment was essentially a political move -- Attorney General Bill McCollum already sued in 2010 to challenge the federal law and Pam Bondi later took over that effort.) The Democrats offered one piece of evidence from 2017, but it also does not prove Diaz supported any of the repeal proposals. Diaz was one of several Florida lawmakers invited to Washington in February for two days of closed-door meetings with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio to discuss the Affordable Care Act, flood insurance, water issues and tax reform. After the meetings concluded, Rubio said that ""among the issues we discussed, repealing and replacing ObamaCare was a top priority."" There is no public record to review whether Diaz mentioned repeal. (The Tampa Bay Times posted a video after the meeting in which Rubio, seated at a table with Diaz and other state lawmakers, spoke on a variety of issues, including his criticism of Obamacare. Diaz did not speak.) In the CBS4 debate, Diaz said during his visit to Washington, D.C. ""I did not advocate for anything that had to do with dismantling Obamacare."" When we asked Diaz about his position on the repeal and replace efforts, the statement we received didn’t clearly answer if he favored the proposals. He replied that many voters in the district ""believe that Obamacare is a failed product"" and said if ""Obamacare is indeed repealed, we need to ensure that everyone that is currently covered continues to be covered, including pre-existing conditions."" Campaign spokesman David Custin pointed to an effort by Diaz to expand health care coverage as a state House member in 2016. Diaz sponsored a bill that allowed eligible children of legal immigrants to apply for the state and federal Kidcare program. The language was folded into another bill that became law. Before we issue our ruling, we wanted to briefly explain the other points in the ad about the Republican plans to repeal or replace Obamacare in the U.S. House and Senate. While the House narrowly passed a bill in May, the Senate failed to pass a new plan in July before it went on recess. While the GOP health care plan didn’t include explicit changes to Medicare, the legislation could hurt the 11 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are dual enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. These ""dual eligibles"" would be affected by congressional efforts to cut and cap Medicaid funding, according to the Commonwealth Fund. The so-called ""age tax"" already exists, although GOP plans would have made it even steeper. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. House and Senate bills increased the ratio up to five times. While that change would reduce premiums for younger people, it would increase premiums for older people in that age bracket. The Affordable Care Act included a ban on denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The House GOP plan had literal language which said that insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions, but it didn’t address costs. The legislation would have allowed insurers to set premiums based on the ""health status"" of individuals -- which would have meant higher costs for sicker patients with pre-existing conditions. One more time: We don’t know Diaz’s position on these bills. A Florida Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee TV ad says Diaz supports Trump's ""plan to slash Medicare, charge older Americans an age tax and cut coverage for pre-existing conditions."" The ad provides no evidence that Diaz, as a state representative and now a state Senate candidate, has taken stances on the efforts in 2017 by Trump and Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate to repeal or replace Obamacare. Instead, the Democrats point to a series of anti-Obamacare votes Diaz took in the state House years ago that ask Congress to repeal the law and declare opposition to the individual mandate. Those votes aren’t mentioned in the ad, and they obviously don’t address support for the 2017 proposals in Congress that analysts said would hurt some Medicare users and lead to higher costs for older adults and people with pre-existing conditions. Votes by Diaz show that he opposed the federal law while in the statehouse, but that’s not what the Democrats’ ad says.

Perdue cites data on immigrant households benefiting from social welfare programs
","One argument supporters make for limiting legal immigration is that a significant share end up on social welfare programs. ""The majority come here on family-based visas, without regard to their skills or our needs. As a result, half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system,"" wrote Sen. David Perdue in an Aug. 8 op-ed in USA Today, co-bylined with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. Perdue and Cotton sponsored the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act, or RAISE Act, which President Donald Trump has endorsed. Currently, the country accepts about 1 million new immigrants a year. Research has found that about 50 percent of households headed by an immigrant (living here legally or illegally) do benefit from government assistance programs. In many of those households, it’s a U.S.-born child who is eligible for a program. Perdue’s and Cotton’s offices told us their claim relied on a September 2015 study from Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. Using data from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, the study found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported having used at least one welfare program during the year, compared with 30 percent of native-born households. The study factored in the following programs: Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); Women, Infants, and Children food program (WIC); free or subsidized school lunches; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as the Food Stamp program); Medicaid, and public housing and rent subsidies. The report said a household was using welfare if any member used a program during 2012. An immigrant household included foreign-born individuals (such as naturalized U.S. citizens, green card holders and unauthorized immigrants) as well as U.S.-born children who were eligible for a welfare program. Some immigrant households also had members who were native-born adults. Though there is a 1996 law restricting immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a ""qualified alien"" (the classification includes lawful permanent residents), the majority of authorized immigrants have been here for more than five years, the study said. As a result, that law ""has only a modest impact on the share of immigrant households receiving one or more welfare programs,""  Camarota wrote. Compared with native-born individuals, immigrants have higher levels of poverty primarily because they are relatively less likely to be employed and on average earn lower wages, and it takes time for the newly arrived ""to move up the job ladder and for the poor among them to lift themselves and their children out of poverty,"" said a 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Leighton Ku, a health policy professor and director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, criticized the report from the Center for Immigration Studies for using an overly broad definition of benefits that most people probably would not think as welfare. All school lunches, for example, get some federal subsidy, whether full price or not, Ku said. ""Does this mean that all school children are getting welfare?"" he asked. Ku in 2013 co-authored a paper concluding that low-income immigrants use public benefits at a lower rate than low-income native-born citizens. Ku’s and Camarota’s methodology differed. For instance, Ku’s analysis focused on individuals by immigration status, not on households headed by immigrants. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told us that the school lunch program isn’t like other programs traditionally considered welfare. It’s a nutrition program, and does not have the same work, citizenship or other requirements that actual welfare programs do. And it’s not always means-tested, as for example some schools in low-income areas provide free or reduced lunches to all students,"" she said. But excluding school lunch recipients doesn’t change the numbers that much. Camarota in his study said that if subsidized school lunch was excluded from the equation, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent (compared with 28 percent for native households). That’s only slightly lower than Perdue’s claim that about ""half"" of immigrant households receive welfare benefits. The National Academies report found similar numbers of about 45 percent when looking at various public benefits. It examined benefits used by immigrant and U.S.-born households, both with children. The report found that ""cash assistance"" such as SSI and TANF was low for both sets of households, around 6 percent. ""Cash assistance is what we generally think of as ‘welfare’ for households with children in which the adults cannot work or have difficulty finding jobs,"" Mittelstadt said. But food assistance and Medicaid participation was much higher for immigrant households than for U.S.-born households, she said. About 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and 46 percent Medicaid, according to the report. Perdue said, ""Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system."" Cash assistance for immigrants is very low, about 6 percent, but there are other programs from which immigrants benefit, and Perdue cited benefits broadly. Research from the Center for Immigration Studies found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported to have used at least one welfare program during the year. That percentage includes a broad definition of welfare, including school lunch. Excluding subsidized school lunches, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent, according to the study. The study included as welfare beneficiaries immigrant households in which a U.S.-born child is benefitting from a welfare program.

Infowars' Alex Jones falsely says George Soros, Hillary Clinton instigated Charlottesville violence
","Alex Jones, a conspiracy-minded conservative commentator, said the Charlottesville, Va., protests and counter-protests on Aug. 11-12, were staged acts of civil unrest funded by liberal interests to hurt conservatives and President Donald Trump. In a pair of videos posted on his website Infowars.com, Jones accused the Southern Poverty Law Center of going to ""central casting"" to hire actors to ""dress up as white supremacists."" There is no evidence that is true, and Jones provided no evidence to support his claim in his video. Jones then claimed the foundation for the Charlottesville protests is seen in emails between the Democratic Party and George Soros, a billionaire who often supports liberal causes. ""It was clear once Trump got inaugurated, they were going to go for civil unrest,"" Jones said. ""If you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’ ""Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ ""These are quotes. Hundreds and hundreds of emails,"" Jones said."" We’ve covered them … linking to them."" While Jones offered no evidence the Charlottesville protests were staged, he did say there are quotes from Soros, Clinton or Democratic Party officials in emails talking about controlling minorities and stoking fear in the public to ""keep them desperate"" and ""keep control of them."" So we decided to see if there is any evidence of that. We couldn’t find any. (We reached out to Jones through the media contact form on his Infowars.com website and did not hear back.) For this fact-check, we consulted three email batches Jones could be talking about -- the emails Hillary Clinton made public during her time as secretary of state (search the government database), the leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta (search the Podesta emails), or the leaked emails of the Democratic National Committee (search the DNC email database). Jones claimed the ""Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into the free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’"" There are 15 emails in the DNC email database that mention the word ""Soros,"" and five of those come from Politico email newsletters. Of the remaining 10, five reference news coverage and one is text of a speech from Trump referencing Soros (""Forget Soros, leave him alone, he’s got enough problems."") The other four are from May 22, 2016, and discuss a mobile application someone was building to support the Democratic nominee. The developer of the application was looking for funding for the project, including from Soros. We also searched under Soros’ Open Society Foundation or OSF. We found four additional emails, the most interesting of which appears to be a communications officer for OSF trying to schedule a tour of the White House. We did find an email, which Infowars has written about, that Soros sent to Clinton while she was secretary of state (see the email). The 2011 email is about unrest in Albania, which included a series of anti-government protests amid corruption charges. In the email, Soros asks Clinton to bring ""the full weight of the international community"" to try and ease tensions in the country. Soros writes that he is particularly concerned of the actions of Albania’s prime minister and that Soros has heard of videotape showing national guard members firing on demonstrators. Infowars also has written about a 2014 email from Podesta’s account in which Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Clinton would only attend a fundraiser for a Soros-supported group, America Votes, ""to make Soros happy."" The most recent emails leaked from Podesta’s account are from March 2016, and seem to be related to a meeting between Soros and Podesta. ""In general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se, though I can’t imagine you won’t spend some time on politics,"" Soros aide Michael Vachon wrote (read the email). ""In a separate email I will send you George’s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine. Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the US as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally."" Here’s the bottom line: Whatever the emails say about Soros’ access to top Democrats, including Clinton, they don’t say anything akin to what Jones claimed. It’s a bit easier to triangulate what Jones was talking about when he said, ""Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them. Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ "" He’s likely referring to leaked audio of a February 2016 Clinton fundraiser in which Clinton was talking about the supporters of Bernie Sanders. Infowars wrote about this, too. Here is what Clinton said (bold emphasis is ours): Clinton: ""Some are new to politics completely. They’re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents’ basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don’t see much of a future. I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said, ""You know, none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college. And we don’t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance."" So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics. And so if you’re feeling like you’re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot, and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be, you know, a wet blanket on idealism. We want people to be idealistic. We want them to set big goals. But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals."" You can listen to the comments here, courtesy of the Intercept, but you can see how Jones distorts Clinton’s comments. Jones said Democrats wanted to keep ""people in their mother’s basement as baristas,"" to ""control them,"" ""keep them desperate."" But Clinton was talking about people new to politics who grew up at a time when opportunities were difficult to find. She never once discussed controlling or keeping people desperate. Clinton did face criticism for describing Sanders supporters as people living in their parents’ basement, but that’s not what Jones was saying.   Jones said, ""if you go back to the Wikileaks, from over a year ago, the Democratic Party is sending emails to George Soros and back and forth at the highest levels of the Democratic Party saying, ‘We’re losing the public. Minorities are getting into free market. We (Democrats) want to keep people in their mother’s basement as baristas.’ ""Remember even Hillary said that. ‘What are we going to do to keep control of them? Keep them in the dark, keep them desperate.’ Jones' comments were part of a broader accusation that the events in Charlottesville were staged by liberals and coordinated by top Democrats. We can find no evidence that Jones’ broad attack, or his specific claim about comments made by Soros, Clinton or Democrats in emails, checks out. Clinton did describe supporters of Bernie Sanders as working as baristas or living in their parents’ basements. But that’s well short of what Jones alleged.

Did Dwayne the Rock Johnson officially file to run for president in 2020?
","It’s never too early on social media to stir up interest about the next presidential election in 2020 -- especially if the buzz features a potential candidate who’s a bona fide celebrity. On Aug. 9, Rearfront.com -- a viral-content website that describes itself as a ""powerhouse of generating awesomeness"" -- posted an item headlined about former pro wrestler and popular actor Dwayne Johnson, sometimes known as ""the Rock."" It said: ""Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign And Twitter Is Already Going Crazy."" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post had attracted 16,700 views through Aug. 11. So we decided to take a closer look. As it turns out, the headline and some of the text in the article offered a garbled account of what had actually happened. Johnson, reportedly an independent, has indeed flirted with making a presidential run in 2020, though it remains to be seen how serious his is about a bid. In May, when he hosted the season finale of NBC’s Saturday Night Live, Johnson joined with fellow actor Tom Hanks under a large banner reading ""Johnson Hanks 2020"" as confetti flooded the stage. Johnson talked about the growing buzz about a candidacy with GQ writer Caity Weaver in June 2017. Weaver wrote: ""Johnson doesn't hesitate when I ask him whether he honestly might one day give up his life as the highest-paid movie star on earth — which is unquestionably easier, more fun, and more lucrative than being president of the United States — in order to run for office. 'I think that it's a real possibility,’ he says solemnly."" Then someone took it seriously and filed papers with the Federal Election Commission -- but contrary to the Rearfront.com article, it wasn’t Johnson. On July 9, Kenton Tilford of Wheeling, W. Va., filed paperwork to formally establish ""Run The Rock 2020."" It is what’s known as a draft committee -- an organization created ""solely to draft an individual or to encourage him or her to become a candidate for federal office,"" according to the Federal Election Commission. The paperwork says that the committee supports ""only one candidate … Dwayne Douglas Johnson."" Where the Rearfront.com item gets it wrong is when it says that Johnson himself has ""officially filed"" as a 2020 presidential candidate. That is flatly wrong. The paperwork itself clarifies Run the Rock 2020 ""is NOT an Authorized Committee,"" meaning that it was not established by the candidate being supported. The Run the Rock 2020 website offers T-shirts for $20.20 to fund its grassroots effort.   Tilford confirmed to PolitiFact that the Rearfront.com post ""is indeed incorrect."" ""I have not been in touch with Mr. Johnson or his representatives,"" Tilford told PolitiFact. ""I'm simply a private citizen who formed a draft committee to rally like-minded people around the goal of encouraging him to run. As far as I know, Mr. Johnson and his representatives have not commented on the matter. We filed paperwork with the FEC because we hope to raise money and develop a real presence to show him the energy on the ground for his candidacy."" That explanation squares with what Tilford had earlier told several other news outlets that he has not talked to Johnson himself. According to his LinkedIn page, Tilford graduated from Knox College in 2012 and has worked on campaigns in New Jersey and Louisiana. He was also a field organizer for Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign in Clayton County, Iowa. We did not hear back from two representatives of Johnson’s camp.

Scoop, toss and spin: Digging into Rahm Emanuel's budget claim
","It’s not easy finding silver linings in the dark clouds that define Chicago city finances, but Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his spin machine are doing their best. Fresh off unveiling a preliminary Fiscal Year 2018 budget that forecasts a deficit of $114 million -- the city’s smallest in 11 years -- Emanuel focused on the sun behind the clouds that have led him to pile on city debt at very high interest rates and cope with a major rating agency downgrading the city’s credit rating to junk bond status. ""Every one of the financial bad management practices that I inherited, every one of them, have either been eliminated or cut significantly,"" Emanuel said after the report’s July 31 release. He repeated the claim on Aug. 9 in an address to the Chicago Investors Conference. Has Emanuel really rid city budget-making of the practices from the days of former Mayor Richard M. Daley that dug the hole from which he’s now trying to lift Chicago? What are these ""financial bad management practices?"" And, perhaps most important of all, has he set city finances on a distant path to soundness or is he merely trying to perfume a fiscal pig. We decided to check. The assertion brought to mind a curious public relations stunt Emanuel trotted out occasionally for the TV cameras in the early months of his administration. He would pose in front of a giant scorecard filled with goals he had set for himself that were then checked off as accomplished. In sum, Emanuel wrote the test and then declared he had aced it. A sense of déjà vu came over us when we contacted the mayor’s Office of Management and Budget for an explanation of Emanuel’s claim to have weeded out the bad old days of city financial management. Spokeswoman Molly Poppe provided an extensive list and explanation of the practices to which Emanuel referred. They were outlined, she said, in a speech Emanuel delivered to The Civic Federation, a government finance watchdog group, on April 29, 2015, three weeks after his election to a second term. * Ending by 2019 the practice of ""scoop and toss"" in which the city pays short-term expenses with long-term debt;   * Ending risky ""swaps"" in the City’s general obligation debt portfolio;   * Converting all of the City’s general obligation variable debt to fixed-rate;   * Pay legal settlements from operating funds, rather than with long-term debt * Replenish the city’s ""rainy day fund"" -- a pool of money maintained to deal with immediate emergencies -- from which $1.2 billion had been removed for operating expenses from 2009 to 2011. Here again, Emanuel is setting his own benchmarks then declaring them met. By that standard at least, there may be merit to the chest-thumping. On the other hand, the suggestion that the mayor has fixed or is fixing ""every one"" of the bad financial practices he inherited suggests the arrow is pointing up for city finances when a range of other meaningful indicators is still flashing a bright red danger sign. In its analysis of Emanuel’s 2017 budget, the Civic Federation noted that the administration had adhered to its pledge to gradually wean the city from ""scoop and toss"" borrowing and borrowing to pay legal settlements. The budget ""makes significant improvements from its past practices by continuing to reduce ‘scoop and toss’ borrowing by $63 million in FY2017 and incorporating large expenses such as judgements and settlements into its operating budget rather than funding them through borrowing,"" the Civic Federation reported. Between FY 2015 and FY 2017, ""scoop and toss"" debt refinancing fell from $225 million to $62 million. ""Scoop and toss"" is such a bad practice that the audience at the Aug. 9 Chicago Investors Conference burst into applause when Emanuel mentioned in his speech his intent to stop it entirely by 2019. It’s a practice that was used throughout city government to mask operating costs by turning them into long-term debt. The Chicago Tribune described it as ""equivalent to taking out a 30-year mortgage to buy a car and making your children — or grandchildren — pay it off, with interest."" Whether the 2019 termination target represents a laudable accomplishment or the unnecessary prolonging of the city’s addiction to a terrible fiscal practice is open to debate. ""I would have liked to have seen them stopping that practice earlier,"" said Richard Ciccarone, president and CEO of the municipal finance analysis firm Merritt Research Services and an audience member at Emanuel’s speech. The termination of risky swaps and variable-rate debt are covered in the city’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports for 2015 and 2016. These practices subjected city debt to changing interest rates, much the way variable-rate mortgages affect homeowners. The interest rate is low when the loan is taken out but can skyrocket at any time due to changing market conditions. To avoid borrowing to finance legal settlements and judgments, the city steadily increased the amount it budgeted from $28.7 million in 2012 to $46.7 million this year, Poppe said, allowing the city by 2016 to avoid borrowing for these costs. The city also no longer uses proceeds from the long-term lease of the Chicago Skyway or the infamous parking meter privatization to balance its budget. Since 2012, only interest from those deals has been transferred to the city’s main checking account. The policy has added $40 million to the city’s ""rainy day"" reserves, a pool of money maintained ""to mitigate current and future risks, emergencies, or unanticipated budget shortfalls."" The current principal balance is roughly $620 million with an additional $17 million in interest income pending transfer. On its face, Emanuel’s statement appears to hold up. But face value rarely delivers the whole story in politics, and a deeper look is required here. Clearly, Emanuel intended to convey that city government had turned the page on its long history of irresponsible budget practices. Emanuel first made the claim about ending the bad practices he inherited during his presentation of the city’s 2018 Annual Financial Analysis on July 31. That also was when he noted that the expected $114 million gap was the smallest the city had faced since 2007. (The preliminary budget is an early snapshot of how the next city budget would fare without spending cuts or tax and fee increases, which typically get added on later to bring the real budget into balance.) But the headlines in the days immediately afterward focused on $70 million that was not included in the budget projection but will be spent next year as Emanuel fulfills his promise to add hundreds of officers to the Chicago Police Department. ""I should know by now: In dealing with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration, you never take anything at face value because you're always being spun,"" wrote Crain’s Chicago Business political columnist Greg Hinz after noticing the $70 million omission. Indeed, Emanuel since his earliest days as mayor has displayed a proclivity for downplaying key pieces of information that may punch holes in financial claims. The pledge to break the bad habits we’re discussing here didn’t come until Emanuel won reelection to his second term in April 2015. Less than two weeks later, Moody’s Investors Service dropped the city’s bond rating to junk status, although other rating agencies have not gone that far. Emanuel has stressed that some ratings agencies have upgraded the city’s long term financial outlook from negative to stable. Still, Emanuel’s pledge to change things didn’t come until 18 months after the Chicago Tribune exposed the depth of the city’s fiscal rot in a devastating investigative series titled ""Broken Bonds."" The Administration’s Annual Financial Analysis explains the mayor’s rationale for leaving out the police costs this way: ""In addition to addressing the 2018 operating deficit, the City will move forward with the second year of its two-year hiring plan in the Chicago Police Department and further investments in training, technology and personnel to support police reform efforts by the Administration. This increased cost is not incorporated into the 2018 operating deficit as it is a new investment for the upcoming year, not an existing, structural expense currently in the City’s corporate budget."" (Click here and scroll to the section ""2018 Corporate Fund Projections"" for more detail.) No matter how it’s labeled, the cost of new CPD personnel, along with the official budget gap projection of $114 million, will be borne by Chicago taxpayers. Emanuel has not discussed how the city will close the gap and pay for the new police ""investment."" Things got even more complicated on Aug. 11, when Chicago Public Schools announced it faces a $269 million shortfall in its 2018 budget and wants the city to fill the gap. And while the city appears to be following Emanuel’s timeline on ending ""scoop and toss"" by 2019, city taxpayers still are getting hit hard by the practice. Cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools this year relied on it to generate $500 million in operating cash. As the Chicago Tribune noted, city taxpayers ultimately will pay $835 million in interest over the 30-year financing period. That’s a $1.35 billion investment for $500 million in operating capital that will be spent within two years. Technically, CPS is separate from Chicago city government, but Emanuel effectively controls both. Ciccarone noted that city officials ""have worked very hard"" to ensure that the bond market treats the two as separate entities. This is important because the school district’s finances are in far worse shape than the city’s. Emanuel says his administration has either ended or curtailed ""every one"" of the poor management practices that were in place when he took office in 2011. He described each of those practices in a speech in 2015 and his office provided explanations backed by official data of how each has been addressed. Yet while claiming a new era in good budget practices, the administration used budget-speak to keep the $70 million cost for Year 2 of Emanuel’s police plan out of the ""lowest-in-a-decade"" preliminary budget gap. Emanuel’s curtailment of expensive ""scoop and toss"" refinancing is admirable in city government, but it’s of little solace to property taxpayers who still foot the bill for it from Chicago Public Schools. Emanuel indeed inherited significant fiscal headaches from Daley, but fixes he is taking credit for like phasing out scoop and toss were initiated only after the problems were exposed by media investigations. It’s also worth noting that it wasn’t until after Emanuel won election to his second term that a major credit rating agency downgraded the city’s credit to near junk bond status, timing that suggests if nothing else he was slow to act.   Factoring in the caveats and history, we rate Emanuel’s statement Half True.    ",/factchecks/2017/aug/14/rahm-emanuel/scoop-toss-and-spin-digging-rahm-emanuels-budget-c/

How has gun crime changed since the SAFE Act?
","Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, says some of New York state’s gun control laws should be scrapped. The 2013 Secure Ammunition and Firearm Enforcement Act was supposed to reduce gun violence in New York. Collins says there’s no evidence that’s happened. ""Statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County,"" Collins said in an op-ed in The Buffalo News. Collins is sponsoring federal legislation to reverse parts of the SAFE Act that regulate rifles and shotguns. He says the law has been an unnecessary burden for gun owners across upstate New York. But is he right that the number of violent crimes with a firearm has been unchanged since 2013? Statewide data For the state as a whole, the numbers don't back up Collins' claim. In 2016, there were 10,007 violent crimes with a firearm reported to police,  according to data from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. In 2013, there were 12,235. The percentage of violent crimes with a firearm also fell from 16 percent in 2013 to 13.5 percent in 2016. Looked at another way, the number of firearm-related violent crimes per New York state resident also has declined. There were 62 firearm-related violent crimes reported for every 100,000 residents in 2013, compared with 50 for every 100,000 residents by 2016. The number of firearm-related violent crimes has decreased statewide each year since 2012, the first year New York City was included in the data. The number was already going down outside New York City before the SAFE Act in 2013. There were 5,340 violent firearm crimes reported to police outside New York City in 2008 — the most in the last decade. The count has only increased twice since, in 2012 and 2016. Erie County data In Erie County, the trend is different. Violent crimes with a firearm have been on the rise. Police in Erie County reported 1,154 violent crimes with a firearm in 2016 — more than any other county upstate. That’s up from 1,092 in 2013. The rate of firearm-related violent crimes has also increased, from 118 of those crimes for every 100,000 Erie County residents in 2013 to 125 in 2016. Collins’s view A spokesperson for Collins said he based his claim on an article from WKBW, a Buffalo news station. ""The SAFE Act has done little to keep Western New Yorkers safe and has taken away the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens,"" Collins spokesperson Sarah Minkel said in a statement responding to our findings. WKBW used the same data we did and presented the same results, though the article notes there have been ""no major changes in crime rate"" since 2013. Our ruling Collins said ""statistics show that violent crimes where a firearm is used have remained static since 2013 in both New York State and Erie County."" Statistics tell a different story. Violent crimes with a firearm have decreased statewide since 2013 and increased in Erie County. But correlation does not equal causation. Trends show violent crime with a firearm was already going down statewide before the SAFE Act.

Wisconsin offering to pay Taiwan tech firm Foxconn $1 million per job at manufacturing plant?
","When Republican Gov. Scott Walker said iPhone manufacturer Foxconn was bringing 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin, we drew the line on his exuberance at Half True. Even the Taiwanese company itself has said only there is potential for 13,000 jobs, and that its initial plans call for 3,000. But some Democrats, including state Rep. Melissa Sargent of Madison, have also been overly effusive in criticizing the up to $3 billion in incentives Walker wants to give Foxconn. Sargent, who made news in early 2017 for proposals to legalize marijuana and eliminate the state’s ""tampon tax,"" posted this tweet on Aug. 2, 2017 -- a week after Foxconn announced in the East Room at the White House that it had chosen Wisconsin for its first major American factory: 3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job. #foxconn She had already made the claim in her official newsletter. The idea that the state would pay incentives to Foxconn worth more than $1 million per job might sound absurd on its face. And as we’ll see, Sargent took down her tweet. But we are talking some colossal numbers here. Half-a-million dollars per job, anyone? No, it’s not $1 million per job Under the deal it made with the state, Foxconn agrees to invest $10 billion to construct a facility in Wisconsin and create up to 13,000 jobs. Wisconsin agrees to, among other things, provide up to $3 billion in incentives. Sargent’s staff told us her $1 million-per-job claim was based on a column posted on the Bloomberg Businessweek website that was written by Tim Culpan. Culpan is a Taiwan-based technology columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly, a commentary site. He wrote that Wisconsin ""is paying as much as $1 million per job."" Culpan’s $1 million claim was widely circulated -- by state Superintendent of Schools Tony Evers, who is weighing a run for governor in 2018; state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse; and a host of national media, including Vanity Fair, a Washington Post columnist, The Atlantic and others. If you take $3 billion in incentives -- the amount cited in Sargent’s tweet -- and divide it by 3,000 jobs, you get $1 million per job. But the $3 billion is the maximum -- to be paid only if Foxconn meets several requirements, including creating 13,000 jobs. If fewer jobs are created, the incentives paid are less. So, what is the cost per job? What the per-job cost might be The $3 billion -- up to $200 million per year for 15 years -- would amount to nearly 50 times the previous record paid by Wisconsin taxpayers, when the state in 2010 offered $65 million in subsidies to keep Mercury Marine from moving a factory from Fond du Lac to Oklahoma. The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates it would take 25 years for taxpayers to recover the bulk of that -- the $2.85 billion the state would be paying Foxconn in cash. (The other $150 million would be provided through a sales tax exemption.) As for the per-job cost, we turned to an analysis by the Wisconsin Budget Project. The project is part of Kids Forward, formerly known as the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a left-leaning nonprofit. The $2.85 billion in cash payments, according to the analysis, would amount to $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created. An important note: As the analysis and Culpan noted, and as economist Timothy Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research told us, the more Foxconn gears its plant for robotics, the fewer jobs it will create -- and thus the per-job cost of the incentives will be higher. Asked about Sargent’s taking down her tweet, one of her staff members told us the Bloomberg column ""was early,"" and that as more details of the incentive package were released, ""it became clear that estimates were more nuanced, and Melissa removed the tweet to prevent any confusion or misinformation."" The news reporting, however, had been clear: up to $3 billion in incentives only if 13,000 jobs were created, not 3,000. The staffer, citing the Wisconsin Budget Project analysis, also told us there will be costs to taxpayers beyond the $3 billion, such as local government spending on infrastructure improvements and state borrowing for Interstate 94 improvements. But Sargent’s tweet referred only to the $3 billion in incentives, not those other potential costs. Our rating In a tweet she later took down, Sargent said that on the Foxconn deal, ""3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job."" The per-job cost could never reach $1 million if only 3,000 jobs are created; the full $3 billion would be paid only if 13,000 jobs are created. An analysis projects the per-job cost at $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created.

No, the Obama administration didn't invent the term 'lone wolf' for terrorists
","Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, is none too fond of the terrorism-fighting approach of former President Barack Obama. He made this clear during an Aug. 8 interview on MSNBC. ""There's no such thing as a lone wolf,"" Gorka said. ""You do know that. That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid. There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida. At least through the ideology and the TTPs, the tactics, the training, the techniques and the procedures, that they supply through the internet. Never happened. It’s bogus."" However, Gorka’s assertions are flawed, several terrorism experts told PolitiFact. (The White House did not provide any additional explanation in response to an inquiry.) The lone wolf as a metaphor for independent terrorism clearly pre-dated the Obama administration. We’ll also note that Gorka’s claim that there has ""never"" been a serious plot unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida is dubious. This is easily debunked. Just look at a few of the books that used the term in the context of terrorism before Obama took office in January 2009: • Brian T. Bennett, Understanding, Assessing, and Responding to Terrorism: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Personnel, 2007: ""Lone wolf terrorism involves individual extremists who usually operate alone or on the fringes of established extremist groups, inflicting serious harm or causing significant damage."" • Jeffrey F. Addicott, Winning the War on Terror: Legal and Policy Lessons from the Past, 2002: ""Because they operate on their own, without affiliation to any known group or state, individuals who engage in ‘lone-wolf terrorism’ are far harder to predict, track, or deter."" • Linda Jacobs Altman, Hate and Racist Groups: A Hot Issue, 2001: ""The lone wolf and leaderless cell became part of the new face of racist terrorism in the 1990s."" In addition, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of an ""agent of a foreign power"" to include a ""lone wolf"" category. The provision was widely known as the ""lone wolf"" amendment. So, how far back does the term go? Experts said that its specific application to terrorism originated with the ideas of white nationalist Louis Beam, who in the early 1980s advocated ""leaderless resistance."" Tom Metzger, the founder of the group White Aryan Resistance, advocated a similar approach. The idea ""was adopted by American right-wing extremists in response to a federal law enforcement crackdown on domestic terrorists during the 1980s,"" said Mark Hamm, an Indiana State University criminologist who coauthored the book The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism. ""Leaderless resistance is based on the idea that a terrorist group, no matter how secret or well-organized, simply cannot evade law enforcement, so terrorism is more readily accomplished by individual actors rather than a group."" In 1998, FBI agents in San Diego opened ""Operation Lone Wolf"" -- an investigation into the criminal activities of a self-proclaimed white supremacist, Alex Curtis. The following year, a widely noted New York Times article was headlined, ""New Face of Terror Crimes: 'Lone Wolf' Weaned on Hate."" Over the next few years, the term became increasingly associated with terrorism of all stripes and was used by government officials, academics, and the media. ""The reason was obvious: There were numerous sporadic terrorist attacks carried out by individuals and small groups,"" said George Michael, a criminologist at Westfield State University and author of Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance. ""Furthermore, many of the perpetrators had little or no connections to terrorist movements."" So while the term ""lone wolf"" was used increasingly during Obama’s presidency, its application to terrorism was already decades old, and it was not ""invented"" by the administration. Analyzing this statement requires a bit more nuance, so we won’t factor it into our rating. But the claim is still problematic, experts said. On the most basic level, there have been countless of terrorist attacks that have nothing to do with Islamic radicalism -- starting with the white nationalist movements that helped promulgate the term ""lone wolf"" in the first place. Other examples of terrorism, stemming from a variety of motives, include the 16 lethal bombings by Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski between 1978 and 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, and the series of bombings by Olympic Games bomber Eric Rudolph between 1996 and 1998. Meanwhile, across the globe, ""there are a range of attacks by lone perpetrators that are tied to ethnic rather than religious causes, and not all were Islamic by a long shot,"" said Jeffrey Kaplan, a terrorism specialist who is starting a posting at King Fahd Defense College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and who co-authored the book, Lone Wolf and Autonomous Cell Terrorism. Even limiting the universe to post 9/11 attacks with Muslim perpetrators produces some exceptions to Gorka’s firm ""never,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. He cited two attacks without apparent links to al-Qaida or ISIS: • On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but that he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. • On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself ""a Muslim American, angry at Israel"" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but ""acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization."" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. Gartenstein-Ross said he’s sympathetic to Gorka’s broader skepticism about the impact of lone wolves. For starters, there is evidence from a recent University of Miami study that online pro-ISIS groups have highly fluid memberships, suggesting that true lone wolves -- people acting genuinely on their own without any interactions with like-minded individuals, online or otherwise -- are rare in the Internet age. Experts have cautioned that overuse of the term ""lone wolf"" may even be hampering investigations. ""When you systematically describe attackers as lone wolves, you sometimes end up missing the networks they were connected to,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. Gorka said, ""There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid."" Contrary to what Gorka said, the concept of the lone wolf terrorist predates the Obama administration by decades. We found the term widely used by government officials, academics, and the media, all before Obama took office.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Labor', 'Stacey Evans']","
Are Georgia firms cheating 1,000s of workers out of benefits, health care?
","With health care policy in limbo in Washington, the politicians who would like to be Georgia’s next governor are staking out their own policy outlines. Democratic State Rep. Stacey Evans favors expanding Medicaid, but said the state could take other action as well. ""There are thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors, so that their employers can wrongfully deny them the benefits that they deserve, including health care,"" Evans said Aug. 5. ""By expanding Medicaid and classifying workers appropriately, insurance will be available to hundreds of thousands more Georgians."" We decided to check Evans’ number of misclassified workers, and found she’s on safe ground. Some businesses avoid treating workers as employees by calling them an independent contractor. The person might work only for that one business, use equipment the business provides and do exactly what the business tells him or her to do, and yet be labeled as if the person was in business for themselves. The advantage for companies is they avoid paying a number of employment taxes, including Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance. If they offer health insurance, they would sidestep that too. As Georgia’s Department of Labor put it, ""independent contractors are not independent just because that is what their employer calls them, because that is what they call themselves, or because they sign an ‘independent contractor agreement.’ Independent contractor status depends on the underlying nature of the work relationship."" In a recent case, a state administrative judge ruled that a man who drove for a Georgia limousine service was actually an employee and not an independent contractor, as the company (and the state Department of Labor) claimed. The company had required the man to set up his own limited liability corporation, but the ruling said that made no difference. The driver used a company car, and he was ""given direction as to where to drive, when to drive, how to drive, how often to drive, and the rates to charge customers."" The judge called this an ""extreme"" case of misclassification. Evans’ campaign spokesman Seth Clark said she relied on a 2015 Georgia Senate study. That report said an accurate estimate was difficult to make because the state had never done a complete study, as other states have done. However, the state Department of Labor reported that its inspectors had found ""over 4,000 misclassified employees,"" across about 1,700 businesses in 2014. When we asked, the state Department of Labor sent us more recent data. In 2015, it found about 1,500 misclassified workers at 1,800 firms, and in 2016, the number was about 3,000 out of 2,400 firms audited. Complaints by workers and random selection by inspectors trigger audits. The data show that most audits lead to the discovery of a misclassified worker. The department told us that currently, it lists nearly 235,000 employers. The review of about 2,400 represents a small fraction, about 1 percent. The Senate report said the department lacked the resources and manpower to ""effectively audit and investigate potential violators."" The Senate report listed other state studies. By and large, the more effort a state put into an investigation, the more it found. Minnesota estimated that about 14 percent of employers misclassified workers. Michigan found about 8 percent. A Maryland audit uncovered an average of 20 percent of employers misclassifying employees. In contrast, Nevada relied on records accumulated in the ordinary course of business and reported that while about 12 percent of complaints involved a claim of misclassification, the fraction of audits that found this problem was 2.7 percent. At the national level, the most recent numbers come from the Government Accountability Office. Its review of IRS data from 2008-10 found that worker classification problems represented 20 percent, or over 3 million cases, of noncompliance issues. It’s important to note that simply being classified as an employee is no guarantee of health coverage. Companies with fewer than 51 employees face no penalty if they fail to offer insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Evans said that thousands of Georgia workers are misclassified as independent contractors and as a result, lose out on benefits, including health insurance. A state Senate study said there is no solid estimate of the number of misclassified workers, but state investigators had found between 1,500 and 4,000 instances in each of the past three years, or an average of 2,800 per year. That is based on a review of about 1 percent of businesses and most reviews reveal a misclassified worker. States that have conducted more systematic studies found misclassification rates in the range of 10 to 20 percent. The 2,800 average likely misses many instances and it’s a relatively small number, but it’s enough to support Evans’ statement. The connection to health care is less clear, because many small employers don’t offer health insurance, nor are they required to. But Evans was careful to include health care as one of several benefits, and her claim doesn’t hinge on that element. With that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/10/stacey-evans/are-georgia-firms-cheating-1000s-workers-out-healt/

Greenlight Pinellas opponent says 'light rail does not reduce congestion'
","Critics of the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative are attacking the plan at full speed by questioning the effectiveness of the proposal’s light rail line. The group’s home page, RailTaxFacts.com, features a commercial arguing against pro-transit talking points, such as light rail creating long-term economic growth and reducing traffic congestion. The video shows a ""Truth Meter"" (not to be confused with PolitiFact Florida’s Truth-O-Meter) rating the statements false. ""Light rail does not reduce congestion,"" the website says under the video. Greenlight Pinellas plans a 24-mile light rail route from St. Petersburg to Clearwater projected to cost $2 billion over a decade. We wondered if the idea of reduced congestion was a dependable guidepost, or if we’re all being taken for a ride. Railing against rail Light rail is generally considered to be a rail line that either shares space with roads or is a separate, above-ground commuter line, as opposed to a subway or elevated train. The Greenlight Pinellas plan calls for a proposed line with 16 stations to provide a 57-minute total trip time between St. Pete and Clearwater. It’s slated to be installed and operational within 10 years and serve as an anchor for future transit additions. Greenlight also has plans for bus rapid transit and expanded service, which we’ve addressed before, but in this case, No Tax For Tracks says a common talking point by light rail advocates is that a rail system will decrease congestion. One of the group’s supporting links is a Washington Post Wonkblog post linking to another post from The Atlantic suggesting light rail’s effects on congestion are debatable. The other piece of evidence is an April 2014 analysis by David McKalip, a St. Petersburg neurosurgeon and No Tax For Tracks supporter, concluding light rail actually increases congestion. McKalip writes about how despite extensive rail investment in Portland, Ore., the city saw more people in cars and higher traffic volumes in the subsequent years. He also cites another Atlantic post discussing a study of four British cities that showed light rail didn’t get people out of their cars, but did take them off buses. ""I have yet to find any science ever that says congestion goes down,"" McKalip told PolitiFact Florida. ""Experts say, ‘do not make that assertion.’ "" McKalip followed up his post with another on July 1 saying car travel times in the Tampa Bay area are routinely faster than in other cities with rail and there is no concrete evidence of a relationship between congestion reduction and light rail. An essay by public transit planning consultant and author Jarrett Walker says that while transit has several benefits that make cities more sustainable and improves quality of life, a definite correlation between service and fewer cars isn’t apparent. Thinking ahead Many transit experts don’t agree with that conclusion. Todd Litman, founder and executive director of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute in Canada, said ""traffic congestion and economic impacts vary considerably depending on specific circumstances and how the impacts are measured."" He said that a transit system with sufficient demand and adequate supporting policies can indeed reduce congestion. He cited several studies that showed congestion increased at a higher rate in areas without light rail. One showed that in Denver, there was a 31 percent increase in vehicle traffic in light rail corridors, as opposed to 41 percent elsewhere. Another said Baltimore’s congestion increase dropped from 2.8 percent to 1.5 percent annually after building light rail. One Los Angeles study said people who lived within a half-mile of one light rail line in the city traveled an average of 10 to 12 miles less by car per day. Another said that Utah’s TRAX system dropped the estimated number of vehicles on the studied corridor from 44,000 to 22,300 per day. PSTA told PolitiFact Florida that reducing future congestion is the guideline Greenlight Pinellas is addressing, offering Pinellas County residents a transportation option in the face of projected population growth across the region. Vukan Vuchic, transportation engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that’s a sufficient way to measure a reduction in congestion. Cities inevitably will keep growing, and thanks to an ingrained car culture, the only way to ensure a net loss of vehicles is to completely reorganize entire cities with pedestrian zones and policies that make car ownership prohibitive. ""Yes, we see people are buying more cars and driving more miles, but we didn’t give people a choice,"" he said, adding that communities must make a conscious choice to enact many policies aimed at reducing congestion. ""It’s not automatic. It’s not like you put in a rail line and it’s automatically beautiful."" Our ruling No Tax For Tracks said ""light rail does not reduce congestion."" The studies we looked at didn’t show a strict reduction in congestion. However, there are studies that show congestion grows more slowly in communities that have implemented light rail, especially if they do so in conjunction with other policies that give people an option not to drive.

Dan Patrick was sole senator to oppose veterans program for entreprenuership
","Democrat Leticia Van de Putte told her party’s state convention her Republican opponent for lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, is so out of step, he stood alone against a program to help veterans. Van de Putte, of San Antonio, and Patrick, of Houston, both are members of the 31-member Texas Senate. In her speech, Van de Putte declared she’s watched Patrick’s Senate votes. ""I mean,"" Van de Putte said, ""Dan was the only vote, the only one in the entire Senate who voted against the Veteran Entrepreneurship Program, a program that assists veterans in successfully starting up their own businesses. That’s not putting Texas first."" We wondered about this program and whether Patrick indeed was alone in opposition among the senators. On Van de Putte’s behalf, Manny Garcia, a Texas Democratic Party spokesman, pointed out by email that according to the state’s Senate Journal, which tracks Senate actions, Patrick voted April 18, 2013, against approval of a proposal related to the creation of the veteran entrepreneur program by the Texas Veterans Commission. According to the journal, Patrick asked to be recorded as voting against even taking up Senate Bill 1476. Patrick then voted against preliminary and final approval of the measure, according to the entry, which advanced to the House by a 29-1 margin; one senator was absent, according to the journal. To our inquiry, Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, emailed us that Patrick voted against the proposal ""because it expanded the state's bureaucracy with a new function that would be more efficiently absorbed in a different agency."" Separately, the non-partisan House Research Organization said in its May 2013 description of the proposal that opponents considered the legislation ""unnecessary because it would spend state dollars for assistance already offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Patrick wasn’t the only legislator to oppose the measure. According to legislative records, Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, was the ""no"" vote on the proposal when it cleared the House Committee on Military & Veterans Affairs by 7-1. And on May 14, 2013, five House members asked to be recorded as voting against preliminary approval of the legislation, according to the House Journal. House members gave their final approval by 125-19, the journal shows, but afterward, five members reported intentions to vote ""no"" even though they were recorded as voting ""yes."" The proposal, signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry, required the Texas Veterans Commission to establish the ""veteran entrepreneur program to perform outreach functions to improve veteran entrepreneurs' and business owners' awareness of federal and state benefits and services,"" according to an analysis by the Texas Senate Research Center. The effort, which relied on lawmakers ponying up funding, was projected to cost more than $210,000 a year, according to the legislation’s fiscal note. By email, commission spokesman Duncan McGhee told us the program fielded about $257,000 in funding for the two budget years starting September 2013. Since the law took effect, he said, it has helped nearly 1,300 veterans ""toward entrepreneurship.""

Senate candidate Dan Sullivan says he passed 'stand your ground' in Alaska
","In his campaign for Senate, Republican front-runner Dan Sullivan touts his history of protecting Second Amendment rights in the hunting-loving state of Alaska. But a recent pro-Sullivan ad might have stretched the rifle and pistol expert’s record a little too far. ""As Alaska’s attorney general, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground,’ "" said a recent radio ad out of the Sullivan campaign. In 2013, the Alaska Legislature passed a ""stand your ground"" law, which typically allows a person to use deadly force if they believe they face an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death. More than 20 states have such laws. ""Stand your ground"" became a hot topic following George Zimmerman’s acquittal, after he claimed self-defense in his 2013 trial for killing Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. But Sullivan’s opponents -- Democrat and Republican -- have challenged his record, saying ""stand your ground"" legislation in Alaska wasn’t his doing. He’s running against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich and, on the Republican side, tea partier Joe Miller and Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. We decided to sort this out. ""Stand your ground"" was first introduced in the Alaska Legislature in 2010. At the time, Sullivan served as the state’s attorney general, heading an office that reviews every law moving through the Legislature. The original ""stand your ground"" bill failed to pass. A second iteration of the bill appeared and failed in 2011. Sullivan left the attorney general’s office to become the commissioner of natural resources at the end of 2010 -- long before a final version of the bill passed in 2013. So even though ""stand your ground"" first appeared in the Alaska Legislature when Sullivan was in a position to put his support behind it, it wasn’t successful until he had moved on to other positions. We came across one indication of Sullivan and the attorney general office’s position on ""stand your ground,"" but it doesn’t help his case. His office sent a letter in March 2010 that attacks the heart of ""stand your ground"" law. The letter uses strong language and primarily takes issue with the fact that the law would remove the then-existing ""duty to retreat."" ""Duty to retreat"" means that if a person believes that they are in imminent danger of death or severe bodily harm, but there is a safe way for them to get away, they are expected to retreat without assaulting or killing the person threatening them. ""Whatever source one thinks our laws should be drawn from -- the 10 commandments which say 'thou shalt not kill,' simple morality, utilitarianism principles of the greater good or simply the concept that life is sacred -- this bill would encourage the needless taking of human life,"" the letter reads. Although the letter seems to make Sullivan’s position fairly clear, he now has a twofold defense: First, his campaign says the letter took issue with the bill’s complexity, rather than ""stand your ground"" laws in general. That doesn’t seem to be the case. When we read the letter, we found that nearly half of it criticized the bill for nearly eliminating the duty to retreat -- contradicting the core of ""stand your ground,"" according to some experts. ""Duty to retreat"" and ""stand your ground"" laws cannot coexist, as the names suggest. ""Someone who opposes a self-defense statute that provides that there’s no ‘duty to retreat’ is also against a typical ‘stand your ground’ statute,"" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. To be fair, we also found that the letter brings up problems with specific language and lack of clarity, and it never says outright that the Legislature should abandon its efforts to pass ""stand your ground."" But it does say that the bill ""would promote violence and be a bad idea for (Alaska)."" Second, Sullivan says he did not pen or approve of the letter even though his name is included in the signature. (A then-assistant attorney general John Skidmore wrote it.) Sullivan’s name was included on any piece of paper that left his office -- even if he didn’t see it first. There are nearly 200 assistant attorneys general, and a lot of legislation passes through that office, so it is conceivable that he wasn’t aware that the letter was going out, said Cori Mills, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law. However, Skidmore wasn’t the only assistant attorney general who had problems with the bill. About two weeks later -- after some tweaks had been made in response to the letter -- three other assistant attorney generals (all from different divisions) gave similar complaints on behalf of the Department of Law at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. The updated version made ""a bad bill better,"" said then-Assistant Attorney General Anne Carpeneti. We asked Sullivan’s campaign to point to any public statement showing his support for the law. They could only provide this letter from state Rep. Mark Neuman, R-Big Lake. The undated letter briefly mentions the attorney general’s office as supportive of the 2010 bill -- despite the obvious lingering complaints expressed at the hearing. The language in the final bill hasn’t changed since 2010, and the final bill still eliminated the duty to retreat in most circumstances. Our ruling A recent radio ad said, ""As Alaska’s Attorney General, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed ‘stand your ground.’ "" We found that evidence of Sullivan’s support for ""stand your ground"" is dubious at best. We couldn’t find any public proof of his support, and multiple attorneys under him spoke out against the law. Even if he had publicly shown support for ""stand your ground,"" he wasn’t in a position to push the legislation forward when the law finally passed in 2013.

"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
Under Gov. Kitzhaber, has Oregon's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest point in three years?
","Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office. The problem-filled rollout of Cover Oregon, the state’s health insurance exchange, is bound to be a contentious issue in his race against challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point. But so is the state’s economy, which took a beating in the wake of 2008’s Great Recession. The claim: On his campaign website, Kitzhaber lists ""Getting Oregonians Back to Work"" among his top priorities. At the same time, the site says, some positive economic news has been generated since he took office in January 2011. Chief among those, it says, are the creation of 25,000 jobs and an improvement in the state’s credit rating. Then, there’s this: ""Since the governor took office, Oregon’s unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level in three years."" PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know if that’s true. The analysis: This fact-check seemed about as straightforward as they get -- find the relevant statistics, see if they comport with the claim and proceed to the rating. However, there’s an aspect to this claim that goes beyond the bottom line. Kitzhaber doesn’t take complete credit for the turnaround, but it’s clear -- especially combined with his job-creation numbers and better credit rating -- that he’s submitting an economic resume to bolster his 2014 campaign. Kitzhaber defeated Republican Chris Dudley in November 2010 to win his third term. His first two terms ran from 1995 to 2003. He was sworn in most recently in January 2011, so that’s when the clock starts ticking. We emailed Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor, who sent an online interactive graph showing unemployment rates for Oregon and the nation as a whole from 1990 through May 2014. Here are the numbers, as shown on a graph prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: In January 2011, the month Kitzhaber was sworn in, Oregon’s unemployment rate was 10 percent -- down considerably from the Great Recession peak of 11.6 percent in May and June 2009. By comparison, the U.S. unemployment rate when he took office was 9.1 percent, down from the post-recession high of 10 percent in October 2009. So when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon’s unemployment rate was already trending down, as was the rate for the nation as a whole. Still, has it dropped since then to its lowest level in three years, as the governor claimed? The answer is essentially yes, according to Oregon Employment Department figures for May 2014, the most recent month available. The statewide rate, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, is 6.9 percent, down from the 10 percent when Kitzhaber took office. The rate was slightly lower in February and April at 6.8 percent, but it’s ticked back and forth between 6.8 and 6.9 percent since. It needs to be pointed out, however, that 6.9 percent is a statewide average. Rates in some rural counties remain stubbornly high, although down significantly from their recession peaks. We contacted Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist, for his view. ""Unemployment rates are generally higher in Oregon’s non-metro counties, which has been the case for at least 10 years,"" he wrote in an email. ""They have the same overall pattern of falling unemployment rates that the Portland metro area counties and other metro area counties show."" Combined, all non-metro counties in the state have an average unemployment rate of 8.5 percent, he added. That’s down from just under 11 percent three years ago. We contacted Kitzhaber’s office to see how much credit the governor is taking for the statewide dip. As it turns out, at least some. In rural Oregon, for instance, various initiatives the governor has launched are ""making a difference in reducing unemployment and encouraging economic development,"" according to a statement emailed by spokeswoman Rachel Wray. The statement also singled out the six Regional Solutions teams deployed across the state, the Governor’s Strategic Reserve Fund to help support job training and hiring, and the Oregon Business Plan -- Kitzhaber’s ""blueprint"" for strengthening the economy across the state. Last, we got back in touch with Duy, the University of Oregon economics professor. ""Politicians in general like to take credit for the economy,"" he said in a voice message. ""But in many cases, including this one, there are larger cyclical factors at play, and we’re caught up in those larger cyclical factors. To me, this is best evidenced right now by unemployment rates dropping for the U.S. as a whole."" The ruling: Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, is seeking a fourth term as governor. Among the accomplishments listed on his website is that unemployment in Oregon is at its lowest in three years. Kitzhaber’s office, in a statement, also took some credit for the drop. Statistics largely bear out the claim that the unemployment rate is the lowest in three years -- down from 10 percent when Kitzhaber was sworn in to 6.9 percent currently. Although it was one-tenth of a point lower in February and April than in May, the most recent month available, we aren’t dinging the governor for that. Monthly unemployment numbers are often adjusted later and the figure remains between 6.8 and 6.9 percent. It’s important to note, however, to keep two things in mind. The first is that unemployment rates across the country, including Oregon, had been trending down for at least two years before Kitzhaber was sworn in. Second, that unemployment rates in a handful of rural counties remain considerably above the statewide average (although they, too, are down from when the governor took office). An economist also stressed that the drop in Oregon’s unemployment rate over the course of Kitzhaber’s most recent term is inextricably linked to a similar national reduction in unemployment. The governor’s statement is accurate, as far as it goes, but lacks key context to shine a true light on the state’s unemployment situation. We rate it Half True. Comments? Questions?

David Alameel lived in La Colonia in California, but it wasn't a colonia
","David Alameel, the Democratic nominee challenging Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told delegates to his party’s state convention last month he’ll fight for immigration reforms including a path to citizenship for residents living here without legal permission. Then Alameel, a wealthy Dallas investor, revealed a biographical detail potentially making him unique among all the Texans ever nominated for statewide office--saying he once lived in a colonia. According to the Texas Secretary of State, a colonia is ""a residential area along the Texas-Mexico border that may lack some of the most basic living necessities, such as potable water and sewer systems, electricity, paved roads, and safe and sanitary housing."" Per federal law, such colonias also persist in the states of Arizona, California and New Mexico. Here’s what Alameel said as he touched on immigration reform: ""My wife’s family is from Zacatecas, Mexico. I have a large Mexican-American family. When I was working in the fields, we lived in the Colonia. Where people wanted me to go and see when I was running, I told them, ‘I lived ... I know what colonia is all about, I know what they need.’ "" When we followed up, Alameel said by phone that in 1973-74 he and his wife lived with her parents in a humble house in an Oxnard, Calif., neighborhood called the Colonia. He picked chiles and strawberries in the area before enlisting in the U.S. Army. His campaign spokesman, Sergio Cantu, emailed us a photograph of what he described as a family reunion at the house several years ago.    Photo of home in Oxnard, Calif., taken within the past few years. (Provided by David Alameel campaign.) Alameel told us the three-bedroom, one-bath house that was his home had typical amenities including running water and electricity and sewer services. The house also was safe and clean, he said, and the streets outside were paved. So, the Colonia neighborhood of Alameel’s past doesn’t fit the definition commonly used in Texas to describe a residential area lacking basic utilities. Still, ""we were poor,"" Alameel said, and the neighborhood ""was considered the roughest and toughest part of Oxnard."" We found more history about La Colonia and Southern California’s Latin American community in a Nov. 1, 1992, Los Angeles Times news story. It called the area ""Ventura County's most notorious pocket of poverty"" with ""a reputation as a violent, drug-choked neighborhood to be avoided."" The story said residents ""charge, and some city officials admit privately, that a practice of neglect has mired the old barrio in a tangle of social ills deliberately perpetuated to keep the area separate and not equal."" The Times said the neighborhood ""was born in the late 1800s to segregate Oxnard's Mexican work force from the gentry of the city."" It quoted a newspaper from the early 1900s as saying: ""While the east end of town was a rip-roaring slum . . . where crime and other illegal activities were concentrated, the westside was listening to lecture courses and classical music."" By 1947, the story said, the barrio ""was overcrowded and mostly inhabited by transient farm laborers who rented houses already considered substandard. La Colonia has been and remains a stop on the underground railroad for Mexican immigrants heading north."" After World War II, ""as veterans returned to a barrio of unpaved streets and outhouses, newly created political groups"" drove the election of a Latino member of the Oxnard City Council,"" the story said, continuing: ""During the consciousness-raising Chicano movement of the 1960s, when riots broke out in La Colonia to protest lousy conditions, residents elected the city's second Latino council member… Both elections brought measures of public improvements."" In what proved to be our first interview, Alameel described another part of his life. For his first eight to 10 years, he said, he lived in one-room house in Haifa, Israel, its tin roof topped by stones. The house had no electricity and no running water, Alameel said, making his life tougher than what he’d encounter as an American. Alameel later called back, saying he didn’t mean to suggest in his speech that he lived in a colonia meeting any federal definition. His point, he said, was that he’d lived among migrant workers in the poorest, toughest neighborhood. He said he meant to convey he knows what it’s like to be poor. Our ruling Alameel told Democrats he once lived in a colonia. Not so. Alameel resided for a couple of years in a low-income Oxnard, Calif., neighborhood called La Colonia. By his account, though, that home had basic services like water and utility lines that are often absent from houses in Texas colonias. We rate this statement as False.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissent says women pay 68 percent more out of pocket for health care
","The Supreme Court recently decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby -- a landmark decision in which a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation could decline, on religious grounds, to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The decision was a victory for supporters of religious freedom and a defeat for backers of expanded reproductive health care. The unveiling of the decision on June 30, 2014, produced widespread commentary and debate over its merits. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s stinging dissent attracted wide attention from those who opposed the majority opinion. We noticed the following claim in Ginsburg’s dissent: ""Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men."" We thought it would be interesting to see how that statistic was calculated. But when we looked into it, we were in for a surprise: The 68 percent figure was a lot older than we’d expected. Where the statistic came from In her dissent, Ginsburg cited the statistic as being from a ""statement of Sen. Feinstein,"" which appears to refer to a Senate floor speech by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. During the debate on President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in December 2009, Feinstein said, ""The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most people don't know that, but it is actually true."" The 68 percent statistic has been cited repeatedly in the judicial debate over the contraceptive mandate in the health care law. In the Hobby Lobby case alone, it was cited in briefs by the Obama administration, as well as in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief by 91 Democratic members of Congress and a separate amicus brief by the National Women’s Law Center. We found a flurry of references to the statistic in court cases, bills, and reports in 2014, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2003, 2002, 1999 and 1998. After a lot of digging, PolitiFact was able to trace the 68 percent figure back to a publication released by the Women’s Research & Education Institute titled, ""Women's Health Care Costs and Experiences."" That study was published in 1994 -- and if 1994 was the publication year, it’s reasonable to assume that the data in question are even older than that. (We couldn’t find the full report online, and inquiries to the group and to the original author were not answered.) Is there newer data? Could Ginsburg -- or anyone else who cited the 68 percent statistic in recent years -- have used more up-to-date data? Yes. PolitiFact asked officials at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- to walk us through the data in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which is the source several independent experts had suggested we use to test Ginsburg’s statistic. It turns out that for 2011, women between 18 and 44 had out-of-pocket expenses that averaged 69 percent higher than men of the same age range. That’s virtually indistinguishable from what Ginsburg said. Still, it’s worth noting that alternative data comes up with somewhat lower estimates. Data from a different HHS source -- National Health Expenditure Accounts -- found that in 2010, women between 19 and 44 had 52 percent greater out-of-pocket spending than men of the same age range. And an annual study by the Health Care Cost Institute, which is based on information supplied by private health insurance companies, found an even smaller gender gap. In 2012, women's out-of-pocket expenses were 36 percent higher than men's. However, this figure is for all women through age 65, rather than just childbearing age, so it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. The experts we checked with didn’t doubt that women of childbearing age tend to pay more out of their pocket for health care. ""Women under 65 use a lot more health services than do men, especially preventive care, screenings and well-care, all of which is covered less by insurance than hospital expenditures,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Still, there are indications that the gap is narrowing between men and women, perhaps because the insurance market has changed substantially over the past 20-plus years, with cost-sharing becoming much more significant than it was in 1994. The annual Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust study found a rising percentage of workers with employer-provided health coverage facing an annual deductible of $1,000 or more. The share of people in that category rose from 10 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2013 -- a far shorter time horizon than 20 years. Meanwhile, data from HHS’ national accounts series shows that out-of-pocket spending for men grew faster than it did for women between 2002 and 2010 -- a 3.9 percent growth rate for men, compared with 3.3 percent for women, Tanner said. The significance of an old statistic We can’t be 100 percent sure that by citing Feinstein, Ginsburg was simply relying on a very old statistic without further checking. However, given the long history of the identical number being used, we suspect the statistic was repeated, in most or all cases, without being checked against more recent data. Ginsburg did not respond to an inquiry for this story sent through the Supreme Court’s public information office; justices rarely if ever comment to the media. In any case, we found repeated mentions of this statistic by advocates, lawmakers and government officials without citing the original 1994 source, leaving the incorrect impression that the number was current. Our ruling Ginsburg wrote that ""women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men."" Some estimates cited by a litany of politicians and advocates are based on 20-year-old data. But more recent data shows that women do still pay more out of pocket for health care than men do, with one estimate very close -- 69 percent -- and other estimates in the 40 percent to 50 percent range. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/02/ruth-bader-ginsburg/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dissent-says-women-pay-68-perc/
"['Congress', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic Party of Wisconsin']","
GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson largely unknown in Wisconsin, Democratic Party says
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was out and about in June 2014. The Wisconsin Republican appeared on CNBC, on CNN and on a nationally syndicated radio talk show. He was quoted in the Huffington Post and in a Wall Street Journal blog, and featured in articles on national political websites such as Real Clear Politics and Salon. His name appeared in 10 articles and letters to the editor in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So, Johnson, a political newcomer when he was elected in November 2010, is pretty high-profile, right? Not according to the Wisconsin Democratic Party. On June 12, 2014, the party posted this on its Facebook page: ""He’s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who Ron Johnson is."" Total exaggeration? Not totally. Marquette poll The party cited as evidence a Marquette Law School Poll of registered voters in Wisconsin from March 2014, the most recent one to include such a question about Johnson. We took a look at the script used by the poll takers. The seventh question was preceded by this statement: ""I’m going to read you a list of people and organizations. Please tell me if you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each of them or if you haven't heard enough about (him/her) yet to have an opinion. The first name is Barack Obama."" The interviewer continued with the same question about several Wisconsin politicians, including Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). The interviewer would record the answer as Favorable, Unfavorable, Haven’t Heard Enough, Don’t Know or Refused. The figures for Johnson, as summarized in the results section of the poll data: Favorable 29 percent Unfavorable 27 percent Not Heard Enough 40 percent Don’t Know 4 percent Refused 0 So, 40 percent said they didn’t know Johnson well enough to have an opinion of him. (The 4 percent represented people who responded by saying don’t know, rather than saying they didn’t know enough to have an opinion.) In comparison, 27 percent of those polled said they had not heard enough about Baldwin to have an opinion of her and another 3percent said they didn’t know if they had an opinion. Baldwin was elected to the Senate two years after Johnson, but previously served 14 years in Congress and has gained national attention for being the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. It’s worth nothing that another Wisconsin poll also showed a relatively high percentage of residents weren’t sure how they felt about Johnson. But it also did not ask respondents if they knew who Johnson is; rather, the question was about job approval.   In the latest poll by the St. Norbert College Strategic Research Institute, done in late March and early April of 2014, the interviewer said: ""Now I’d like to ask you about some major political figures and your opinion on how well they are doing their job. For each of the following, please tell me whether you strongly approve, approve, disapprove, or strongly disapprove with the way the person is doing their job."" On Johnson, 31 percent of the respondents said they weren’t sure, compared to 21 percent for Baldwin. Perspective For his part, Marquette poll director Charles Franklin told us there’s no way to know from his poll what percentage of the respondents ""don’t know who Johnson is."" That question was not asked. At the same time, Franklin said, the favorable/unfavorable question used by the Marquette poll is good as a general measure of the public’s awareness of, or familiarity with, a person. And the Democratic Party’s claim about Johnson, he said, ""has a little bit of hyperbole, but it’s not a wildly misleading reading"" of the results. We checked with three other experts: David Wegge of the St. Norbert institute, which is based at St. Norbert University near Green Bay; and John Stevenson and Chad Kniss of the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, which does surveys for the UW community and other organizations and formerly did political polling for the Badger Poll. They agreed the Democratic Party's claim is not totally accurate, but not way off, either. If you’re surprised that 40 percent of the respondents didn’t feel they had heard enough about a nearly four-year U.S. senator to have an opinion of him, Wegge noted that St. Norbert’s Wisconsin surveys, which date back to 1984, show U.S. senators have less name recognition than governors. Senators are generally in the state less, get less Wisconsin media coverage and, of course, deal more with national than state issues, he said. Indeed, even near the end of Democrat Herb Kohl’s 24 years in the U.S. Senate, many Wisconsinites said they didn’t know enough about him to have an opinion, according to an April 2011 St. Norbert poll. Marquette’s Franklin added: ""A lot of people are not so intensely engaged in politics that they follow these names day in and day out and form strong opinions about them outside of a campaign."" That was borne out in two polls taken in the weeks before Johnson was elected -- the vast majority of registered voters said they had an opinion when asked by Marist College if they had a favorable or unfavorable impression of Johnson. In late September 2010, only 19 percent said they were unsure of their opinion of Johnson or hadn’t heard of him; by late October 2010, the figure was 18 percent. It doesn't stand to reason that nearly four years after Johnson's election, 40 percent of Wisconsinites don't even know who he is. Our rating The state Democratic Party said: ""He’s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who Ron Johnson is."" In the most recent statewide poll that asked about Johnson, 40 percent of registered voters said they didn’t know him well enough to have an opinion about him and another 4 percent said they didn’t know if they had an opinion of him. But that falls short of evidence that 40 percent don't even know who he is. We rate the claim Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Matt  McGrath']","
Carter camp overstates Deal's education record
","The war of words in the governor’s race has been escalating. And it recently came to this: ""Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state,"" Matt McGrath, the campaign manager for Carter for Governor, said in a press release June 18. A fundraising email went out the next day, repeating that statement. In previous fact checks, we’ve noted the pitfalls to calling anything the most extreme, the first or, in this case, ""the worst."" The main problem: How do you prove that? In this case, Republican Nathan Deal, who faces Democrat state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta in the November general election, is Georgia’s 82nd governor. So when you talk about the worst governor in Georgia history, you are covering a lot of territory. Remember, the state began as a prison colony, and its first chief executive took office in 1775. The governors who followed presided over a state that made almost no attempt to educate poor whites, banned education for enslaved blacks, and aided and abetted the removal of Native American children and their parents to reservations in the West. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia and a longtime Capitol observer, said the statement by McGrath is ""the kind of campaign rhetoric that is false on its face."" ""Obviously, someone like Gene Talmadge who did three terms as governor did less for education than Nathan Deal,"" Bullock said. ""It used to be that the state’s budget went disproportionately for transportation; now most of it goes for education."" Deal took office in early 2011 and, with his budget proposal for fiscal 2015, will have increased k-12 spending by $868.6 million in four year, we reported in a recent fact check The overall budget for education is up $930 million in Deal’s tenure, when increases for pre-kindergarten and higher education are counted, according to the state Budget Office. So what about the Carter camp’s claim? We contacted Bryan Thomas, Carter’s campaign spokesman, to ask for supporting evidence. He told us the statement reflects the Carter campaign’s ""opinion."" He also said McGrath’s statement was aimed at Deal’s record on education funding, though that’s not what it says. Thomas made three points to us, all dealing with the austerity cuts to education that started under Gov. Sonny Perdue in 2003, increased to more than $1 billion a year in his final two years in office and have largely continued at that level under Deal. These cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985. Here are Thomas’ points, as well as some state data and our research.. 1). On average, Deal has underfunded k-12 education in Georgia by more than $1 billion per year since taking office. That’s true. Austerity cuts (and we’re rounding) were $1.15 billion in fiscal 2012, $1.14 billion in fiscal 2013, $1.06 billion in fiscal 2014 and $746.6 million for fiscal 2015, which began Tuesday, state records show. 2.). After just four years in office, Deal is responsible for more than half of the total austerity cuts, or about $4.1 billion. Our research and state records show the austerity cuts total about $4.1 billion under Deal and $8.4 billion since the cuts started in 2003. 3). Between fiscal 2003 (when ""austerity cuts"" began) and fiscal 2011 (when Deal took office) — a period encompassing the worst years of the Great Recession — the average QBE shortfall was just $380 million per year. Nathan Deal’s average has been more than 250 percent higher than that, at just over $1 billion per year. True. Austerity cuts in Deal’s tenure are averaging $1.02 billion a year. The cuts under Perdue were $134.9 million in fiscal 2003, $283.5 million in fiscal 2004, $332.8 million in fiscal 2005, $332.8 in fiscal 2006, $169.7 million in fiscal 2007, $143 million in 2008, $496 million in 2009, $1.4 billion in 2010 and $1.1 billion in 2011, with rounding. ""Find me another governor who has so incredibly underfunded education according to the state’s own guidelines,"" Thomas said in an email. Jen Talaber, a spokeswoman for the Deal campaign, said: ""To be clear, the Carter campaign just said that Governor Deal had the ‘worst record in the history of the state’?"" ""The Carter campaign believes that segregationist governors had better records than Governor Deal?"" Talaber said it’s important to recognize the economic conditions that existed when Deal took office. ""The rainy day fund was in pitiful shape, mandated health care spending was increasing, and we were in the midst of the Great Recession,"" she said. ""In spite of that, the governor increased education funding every year he’s been in office."" Carter voted for Deal’s budget every year, except for the fiscal 2015 budget this year, Talaber said. (This is something Deal’s campaign ads point out.) Talaber said the governor ""believes a strong education builds a strong economy"" and has backed school choice, working for passage of the 2012 charter school amendment. His record on education also includes championing or implementing a plan to increase schools’ access to the Internet, educator training in reading and other best practices, and the health education program SHAPE, Talaber said. Deal also saved the popular lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-kindergarten programs from the brink of bankruptcy, she said. (Some of the HOPE changes that ultimately were approved were brokered by a bipartisan group that included Carter.) So with the perspective of both camps, we reached out to Thomas V. O’Brien, chairman of the department of educational studies and research at the University of Southern Mississippi, for help with the long view of Deal in history. O’Brien has researched American education in the 20th century and published a book in 1999, ""The Politics of Race and Schooling: Public Education in Georgia, 1890-1961."" He said he believes that because of the governor’s funding cuts to education and his stance on school choice, ""it is fair to say that Deal is no friend to public education."" But a declaration of worst is problematic, O’Brien said. In the 1950s and 1960s, Govs. Herman Talmadge, S. Marvin Griffin and, for a time, Ernest Vandiver threatened to do away with the public schools if they were forced to integrate by race. ""They also led the Georgia Legislature to put in place laws that would facilitate such actions,"" he said. ""However, most of their concrete actions that took hold, initiated by Talmadge, were not to cut dollars for public ed, but rather to invest in public education under the ‘separate but equal’ doctrine (Plessy vs. Ferguson, 1896)."" The strategy to avoid token desegregation did not work, and, when pushed, the segregationist state leadership under Vandiver kept the public schools and repealed most of the massive resistance legislation, O’Brien said. Thirty-eight Georgia governors served before the Civil War, when there was no public education to speak of, O’Brien said. It was against the law in most places to teach a slave to read, write or do math. Poor whites had no schools, and wealthy whites brought in tutors or sent their children to school in Europe or the North, he said. So where does this leave us? The Carter camp issued a statement saying ""Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state."" Spokesman Bryan Thomas later said the camp was referring to his record on education funding and specifically pointed to austerity cuts during his administration. Annual austerity cuts topped $1 billion in his first three budgets, but also were that high in the last two budgets of his predecessor, Sonny Perdue. The Carter camp can’t prove that among Georgia’s 82 governors Deal’s record is the worst on education in general or on education funding in specific. The Carter campaign’s charge was incendiary -- that the sitting governor has the worst education record in Georgia’s history. And we smell smoke. We award it our lowest rating, Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jul/02/matt-mcgrath/carter-camps-claim-all-smoke/

Did Hobby Lobby once provide the birth control coverage it sued the Obama administration over?
","Hobby Lobby’s Supreme Court victory over the federal government’s contraception rule set off a fast-breaking wave of punditry on national TV. CNN brought in liberal pundit and contributor Sally Kohn, who panned the court’s 5-4 decision as disastrous and Hobby Lobby’s intentions as disingenuous. ""Hobby Lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit, which was politically motivated,"" she said. We can’t determine if politics motivated the company, but we did wonder whether Hobby Lobby covered the types of birth control at issue in its lawsuit but dropped the coverage before filing its complaint. The short answer: Yes. The Green family, which founded Hobby Lobby in Oklahoma City in 1972, said as much in its original complaint. The Greens re-examined the company’s health insurance policy back in 2012, shortly before filing the lawsuit. A Wall Street Journal story says they looked into their plan after being approached by an attorney from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty about possible legal action over the federal government’s contraceptives requirement. That was when, according to the company’s complaint, they were surprised to learn their prescription drug policy included two drugs, Plan B and ella, which are emergency contraceptive pills that reduce the chance of pregnancy in the days after unprotected sex. The government does not consider morning-after pills as abortifacients because they are used to prevent eggs from being fertilized (not to induce abortions once a woman is pregnant). This is not, however, what the Green family believes, which is that life begins at conception and these drugs impede the survival of fertilized eggs. At any rate, Hobby Lobby stopped covering those drugs in its plan and took the health care contraceptive mandate to court, represented by the Becket Fund. The only caveat here is Hobby Lobby said it didn’t know it was covering the drugs. ""Coverage of these drugs was not included knowingly or deliberately by the Green family. Such coverage is out of step with the rest of the Hobby Lobby’s policies, which explicitly exclude abortion-causing contraceptive devices and pregnancy-terminating drugs,"" the company stated in its court filing. Of note, company leaders do not have religious problems with other forms of birth control, such as the pill, condoms, diaphragms and sterilization, according to the family’s legal representation, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Our ruling On CNN, Kohn said, ""Hobby Lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit."" The Christian-owned company did previously offer insurance plans that included coverage of a few contraceptives at issue in the case, namely morning-after pills, but reports suggest owners weren't aware they offered that coverage. When the company found out -- in the wake of the contraceptive requirements that came out after the health care law -- the company stopped offering the drugs and took the contraceptive mandate to court. Kohn’s statement is accurate but leaves out that Hobby Lobby says it unwittingly offered this kind of birth control coverage.

Did Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton vote against disaster relief five times?
","Democrats are attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for his voting record on an important Tornado Alley issue. A television ad produced by the liberal Senate Majority PAC shows video footage of tornadoes and a storm-ravaged town. The narrator, a firefighter identified as Matthew from Little Rock, goes on to criticize Cotton, who is running for Senate, for voting against disaster relief. ""I'll never understand why Congressman Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times, against recovery for victims of natural disasters. He's detached himself from what's going on in Arkansas,"" he said. The federal government most recently declared a disaster in Arkansas this past April, when a tornado killed 16 people -- the deadliest tornado in the state since 1968. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent about $5 million on disaster relief there, without having to seek Congressional approval. Cotton, who is running against incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor, has been in Congress for less than two years -- has he voted against disaster relief five times? Senate Majority PAC spokesman Ty Matsdorf pointed us to the five times they found Cotton had voted against disaster relief since he took office in January 2013. Four out of the five have to do with funding Hurricane Sandy relief (three of those were all on one bill). The votes are: Vote 1: H.R. 41, January 2013 Cotton voted against a measure to temporarily increase FEMA's borrowing authority in order to carry out the National Flood Insurance Program in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 354-67 and became law. Vote 2: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against an amendment that proposed $17 billion in emergency funding to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 327-91. Vote 3: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against an amendment that proposed $33.7 billion for immediate and anticipated needs in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 228-192. Vote 4: H.R. 152, January 2013 Cotton voted against the final bill that would give $50 billion in disaster relief aid to communities and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The measure passed the House 241 and 180 and became law. Vote 5:  H.R. 3547, January 2014 Cotton voted against this omnibus appropriations bill that appropriated money to the Disaster Relief Fund. The bill passed the House 359 to 67 and became law. Of Arkansas’ four Republican representatives, Cotton is the only one to have voted ""no"" on all five of those measures. But two of them -- Timothy Griffin and and Steve Womack -- voted ""no"" on final passage for the final Hurricane Sandy funding bill, while Rick Crawford voted ""no' on H.R. 3547, the omnibus appropriations bill.  In the Senate, H.R. 41 passed with a voice vote, where the votes aren’t tallied. Pryor approved both of the other two bills. Republican Sen. John Boozman, however, voted ""no"" on H.R. 152, the Hurricane Sandy bill. We should note that none of these votes involved specific disaster relief for Arkansas. However, H.R. 3547 was a general appropriations bill covering many areas, a small part of which had to do with funding general disaster relief. And H.R. 152 included $16 billion for community development in declared disaster areas across the country.  Cotton’s office didn't respond to our questions, but a post on his campaign website defends his disaster relief record regarding Hurricane Sandy. ""Unfortunately, Washington politicians took advantage of a tragic situation and loaded down the Sandy relief bill with billions in spending that didn’t help the victims but instead went to fund the pet causes of Congressmen,"" it says. At the time, some conservatives criticized H.R. 152, the final Hurricane Sandy aid bill, for including funds that didn’t go to immediate disaster relief. According to a Congressional Quarterly analysis, $17 billion went to immediate aid, and $33.5 billion went to long-term assistance. The budget group Taxpayers for Common Sense documented some of the side projects Cotton and his colleagues were trying to trim out of the bill, such as $2 million for Smithsonian museum roof repairs and $118 million on Amtrak upgrades.   And Cotton’s votes on H.R. 152 weren’t all negative. For example, he voted ""yes"" on at least five (failed) amendments that cut funds in other areas in order to account for the additional spending on disaster relief. He also voted ""yes"" on a later bill that expanded the type of nonprofit organization that could provide disaster aid and assistance. In reviewing Cotton’s votes, we found Cotton has tended to side with tea party members of the House looking to rein in government spending at any cost. For example, he was part of the coalition that supported shutting down the federal government over raising the debt ceiling. Cotton has been ""unusually steadfast in his opposition to spending,"" said Janine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas. ""The main undertone I hear when the Pryor allies run an ad like that is another effort to paint (Cotton) as outside the mainstream, even extremist,"" Parry said. Our ruling  A Senate Majority PAC ad said, ""Congressman Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times."" We found that Cotton voted against five bills or amendments that would have gone to immediate aid or funded disaster relief programs. The rest of the Arkansas delegation only voted ""no"" on some of them. However, the ad is a bit disengenuous because it really only addresses three disaster relief bills, and a couple of other Arkansan delegates voted against final passage. The ad also leaves out the times that Cotton voted for disaster relief funding, as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. Overall, Cotton typically doesn’t support spending that isn’t balanced out with cuts in other areas. Additionally, if you think this ad -- which shows tornado-ravaged areas -- is talking all about Arkansas, that isn't the case. Most of these votes had to do with Hurricane Sandy.

Does Kingston bring home the bacon?
","Earmarks are the money lawmakers yank from the federal budget to benefit their jurisdictions. Critics of the system tend to use the pejorative term ""pork"" for the same taxpayer-funded projects. A pivot to that first definition helped U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi beat a tough tea party-backed challenger in the GOP runoff last week. Cochran focused on the money he brought to the Magnolia State. A recent attack in Georgia’s tight Republican runoff for the U.S. Senate focused more on the second understanding of the term, with a tweet for all the Internet to see. ""Jack Kingston requested more earmarks than any other GA Congressman and all GA GOP members combined."" David Perdue wrote over pictures of pigs feeding at the trough, lest anyone miss his contempt. That’s a pretty specific claim. And if there’s anything PolitiFact Georgia loves to check, it’s the specifics, especially with the July 22 runoff between Perdue and Kingston  looming. Perdue said he based his claim on databases created by the Center for Responsive Politics of OpenSecrets.org. Perdue, a former Dollar General CEO, is running as an outsider who sees earmarks as a type of overspending from longtime Washington representatives such as Kingston. ""Before my congressman brings money back to Georgia, I want to know what debt I am going to be responsible for,"" Perdue said. ""The earmark provision drives up the debt and is a free pass on the budget responsibility we want from our congressmen and senators."" That kind of criticism prompted Congress to abstain from pork in 2010. Kingston told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008 that he had cut back on his requests for earmarks over those complaints. But he also noted his concern that other states would get more money if he and other Georgia lawmakers quit the practice. Open Secrets allows searches to see how much money members of Congress steered to their district for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. Fiscal years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Our review of those databases shows Kingston made 145 requests in those three years, pulling in about $211 million. His next closest colleague had 213 earmarks, totaling about $202 million. But that’s from U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, a Democrat from Albany. Next on the list from the GOP was U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta, who lost to Perdue and Kingston in the May primary. He had 58 earmarks that totaled about $94 million. Together, Georgia’s GOP delegation had about $327 million in earmarks for the three years. Kingston’s total was larger than the other six Republican lawmakers combined.

The nonprofit, with staffers who have worked for both Democrats and Republicans, shows slightly different tallies for those years – but comes to the same broad conclusion. It counts 146 earmarks from Kingston, totaling about $213 million. That compares with $116 million in earmarks from the other six GOP congressmen. Kingston, who represents five of Georgia’s eight military installations, noted that much of the funding was for defense or military spending such as an IED simulator at Fort Stewart and hospital renovations at installations statewide. Kingston contrasted that record with Perdue’s, whose business record includes a brief leadership of Pillowtex, a troubled North Carolina textile firm that went under shortly after he left. ""The majority of what we did was for the military,"" Kingston said. ""I don’t know that we need lectures on fiscal responsibility from somebody with his abysmal track record."" In isolation, those costs don’t appear to be a problem, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers For Common Sense. But money spent there is money not available for other projects that may be more critical. But without the procurement process that follows other federal spending, there’s no way to judge the merit of the projects being funded, he said. ""If a congressman is saying they know their district better than a pointed-headed bureaucrat, that’s absolutely true,"" Ellis said. ""But with earmarks, they’re saying they know what’s best for all 435 congressional districts. And that’s not true at all."" Perdue said Kingston had more earmarks than any other congressman in the state and more than Georgia’s other GOP congressmen combined. Two separate databases back him up. It’s up to voters to decide whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing. There is one caveat to Perdue’s claim. It covers three years, and Kingston has been in office for two decades. It’s that bit of context that moves it down just a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Perdue’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jul/01/david-perdue/does-kingston-bring-home-bacon/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz decries impact of Hobby Lobby decision on birth control
","On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies with religious objections can opt out of a mandate under the Affordable Care Act to provide free contraception to their employees. The 5-4 ruling involved a case brought by two companies owned by Christian families: Hobby Lobby, a chain of hobby stores, and Conestoga Wood Specialties, which makes wood cabinets. The companies opposed providing certain types of contraception that they believe is equivalent to inducing abortion, including morning-after pills and IUDs. (They didn’t oppose other methods of birth control.) They based their case on the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed by President Bill Clinton. The issue arose because birth control is included among the free preventative services mandated by President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 health care law. Houses of worship and religious institutions were already exempt from this aspect of the law. The court’s ruling applies to ""closed corporations"" which are in control by a few people, rather than public companies with many shareholders. Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote the majority opinion, stating that women who work for these corporations can still access these types of birth control either by the federal government paying for it or through a third-party administrator. Though the ruling was narrower in scope than it could have been, supporters of broad access to contraception expressed disappointment. One of these supporters was U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair from South Florida. In a statement attacking the decision, Wasserman Schultz said that contraception for women isn’t just about avoiding pregnancy. ""Nearly 60 percent of women who use birth control do so for more than just family planning,"" she said. We wondered whether that was correct. Guttmacher Institute study A DNC spokeswoman said Wasserman Schultz was referring to a November 2011 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights. The report focused specifically on the oral birth control pill, not all contraception. (We should note that the Guttmacher institute filed a brief on the side of the federal government in the Supreme Court case. We will also note that the oral birth control pill is different from the morning-after pill the plaintiffs objected to funding.) The Guttmacher report stated that while birth control pills are primarily intended to prevent pregnancy, they also provide other health-related benefits including easing menstrual-related problems. The report used national data from the 2006–2008 National Survey of Family Growth, which is administered by the government’s National Center for Health Statistics. Here are some of the key findings: • Out of about 7,350 women surveyed, 58 percent of pill users relied on the method at least in part for one non-contraceptive reason, such as managing menstrual pain, regulating periods and controlling acne. That’s the source for Wasserman Schultz’s claim about ""nearly 60 percent."" • Birth control is the most common reason women use the pill, reported by 86 percent of pill users at the time. That left 14 percent of pill users who said they only took the pill for non-contraceptive reasons. • Reliance on the pills for non-contraceptive reasons is highest for teenagers. A spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute told PolitiFact that they had not updated their 2011 report. Previously, we fact-checked a similar claim based on the same report. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said on MSNBC in March that ""it’s important to note that women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions, so it is an attack on women."" We rated that claim Half True because it required additional clarification about the type of birth control and the survey results. Wasserman Schultz's statement was somewhat more carefully worded. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that ""nearly 60 percent of women who use birth control do so for more than just family planning."" This claim gets support from a Guttmacher Institute report that found 58 percent of pill users citing at least one non-contraceptive reason. However, Wasserman Schultz’s comment glosses over two important caveats. First, she said ""women who use birth control,"" even though the study looked at women who use the birth control pill specifically -- a type of birth control that wasn’t even one of the ones directly at issue in the Supreme Court case. Second, the Guttmacher study found that birth control is indeed the most common reason that women use the pill, with 86 percent saying it was one of the reasons they chose that option. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/30/debbie-wasserman-schultz/after-supreme-court-hobby-lobby-decision-wasserman/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Gilberto Hinojosa']","
Texas Republicans oppose legal status for U.S. illegal immigrants, but not mass deportation
","The chairman of the Texas Democratic Party predicted delegates to its state convention in Dallas would endorse a platform favoring paths to citizenship for hard-working, tax-paying illegal immigrants in the country and legal residency for children of illegal immigrants who came here through no choices of their own. In advance of his party’s gathering, where he won a fresh two-year term, Gilberto Hinojosa went on to suggest the Republican Party of Texas recently settled on an approach to immigration with a decidedly negative vibe. Hinojosa told KERA, the Dallas public radio station: ""The party platform of the Republican Party says deport everybody and to hell with it. And that’s just not what America’s all about. So that’s going to be a big contrast, and I think it’s going to affect substantially the attitude a lot of Hispanics have toward Republicans."" It’s been widely reported that Texas Republicans, who met in Fort Worth in early June 2014, removed platform language from 2012 endorsing a federal guest-worker program. Also, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in a June 7, 2014, news story, the platform was stripped of ""any provision that would create an opportunity for immigrants living and working in the United States without legal sanction to receive provisional visas."" Did the party also say ""deport everybody,"" as Hinojosa said? The word ""deport"" isn’t in the 2014 Republican platform, which has a two-page section on immigration that opens by saluting the importance of immigrants in the nation’s history. It goes on to say: ""It remains imperative to create fair and consistent procedures that will enable freedom-loving, hard-working and law-abiding immigrants to join us, by providing them an efficient, practical method of legal entry, so they can lawfully take positions where their labor is needed, without exploitation or harassment. ""Our national interests are poorly served by our broken, embattled, and outdated immigration system, and patchwork attempts to mend its deficiencies will not prepare us to continue to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex global economy that demands the legal movement of people to fill jobs at all skill levels."" Among other elements, the immigration plank calls for more officers on the border, an end to the possibility of in-state college tuition for certain illegal residents and protection of the ability of law officers to ask into the immigration status of someone in custody. The closest the plank comes to deportation is a line stating no form of amnesty should be granted, ""including the granting of legal status to persons in the country illegally."" Such individuals, we suppose, would remain subject to deportation at any time. For a slightly longer perspective, we looked next at the state Republican Party platform adopted by delegates to its June 2012 convention. The 2012 immigration plank opens: ""Because of decades-long failure of the federal government to secure our borders and address the immigration issue, there are now upwards of 11 million undocumented individuals in the United States today, each of whom entered and remain here under different circumstances. ""Mass deportation of these individuals would neither be equitable nor practical,"" the 2012 platform says, going on to oppose ""blanket amnesty"" while endorsing a temporary guest-worker program ""to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available."" To our email request for the basis of Hinojosa’s claim, Emmanuel Garcia, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said Hinojosa was ""referring to the emotions that many Latinos and immigrants feel with the rhetoric at the"" 2014 ""GOP convention and the changes in the GOP platform. You are correct those exact words are not there."" Our ruling Hinojosa said the Republican Party platform ""says deport everybody and to hell with it."" The heck you say. The Texas GOP platform opposes illegal immigration and any legal status for unauthorized U.S. residents, which leaves deportations a possibility. But the platform doesn’t venture as far as the chairman said. It doesn't call for deporting everybody living here illegally.

Limbaugh says Obama administration planned the influx of children at the border
","So far this year, over 47,000 children without their parents have shown up at the southern border and the government is scrambling to deal with them. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson published an open letter in Spanish-language newspapers earlier this week, urging parents in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to stop sending their children north. House Speaker John Boehner formed a group of representatives to focus on the surge of children migrants. In a news conference, Boehner faulted President Barack Obama. ""We’re seeing a humanitarian disaster, one of the administration’s own making,"" Boehner said. Some of the president’s critics go much further. In a June 24 broadcast, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said the administration planned the surge at the border. ""You tell me this is not purposeful,"" Limbaugh said. ""Listen. Six months ago, the regime began planning how to transport tens of thousands of undocumented children from the border."" For Limbaugh, the smoking gun is a Jan. 29, 2014, posting for contract work by the Homeland Security Department. The agency said it wanted a private company to take as many as 65,000 children in the course of the year and hand them over to the department of Health and Human Services. ""On Jan. 29, they knew,"" Limbaugh said. ""Somebody had advance knowledge that these thousands of undocumented children would be flooding the border ... All these kids were planned in advance to show up."" That contract work posting has generated a lot of speculation in conservative circles. It appeared a week and a half ago on the website Infowars.com with the interpretation that the government sought to escort illegal immigrants into the United States. Soon after, that allegation morphed into the suspicion that the surge reflected some hidden plan by the administration to advance a political agenda. ""This advertisement raises a lot of questions,"" said the website Weasle Zippers on June 20. ""There is a lot of specificity reflected in this document that seeks to deal with an influx that hadn’t as yet happened."" In this fact-check, we examine the evidence that the Obama administration planned the influx. The story behind the estimate In November 2013, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops sent a delegation to Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to get a better understanding of why unaccompanied children were flooding America’s southern border. Jeanne Atkinson, director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, went on that trip and met with two Homeland Security officials stationed in the region. The report from that trip said that in November the Homeland Security Department estimated ""that more than 60,000 unaccompanied minors could enter the United States during 2014."" ""The numbers are not pulled out of a hat,"" Atkinson told PunditFact. ""Based on looking at past years and the daily numbers, we knew it was an estimate but it seemed like a reasonable estimate."" A rising trend line Here’s a graph of the numbers Atkinson and her team saw. The figures from the Homeland Security Department (see the raw data here) show a rapid increase in the number of children stopped as they tried to enter the country. The shift began in 2011 and it was driven by children leaving El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of children leaving those three countries increased by 158 percent. The next year, the increase was 105 percent. We ran the numbers several different ways. Allowing for the modest increase from Mexico, by the end of fiscal year 2013, officials would have been looking at an average annual increase of 55 percent from the four countries combined. Multiply that by the total in 2013, about 38,000, and you get just under 60,000. The data in the graph are for fiscal years which end in September. The 2014 data does not include the entire year. The point is, in the fall of 2013, anyone looking at the situation would be seeing steep increases. W. Ralph Basham was commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009. Basham told PunditFact that the government estimates in 2013 follow established practice. He said people should remember they are based on more than just the numbers. ""The Border Patrol interview these people on the border,"" Basham said. ""When they hear what's going on the ground in these countries and why these people are leaving, they start to put the numbers together. They are always looking at trends to prepare themselves to deal with these surges. Unfortunately, this time it got ahead of them."" Basham said he finds it ""hard to buy the notion that the administration planned this."" He said the situation on the border stems from a ""perfect storm"" of rampant violence, sometimes by gangs, in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, limited capacity in this country to quickly send these children home and a belief in Central America that if you get over the border, you can stay in America. The Migration Policy Institute, a research group that promotes better management of immigration flows, pointed to the impact of a 2008 law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Under this legislation, signed before Obama took office, the government follows what the institute called a ""more child-friendly"" policy that could encourage more families to take the risk of trying to get their children into the country. Atkinson with the conference of Catholic bishops said she has heard first-hand accounts of the threats to children, including gang members seizing teenage girls from their homes. ""These mothers and grandmothers told me, ‘Do you think we would send them away if we had any other option?’ "" Atkinson said. Basham said the governments in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras need to contain this violence but so far, they’ve been unable to. Our ruling Limbaugh said the Obama administration planned the rapid influx of children attempting to get into the country. Not that the administration planned for the influx, but actually planned it. Limbaugh did not return our requests for comment, but his evidence was a request for contract services from early 2014 that projected that about 65,000 children would need to be moved to temporary shelters. Limbaugh viewed that estimate with suspicion. In reality, the rising number of unaccompanied children arriving at the border was well established by the end of 2013. Catholic relief workers and a past Homeland Security commissioner said all the data pointed to a continued increase into 2014. Many of the factors behind the surge of children lie outside the control of the administration. No expert we reached gave any credence to the idea that the administration planned this crisis on the border.

Rep. Hartzler says Export-Import Bank is free for taxpayers
","One of the tea party’s newest pet peeves is the Export-Import Bank -- a little-known government agency that the party is hoping to abolish. What’s the Export-Import Bank? It’s a government agency that gives low-interest loans and guarantees to foreign buyers in hopes of promoting American exports. The tea party calls it crony capitalism. We decided to tackle a striking claim that the bank’s supporters, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, frequently tout -- but one critics say is misleading. We heard it most recently from Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., in a June 24 Roll Call interview. She said the Export-Import Bank ""doesn't cost taxpayers anything."" A government agency? That doesn't cost taxpayers anything? How can that be? In contrast, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who has been leading the current effort against the bank, told the House Committee on Financial Services on June 26, 2014, ""We should examine where the money comes from to finance Ex-Im. Whose money is it? Obviously, it’s taxpayers’ money."" What is the Export-Import Bank? The Export-Import Bank is a federal agency founded in 1934 that finances foreign buyers with loans, guarantees and other products -- at lower interest rates than they would get from a private bank -- to help them purchase American products. About 60 other countries have similar agencies. Overall, the bank finances less than 5 percent exports annually. In 2013, the bank supported about $37.4 billion in exports. Its biggest, and thus most controversial, beneficiary is Boeing. Those who support it say the bank makes American companies more competitive globally by incentivizing foreign buyers. Those who are against it say it is corporate welfare that helps hand-picked companies while disadvantaging businesses that don’t use the bank. It's a hot topic because the agency's charter is up for congressional reauthorization in September. Its current three-year term ends in 2015. How much does it cost? Every year Congress sets a limit on the bank’s financial activities. The bank then borrows money from the Treasury to give out direct loans, which it pays back with interest. Since 2008, the bank has not relied on taxpayer dollars to cover its operational costs and loan loss reserves. Instead, the bank charges customers fees and interest that it uses to cover those costs in full. Often, the fees generate a surplus, which the bank gives back to the Treasury. In the past five years, the bank has given back $2 billion. Additionally, the bank’s default rates have historically been lower than private financial institutions -- the current default rate is less than 0.25 percent. The bank hasn’t been completely without losses, though. In 1987, several straight years of losses of more than $250 million to $300 million forced the bank to ask Congress for a $3 billion bailout.   The most recent losses were in the 1990s, following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, said Export-Import Bank Advisory Board member Gary Hufbauer, also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank.   Still, the bank has generated an overall profit of more than $5 billion for the Treasury since 1990. But just looking at cash flow doesn’t give us a full picture. Long-term costs The bank’s overall revenue isn’t as high as it could be because the interest rates are lower than market rate, said Charles Calomiris, a finance professor at Columbia University. This means there is a cost to taxpayers in terms of lost opportunity, and it will eventually become a loss in cash flow. Some economists believe that the incoming revenue will not be able to keep up with defaults adding up over the long term. It may take 100 years to see the costs in terms of cash flow, but they are always there, Calomiris said. ""Loan subsidies don't come from thin air. They are paid for by the taxpayers. So, saying that the Export-Import bank is free is wrong,"" he said. He noted that federal mortgage loan providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rarely reported cash flow losses until 2008, when their monumental losses contributed to the Great Recession. Adding to the debate is a Congressional Budget Office report from May that gives a 10-year projection for the Export-Import Bank using two different accounting methods -- yielding two disparate outcomes. One shows the program operating at a $14 billion surplus, the other shows it with a $2 billion loss. The positive results from the method the government has traditionally used to assess the program. The loss results from a fair-value method of examining the program the way a private financial institution would, taking more risk into account. The bank's proponents say it’s wrong to treat government lenders like private lenders because the conditions are so different. The bank’s accepted accounting method better reflects factors like the Export-Import Bank's high credibility, lower tax burden and lower interest rates. ""Comparable private market interest rates and guarantee fees seldom exist as benchmarks for Ex-Im Bank financing,"" Hufbauer said in a Peterson Institute blog. Our ruling Hartzler said the Export-Import Bank ""doesn’t cost taxpayers anything."" It’s true that in recent years, the bank has actually made a net profit on its loans and turned in money to the U.S. Treasury. But in the past, the bank has had years of losses and actually cost taxpayers money. Some economists think that could easily happen again, even if it doesn’t seem like an immediate danger.

Do deputies get paid overtime to sit at courthouse security checkpoints and watch?
","Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. regularly uses the media to criticize other elected officials -- having, for example, accused Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele of penis envy and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett of being ""clueless."" In contrast, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm rarely engages in public political battles. So it was a surprise when Chisholm excoriated Clarke in a letter on June 2, 2014. Among other things, Chisholm said the Sheriff's Office was running a budget deficit partly because Clarke has ""deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work."" Chisholm’s charge seemed worthy of a look. The backdrop The district attorney’s letter was in response to a letter he and the county’s chief judge received a few days earlier from Clarke. Clarke, in the wake of a shooting of a 10-year-old Milwaukee girl, who was gravely wounded in the crossfire between two men on a playground, called for temporarily suspending plea bargaining and probation sentences for major crimes. For years, he wrote, the county's prosecutors and judges had engaged in ""soft-on-crime practices."" Security checkpoints Security checkpoints for the county courthouse complex, which includes the Public Safety Building and the Criminal Justice Facility, are not the responsibility of the Sheriff’s Office but rather the county Division of Facilities Management. In other words, county workers, not sheriff’s deputies, check visitors and operate metal detectors at the various entrances to the complex. The security work is not part of the sheriff’s budget. Clarke, however, has asserted his authority to help provide security. In March 2013, Clarke announced that during an ""integrity check,"" an undercover sheriff's deputy with a gun cleared security checkpoints at all six entrances into the county courthouse complex. He said that, as a result, he had ordered deputies posted at each security checkpoint in the complex until ""he is convinced weapons cannot get through."" He said the staffing would be paid for with overtime. That staffing is continuing. When we checked the entrances one afternoon in June 2014, we found two county employees manning each checkpoint and a deputy nearby. At one checkpoint, we saw a deputy actively working the metal detector; but at the others, a deputy was only observing. Our colleagues who regularly visit the courthouse told us the same: usually they see deputies merely observing, but occasionally actively working a checkpoint. For his part, Clarke told us the deputies are not posted at the checkpoints to watch the screeners. ""The deputies are there to provide an armed presence for the protection of the public and employees, and to prevent and deter an armed person from getting into the building,"" he said in an email. The cost There’s no dispute that overtime pay is being used, at least in part, to pay deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex. But the amount is not clear. Based on overtime reports the Sheriff’s Office submits to county officials, it’s not possible to tell how much in overtime pay is being spent on deputies working security checkpoints at the courthouse complex, said county Auditor Jerome Heer. Overall, the sheriff’s overtime expenditures have gone over budget. In 2013, the Sheriff’s Office spent $5.9 million for overtime, exceeding the $3.6 million overtime budget, Heer said. As of June 23, 2014, he said, overtime expenditures were $2.7 million, which is on pace to exceed the overtime budget of $4.1 million. Our rating Chisholm said Clarke has ""deputies collecting overtime while sitting passively in chairs watching courthouse security personnel work."" There’s no dispute that part of the sheriff’s overtime budget pays deputies to work security checkpoints at the courthouse complex. The deputies typically are observing visitors passing through the checkpoints, but sometimes get actively involved in screening them or monitoring metal detectors.

Warner has changed stance on balanced budget amendment

","U.S. Republican senate candidate Ed Gillespie is accusing Democratic incumbent Mark Warner of switching positions on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. A web video released by Gillespie’s campaign shows a montage of two contrasting statements Warner has made over the years as evidence the Democrat has ""promised Virginians one thing on the campaign trail and changed his position in Washington."" The video starts with footage from Warner’s unsuccessful a 1996 campaign to unseat incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. John Warner. During a debate that summer, Mark Warner was asked to name issues on which he disagreed with his party and then-President Bill Clinton. ""I also believe we need a constitutional amendment balancing the budget,"" Warner said.  ""For too long Congress, even though politician after politician makes promises that we’ll balance the budget soon, year after year the deficit goes up. I think we need constitutional amendment to balance that budget, and we need it now."" The video contrasts that statement, which Warner echoed throughout that campaign, to comments he made during a April 2011 interview with CNN. The Democrat had been elected to the Senate in 2008 and, a month prior to the interview, voted against a Republican bill for a balanced budget amendment. ""Listen, I was a governor. We had to balance our budgets,"" Warner told CNN. ""I don’t think a federal balanced budget amendment gets us where we need to be."" Supporters of the balanced budget amendment have long maintained that the provision would mandate spending discipline by Congress.  Opponents say a balanced budget can’t be achieved without painful tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts, including to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman, acknowledged that the senator’s position on the amendment has changed, but said it’s old news. The turning point, he said, came shortly after Warner became governor in 2002 and took charge of a state government that had its own balanced budget requirement. Despite that constitutional amendment, the state was emerging from recession and faced massive budget shortfalls because of low revenues and a car tax cut ushered in by the previous administration. Warner and the General Assembly balanced the budgets through spending cuts and tax increases and, when the economy improved later in his term, the state budget ended up in surplus. Warner told CNN in 2011 that he is convinced that when it comes to managing federal finances, long-term bipartisan planning is a superior way to lowering debt than a balanced budget amendment. Warner, during his first term, has led a group of senators seeking a bipartisan agreement to lowering deficits through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. We couldn’t find any record of Warner weighing in on a balanced budget amendment between 1996 and 2011. The issue did not come up in two debates viewed from his 2008 Senate campaign or in any of news stories we accessed from that election. There’s no evidence Warner promised voters he’d support the amendment during the 2008 campaign that put him in the Senate and recanted after he took office. Our ruling The purpose of our Flip-O-Meter is to gauge how much a politician’s position on an issue has changed. We don’t take a position on whether the change is good or bad. There’s no doubt Warner has reversed course on a balanced budget amendment over the years. So we rate it a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2014/jun/30/mark-warner/warner-has-changed-position-balanced-budget-amendm/
