In Texas, do you have to drive 120 miles for a voter ID?
","During a CNN debate among candidates to chair the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez -- a leading candidate who served as secretary of labor and assistant attorney general for civil rights under President Barack Obama -- emphasized the importance of protecting voting rights. Perez cited efforts, typically led by Republicans, to require voters to show state-issued ID cards at the polls. Democrats say such policies suppress the vote. Republicans say they cut down on voter fraud. ""I've spent a substantial portion of my life doing these cases at (the) Department of Justice,"" Perez said at the debate. ""Let me give you some facts and figures. We sued Texas, and we won. And we won, because over a 10-year period, 46 million votes were cast -- zero, count them, zero reported incidents of illegal noncitizen voting, two incidents of in-person voter fraud, (out of) 46 million votes cast. If we weren't on television I would call this a word that begins with a B. I will anyway. It's bunk. And you know what, it's bunk in every other case. And if you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID. If you're poor, that is a poll tax."" This includes a lot of different claims, but we will look at one aspect. Is it true that you have to drive 120 miles to get an acceptable ID in Texas? The short answer: The vast majority of Texans don’t. Residents of its big metropolitan areas like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin will certainly have a driver's license office much closer than that. However, for a small percentage of the population, the trip could be that far, or even farther. The source of the talking point The statistic comes from testimony against Texas’ voter ID law, which required voters to show certain forms of a government-issued ID. The law, signed in 2011 by then-Gov. Rick Perry, required voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport. When the law was under attack, Texas state Sen. Carlos Uresti, a Democrat from San Antonio, testified that some of his constituents would have to drive up to 120 miles to secure a driver’s license, the Houston Chronicle reported. This bit of testimony appears to have been picked up by federal appellate judges in Washington, who ultimately issued a unanimous ruling striking down the law. During oral arguments, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins asked the attorney defending the law for the state whether the law would be a burden on people having to travel more than 100 miles for a driver’s license. ""How does that impact your argument?"" Wilkins asked. ""Isn’t that unduly burdensome?"" John Hughes, the attorney for Texas, said rural Texans are used to driving long distances, according to the Washington Post. ""People who want to vote already have an ID or can easily get it,"" he told the judges. But another judge on the panel, David S. Tatel, said, ""The record tells us there is a subset of registered voters who lack ID. We have to think about the economic burden and the fact that minorities are disproportionately poor."" He, too, cited the 120-mile drive statistic, the Post reported. And the talking point made it into the ruling in which the appeals court struck down the law. That said, the claim deserves some context. Where would someone have to drive that far? Uresti, the Texas state senator, had testified that the drive could be up to 120 miles for some Texans who live between San Antonio and El Paso -- basically, the lightly populated western portion of the state. So that’s where we focused our attention. We found one newspaper reader who contributed some thoughts on the law to the Dallas Morning News. Kirby Warnock, of the Dallas suburb of Oak Cliff, told the paper that he has family in the Big Bend region, a rural area of west Texas along the Rio Grande. ""If a person lives in tiny Imperial, or Terlingua, they have to get a friend or family member to drive them 60 miles and 120 miles respectively, round-trip, just to be able to vote,"" Warnock said. So we looked at the situation in Terlingua. According to the Texas driver’s license handbook, the closest driver’s license office to Terlingua is in Alpine. According to Google Maps, that is 83.4 miles one way, or about 167 miles round trip. That’s an even longer distance than Perez had said. This shows that there’s at least one place in Texas that would require more than a 120-mile round-trip journey. (Imperial, Texas, for the record, is only 30 miles from Fort Stockton, or a 60-mile round trip, as Warnock indicated.) It’s also worth noting that the 9,145 people who live in Brewster County, Texas -- where Terlingua is located -- are 43 percent Hispanic, which is a bit higher than the state average. Considering that there are no driver’s license offices in 81 of the state’s 254 counties, it’s not hard to imagine that there are other locales beyond Terlingua for which a 120-mile round trip would be necessary to secure a driver’s license. How common would such a long trip be? But just because a 120-mile drive is possible in Texas doesn’t mean it’s common. Most of its 27.5 million people live in metropolitan areas. To get a handle on how many people might be impacted by long trips for a driver’s license, we looked at the 81 smallest-population counties in the state. As it turns out, the population of Texas’s 81 least-populated counties is 343,823, or 1.3 percent of the overall state population. And it’s likely that many of them already have a driver’s license. So the 120-mile threshold is a pretty extreme scenario that affects a tiny slice of Texas’ population. That said, it’s still possible that the law would be a burden for thousands of rural residents living far from a Department of Public Safety office. Our ruling Perez said, ""If you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID."" He has some basis for this statement: The 120-mile figure did crop up in the court case against the law, and we found at least one example of a west Texas town for which the distance was actually even longer. However, Perez not only failed to communicate just how rare this scenario is, but he didn’t even use a basic qualifier like ""some people in Texas."" Taken literally, he said everyone in Texas has to drive 120 miles to get a license. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. CORRECTION, Feb, 27, 2017, 11 a.m.: After we published this article, several readers noted that there was a closer driver’s license office to Terlingua than Fort Stockton -- the one in Alpine. We have changed the article to reflect this. We have not changed our rating. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fd5bccc4-db1f-4a28-9f62-e4bbba9e2063",/factchecks/2017/feb/24/thomas-perez/texas-drive-120-miles-voter-id/
"['Health Care', 'Pennsylvania', 'Reps.  Keith Rothfus, Mike Kelly and Bill Shuster']","
The bad math behind 3 PA GOP congressmen’s Obamacare claim
","Three Republican congressmen from Pennsylvania circulated an op-ed criticizing the Affordable Care Act and touting an alternative health care plan that ""will expand the options for individuals and families to access affordable insurance coverage."" In the three-byline op-ed titled, ""Relief from Obamacare: a better system ahead,"" Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-12th, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-3rd, and Rep. Bill Shuster, R-9th, claimed that ""Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people than it was expected to, and the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion."" But that didn’t sound anything like figures that have come from both sides of the aisle: that some 20 million people are now insured and wouldn’t have been if it weren’t for the Affordable Care Act. So we decided to check the claim. Kate Rosario, a spokeswoman for Rothfus, said the numbers ""all come from the Congressional Budget Office"" and cited three articles — two from The Weekly Standard and one from the Washington Examiner — about CBO figures. The CBO is the nonpartisan arm of Congress charged with determining how much legislative proposals will cost the federal government. Sometimes its projections change as circumstances change (as we’ll see), but PolitiFact considers it a standard for fact-checking claims. Let’s look first at the number of people covered under the Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, the CBO released its cost projections before the law’s final passage. At the time, it estimated the following would occur by 2016: By 2016, those projections had changed. At that point, the Supreme Court had ruled Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act could be left up to the states, changing some projections about who would enroll and how they would do it. The projections by 2016 — the last available full report, according to a CBO spokeswoman — were: That means that in 2010, the CBO estimated 21 million people would be covered under exchanges by 2016. Six years later, it’s 12 million, but an additional 11 million people qualified for Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. That means those covered under Obamacare was actually about two million people higher than the projections. So where’d that 24 million number come from? Rosario referenced a Weekly Standard article from March 2016 titled, ""CBO Misses Its Obamacare Projection by 24 Million People."" In the article, the reporter wrote that in 2013, CBO estimated the ACA would result in ""201 million people having private health insurance."" By 2016, that estimate decreased to 177 million. The article later states that ""[n]one of this is to say that fewer people have ‘coverage’ under Obamacare — it’s just not private coverage."" Rothfus and his colleagues didn’t qualify that in their op-ed, though. They wrote only that Obamacare covered 24 million fewer people than it expected to. In reality, it covers slightly more people than it was expected to. The piece of their claim that asserted ""the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion"" is a bit more complicated. In 2010, the CBO projected that between 2010 and 2019, the gross cost of the ACA to the federal government would be $938 billion, a number used by former President Obama. In its March 2016 report, the CBO estimated that between 2016 and 2026 — a similar length of time but a different time period — the gross cost of coverage provisions would be $1.9 trillion. Rosario blamed the discrepancy on Democrats, saying the original figure provided by the CBO in 2010 was a ""gimmick to make the cost of the bill look less up front than it would end up being."" But cherry-picking those figures from either side of the aisle leaves out some key points. First, the CBO’s estimates for 2010 through 2019 included the first four years after the Act’s passage when spending was negligible, as the healthcare exchange didn’t launch until fall 2013 and Medicaid expansion was still being worked out in individual states. It makes more sense to compare the same years over a smaller time frame. In 2010, the CBO estimated that costs related to the Affordable Care Act would total $623 billion between 2016 and 2019. By March 2016, the projection had actually decreased to $157 billion, or by about 25 percent. The decrease in costs can be partially attributed to the Supreme Court’s decision that Medicaid expansion was optional for states. When taken year-by-year once the Act was in full effect, the CBO’s 2010 projections were actually above what they are now. The CBO wrote in a recent report that ""for 2019, for example, CBO and [the Joint Committee on Taxation] projected in March 2010 that the ACA’s insurance coverage provisions would have a net federal cost of $172 billion; the current projections show a cost of $123 billion — a reduction of $49 billion, or 28 percent."" That checks out. In the CBO’s March 2010 report, it projected the gross cost of coverage provisions in 2019 would be $214 billion. Last year’s report projects the gross cost of coverage provisions in 2019 will be $164 billion, a decrease of $50 billion. The CBO has also warned against using the gross cost of coverage provisions (that’s the $1.9 trillion figure) to assert the ""price tag"" of the Affordable Care Act. That’s because the Act includes a number of tax provisions, penalty assessments and decreases in Medicare payments to hospitals that both bring in revenue and decrease overall costs. The CBO contends that because of that, the ACA is still expected to, on the net, reduce budget deficits. Representatives from both Kelly’s and Shuster’s offices did not respond to requests for comment. Our Ruling Three Republican congressmen wrote in an op-ed that ""Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people than it was expected to, and the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion."" Obamacare actually covers slightly more people than it was expected to. Fewer people are expected to be covered by private health insurance, but the congressmen conflated that with the Affordable Care Act in totality. In addition, the projected gross cost of the ACA over a 10-year span has more than doubled to reach nearly $2 trillion, but original projections included several years in which spending was negligible. To assert that the ""price tag"" of Obamacare is $2 trillion is itself a misleading statement that ignores other provisions of the act that offset those costs. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/66f65bf9-dd5a-4fed-b232-255de662be92",/factchecks/2017/feb/24/reps-keith-rothfus-mike-kelly-and-bill-shuster/bad-math-behind-3-pa-gop-congressmens-obamacare-cl/
"['Education', 'Science', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Greitens overstates number of students not enrolled in physics
","At this year’s State of the State Address, newly elected Gov. Eric Greitens discussed problems with the Missouri education system and why he believes Missouri schools rank last in almost every area. Greitens, a Republican, offered some interesting statistics about how so few students are enrolled in certain math and science courses. His statement about physics enrollment stood out. ""What we need to do is make sure that the money we spend finds its way into the classroom,"" Greitens said. ""Over half of Missouri school districts do not offer a single Advanced Placement class. Over 200 of our 520 school districts did not have a single student in physics. Over 100 did not have a single student enrolled in chemistry. ""We need to expand course access programs, so that every child in Missouri can use technology to get the education they need."" The governor’s claim about enrollment numbers for Missouri high school students in physics courses seemed a bit low. So we wondered, is this really the case? And if so, why do so few Missouri school districts offer physics? What the numbers show Greitens spokesman Parker Briden said the office pulled data from a report compiled by a think tank called the Show-Me Institute. The report, which focused on course access in Missouri, requested information from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education on enrollment of various courses offered in public schools. The report said that, ""During the 2014-2015 school year, of the 507 school districts that offer high school in the state ... 213 districts had no students enrolled in physics."" However, PolitiFact Missouri called into question these numbers, and on Feb. 8, the Show-Me Institute issued a correction to its  data. According to the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, there are 448 school districts offering high school courses in Missouri — not the 507 that the Show-Me Institute had previously stated, or the 520 that Greitens claimed. With the new calculations, the Show-Me Institute found that 154 of those districts — not 213 — had no students enrolled in physics. Why are so few students enrolled? Even after the Show-Me Institute’s correction, the data still showed that a large number of students in Missouri weren’t enrolled in physics during the 2014-2015 school year. However, when the Show-Me Institute crunched its numbers, it only included higher-level courses for each subject. It didn’t take into account the ninth grade course, ""Physics First."" A TIME for Physics First , a program that was created as part of a grant in 2009, takes a different approach to teaching high school science. Meera Chandrasekhar, a leader of the program team and physics professor at MU, said that Physics First reverses the high school science sequence and allows students to apply the algebra skills they are just learning. ""It gets students in ninth grade started off in a really good footing for upper-level science courses because physics is a fundamental science,"" Chandrasekhar said.  How many students really are studying physics? In order to find out how many students are in any physics course in Missouri, we decided to crunch our own numbers independently from the Show-Me Institute. Turns out there was a bit of a difference. When the Show-Me Institute compiled and published its report, it didn’t use finalized numbers for the 2014-2015 school year. The most recent numbers from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education showed that of the 448 school districts offering high school in Missouri, 178 districts did not offer upper-level physics courses. When adding in Physics First, 156 school districts did not offer any physics course. Even though there isn’t a large difference between the two sets of data, 22 of these school districts actually offer Physics First only. Chandrasekhar said that this has to do with requirements for high school teachers. To be able to teach physics at the high school level, a teacher must have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree  in physics. Physics First, however, is taught as more of an introductory science course and the program offers training for high school science teachers who are qualified in other areas such as biology or chemistry. This is a benefit for more rural schools in Missouri that might not necessarily have the resources to hire a physics teacher since physics is not a required science. ""Every child in ninth grade gets to take a physics class then,"" Chandrasekhar said. ""It essentially boosts the numbers."" The national picture When Greitens made his claim about physics enrollment, it was part of a much larger claim — that education in Missouri is behind. ""We have an education system that ranks near last in every measure that matter,"" Greitens said. However, when it comes to physics, that’s far from the truth. Paul Cottle, a physics professor at Florida State University, has focused some of his research on physics course access in the United States. As a part of his research, he requested data from every state education department on its  physics enrollment numbers. For the 2014-2015 school year, Missouri ranked sixth out of the 29 states from which Cottle received data. Missouri’s physics enrollment numbers were also above 50 percent, compared with the 23 other states, which had enrollment rates below 42 percent. Our ruling Greitens said that over 200 of 520 school districts in Missouri didn’t have any students enrolled in physics. The data that Greitens used for his claim contained incorrect information and didn’t account for students enrolled in the Physics First course. Part of Greitens overall claim was that the Missouri education system ranks nearly last in every category. But when it comes to physics, Missouri has an above-average enrollment rate. We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/feb/24/eric-greitens/greitens-overstates-number-students-not-enrolled-p/
"['Economy', 'States', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Is Midland outpacing San Francisco in startups? Yes, but perhaps not like you'd think
","Gov. Greg Abbott closed January 2017 by telling lawmakers that Texas not only leads the nation in oil and gas, it’s enjoying an ""innovation renaissance"" typified by technology development. In his State of the State address, Abbott also called Houston, Dallas and Austin global ""knowledge capitals."" But he sparked our curiosity by saying a West Texas city generates more jobs due to startup businesses than California’s arguably edgiest city. ""Midland,"" Abbott said, jabbing with his left index finger, ""Midland, Texas, now beats the San Francisco area in the percentage of jobs created by startups."" Midland enjoyed a bounce during the latest oil boom. Did it become a hot spot for new jobs and tech jobs? Census Bureau chart We asked Matt Hirsch in Abbott’s office about the basis of this comparison and didn’t hear back. But the day Abbott spoke, journalist R.G. Ratcliffe, writing in Texas Monthly’s Burkablog, attributed the comparison to an analysis of government data by howmuchnet.com, which says it focuses on preparing visualizations about money. That analysis, presented on a U.S. map, indicates that according to U.S. Census data, start-up businesses in 2014 accounted for 4.7 percent of the nonfarm private payroll jobs created that year in Midland. Text above the map states ""the epicenter of job creation from startups in the U.S. is in the heart of Midland, Texas."" In contrast, according to the presentation, startups in the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont part of California accounted for 2.2 percent of such new jobs. Startups accounted for 2 percent of such new jobs in the San Jose-Sunnyvale region, which encompasses Silicon Valley. The average for U.S. metropolitan areas was 2.1 percent. Besides Midland, other high-growth areas were the Madera-Chowchilla section of northern California and Greenville, N.C. (both with startups accounting for 4.5 percent of nonfarm private payroll jobs created) and the Panama City portion of Florida (4.3 percent)--with Victoria, Texas, also ranking high (4 percent), according to the presentation. The map is accompanied by this explanation: ""The Census Bureau defines startups as businesses that began operating in a particular year. There is no prior business activity associated with the startups. The Business Dynamic Statistics produced by the Census Bureau provide valuable information on business in the U.S. across a broad range of statistical categories. Although San Francisco is often associated with tech startups, that definition may include more established businesses that do not qualify as startups according to the fairly strict definition of the Census Bureau."" We clicked next to a bureau BDS web page and downloaded its chart, which places Midland No. 1 nationally in 2014 for its share of nonfarm private payroll jobs created by startups. The chart, posted in September 2016, ranks San Francisco 112th among the nation’s 366 metro areas. According to a bureau publication issued with the chart, startups nationally in 2014 created 2.5 million jobs, an improvement from recent years but still below the 2006 pre-Great-Recession count of 3.5 million such jobs then accounting for 3 percent of U.S. private nonfarm employment. Economists queried For perspective on the rankings, we queried a West Texas economist and a counterpart in the San Francisco area. Amarillo economist Karr Ingham oversees the Midland-Odessa Regional Economic Index, which shows Midland’s economy roaring through 2015, but losing steam almost to the end of 2016 before starting to rebound. Ingham added that hard post-2014 data on jobs from startups doesn’t appear to be available, but his sense is that it’s not possible that Midland’s downturn didn’t affect the local pace of jobs created by startups. Conversely, Ingham said, he’d speculate that San Francisco’s economy wasn’t hurt like the Midland economy by oil and gas price drops. That said, Ingham told us, his suspicion is that Midland still has a greater share of jobs created by startups than San Francisco. In California, Juliana Bunim of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the Midland-topped breakdown wasn’t limited to high-tech startups like businesses famously prolific in and near San Francisco. ""That’s an important distinction because when people hear the word ‘startup’ they often assume they are technology companies,"" Bunim said by email. ""And of course when it comes down to number of jobs and companies, the Bay Area – though a smaller percentage – has significantly more,"" Bunim said. She noted too the bureau breakdown covered jobs created by startups in a year, not over several years. By phone, California economist Christopher Thornberg called the focus on the rate of jobs-created-by-startups metric almost laughable given differences in the respective economies. Thornberg suggested Midland’s 2014 spike in jobs tied to startups was all about an oil boom. ""The idea you’re going to compare what’s happening with oil in Midland what’s happening with high tech in San Francisco, it’s just apples and oranges,"" he said. ""Both are solid economies. They go about it different ways."" A closer look Next, we took a longer look at the Midland-San Francisco comparison. In raw numbers, unsurprisingly, startups in the San Francisco area created far more jobs in 2014 than startups in the Midland area, according to detailed bureau data showing job counts for each of the country’s metro areas starting in the late 1970s. In 2014, according to the data, startups in the San Francisco area were responsible for 43,714 of 1.9 million-plus total jobs. The figure for the Midland area: 3,893 startup-tied jobs out of nearly 87,000 total jobs. We checked too on types of jobs. According to other data pointed out by bureau spokeswoman Jewel Jordan, 29 percent of Midland-area workers in 2014 made oil and gas extraction that area’s No. 1 sector with retail trade accounting for 11 percent of employees and accommodation and food services workers comprising 9 percent of the area’s workers. In the San Francisco area, workers in health care and social assistance accounted for 13 percent of employees, making that the area’s biggest field of work, followed by 12 percent of workers in professional, scientific and technical services and 11 percent in accommodation and food services. We also inquired into whether it was unusual for Midland to outpace San Francisco and other metro areas in a given year. Jordan told us by phone the bureau only made its national rate comparison for the latest year of available data, 2014. But we were able to use the bureau’s annual job counts to calculate rates for all five years through 2014. In each of the years from 2010 through 2014, we found, a greater share of jobs in the Midland area were created by startups than in the San Francisco area. The closest margin: In 2010, 1,291 jobs were launched by startups in the Midland area, accounting for 2 percent of 63,588 total jobs, while 33,223 jobs were created by startups in the San Francisco area, for 1.9 percent of more than 1.77 million total jobs. Notably too, the 4-plus percent of jobs attributed to Midland-area startups in 2014 outpaced the area’s rate in each of the previous four years, which topped out at 2.9 percent in 2013. Our ruling Abbott told legislators Midland ""now beats the San Francisco area in the percentage of jobs created by startups."" The Midland area in 2014 whaled the San Francisco area by this metric. We don’t know where either region ranks now; the government hasn’t done an update. It’s worth clarifying too that startups in this context simply means new businesses; Midland didn’t become a better-than-California high-tech hub. The two economies differ in scale and job types.

"['Immigration', 'Crime', 'California', 'Kamala Harris']","
MOSTLY TRUE: Latinos 40 percent less likely to call police when victims of a crime
","In her first official speech on the U.S. Senate floor, Sen. Kamala Harris said President Trump’s executive actions ""have hit our immigrant and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear in the hearts of millions of good hardworking people."" The California Democrat went on to say that rather than making communities safe, Trump’s immigration raids and policies will make immigrants less likely to report crimes for fear they’ll be deported. ""For this reason,"" Harris said in her Feb. 16, 2017 speech, ""studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime.""  Harris makes her claim at about the 7:40 minute mark in the video above. With so much focus in California on Trump’s immigration orders, we decided to fact-check Harris’s claim. Our research As evidence, a spokesman for Harris pointed to a 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, called ""Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of Police Involvement in Immigration Enforcement."" The study relied on a survey of 2,000 Hispanics, both documented and undocumented, in late 2012 in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. One of the survey questions asked respondents to agree or disagree with the following statement: ""I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status."" Overall, 44 percent of respondents agreed with the statement. That’s just about what Harris said in her claim. ""Basically on target,"" Nik Theodore, who authored the study and is a professor at the University of Chicago’s Department of Urban Planning and Policy, told PolitiFact California. Here’s a breakdown of the share less likely to contact police by county and state surveyed: Chicago (Cook County) Illinois: 39 percent Houston (Harris County) Texas: 47 percent Los Angeles (Los Angeles County) California: 40 percent Phoenix (Maricopa County) Arizona: 50 percent Digging deeper, the study found overall 70 percent of undocumented Latinos and 28 percent of U.S.-born Latinos were hesitant to contact the police when they had been the victim of a crime. It also found that more than 40 percent of respondents were less likely to contact police about a crime they knew had taken place. The study did not report on the share of overall Americans hesitant to call police because it only surveyed Latino residents. While technically Harris says ""studies"" in her claim, indicating there are multiple reports that back this up, her spokesman said he could only find the single report from 2013 as evidence. 2009 Pew study Theodore told us there hasn’t been much research on Latino attitudes about police. We did find a 2009 study by the Pew Research Center that’s somewhat similar. It found 78 percent of Hispanics surveyed in 2008 said they would definitely contact police if they were the victim of a violent crime. An even higher percentage, 84 percent, said they would contact police if they were the victim of a property crime. That would indicate that, at least at that time, a smaller share than 40 percent of Latinos were hesitant to contact police when they were victims of a crime. Asked about this, Theodore said the two studies ask different questions and were completed four years apart. He added that his study ""was done after an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement."" Immigrant rights groups often cite Arizona’s passage of a broad new immigration enforcement measure, SB 1070 in 2010, as eroding trust between Hispanics and law enforcement in that state. The law, which faced numerous legal challenges, required Arizona state law enforcement officers to attempt to determine a person’s immigration status when there was reasonable suspicion that person was an illegal immigrant. When looking at the two studies, only the 2013 University of Chicago study asks whether respondents would be ""less likely"" to contact the police if they had been the victim of a crime ""for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status."" The Pew study does not include the second part of that question. The Pew study did find that about 50 percent of respondents felt ""just some or very little confidence that police will treat Hispanics fairly."" John Thiella is a consultant with the Sacramento-based Latino Policy Coalition, which advocates for immigrant rights. He said Harris used ""a fair statistic"" in describing the percentage of Latinos hesitant to call police when they are victims of a crime. Thiella said there’s long been ""a climate of fear and uncertainty"" between Latinos and the police due to the lack of a clear path forward for undocumented residents. He said Trump’s hard-line immigration policies have deepened that fear. Obama Administration also contributed to the uncertainty by deporting more than 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any president in U.S. history. Our ruling  U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris said in a recent speech that ""studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime."" A 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, found 44 percent of respondents (all Hispanics) agreed with the following statement: ""I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status."" The study’s author called Harris’ claim ""basically on target."" Harris leaves the impression there are multiple reports to back up her claim when she uses the phrase ""studies have shown"" in her claim. Based on our research, and comments from her spokesman, there’s only a single report that backs this up. In 2009, the Pew Research Center produced a report that indicates a smaller share of Hispanics would be hesitant to contact police if they were victims of a crime. Unlike the 2013 report, the Pew study did not raise the issue of whether respondents would be concerned police would ask about their immigration status. It also took place before an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement around the country. In the end, Harris’ statement needs a couple clarifications but is backed up by the 2013 report. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ebea8081-40ba-4fbd-85a4-f10c04656599",/factchecks/2017/feb/24/kamala-harris/mostly-true-latinos-40-percent-less-likely-call-po/

Durbin on target about the location and causes of Chicago gun violence
","Politicians and national media once again have turned their attention to Chicago’s violence. The city’s nearly 800 murders in 2016 prompted President Donald Trump to repeatedly liken parts of Chicago to sections of the Middle East. Trump also has said he will ""send in the feds"" to ""fix the horrible carnage,"" but no signs of federal intervention have been seen so far. Trump’s focus on Chicago, combined with the recent murders of 2-year-old Lavontay White Jr., 11-year-old Takiya Holmes and 12-year-old Kanari Bowers, has only heightened interest in what is happening in Chicago. The subject came up as MSNBC’s Willie Geist interviewed U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on Feb. 15. Geist asked Durbin why Chicago is so violent, especially in comparison to other major cities like New York, which saw a historically low murder rate in 2016. (The Chicago violence segment starts at 3:54)  Durbin made the argument that Chicago, as a whole, doesn’t suffer from constant violence. He said the gun violence only occurs in a few areas. ""You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city,"" Durbin said. ""They are just areas of devastation, economically and otherwise."" Is Chicago’s violence actually that concentrated? Murder across neighborhoods We reached out to Durbin’s office to see where he found this data. His press secretary, John Normoyle, pointed to a Chicago Tribune article published on Feb. 1 titled, ""Violence in Chicago still stubbornly high; Trump reacts again."" The story cites Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson who, during a press conference, said half of Chicago’s homicides in January occurred in three police districts: Englewood on the South Side and the West Side districts of Harrison and Austin.  We followed up with the Police Department’s News Affairs Office to verify that statement. The department’s director of communication, Frank Giancamilli, sent back a press release from Feb. 1 that says the Englewood, Austin and Harrison police districts approximately made up half of Chicago’s 51 murders in January. The distinction is important. Data from each police district crime map shows a total of 22 of the 51 January murders can be attributed to the Englewood, Austin and Harrison districts. It’s a significant chunk — 43 percent — but not exactly half. ‘It’s a tale of two cities’ Loyola University criminology professor Arthur Lurigio said violence in these areas is hardly news. Violence has been rampant in the Englewood, Austin and Harrison areas since the 1960s, Lurigio said. ""Without even seeing the data, I would have picked those three districts,"" Lurigio said. ""These communities haven’t changed, and I expect them to continue being this violent if they experience the same conditions."" This brings us to the second part of Durbin’s statement: The areas in which gun violence is concentrated are plagued by other problems that feed the violence. ""Homicide doesn’t occur in a vacuum,"" Lurigio said. ""Violence is a public health problem, but people only view it in a criminal aspect. People in these areas are plagued by other social, economic and health problems. Things like housing foreclosures, high unemployment and school closures. So a lot of young men devalue their own life because they don’t see a future. There’s no compunction about pulling the trigger."" There’s data backing up Durbin and Lurigio’s claims. According to U.S. Census data compiled by the Chicago Tribune, both Austin and Englewood have an unemployment rate of 21 percent compared to an 11.1 percent rate in Chicago overall.  East Garfield Park and West Garfield Park both make up parts of the Harrison Police District and have unemployment rates of 15 and 25 percent, respectively. Likewise, those neighborhoods have considerably lower individual incomes and higher percentages of households in poverty than Chicago as a whole. ""Chicago is like a tale of two cities,"" Lurigio said ""It’s a city that’s been utterly neglected in some parts. Give the city money to repair infrastructure where its needs it most. Fix the primary school systems in these areas. Don’t call murder a crime problem when the answers lie in investing in these blighted areas."" Our ruling In a recent interview with MSNBC, Durbin spoke about gun violence in Chicago. Durbin said of Chicago, ""You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city. They are just areas of devastation economically and otherwise."" Durbin’s office cited a news article that used statistics from the Chicago Police Department. A press release from CPD News Affairs Office confirms this. It read: ""Three districts (7, 11, 15) are responsible for approximately 50% of murders in January 2017."" We confirmed these statistics by looking at data available on crime maps posted on the CPD Harrison, Englewood and Austin district websites. Durbin’s assessment of Chicago’s homicides is accurate. He did say you can ""almost"" attribute half of deaths to a few communities and 43 percent are in certain west and south side neighborhoods. A crime expert told us these trends have been consistent over the last five decades. Finally, we found data that shows there is a correlation between areas with high violence and economic hardship. For these reasons, we rate Durbin’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5484015b-2ce9-4e5a-baf3-bd3e12527b40",/factchecks/2017/feb/23/richard-durbin/Durbin-right-about-geography-of-Chicago-violence/

Steve Adler says authorities in 43 states turned down 43,000-plus requests to 'detain' immigrants
","Austin Mayor Steve Adler says Travis County’s sheriff isn’t out of line by not automatically honoring federal requests that specific suspects be held 48 hours so immigration authorities can step in. Adler’s February 2017 open letter to residents objects to U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement officers arresting Austin-area residents suspected of living in the country without legal authorization.The letter further says that ""participating in a voluntary, warrantless ‘detainer’ program, which is not required by law, will make our community less safe because it jeopardizes community trust."" ""In fact, and you wouldn’t know it from the debate here locally, local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015,"" Adler's letter says. ""Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states,"" Adler wrote. We wondered about those figures. Have detainer requests been turned down almost everywhere? Mayor’s backup Adler was piping up in defense of the county’s new sheriff, Sally Hernandez, a Democrat who announced in January 2017 that as of the next month, her department would agree to hold an inmate in response to an ICE detainer request only if she or he were charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking — or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Otherwise, inmates would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Through the first eight days of implementation, we later determined, 45 individuals for whom detainer requests were denied were released by the county--with about 150 inmates whose detainer requests were refused remaining behind bars, in some cases unable to make bond. Adler’s letter includes, right next to the figures, a web link to a Feb. 10, 2017, story posted by Stateline, a nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts journalism project that focuses on state policies. The story, ""Sheriffs Still Looking for Clarity on Deportation,"" introduces the Adler-cited figures after referring to President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order directing federal agencies to act against ""removable"" immigrants and to enlist state and local law enforcement agencies to apprehend such individuals: ""When considering whether to deport prisoners under Obama administration policies, ICE focused on those deemed to ‘pose a threat to public safety’ because of gang activity or felony convictions unrelated to immigration status. Trump’s executive order expands that focus to include any criminal activity, fraud or abuse of public benefits, or failure to obey a court order to leave the country. ""Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states."" A 26-month study The story lacks a source for those numbers. But to our query, Stateline reporter Tim Henderson pointed us to a chart posted in August 2016 by the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which describes itself as a data gathering, research and distribution organization focused on federal staffing, spending and enforcement activities. TRAC’s chart (Table 1 here), drawing on ICE data, indicates that from October 2013 to December 2015, local police agencies in 43 states refused to honor 16,296 detainer requests--as Adler basically said. Nationally, the chart says, 6.1 percent of detainer requests were denied over the 26 months. Also as Adler said, the chart identifies Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming as the only states where no requests were denied, together accounting for a scant 1,056 of 267,548 of the total detainer requests tallied nationally. For our part, we noticed that adding up the tallies shown for each of the states yielded smaller totals than the national totals topping the chart. That is, it looked like among the 50 states over the 26 months, 13,372 of 242,525 detainer requests were denied, which breaks out to a 5.5 percent denial rate or 94.5 percent detainer approval rate. So, would it be more accurate to say that more than 13,000 (not more than 16,000) detainer requests were denied in 43 states? It's not that simple. First, a note below the chart clarifies that the presented national totals fold in detainer requests submitted to and denied by jurisdictions in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories as well as requests made or denied for which a state wasn’t listed on federal paperwork. Second, Sue Long, the clearinghouse’s director, told us by phone that most detainer requests and denials tallied in the national totals but not showing in the state-by-state entries reflect gaps or blanks in ICE forms related to actions in states, not in Puerto Rico or beyond. Long otherwise cautioned that denials of detainer requests shouldn’t instantly be characterized as local law agencies failing to cooperate with federal colleagues. For instance, she said, local jurisdictions might wish to maintain control over the prosecution of a local crime rather than risk losing a suspect to deportation. Also, Long advised, the clearinghouse has yet to reach a more up-to-date analysis of detainer requests and requests denied. ICE-provided data, she said, has proved increasingly incomplete. Most detainer refusals in a few states We noticed that TRAC’s chart gives helpful context to the mayor’s claim. For instance, the chart shows the bulk of detainer denials in the study period occurred in a handful of states with only a few occurring in each of more than 20 states including Texas, which led the nation with 58,452 federal requests to hold suspects--and agencies in the state refused only 18 requests. From the chart, we broke out the 10 states that fielded the greatest number of detention requests--finding refusal rates ranging from nearly zero in several states up to 15 percent or 16 percent in three states: STATE Total Requests to Detain Requests Refused* % Requests Refused TEXAS 58,452 18 0.03% CALIFORNIA 46,444 7,292 15.70% ARIZONA 16,724 13 0.10% FLORIDA 11,462 1,022 8.90% GEORGIA 11,089 37 0.30% NEW YORK 10,768 1,696 15.80% NORTH CAROLINA 6,275 20 0.30% VIRGINIA 5,860 16 0.30% PENNSYLVANIA 5,382 171 3.20% COLORADO 5,268 804 15.30% SOURCE: Report including Table 1, ""Outcome of ICE I-247 Detainer Requests by State, FY 2014 - FY 2016,"" ""Has Cooperation by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Improved ICE's Apprehension Numbers?,"" Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, August 12, 2016 In raw numbers, local agencies in California led the nation by a wide margin in refusals with 7,292 requests rebuffed. That total was followed by detainers refused by departments in New York (1,696 refusals); Florida (1,022); and Colorado (804), TRAC’s chart shows. Put another way, agencies in the four states accounted for 81 percent of detainers refused in the 50 states. Eight other states had 129 or more refused requests each, the chart shows. Put another way, a dozen states accounted for 96 percent of the detainer requests denied in the 50 states. At the low end, the chart shows a dozen states had 10 or fewer denied requests. We also looked at refusal rates by state. According to the chart, eight states led the nation with detainer refusal rates of 10 percent to nearly 16 percent (topped by agencies in New York and California). In contrast, local departments in 27 states including Texas had refusal rates of 2 percent or less, leaving eight states with refusal rates of 2.5 percent to nearly 9 percent. Another sheriff comments and mayor stands by claim For perspective outside Travis County, we reached Patrick Royal of the National Sheriffs’ Association who guided us to A.J. ""Andy"" Louderback, the sheriff for Jackson County, Texas, and legislative director of the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas. By phone, Louderback called Adler’s claim a misrepresentation because the vast majority of jurisdictions nationally didn’t deny detainer requests, especially those in Texas. We similarly shared the TRAC chart and our 50-state figures with Adler spokesman Jason Stanford who said by email: ""For us, what the"" mayor’s ""statement means is that detainers without warrants are not accepted in many places around the country and that our sheriff is not alone (we continue to believe that is true)."" Our ruling Adler said: ""Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states."" Adler’s figures trace to research based on ICE data, though our review of the figures suggests that fewer detainer requests might have been refused by local law enforcement agencies. Missing here too is that nearly all detainer requests were honored nationally and most of the tallied detainer refusals occurred in a handful of states. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Target did not stop selling the Bible in stores, despite fake news reports
","A fake news story that claimed discount store chain Target would no longer sell the Bible doesn’t stand up to a more careful reading. The website NewsLeak.co, which is registered to an address in the Eurasian capital of  Tbilisi, Georgia, ran an undated story around Feb. 16, 2017, with the headline, ""Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible."" The story was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to rid its news feeds of fake news. The story said the store had been under fire for its policy of allowing transgendered customers to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identified. That part is accurate. But the story veers into false territory by saying Target CEO Bryan Hornell claimed the chain ""will no longer cater to religious extremists"" by selling the Bible. Hornell allegedly said in a letter that Targets would start phasing out anything related to religion — including Christmas decorations — in its stores. There are many examples of this story all over the Internet, but none of them are true. They’re all based on a (currently deleted) May 16, 2016, story from NationalReport.net, a site that generates made-up articles. ""All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news,"" its disclaimer reads. That disclaimer isn’t on the stories themselves, and don’t look to appear on earnest reposts of the article on other sites. Beyond that, there are clues that this isn’t a real story, starting with the fact that the chairman and CEO of Target is Brian Cornell, not Bryan Hornell. As for being able to buy the good book, a search of the Target.com website turns up 791 results in a search for ""Holy Bible,"" so it’s readily available. But just to make sure, we contacted Target’s public relations department, which assured us that yes, you can still buy the Bible in stores. And no, there were no plans to change that. Target did eventually start offering private bathrooms to try to settle the boycott over transgendered bathrooms, but it never said it would stop selling the Bible.

Tale of killer whales eating Japanese whalers is fake news

","A fake story being shared on social media about Japanese whalers meeting an untimely end in the bellies of a pod of orcas may sound fishy for a reason — it is. ""Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead,"" shouts a horror-show headline on a Feb. 11, 2017, post on ReligionMind.com. Facebook brought the post to our attention as potentially being fake as part of its efforts to eliminate false stories from its news feeds. The story — which again, didn’t happen — recounts the fate of the hapless crew of the whaler MV Nisshin Maru, many of whom abandoned ship after a gas leak forced them to clear the deck. The ship was supposedly stranded in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, off the coast of South Africa. In a twist of irony too dark to be true (because it isn’t), 16 whalers were swallowed by killer whales within a half hour of hitting the water. The yarn cast a wide net, landing on several websites, with one version of the article posted as late as Feb. 12. But we didn’t take the bait. The origin of this fish tale (yes, we know killer whales are mammals) goes all the way back to July 28, 2014. That’s when WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting contrived stories, first published the saga of the Nisshin Maru. The story was pretty popular back then, too, because several media outlets wrote articles to point out it was a made-up story. Nearly all of them made reference to the site’s disclaimer, which reads, ""All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news."" There’s no indication on the various posts we found identifying the story is fake. There’s also no mention that it is several years old. We’ve noticed here at PolitiFact that some fake news stories seem to come back into the social media consciousness after a couple of years in limbo. We don’t know why this one returned to port after so long adrift, but the story is still anchored in fiction.

David Clarke says Michelle Obama said she was proud of U.S. only after Barack Obama became president
","Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a big enough supporter of President Donald Trump that he has been mentioned for a role in the administration, has been a frequent basher of former President Barack Obama. On Feb. 17, 2017, he turned to attacking the former first lady. ""Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS,"" Clarke charged on Twitter: ""I've never been prouder since we got rid of him."" With the tweet was a photo of Clarke, who is being encouraged by some to run against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in 2018. Flexing his biceps, Clarke is shown wearing a T-shirt with an image of Trump standing on a tank and holding a rifle. During Obama’s first presidential campaign, Obama did take some flack for remarks she made in Wisconsin about being proud of her country. Let’s see whether Clarke is accurately describing what she said. Two Wisconsin speeches Obama campaigned for her husband in Milwaukee and Madison on Feb. 18, 2008, the day before Wisconsin’s primary. He had won eight consecutive Democratic primaries and caucuses over Hillary Clinton. In Milwaukee, Michelle Obama said: People in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and … for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback. But remarks she made later in Madison were the ones that gained widespread media attention. Several minutes into her speech, Obama noted her husband’s primary victory in South Carolina and continued by saying: And then he went on to win throughout the country. And when’s the last time we’ve seen a candidate -- male, female, whatever party -- who has been able to pull together victories that included Utah and Idaho and Louisiana and Maine and Washington and Illinois. I don’t think we’ve seen that. But what we’ve learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback. It is making a comeback and let me tell you something: For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change. And I have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment. I’ve seen people who are hungry to be unified around some basic common issues and it’s made me proud. So, Obama’s remark was made before her husband had won the Democratic nomination and nine months before was elected president. And Obama said she was proud because Americans were hungry for change, not just because her husband was winning. But her statement was controversial. Asked the day after the Wisconsin primary, which her husband won, if she wanted to clarify her remarks, Obama said: What I was clearly talking about was that I'm proud in how Americans are engaging in the political process. For the first time in my lifetime, I'm seeing people rolling up their sleeves in a way that I haven't seen and really trying to figure this out -- and that's the source of pride that I was talking about. Bill Kristol, editor-at-large of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, said at the time that Obama’s original comment ""was sort of revealing,"" adding:

She was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress ….I don’t think the American people think on the whole that the last 25 years of American history is a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of.
  CNN included the key part of Obama’s remark -- ""For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change"" -- in a documentary on her that aired in January 2017. That clip was followed by David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, saying: Those kinds of moments gave you a heartburn. By the same token, it became clear to me very quickly that we had failed her, because we threw her out there without adequate staffing, without adequate preparation. For his part, Clarke didn’t provide us any information to back his claim. The sheriff’s office spokeswoman told us the sheriff said: ""Go suck an egg"" and that when he does provide us evidence of his claims, PolitiFact Wisconsin ""still finds a way to contort a way to say false."" Our rating Clarke says Obama ""said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS."" He provided us and we could find no evidence of such a statement. What Obama said -- nine months before her husband was elected president -- was that for the first time in her adult life, she was proud of her country not just because Barack Obama had done well in pursuing the presidential nomination, but also ""because I think people are hungry for change.""

Fact-checking Swedish response to Donald Trump campaign cry
","Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt is taking a card out of President Donald Trump’s playbook: foreign relations in 140 characters or less. At a political rally in Melbourne, Fla., on Feb. 18, Trump wrongly suggested a horrible crime had taken place in Sweden. After media reports, including PolitiFact, noted that no terrorist incident transpired in Sweden Feb. 17, Trump tried to clarify his statement multiple times. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT! Bildt — unsatisfied with Trump’s latest charge — struck back. ""Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad,"" Bildt wrote in a tweet Feb. 20. Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad. It’s worth noting that Trump actually spoke at the Orlando Melbourne International airport, which is approximately 65 miles southeast of Orlando and located in Brevard County, not Orange. Still, the shade being thrown was too much to resist, so PolitiFact Florida decided to take a look at Bildt’s claim for ourselves. What we found is that Bildt’s assertion relies on data that isn’t uniformly available yet, and is based on a single point of time. Not only does picking one year make it hard to make meaningful comparisons, it also includes the year with the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Crunching the numbers We never heard back from Bildt’s assistant about where he got his numbers, which made it impossible to verify the specific point he made. Bildt specifically said ""last year"" in his comparison, but 2016 data regarding homicides won’t be uniformly available in Sweden until March 30. Furthermore, experts said using Orlando’s 2016 murder count inflates the real murder rate because of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. ""You can't make meaningful comparisons when you’re using outliers, which is why it’s better to look at long-term trends in crime,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor at the State University of New York in Oswego. With these factors in mind, we tried to answer the overarching question Bildt’s point makes: Are there typically more murders in Orange County, which includes Orlando and has a population of about 1.2 million people, than in Sweden, population 9.8 million as of 2015? To get the most accurate picture of the situation, Schildkraut compiled 10 years worth of data (2006-15) from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI Uniform Crime Report and the The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Two important notes before we go on. First, Bildt said murders. The FBI tracks homicides. Murder falls under the larger homicide umbrella, which also includes justifiable or excusable homicides, for example. The statistics that Schildkraut provided are for murder and non-negligent manslaughter, which are still homicides, but eliminate the other justifiable or excusable cases. Second, Sweden, Orange County, Orlando and Melbourne have drastically different populations, so to get the best idea of how the Florida locations compare to Sweden it’s better to calculate the homicide rates and then compare. That rate can be calculated by dividing the number of homicides by the population and then multiplying that total by 100,000. For Orange County, Orlando and Sweden, Schildkraut found the number of homicides, the population and the homicide rate. That data shows that the homicide rate in Orange County and Orlando between 2006 to 2015 was significantly higher than Sweden’s. From 2006 to 2015, Sweden’s homicide rate has remained steady, hovering between 0.7 to 1.2 homicides for every 100,000 people. Orlando’s homicide rate has been significantly higher through the years. It peaked in 2006 with 22.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 2006. It’s lowest rate was in 2015, when there were 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people. As for Orange County, which pulls in the Orlando suburbs, the homicide rate was still significantly higher than in Sweden. In 2015, the homicide rate in Orange County was roughly 4.3 homicides for every 100,000 people. Even if you check Melbourne, the actual location of Trump’s speech, the pattern holds. Our ruling Bildt said, ""Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad."" We're not sure where Bildt got his numbers from because data from 2016 is incomplete. But if history is any guide, he will actually have understated the comparison between Orlando, Orange County and Sweden. For almost a decade, homicide rates in those Florida municipalities have far exceeded that of Sweden. His argument also would have been on par for Melbourne too, had Bildt designated that as the city Trump spoke in.

""You may not be interested in the trouble on a far-off street or across the Mediterranean on the other side of the globe, but let me assure you, that trouble is interested in you,"" Bono said. The singer-activist put education high on the list of where donors should put their money. ""We need a plan to make sure all girls can go to school -- 130 million girls around the world don't,"" Bono said. ""For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. Some studies even suggest that more education can reduce a country's risk of conflict by 20 percent."" We wondered about the power of education to lift the incomes of women. Does each year of schooling actually lead to a 12 percent rise in earnings? According to the most recent research, it does. A 2014 study from the World Bank took data from 139 countries over a span of four decades and found that both men and women gain from going to school, and women gain more. ""When considering only males, the rate of return to another year of schooling is 9.6 percent, and for females the rate of returns is much higher, at 11.7 percent,"" the authors wrote. Their chart helps show the differences.  Bono’s press office at One, the advocacy organization he co-founded, told us this was the study behind his claim. The findings seem pretty clear, but we checked with Christina Kwauk, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington. Kwauk said not only is the average gain correct, but schooling continues to pay as women rise through the education system. ""Higher levels of education have even higher rates of return,"" she said. ""For example, an additional year of tertiary education is associated with nearly a 17 percent increase in income."" Research also shows that gains are highest in low-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average increase is over 14 percent for women. That’s due in part to the very low starting point. It’s not totally clear why women gain more than men from education, but one theory is that women get a double advantage from going to school. Not only does it increase their skills -- as it does for a man -- but it also reduces the wage gap between men and women. So long as a society is open to hiring a woman for a higher paid job, her income bump will be larger compared to women with less education. A number of studies provide important caveats. They highlight that the quality of education matters, and simply finishing one year of schooling is not a guarantee that someone has learned as much as one might expect. Social attitudes also have an strong impact. If women are excluded from certain kinds of work, that will place a limit on their income gains. Our ruling Bono said that for every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. A recent World Bank study based on numbers from more than a hundred countries found that the average woman gained 11.7 percent more in wages with each year of school. Rounding up to 12 percent seems fair. These gains can vary both up and down, depending on the country, but that’s the nature of an average.

Recidivism rate at Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison for males is 66%, Missouri's is only 8%?
","For two years, Wisconsin’s youth prison for males has been under an FBI-led criminal investigation into allegations of prisoner abuse, child neglect, sexual assault, intimidation of witnesses and victims, strangulation and tampering with public records. Should the facility, Lincoln Hills School, be shut down? That question was posed to Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz in an interview on Nov. 21, 2017, the day after the Oshkosh Democrat toured Lincoln Hills. Responding to Wisconsin Eye TV host Steven Walters, Hintz said an alternative would have to be developed first. Then he made a statement that seemed to indict the facility, saying: We have a 66 percent recidivism rate for the kids there, in the three years after they get out. States like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent."" So, 66 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates commit new offenses within three years of being released? And that’s eight times higher than in states such as Missouri, which has been held up as a potential model for Wisconsin? We’ll see that, as national experts have stated, comparing states on juvenile recidivism is not easily done. The trouble at Lincoln Hills Lincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, with most inmates in their mid-to late-teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles. Incarcerating an inmate there costs more than $100,000 a year. Groups such as Youth Justice Milwaukee, which is calling for Wisconsin’s youth prisons to be closed, argue that conditions at Lincoln Hills can lead to higher recidivism -- inmates committing new offenses after they’re released. Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has gone even further than Hintz, saying 75 percent of Lincoln Hills inmates fall back into criminal activity. Meanwhile, Missouri -- when facing problems similar to those at Lincoln Hills, such as fights between inmates, long stints in solitary confinement and injuries inflicted by guards -- replaced large institutions with small facilities, closer to young offenders' homes. But the contrast in recidivism between the two states is not how Hintz portrays it. Hintz’s partially accurate evidence To back Hintz’s claim, his office cited a January 2017 report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin  Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It says that according to the latest available data, Lincoln Hills has a three-year recidivism rate of 63 percent. That is, 278 juveniles were released from Lincoln Hills in 2011 and 63 percent returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, by 2014. So, Hintz’s claim of a 66 percent recidivism rate at Lincoln Hills is high by only three percentage points. Missouri’s definition of recidivism is roughly similar to Wisconsin’s, but has four parts. It includes youths who are sent back to the juvenile system, are sent to adult prison, are put on probation, or are put into a 120-day program. But the latest State of Missouri figures show Missouri’s three-year recidivism rate, for 2013 to 2016, is 30 percent. That’s far less than Lincoln Hills’ 63 percent. But it’s also much higher than the 8 percent Hintz claimed. That lower rate applies only to the first part of Missouri’s recidivism definition -- youths who commit new offenses and are sent back to the youth system. Apples and oranges There are also other problems with comparing Lincoln Hills to Missouri: Lincoln Hills Missouri Latest three-year recidivism rate is 2011-2014 Latest recidivism rate is 2013-2016 Only male inmates Male and female offenders Inmates have committed serious, violent crimes  — including homicide and robbery — or have had repeated run-ins with the law and didn’t turn their behavior around after being sent to group homes. Youths have committed a wide variety of offenses, from serious felonies to truancy and curfew violations. Those create a major apples-to-oranges problem for Hintz’s statement, particularly the fact Missouri’s count includes many less serious offenders than Lincoln Hills. Our rating Hintz says Wisconsin's Lincoln Hills youth prison has a ""66 percent recidivism rate,"" while ""states like Missouri, that have more of a regional model -- 8 percent."" He is essentially correct on Wisconsin. The latest figures show that 63 percent of Lincoln Hills offenders are returned to either a juvenile correctional facility or an adult prison, or were placed on probation for a new offense, within three years of being released. But the comparison to Missouri misses on several counts. Missouri reports a three-year youth recidivism rate of 30 percent, not 8 percent -- and even that is misleading. While Lincoln Hills incarcerates only serious male offenders, Missouri’s youth correctional system includes males and females who commit offenses ranging from serious crimes to truancy. So, Hintz is comparing two significantly different populations. Hintz’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

Tom Luce understates share of Texas students succeeding in education after high school
","Former gubernatorial hopeful Tom Luce, the Dallas lawyer long associated with Ross Perot and the landmark 1984 overhaul of state education laws, recently declared that few Texas students succeed in formal schooling past high school, we learned from a reporter’s tweet. Luce, the lead witness at a mid-November 2017 hearing held by the Texas House Select Committee on Economic Competitiveness, said: ""Here are the facts: Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree. Now stop and think about that: Just 20 percent of our youngsters achieve one of those three credentials."" Luce went on to say the state should be at 80 percent instead. That 20 percent figure was familiar. In March 2016, the state’s commissioner of higher education, Raymund Paredes, told lawmakers that just 20 percent of Texas eighth-graders earn a college degree or other advanced certificate within 11 years (or six years after high school). That conclusion tied to a research approach initially laid out in a February 2012 report commissioned by the Houston Endowment stating that researchers conducted a ""cohort analysis of every student who started 8th grade in a Texas public school in 1996, 1997, and 1998,"" subsequently tracking progress over 11 years. By phone, Luce told us he got his figure from that same longitudinal research posted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Luce also provided a document headlined: ""Given current trajectory, Texas at risk for decreasing educational attainment."" The document states that 20.9 percent of the state’s eighth-graders in 2005 later earned a certificate or degree from a Texas college or university within six years after high school graduation--with achievement rates varying by ethnicity and economic status. A Coordinating Board staff spokeswoman, Kelly Carper Polden, responded to our emailed inquiry about educational attainment after high school by pointing out a page in the agency’s April 2017 Texas Public Higher Education Almanac indicating that by 2016, of every 100 students enrolled in eighth grade in fall 2005, 74 had graduated from a public high school, 54 had enrolled in higher education in the state and 21 had received a Texas higher education degree or certificate within six years of leaving high school. Of the 21, the almanac says, one student received a certificate, four received an associate degree and 15 received a bachelor’s degree or more. On point to Luce’s focus on high school graduates, Polden also told us that 27 percent of eighth-graders in fall 2005 who went on to graduate from high school had completed a Texas college degree or certificate by 2016. Graduates going to college out of state We recognized, though, that the provided percentages don’t take into account post high-school achievements outside Texas. Polden said the almanac figures do not fold in such students ""because we don’t consistently have that data."" We wondered how to account for students ultimately earning certificates or college degrees out of state. According to a February 2017 board document, about 5 percent of Texas high-school graduates in recent years enrolled the subsequent fall at an out-of-state college. By phone when we asked, David Gardner, the board’s deputy commissioner for academic planning and policy, estimated that at least 30 percent of all high school graduates who were in eighth grade in fall 2005 have since earned a post-high-school degree or certificate. Gardner said too that many students have accumulated college credit but not yet landed a degree. John Wyatt at the agency emailed us a pie chart indicating another 3 percent of high school graduates had completed a degree or certificate out of state by 2016. That chart indicates that 70 percent of those graduates hadn’t attained a post-high-school degree or certificate by 2016.
  SOURCE: Email, John Wyatt, director of external relations, THECB, Dec. 1, 2017 Another agency’s analysis We also queried the Texas Education Agency, which oversees public schools. By email, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us how to generate an agency report gauging students who went on to get degrees from Texas institutions. Upshot: Some 24 percent of the state’s 2008-09 high-school graduates earned a Texas community college or four-year college degree by 2015-16:  SOURCE: Report, ""2015-16 Texas Public Schools State Summary,"" Texas Education Agency (fetched from website, ""Education Summary - Statewide,"" Texas Public Education Information Resource, TEA and THECB, Nov. 29, 2017) We circled back to Luce, who said by phone that if 27 percent of high school graduates got a Texas college degree or certificate within six years of graduation, that’s ""still a problem."" Our ruling Luce said: ""Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree."" This claim has an element of a truth in that a minority of Texas high school graduates shortly earn college degrees or other certificates. But Luce's 20 percent figure is incomplete and inaccurate. Notably, it's limited to students landing degrees in Texas only, leaving out students who attended college out of state. In contrast, we found that some 30 percent of high school graduates landed a college degree or other post-high-school certificate within six years of graduation — which leaves Luce's percentage off by 50 percent. The number closest to what Luce cited applies to eighth-graders enrolled in fall 2005;  21 percent of them ultimately earned a college degree or other educational certificate from a Texas institution. We rate Luce’s statement at the hearing Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

NC governor cherry-picks stats showing tax breaks for wealthiest 1 percent
","North Carolina’s U.S. senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, are among the most vocal proponents of GOP plans to change the federal tax code. The Tar Heel State’s top Democrat, meanwhile, is among the plans’ most high-profile detractors. Gov. Roy Cooper recently criticized House and Senate efforts to cut taxes, saying they overwhelmingly favor groups that need help the least – large corporations and millionaires. While Tillis recently pointed to North Carolina as a positive example for change, Cooper highlighted what he said were the negative consequences of the state tax code and said Congress’ efforts seem ""eerily familiar"" in his state. The tax reform efforts in NC and in Washington have divided local Republicans and Democrats. ""Unfortunately, decisions made by the Republican state legislature have left too many middle class families out of our state’s economic growth,"" Cooper wrote in a Nov. 30 op-ed published on Medium.com. ""Those decisions rigged the system to let those at the top reap most of the rewards."" Congressional Republicans, he said, are charting the same course. ""In total, it is estimated that half of the tax breaks in this proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent,"" Cooper wrote. ""The Joint Committee on Taxation shows that, on average, taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would end up paying more in taxes."" PolitiFact’s recent fact-check of Tillis shows that Cooper is partly right about taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 a year, but he left out the fact that most Americans would get a tax cut initially. Experts say that, by 2027, the Senate plan will leave them paying more in taxes, barring further changes in law. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here. Unlike Tillis, Cooper didn’t single out one of the plans. Instead he spoke generally about how ""this proposal"" would affect the wealthiest Americans. The plan changes by year PolitiFact reached out to Cooper for clarification. Ford Porter, his spokesman, cited analyses of each plan by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Tax Policy Center (let’s call it the TPC) found that the Senate plan gives 61.8 percent of the tax cuts to the top 1 percent ""once the cuts are phased-in,"" Porter said. ""Their analysis of the House bill showed 47 percent (of the cuts) going to the top 1 percent,"" he added. Porter is right. But key words to consider are ""once the cuts are phased in."" The report shows that estimates don’t bear out Cooper’s claim until 2027, because that’s when many of the deductions for lower-income Americans are phased-out. In 2019, the center says the top 1 percent would get 17.6 percent of the Senate plan’s total federal tax change, a share that would rise to 22 percent in 2025. Porter acknowledges that distinction in his email. But Cooper’s op-ed failed to elaborate on his claim, which isn’t true if examined in the years prior to 2027. Change, in dollars What does that look like in financial terms? The Tax Foundation is a conservative-leaning nonprofit organization that examines the link between tax policies and the economy. The foundation found that, under the Senate plan, the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would initially keep 1.1 to 1.9 percent more of their income. America’s wealthiest – the one-percenters – would initially keep about 7.5 percent more of their money because of cuts to the corporate tax rate, as well as the income tax rate. By 2027, things change for the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers. The foundation estimates they’ll keep just 0.3 to 0.4 percent more. The top 1 percent, however, would keep 4.5 percent more compared to today’s rates. The TPC has a similar analysis. The center says that in 2019, the Senate plan would cut taxes by an average of $900 for taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $87,000 a year. The average tax cut for the top 1 percent would be $34,000. The House bill similarly phases-out deductions for lower-income Americans, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate for the TPC. In the House bill, for example, ""there’s a $300 child and family credit that expires after five years at the end of 2022. That would be for a family of four, that would be a $1,200 tax credit,"" Rosenberg said. By 2027, the analysis says those middle-income taxpayers would get cuts of less than 0.1 percent while the average ""one-percenters"" would still enjoy taxes that are 1.4 percent lower than they are right now. Our ruling Cooper said half of the tax breaks in Senate Republicans’ proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. If key changes in the plan remain temporary, Cooper’s claim would come to fruition, but not for 10 years. Cooper’s op-ed doesn’t explain that change.

GOP tax bill and overseas profits: Beware the hype
","The House and Senate tax bills are a boon to American multinational companies that have booked trillions of dollars in profits overseas. Funds claimed by the companies would see tax rates well below even the much-reduced 20 percent corporate rate in the proposed bills. On the Senate side, companies would face a 14.5 percent tax on money they had been holding as cash or securities, and for money invested in hard assets, the rate could be as low as 7.5 percent. Chris Ruddy, CEO of the conservative website Newsmax, cast this as a flood of money ""three times the Obama stimulus"" that would ""drive the economy for the next 10 years."" ""I think after this tax bill, it's actually going to be a watershed, because $3 trillion in offshore money, forget about the individual and corporate tax rates, $3 trillion of all that Apple money is coming back into the economy,"" Ruddy said on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Dec. 3. (Apple and Google are the poster children of overseas cash, but there are many others, from General Electric to Pfizer to Coca-Cola.) We took a closer look at Ruddy’s claim that ""$3 trillion in offshore money ... is coming into the economy."" Ruddy’s statement is part prediction — the money will juice the economy — and part statement of fact — there’s $3 trillion out there waiting to come into the American economy. Recent history gives reasons to doubt whether the first part will come true, but we don’t fact-check predictions. We can, however, look at whether that money is outside the American economy, as Ruddy said. Ruddy told us that he got his $3 trillion figure from a New York Times article, which said the Senate and House plans would ""allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home."" Where things get tricky is where that money is today. There’s considerable evidence that a large chunk of it, a bit under one-half, already is in the U.S. economy. When a Senate committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations surveyed 27 American multinational corporations in 2011, it found that about 46 percent of tax-deferred foreign earnings were in ""in U.S. bank accounts or invested in U.S. assets such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. stocks other than their own, U.S. bonds, or U.S. mutual funds."" The investment research firm Moody’s calculated that in 2017, foreign subsidiaries of American multinationals held about $1.4 trillion in cash or marketable securities. With estimates of total overseas profits ranging from $2.6 trillion to $3.1 trillion, tax lawyer Steven Rosenthal at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said ""40 percent or so is about right"" for the share of profits in the United States. In an October tax note, Goldman Sachs economists wrote that thanks to those holdings, offshore profits are ""largely available for domestic activities."" There’s no dispute that ""companies can invest offshore funds in U.S. markets,"" said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. Under American law, any money made on those investments is taxable, but the underlying cash remains outside the reach of the IRS. Ruddy told us ""even if it’s in a U.S. bank account, they can’t use it for U.S. operations, as far as I understand."" Ruddy has a point, but nothing keeps the money on the other side of the border. And once it’s put into the economy, it moves around as loans or equity investments in companies that seek to expand. That’s how the U.S. Treasury Department saw it just before President Donald Trump took office. In making the case for tax reform, the department’s Office of Tax Policy said that it is ""a common misconception"" offshore profits must remain outside the United States. ""While there are limitations on how those funds may be used by the corporation, in general those assets are held for investment at U.S. financial institutions, and thus contribute to investment and capital formation in the United States,"" they wrote. American multinationals can also use this to effectively bring home money virtually tax-free, according to Edward Kleinbard, professor of tax law at the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law and former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation Kleinbard described to lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee Feb. 24, 2016, how Apple floated a $12 billion bond in 2016: ""The interest expense will be fully deductible by Apple, and its enormous hoard of foreign earnings will continue to grow."" In fact, Kleinbard said the tax deduction on the interest paid on the bond could largely offset the interest earned by Apple’s offshore cash invested in America. ""In that case, the principal of the bond offering will be the economic equivalent of a tax-free repatriation – in this case of $12 billion,"" Kleinbard said. Kleinbard also told us that some of the overseas profits have already ended up in foreign brick-and-mortar projects. ""Those investments aren’t picking up and moving to the U.S.,"" he said. ""If you are a global business, of course you need at least some real investments throughout the world."" Kleinbard’s rough estimate is that about half of the offshore profits are in cash and other liquid assets, and the other half are in ""real investments in non-U.S. businesses."" Ruddy said that $3 trillion in offshore money could come into the American economy under the Republican tax bills. That assumes that all of that money is overseas and readily available. Neither assumption is accurate. A 2011 Senate study found that a bit under half of offshore profits are already in the United States in the form of bank accounts or investments in bonds or stocks. Investment firms and independent researchers generally agree that the fraction hovers around 40 to 45 percent of all overseas profits. The consensus is that a change in tax law would not inject a flood of new money into the economy because it is already here. A large portion of the other half is tied up in actual projects in businesses overseas. Ruddy’s notion that $3 trillion is sitting there available for use falls wide of the facts. Some portion would be freed up, but not more than that. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/dec/05/chris-ruddy/gop-tax-bill-overseas-profits-beware-hype/

The lawsuit alleges that Trump violated anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution because he benefits financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties. The emoluments clause of the Constitution says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress. On Nov. 28, U.S. District Court Judge Peter J. Messitte ruled that that D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can serve subpoenas requiring Trump-owned companies to preserve documents. The Post described the decision as ""a small advancement"" in the case. We read Messitte’s two-paragraph decision and saw nothing that addressed Trump himself being subpoenaed. Here is the main part: ""It is hereby ordered that the parties shall be permitted to serve subpoenas on third-parties for the sole purpose of preservation of documents,"" the judge wrote. We asked a spokeswoman for the Maryland attorney general if the ruling stated that the plaintiffs could subpoena Trump. ""No, it only relates to preservation of documents,"" Raquel Coombs said. Robert Marus, a spokesman for the D.C. Attorney General, told PolitiFact that the ruling allows the plaintiffs to serve document preservation subpoenas on the Trump-owned companies in preparation for moving to the discovery phase of the lawsuit against President Trump. ""Those entities are not parties to this litigation, which means they would not normally be required to preserve documents. However, their records may be relevant to the case, which is why we asked the court for special permission to subpoena them to preserve these documents,"" Marus wrote. Parties to litigation -- in this case Trump in his official capacity -- do not have to be subpoenaed to preserve documents, Marus said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department pointed to a court document filed on behalf of Trump in which the defendant argued that while a motion to dismiss is pending there shouldn’t be any discovery. For the record, a sitting president can be subpoenaed, said Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. ""Richard Nixon had documents subpoenaed, and the Supreme Court upheld this,"" he told PolitiFact.

So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard? Flynn, Trump’s former National Security Adviser, pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 to misleading the FBI about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn also said he’s cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential campaign and Trump campaign contacts with Russians. Did Clinton lie many times to the FBI, as Trump claimed? The head of the FBI at the time — James Comey — told Congress there was ""no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI."" The White House did not provide material to support Trump’s claim. Let's revisit the recent history books. Clinton exclusively used personal email when she was secretary of state between 2009 and 2013, the New York Times revealed, choosing to rely on two email servers in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Clinton repeatedly claimed she did not have any classified emails on her server from time at the State Department, but an FBI investigation found some classified information ended up on her private server, which was an unclassified system. Comey said in July 2016 that there was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime, and he urged the Justice Department not to prosecute Clinton because there was not enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information with her ""extremely careless"" email setup. (We covered the Clinton email scandal and related claims.) Trump referred to her communication with the FBI ""on the Fourth of July weekend"" during the campaign. There is no transcript of the interview that FBI agents had with with Clinton on July 2, 2016, about her email usage in what her campaign described as a ""voluntary interview."" Comey was not present for the discussion. But he spoke for the agency five days later when House members quizzed him about what happened in a hearing. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., explicitly asked Comey if Clinton lied to the FBI in that interview. Comey’s response: ""I have no basis for concluding that she was untruthful with us."" During a line of questioning with then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., Comey reiterated, ""We do not have a basis for concluding she lied to the FBI."" Here’s another exchange with then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in which Comey repeatedly said he was not aware of any FBI case in which Clinton lied. Chaffetz: ""So Hillary Clinton did come to possess documents and materials that contained classified information via e-mail on these unsecured servers is that correct?"" Comey: ""That is correct."" Chaffetz: ""Did Hillary Clinton lie?"" Comey: ""To the FBI? We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI."" Chaffetz: ""Did she lie to the public?"" Comey: ""That's a question I'm not qualified to answer. I can speak about what she said to the FBI."" Chaffetz: ""Did she -- did Hillary Clinton lie under oath?"" Comey: ""Not to the FBI. Not in a case we're working."" The distinction between what Clinton told the FBI and what she told the public is important. Clinton earned a Pants on Fire for claiming that, regarding the presence of classified information in her email, ""Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people."" That was a rosy review of reality. Comey had specifically sidestepped whether she provided accurate information to the public. In particular, Clinton said there wasn’t any classified information in her email in media interviews, and Comey said there was. However, Trump’s charge said Clinton lied to the FBI, and the agency has made no such claim. Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI."" We at PolitiFact don't know exactly what Clinton told FBI investigators. We also know, however, that Trump failed to back up his allegation. Former FBI director Comey in congressional testimony said there was no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI.

"['National', 'Crime', 'Jeff Sessions']","
Violent crime is up some, but still well off historical highs
","In Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ testimony to Congress about Russia in November, he brought up a recent increase in the rate of violent crime and murder in the United States. ""The violent crime rate has risen, and the homicide rate has risen by more than 20 percent in just two years, really after 30 years of decline in violent crime,"" said Sessions on Nov. 14. We wanted to check out his numbers. Sessions got his information from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report for 2016. After doing some math, we found that from 2014 to 2016 violent crime rate increased by 6.8 percent, and the murder rate increased by 20.4 percent. The FBI defines violent crime as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Sessions’ numbers are accurate, but his focus on the more recent years doesn’t show the full picture. On average, for the last 30 years violent crime has been declining. In 1986, the violent crime rate was 620 violent crimes per 100,000 people. In 1991, the rate increased to 758, which was the highest it has been since 1960. 
 ""For 15 to 20 years both the violent and nonviolent crime rates as measured by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report (UCR) have been dropping like a rock.  It is now at the level of the early 1950s.  It is very low,"" said Alan Lizotte, a professor in the School of Criminal Justice at the University at Albany, in email correspondence with PolitiFact.


 The murder rate in 2014 was 4.4 murders per 100,000 people and in 2016 it was 5.3. Because the numbers are relatively small, a change in the rate is reflected as a seemingly larger percentage. ""To be clear, you can have an uptick in crime from 2015 to 2016, and yet the numbers in 2016 are still lower than what they were a decade ago,"" said Kenneth Leon, professor at the George Washington University. ""Sessions has a structural incentive to emphasize law-and-order-related rhetoric and make statements that suggest there is a crime wave,  or that the U.S. is ‘less safe.’ He is selectively curating the data to fit his needs."" Others see the increase as a worrying sign that could be the start of a new trend. Richard Rosenfeld, a professor at the University of Missouri St. Louis, shared a National Institute of Justice study he participated on that examined the recent rise in homicide in the United States. ""If not wholly unprecedented, the recent homicide increase in the United States was relatively large, especially in several of the nation’s big cities,"" said the report. The report expressed concern at the sudden rise and said that it would take five years, if the rates continue to increase at high rates, for the homicide rates to reach the levels of the 1990s. Sessions gave a speech when this data was first released at the end of August and said that the work that law enforcement officers do is about to get harder. ""That’s because we are fighting a multi-front battle: an increase in violent crime, a rise in vicious gangs, an opioid epidemic, threats from terrorism, combined with a culture in which family and discipline seem to be eroding further and a disturbing disrespect for the rule of law,"" said Sessions. The National Institute of Justice study explored the potential causes of the homicide increase but said that because it was such an abrupt increase, it was difficult to definitively say what the cause was. It encouraged further research. Sessions said, ""The violent crime rate has risen, and the homicide rate has risen by more than 20 percent in just two years, really after 30 years of decline in violent crime."" That is accurate, but it needs additional information. The murder rate spoke is driven by a small increase in cases, and still well below historical highs. Experts say the increasing murder rate may be the start of a trend, or could be a random increase before a return to historic lows.

Biss accurate in sarcastic tax hit on opponents Pritzker, Kennedy
","  After Democratic gubernatorial candidates J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only summaries of their income tax returns on Nov. 27, rival Daniel Biss wasted no time blasting them for what they didn’t make public. As Gov. Bruce Rauner has done since first becoming a candidate in 2013, Pritzker and Kennedy released their federal and state 1040 forms, which reveal only basic details of their their tax pictures. The meat of returns, especially for wealthy taxpayers like Pritzker, Kennedy and Rauner, lies in an array of schedules and attachments to those 1040s that illustrate how they made their money, managed their wealth, donated to charity and reduced their tax burdens by leveraging breaks often used by the wealthy. And neither Pritzker, Kennedy nor Rauner have been willing to share such telling information with voters. ""These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns,"" Biss said in one of many tweets he issued on the topic that day. These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns. -DB In April, Biss, a Democratic state senator from Evanston, released five years’ worth of full tax returns, including Form 1040 cover sheets and attachments detailing deductions, supplemental income and credits. They showed Biss and his wife, Karin Steinbrueck, with quite modest income, averaging just under $55,000 per year over the five years covered in the returns. Biss spent more than seven months criticizing his wealthy competitors for foot-dragging before they released their returns.   With nominating petitions now filed for the March 20 Democratic primary and election season in full swing, the Rauner and Romney comparisons likely will become a hammer with which Biss will repeatedly bash his far wealthier opponents. We decided to look into Biss’ Twitter claim both to check its accuracy and to examine the history of candidate tax disclosure. The ""Bruce Rauner standard"" that Biss, currently a state senator, cites refers to the tax disclosures Rauner has made annually since he first became a candidate for governor in 2013. Though Illinois law does not require candidates or officeholders to make public any income tax information, Rauner released three years’ worth of federal and state 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions in November 2013. They showed Rauner and his wife Diana had income of $27.2 million in 2010, $28.2 million in 2011 and $53.4 million in 2012. Their effective tax rates in those years were 16.9 percent, 21.5 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Rauner has continued to release the 1040 forms since then. His 2013 returns, released a month before the 2014 election, showed income of $60.15 million and a 24-percent tax rate. In 2014, the Rauners reported income of $57.5 million and a 26-percent tax rate. Rauner’s income ballooned during his first two years as governor. In 2015, he reported income of $188 million followed by $91 million in 2016, with tax rates of 26 and 25, respectively. But because Rauner has not released the schedules and attachments that detail how his income was derived, the 1040 forms lend little insight where his money comes from and how he manages it. Pritzker essentially matched Rauner’s skimpy disclosure when the Democrat filed his nominating petitions on Nov. 27, but Kennedy did even less. Pritzker released summaries of his last three years of taxes showing adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015 and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014). Kennedy confined his release of 1040 information to 2016 returns only. For that year, he reported adjusted gross income $1,242,805 and an effective tax rate of 14 percent. The financial picture for Kennedy and Pritzker, at least, is further obscured by their decisions to not release detail about trusts they also benefit from but which are kept separate from the information reported on their personal tax returns.    Like Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy derived their income from interest, dividends and capital gains, not from wages. Candidates in Illinois are are also required to file statements of economic interest that detail entities in which they have ownership interests or derive income, and all the Democrats as well as Rauner have complied. But the information value from such reports is quite limited, with disclosures confined to the names of business interests and not the value of individual investments or income they produce. (Click here for current statements of economic interest from Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy.) Biss also accuses his Democratic counterparts of ""falling dismally short"" of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, like Rauner a longtime private equity investor whose wealth had become an issue in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat then-President Barack Obama. Romney released complete income taxes for 2010 and 2011, including hundreds of pages of schedules and explanatory material that allowed a public view into the management of his fortune. They showed Romney paid a relatively low tax rate of 14.7 percent on a total of $42.6 million in income for the two years combined, and that he held considerable assets in offshore tax havens including Luxembourg, Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In an election in which income inequality had become a major issue, this gave Obama’s campaign ammunition to portray the former Massachusetts governor as out of touch with the vast majority of Americans. Romney was following what had become standard procedure for presidents and major presidential candidates of both parties following the scandal plagued administration of Richard Nixon, said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, which tracks presidential tax releases. Obama also routinely released full returns annually both as a presidential contender and president. Obama’s successor, Donald Trump, is the first U.S. president since Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974, to not release any information about personal taxes. A proliferation of wealthy political candidates coming off successful business careers in Illinois and elsewhere likely portends an era of increasing opaqueness when it comes to tax disclosure, Thorndike speculated. ""I don't know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials,"" Thorndike said. ""I suppose that they're better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s."" Governors’ roles in administering state taxes should heighten public pressure to release full returns, Thorndike said. ""These candidates if they win election are going to be in charge of collecting taxes from everyone else and it seems reasonable to me that voters want to know how they conducted themselves and whether they've been living up to their civic duty in the way that everyone else is supposed to,"" he said. Lawrence Noble, senior director the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, said the current push in Washington for a sweeping federal overhaul, only underscores the shortcomings of the sort of limited tax disclosure practiced by Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy. All derive the bulk of their income from investments, and are likely to reap significant financial benefit from the current GOP push in Washington to overhaul the federal tax system that most analysts have concluded is tilted toward tax breaks for the wealthy. How much any of the well-to-do Illinois candidates stand to benefit is impossible to gauge without more information than is disclosed in 1040 forms.   ""Where they have their investments, how much they have and how various pieces of legislation will affect them is important,"" said Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. ""And one of the ways you can tell that is by their taxes and often it's the only way you can tell unless you’re just going to take their word for it."" Biss sarcastically said his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates ""are living up to"" the standard for releasing tax information set by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. He also said they fell short of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Like Rauner, J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only their federal and state 1040 forms, which provide only the most basic information on income and taxes paid. And Romney did release two years’ worth of full returns, including hundreds of pages of detail, when he was running for president in 2012. There is no law in Illinois requiring gubernatorial candidates or governors to release any tax information whatsoever, and Biss is clearly engaging in some campaign hyperbole when he refers to a Rauner standard and a Romney standard. That said, we find the essence of his statements to be True.  ",/factchecks/2017/dec/04/daniel-biss/biss-accurate-sarcastic-tax-hit-opponents-pritzker/
"['Crime', 'Texas', 'Eddie Rodriguez']","
Domestic violence not confirmed as consistent predictor of mass shootings
","An Austin legislator’s imperfect citation of a study led us to gauge whether domestic violence can reasonably be considered a predictor of mass shootings. Answer: No. In a Nov. 9, 2017, email blast to constituents, Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez noted that the shooter at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, leaving 26 people dead, had been convicted years before of beating his then-wife and young stepson. According to news accounts, Devin P. Kelley subsequently served a year in a Navy brig. Rodriguez’s email blast said the Texas shootings led him to suggest steps ""we can take,"" among them: ""Strengthening existing laws and ensuring they’re implemented correctly to keep guns out of the hands of criminals."" Parenthetically, Rodriguez said next that ""perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, according to the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety."" Domestic violence and mass shootings Rodriguez’s linkage made us wonder, in part because Everytown’s research drew wide mention after the Texas shootings. A Nov. 6, 2017, New York Times news story quoted Billy Rosen, the group’s deputy legal director, saying: ""We have seen over and over this pattern where in these notorious mass shootings, it is a very common thread where the person had a particular history of domestic violence. A history of this particular kind of conduct may really demonstrate that someone has dangerous propensities and should not be allowed to have guns."" Time magazine similarly quoted the group’s Sarah Tofte saying: ""You could think of domestic violence as a canary in the coal mine for future violence. We may not know everything we need to know about why and when it reverberates outside the home, but we know that it does, and we’ve seen it over and over again."" However, the relevant April 2017 report from the Everytown group doesn’t offer data linking past domestic violence to the likelihood of anyone becoming a mass shooter. Rather, the report says that ""in 54 percent of mass shootings, the shooters killed intimate partners or other family members."" We asked Rodriguez about this contrast. In reply, he conceded in a letter that his email blast lacked clarity. ""As I read your question,"" Rodriguez wrote, ""I can understand how my language could inadvertently imply that 54% of mass shooters also had a history of domestic violence, as opposed to the analysis' findings that 54% of the incidents were directly related to domestic violence. ""I agree that my language was unclear,"" Rodriguez wrote, ""as ‘perpetrators of domestic violence’ could be read as shooters who had committed domestic violence in the past or, as I meant it, as shooters who perpetrated domestic violence when they ‘shot a current or former intimate or family member.’ While grammatically vague, I had no intention of misrepresenting the group's findings."" The legislator’s claim and clarification made us wonder what data actually show about mass shooters having domestic violence backgrounds. April 2017 report The Everytown report says the group drew on news stories, FBI figures and police and court records (in 76 instances) to identify 156 mass shootings in the study period--including 85 (54.5 percent) in which the perpetrator ""shot a current or former intimate partner or family member."" Mass shootings can be defined in different ways. The Everytown group tallied shootings involving four or more victims, not counting the shooter. In the report’s appendix, which summarizes each identified shooting, we spotted 13, or 8 percent, that occurred after a domestic dispute or in which the shooter had previously been charged with or linked to domestic violence. Around the same time, though, criminologist James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor, found more domestic violence links to the shootings catalogued by the group. Fox said in a USA Today commentary published after Rodriguez sent out his email blast that of Everytown’s 85 listed shootings in which a person shot a family member, 41 percent were preceded by other acts of domestic violence. More broadly, Fox wrote, 25 percent of all the men listed as committing mass shootings showed ""any indication of prior domestic violence."" We asked Fox to share the specifics behind his percentages. By email, he said we’d need to get the spreadsheet directly from the Everytown group. Its spokeswoman, Phoebe Kilgour, had earlier emailed us a sheet lacking entries specifying prior domestic violence charges or convictions. Kilgour, asked for more detail, said the limited information was ""what we're comfortable sharing at this point."" Separately, Lisa Growette Bostaph, a Boise State University criminologist, responded to our inquiry by saying that her review of Everytown’s information delivered domestic-violence counts matching what Fox reported; she also provided her annotated review of what Everytown listed. By email, Bostaph also cautioned against dwelling on whether mass shooters have documented backgrounds of domestic violence, writing: Parsing ""out whether or not a protection order was granted or a criminal charge resulted in a conviction is ignoring everything that we know about domestic violence: that victims are often manipulated and controlled by fear to rescind requests for protection and criminal charges; that victims are often silent about the domestic violence out of fear of involving others who may later be threatened or hurt; fear of angering the perpetrator and risking further violence for ""bringing others into our business""; fear that the perpetrator may lose their job and the victim cannot provide for their children on their own; fear that, by leaving their abuser, they could be risking their abuser having custody or unsupervised visitation with their children who are often witnesses to the violence and/or abused themselves. This means that, if the domestic violence victim is also a victim in the mass shooting, we may never know if there was a history of domestic violence. But, does that really matter, when the end result of that relationship was the ultimate act of domestic and/or family violence?"" A ‘mass killing’ compilation Fox otherwise alerted us to an ongoing USA Today compilation of U.S. mass killings, drawing from FBI figures plus police and news reports. When we examined it in November 2017, it showed 271 mass shootings of four or more victims from 2006 through Nov. 5, 2017. We sorted those figures to find that 129 of the shootings, or 48 percent, involved family killings including 13 of 23 Texas mass shootings. The day that we looked, the latest listed Texas mass shooting involving family had occurred in Houston in April 2017; a single mother shot and killed four people including her mother and sister. That compilation doesn’t filter out shootings involving a shooter with a domestic violence history. But Fox connected us with Emma Fridel, a Northeastern doctoral student who’s conducted more detailed research rooted in USA Today’s compilation. To our inquiry, Fridel summarized her findings in an email stating that from 2006 through 2016, the country experienced 205 solved mass murders exclusively involving firearms. Of those, Fridel said, she found that 41, or 20 percent, involved one or more perpetrators with a history of domestic violence. (See Fridel’s full analysis, published in early November 2017, here.) Fox, summing up, said: ""You could certainly say about half the cases of mass shootings are extreme incidents of domestic violence,"" which in itself persists as ""a serious problem,"" Fox said. ""But it’s not generally a precursor to mass murder,"" he said. Report: Domestic disputes precipitated a fifth of ‘mass public shootings’ Separately, Time's story after the Texas shootings led us to experts including Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, who by email pointed us to a 2015 report on U.S. mass murders by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. According to the CRS report, in the 15 years from 1999 through 2013, the United States saw about 8.5 familicide mass shootings per year on average. From another vantage point, the report says, a domestic dispute of some type was allegedly a precipitating factor in roughly a fifth (21.2%) of ""mass public shootings,"" or at least 14 of 66 such incidents. Four other mass public shooting incidents could also be characterized as familicides, the report says, in that a spouse or former intimate partner murdered four or more family members--in each case in a public space. Time’s article also drew us to interview Susan B. Sorenson, who directs the Evelyn Jacobs Ortner Center on Family Violence at the University of Pennsylvania. By phone, Sorenson endorsed Everytown’s statistic--that 54 percent of its catalogued mass shootings were acts of domestic violence. Sorenson also told us there’s not research cementing a cause-and-effect link between someone committing domestic violence and later shooting and killing four or more people. ""That’s all speculative,"" Sorenson said. ""We just don’t have that information."" From a public health perspective, Sorenson commented, the focus should be on reducing gun violence. She said there are angry men ""who abuse women all over the globe. What makes us different is the guns."" Our ruling Rodriguez wrote that according to an Everytown study, ""perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016."" Rodriguez’s statement incorrectly suggests that domestic violence was a precursor to 54 percent of mass shootings. The research he cited did not confirm as much. Rather, it says 54 percent of such shootings involved a person shooting multiple family members. Other research suggests that about 20 percent of individuals who committed such shootings from 2006 through 2016 had a history of domestic violence. We rate Rodriguez’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Is living as an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. a crime?
","Albany Mayor Kathy M. Sheehan said in a national television interview that it’s not a crime for immigrants to live in the U.S. without documentation. Sheehan, a Democrat, was defending her city’s status as a so-called ""sanctuary city"" to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The city's law enforcement officials do not report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities unless they commit a serious crime. ""Simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime,"" Sheehan said. ""The U.S. Supreme Court has said that."" Carlson was left baffled. ""You just said that being here illegally is not illegal? I’m not aware of that Supreme Court decision,"" Carlson said. ""How is that true?"" Sheehan cited a court ruling. ""In Arizona v. the United States, the Supreme Court said simply being here undocumented is not a crime,"" she said. ""There are civil violations and then there are criminal violations."" So, who’s right? Sheehan or Carlson? What’s Sheehan talking about? The Supreme Court case Sheehan cited involved a 2010 challenge to an Arizona immigration law from the Obama administration. The law required that immigrants carry documents proving their status in Arizona. Police were also instructed to stop and seek documents from anyone they suspected of being undocumented. Those without documents faced a state criminal charge. The Obama administration contended Arizona could not create a state level criminal charge for the violation because it’s already regulated by Congress. The Supreme Court agreed with the Obama administration and struck down that section of the Arizona law, among other parts.  Civil or criminal Experts supported Sheehan’s claim by pointing out how the U.S. legal system works. People who break the law in the U.S. have committed either a criminal or civil violation depending on how the law defines it and how prosecutors choose to proceed. Being in the U.S. without documentation is considered a civil matter, said Nancy Morawetz, professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law. ""Being present in the U.S., that status, is not a crime,"" Morawetz said. That doesn’t mean undocumented immigrants can live in the U.S. without consequence, said Rick Su, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law. Federal authorities can deport them. A criminal violation comes with a punishment, like time in prison. Civil cases come with penalties instead. Deportation is considered a penalty under federal law, not a punishment. ""Congress can decide what they want to make a crime and what they want to make a civil violation,"" Su said. ""What they’ve decided is that immigration violations by themselves are civil violations."" The Supreme Court confirmed that decision in Arizona v. United States. ""What the Supreme Court said in Arizona v. U.S. is that generally being unlawfully present in the U.S. is not a crime, and that’s definitely true,"" Su said. ""What the court did, is say Congress had made these civil violations and Arizona is trying to make them criminal violations."" Why a civil matter? It’s easier to deport undocumented immigrants through civil proceedings, Su said. In deportation proceedings, immigrants face a special immigrant judge. The government does not have to provide a public attorney to immigrants who cannot afford one in these cases. The burden is then entirely on the immigrant to show they are in the country lawfully. They are also not entitled to any kind of due process. There are some immigration laws that can land an immigrant in criminal court. Entering the U.S. illegally is a crime, for example, but staying after a temporary visa has expired is a civil violation. As much as two-thirds of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. entered legally with a visa, according to the Center for Migration Studies. Our ruling Sheehan said ""simply being in this country without documentation is not a crime."" It may be semantics, but Sheehan is right. Living in the U.S. without documentation is a civil violation, not a crime. PolitiFact Florida rated a similar claim Mostly True earlier this year. As its fact check noted, however, those in the U.S. without documentation may have committed a crime by entering the country illegally. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, told PolitiFact Florida that ""it's easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they aren’t eligible to work."" But their illegal presence is not a crime. Sheehan's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/dec/02/kathy-sheehan/being-undocumented-immigrant-us-not-crime/

Prince Harry never said Donald Trump wasn't welcome at his wedding
","With the engagement announcement of Prince Harry and Suits star Meghan Markle, several news sites have speculated whether President Donald Trump will be invited to the royal wedding. Nova magazine published an article on Nov. 27 with a clickbait headline that is not just speculation but a false statement. The headline reads: ""Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: ‘Trump is a serious threat to human rights.’ "" (Later, the headline was changed to read, ""Donald Trump Not Welcome At Prince Harry’s Wedding To American Actress: Trump Is A ‘Serious Threat To Human Rights.’ "" We’re evaluating the original headline.) Harry and Meghan became engaged earlier in November but announced their engagement on Nov. 27. Very few details have been released about the wedding, other than it will take place in Spring 2018. There is no record of Prince Harry uninviting Trump, nor is it likely that he would. The royal family typically tries to shy away from drama. The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement, and neither mention an invite list. The Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011. The other quote in the title, ""Trump is a serious threat to human rights,"" is from reporting done in an Us Weekly article. Us Weekly said a ""close source"" told them that Harry ""is not a fan"" of Trump and thinks he ""is a serious threat to human rights."" But that source was anonymous and we don’t find it credible. The Nova article said that Markle called Trump ""misogynistic"" and joked about moving to Canada (where Suits is filmed) if he were elected.

NC Sen. Tillis says plan won't raise taxes on Americans earning $30K-$70K a year
","North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis says some in the media are twisting the truth about the Senate’s plan to change the tax code. Tillis held a news conference Wednesday morning with fellow Republican Sens. David Perdue of Georgia and Dean Heller of Nevada to tout and explain the Senate’s efforts. There, he said the plan will help most Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year – contrary to what a reporter suggested to him. ""A reporter came up to me and said ‘Senator, how do you respond to the fact that people making $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 are going to be paying more in taxes?’ I said that’s patently untrue on the whole,"" Tillis told the crowd of reporters. He added that there may be outliers, and that he’s willing to address them at a later time. ""You know, if you look at some sort of detailed circumstance, maybe there’s something that we need to work out once we see the implementation of the tax plan,"" he said. Tillis continued, saying he responded to the reporter’s follow-up by saying, ""You need to understand tax policy, and I know that you don’t because you’ve never done it."" A video is posted on Senate Republicans’ Facebook page. How does the Senate plan affect Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year? Does it help them, as Tillis suggests? First, a reminder. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here. We’ll focus on the Senate plan, since that’s what Tillis was referring to. $450 tax cut Tillis may have expressed criticism of the media, but when we asked him to explain the changes the Senate plan promises, his office referred us to a fact-check published by The Washington Post on Nov. 2. The Post awarded ""Four Pinocchios"" – the worst possible rating – to Senate Democrats for claiming that the Senate plan would raise income taxes for those who earn less than $86,000 a year. Tillis’ assistant emailed only a link to the story, and sections of it where Post fact-checkers scolded Democrats. The Post found that the average tax cut for the lowest four quintiles of taxpayers -- that is, the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum, or about 97 million households -- would be $450. However, a report by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee (which was the source of confusion for some critics) found that about 8 million households earning less than $86,100 would receive an average tax increase of $794. The Post found that the Democrats mangled their claim. We wanted to look specifically at whether Tillis's claim is accurate. Tax cuts for most – initially For starters, we should note that the Post’s fact-check relied on a ""framework"" assembled before the bills were finalized, so it’s not an analysis based on the most up-to-date versions of the bills. The Senate plan, like the House plan, breaks annual income into separate income ranges, so it’s hard to pinpoint how the plan would affect someone earning approximately $70,000. But analyses by various groups suggest that most Americans in the group Tillis described – those earning $30,000 to $70,000 a year – would get tax cuts over the next five to eight years. One of the most recent studies of the plan was conducted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress that is comprised of expert economists, attorneys, and accountants who assist the majority and minority parties in both houses of Congress on tax legislation. The report, compiled on Nov. 27, shows that the plan would cut taxes for most taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 starting in 2019. That year, the JCT estimated 60 percent of people earning $30,000-$40,000 a year would get a tax cut. About 71 percent of the $40,000-$50,000 bracket would get a tax decrease and 80 percent of people earning $50,000-$75,000 would get a cut. The nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center arrived at similar estimates. In 2019, taxpayers with income between about $50,000 and $87,000 would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.4 percent of after-tax income. Another group, the Tax Foundation, found that the Senate plan would reduce income tax rates for most single and joint filers earning less than $100,000 a year. For joint filers who earn between $19,050 and $77,400, the rate would fall from 15 percent to 12 percent. ""The bottom 80 percent of taxpayers (those in the bottom four quintiles) would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 1.1 to 1.9 percent,"" the Tax Foundation reported. Changes in 2027 So Tillis has a point that many lower-and moderate-income taxpayers will see tax cuts from the bill – at least at first. What he leaves out is that many of the middle-class tax cuts in the bill are temporary. So by 2027, according to the JCT, most Americans earning between $30,000 and $75,000 would see their taxes change by less than $100 compared to today’s rates. In each of those income ranges, the JCT reports that fewer than 15 percent of households would get a tax cut and more than 20 percent would see their taxes rise. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office yielded a similar prediction: the Senate plan would leave Americans earning $40,000 or less as ""net losers"" by 2021 and most people earning less than $75,000 a year would be worse off by 2027. The Tax Foundation reported a more specific prediction: that ""the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 percent."" The top 1 percent, meanwhile, might still see tax cuts of up to 4.5 percent. ""Because many of the provisions phase-out over five years, there are large differences in incidences between year 1 and year 6,"" said Michael Walden, William Neal Reynolds distinguished professor and extension economist at N.C. State University. ""I have heard some analysts say the phase-out was only done to meet the budget requirements of passing the Senate bill by a simple majority, and that if passed, Congress would likely change the provisions in the future to eliminate the phase-outs,"" Walden said. ""But that is a lot of ‘ifs.’"" Daniel Keylin, an assistant to Tillis, took a different approach. He said it’s safer to assume that Congress will act to keep or reduce the tax rate than it is to assume they’ll let taxes rise. ""It’s hard to imagine Congress electing to effectively raise taxes on the nation 10 years from now, especially once the economic benefits of tax reform become clear,"" Keylin said. Other considerations The Senate plan, unlike the House plan, would scrap the federal tax penalty for Americans who do not sign up for health insurance – a burden that falls disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households. The mandate was introduced in the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Some could save money if the mandate is lifted. But, if too many go without insurance, health insurance costs could rise across the board for those who opt to keep buying coverage. In addition, anyone without insurance would be responsible for their own medical costs, which would eat into any tax savings. The New York Times reported that the Senate plan might increase taxes for roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize their deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes, according to the Times. North Carolina ranks 23rd – or about average – among U.S. states in itemizing tax deductions, says Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato, Wagoner Assistant Professor of Economics at Duke University. ""In N.C., only 29% of filers itemize their deductions,"" Serrato wrote in an email. ""This tells me N.C. taxpayer will be hurt by eliminating the (state and local tax) deduction, but only itemizers, who are usually higher income, and that the cost of the deduction is not especially high for North Carolinians."" Our ruling Tillis scolded a reporter for suggesting that Americans earning less than $70,000 would pay more in income taxes under the Senate’s plan to change the tax code. Initially, most – though not all – Americans in that income range would pay less in taxes. But after a few years, there would be more clear losers than clear winners in tax payments among members of that income group. Tillis is doing some selective presentation of the data.

Will the GOP tax bill cost Donald Trump 'a fortune'? No
","President Donald Trump said he wouldn’t benefit financially from the Republican tax legislation on Capitol Hill. In fact, he said he would get socked by it. ""So right now, America's tax code is a total dysfunctional mess,"" Trump said in a speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Nov. 29, 2017. ""The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests -- including myself, in all fairness. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me."" Trump’s claim sounded dubious. The analyses of the bills we have seen show advantages, not disadvantages, for the wealthy as well as corporations. When we asked the White House for additional details about how the law would hurt Trump, they cited the repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct all or some of their state and local tax burden from their federal taxable income. As a wealthy resident of New York City, Trump would likely face high tax state and local rates. (At the Nov. 30 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited the elimination of deductions as one possible source of a tax increase for the president.) The White House also cited ""anti-abuse"" provisions within the changes being made to the ""pass-through"" tax rates for business income that is taxed within individual tax filings. Trump may indeed get hit by some of the tax bill’s specific provisions. But independent analyses of the bill’s potential impact on his own tax situation agree that, after all is said and done, he should come out far ahead compared to the status quo. It is impossible to pin down the benefits that would flow to Trump's tax situation due to his own refusal to follow the decades-old presidential precedent of releasing his tax returns. (He broke his promise to release them). Any projections depend on a leaked, partial tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may have changed since then. For instance, there's no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump’s finances. Analyses by the New York Times and NBC attempted to understand how Trump's finances would be impacted by the House bill rely on the partial 2005 return. The Times based its calculations on a framework that preceded the official release of both chambers’ bills. The NBC analysis was based on the House version of the bill. (The framework is different than the House bill in its details, but they share many common elements.) The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off, according to the New York Times analysis. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.) The NBC analysis — undertaken by Maury Cartine, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group — found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax. Trump’s myriad ventures could enable him to benefit from several changes. The House version would allow ""pass-through"" business income to be taxed at 25 percent, rather than the current maximum of 39.6 percent. The Senate bill would use a different mechanism for such income that is less advantageous. Trump’s 2005 return showed more than $109 million in income from businesses that would potentially benefit from a tax break on pass-through income. So, at the very least, two independent estimates came up with immediate savings in the low tens of millions of dollars. Even if the actual savings for Trump end up being a small fraction of that amount, that would be more money than most Americans make in a year, and more than some make in a lifetime. Meanwhile, this doesn’t include the potentially massive benefits Trump could see from changes to the estate tax -- albeit savings that would take longer to materialize. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers. The House bill would end the estate tax after 2024. The Senate bill would keep it, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million. The approach that prevails in the final version of the bill is unknown for now. Both the Times and NBC estimated that the House version of the estate tax could save Trump more than $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked specifically at the Senate’s version; that approach would likely provide Trump with some savings, but on a much smaller scale. (It’s worth noting that any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after the death of Trump or his wife Melania, presumably years down the road.) Trump’s possible gains from the bill are hardly unique for the wealthiest Americans. According to analysis of the Senate bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, American households with incomes in excess of $1 million -- a threshold Trump is almost certainly far above -- would see a tax savings of $41,819 in 2019 and $36,259 in 2017. And an analysis by an independent group, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, estimated that for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of earners -- those with incomes of at least $3,439,900 -- 72 percent would see tax cuts and 28 would see a tax increase in 2018. The average tax cut for this group would be $174,620 in 2018. Our ruling Trump said, ""This (tax bill) is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me."" While there is uncertainty about the exact scale of Trump’s potential gains -- both because of the lack of a final version of the bill and because of big gaps in the public knowledge about his personal finances -- either of the GOP bills would almost certainly give Trump a big windfall. Two independent analyses suggest that it could be in the low tens of millions of dollars immediately. His family also could get as much as $1.1 billion over the longer term if the estate tax is fully repealed, as the House bill would do.

Donald Trump wrong that no tax cuts passed since Reagan
","During a speech in St. Charles, Mo., to promote Republican tax legislation in Congress, President Donald Trump tried to offer some historical context. ""You know, for years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan,"" Trump said on Nov. 29. That’s flat wrong. Under three presidents -- Bill Clinton, George W.

Does 70 percent of tax bill's relief go to those making less than $200,000?
","As crunch time in Congress approaches, Republicans are aggressively making the case that their tax bills will allow a broad swath of Americans to benefit. During a recent interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas -- the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee -- said that ""70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000."" When we took a closer look, we found Brady’s statistic to be somewhat misleading. The Joint Committee on Taxation study Brady's office pointed us to an analysis of the House bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan office of Congress charged with analyzing the impacts of tax bills. The committee released breakdowns of how much various income ranges would see their taxes collectively increase or decrease over the next decade. Because one of the divisions between income groups is at $200,000, it’s straightforward to break down what share of the benefits accrue above and below that income level. Brady’s office pointed us to one chart in particular. It shows the breakdown of gains on the income tax side of the proposal. Those below the $200,000 threshold get 69 percent of the benefits, while those above $200,000 get 31 percent. That’s in line with what Brady said -- but the talking point is cherry-picked. First, the ratio of gains above and below $200,000 change over time. By 2025, households below $200,000 get 52 percent, and by 2027, they get 51 percent -- still a majority, but significantly below Brady’s 70 percent figure. The bigger issue concerns what kinds of income are counted in the chart Brady used. As we’ve found in a previous fact-check, the chart Brady used addresses just the personal income tax changes in the bill. However, the bill would not only change personal income taxes; it would also change how other types of taxes are levied, including corporate and estate taxes. ""A big part of the bill is slashing taxes on business income, which disproportionately affects high-income earners, as does eventually repealing estate tax,"" Len Burman, a co-founder of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has told us. These taxes are not factored into the personal-taxes-only data that Brady cited, so the chart he used underplays the positive impact the bill as a whole would have on wealthy households. As it happens, the same Joint Committee on Taxation assessment does analyze all aspects of the bill. We calculated the percentage of the total benefits going to those above and below $200,000 in income and summarized them here: Year Percentage of gains going to incomes under $200,000 Percentage of gains going to incomes over $200,000 2019 58 percent 42 percent 2021 63 percent 37 percent 2025 62 percent 37 percent 2027 50 percent 50 percent For each year, the percentages taken by the under-$200,000 households are lower than Brady’s 70 percent figure. But they are always a majority. An outside analysis Calculations from the Tax Policy Center show an even smaller share of benefits flowing to under-$200,000 households. That’s because the Joint Committee on Taxation does not include the benefits associated with eliminating the estate tax, and because the two groups use slightly different definitions of ""income."" The Tax Policy Center found that households below $200,000 in income would get about 54 percent of the House bill’s benefits. That percentage would shrink to about 31 percent by 2027. Our ruling Brady said that in the House Republican bill, ""70 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than 200,000."" That’s only accurate if you look at the individual income tax portions of the House bill. Once you factor in tax changes related to business income, which tend to benefit wealthier taxpayers, the share earned by those under $200,000 is actually 58 percent in 2019, falling to 50 percent in 2027. And if you factor in the impact of the estate tax, it would be as low as 54 percent initially and 31 percent by 2027.

Pelosi’s problematic claim GOP tax plan ‘sabotages’ health care of 13 million Americans
","Many Democrats in Congress describe the GOP tax plan as a scheme to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In recent weeks, their attacks have been expanded to say it would take away or damage health care for millions of Americans. That particular criticism started after Senate Republicans added a provision to their tax overhaul bill that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate — the requirement that Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed concern over the inclusion of this provision in the tax bill, which needs approval from nearly all Republican senators to pass. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was the latest Democrat to lodge a comparable criticism of the bill. The GOP tax plan ""Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans,"" Pelosi’s political team wrote on Twitter on Nov. 27, 2017 as part of a longer list of criticisms of the bill.  PolitiFact New York and The Washington Post have fact-checked similar statements by Democratic leaders about the bill's impact on health care. They found those claims were partially accurate but ignored key facts. We’ll take a look at those and rate Pelosi’s statement. Similar claims Earlier this month, PolitiFact New York rated Half True the claim by Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Congressional Republicans ""want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for"" a tax bill. It found Cuomo had a point: Ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis. Pelosi’s spokesman pointed to the same CBO report when PolitiFact California asked for evidence backing up the congresswoman’s claim. In its analysis, however, PolitiFact New York pointed out that ending the individual mandate isn’t the same thing as stripping away health insurance for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily. The Washington Post Fact Checker, meanwhile, gave Two Pinocchios — which it describes as its Half True rating — to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer when he said, ""We’re kicking 13 million people off health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy."" The Post described the first part of Schumer’s statement as ""problematic."" ""CBO, in estimating the impact of repealing the individual mandate, is mostly describing a voluntary action of people choosing not to buy health insurance. That’s not the same as ""kicking off"" 13 million people. Granted, some people may feel they don’t have a choice because their premiums increased. Senate Democrats need to more accurately describe the CBO report,"" the Post concluded. Sabotage? Pelosi, through her political team’s tweet, claims the GOP tax plan ""sabotages"" the health care of 13 million Americans. We took this to mean it intentionally strips health care from millions. If healthy people leave the individual market, premiums will go up for the remaining and sicker enrollees. That could force some people to drop their plans due to cost. But, as with the claims from Cuomo and Schumer, the statement from Pelosi and her staff ignores the fact that a large portion of the 13 million people would voluntarily drop their plans and would not see a direct health impact. PolitiFact New York cited research from RAND Corp. that estimated roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be involuntary. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Our ruling Nancy Pelosi recently claimed the GOP tax plan ""Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans."" She has a partial point: Senate Republicans have proposed eliminating the ACA’s requirement that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. By getting rid of this, the CBO estimates 13 million fewer people would have insurance a decade from now. Many would voluntarily leave the individual health care marketplace, driving up premiums for those who remain, forcing some who want to keep their insurance to drop it. But like other top Democrats, Pelosi left out much of the story. ""Sabotaged"" just doesn’t fit for the two-thirds of those researchers say would leave voluntarily. PolitiFact New York and The Washington Post examined similar claims and rated them the equivalent of Half True. They were partially accurate but omitted key information. We agreed with their assessments. We also rate Pelosi’s claim Half True.
