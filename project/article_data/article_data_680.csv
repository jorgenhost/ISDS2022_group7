NC Congressman exaggerates Washington COVID restrictions
","To hear one North Carolina congressman tell it, Democrats are going to great lengths to guard their grilled meats. Republican Rep. Greg Murphy tweeted on Jan. 16: ""The Dems demand a photo ID to get a cheeseburger but not one to vote. The height of hypocrisy."" We can’t fact check whether Democrats are hypocrites. And it’s well known that many Democrats oppose photo ID requirements at the polls. So let’s set those things aside and focus on the most glaring declaration in Murphy’s tweet: Are governments or businesses requesting photo identification from people who want cheeseburgers? It appears Murphy is referring to new COVID-19 restrictions enacted by local officials in Washington, D.C. Murphy’s tweet included a link to a story by The Gateway Pundit, whose founder has been banned from Twitter for peddling misinformation. The founder, Jim Hoft, wrote the story Murphy shared, too. The headline says ""Democrats Now Demanding Proof of ID to Walk the Streets of Nation’s Capital — But NOT to Vote."" PolitiFact has already debunked a rumor spreading on Twitter and TikTok that Washington residents need a photo ID to leave their home or to ""buy milk."" And Murphy’s tweet appears to be influenced by the same misinformation. Murphy’s office didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  The Gateway Pundit story includes a tweet by Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, that reminded residents of new COVID-19 restrictions in the city starting Jan. 15. The tweet says residents older than 18-years-old should remember proof of vaccination and a photo ID when heading out to a restaurant. Residents 12 and over need proof of vaccination, the tweet said, adding that everyone needs a mask. But the Gateway Pundit story and Murphy’s tweet both exaggerate the scope of the new requirements. Murphy’s tweet gives the impression that anyone ordering a cheeseburger will need to show a photo ID. That’s not the case. The vaccine and photo ID requirements only apply to people who want to enter a restaurant and stay a while. People can still order a cheeseburger and have it delivered. People are also allowed to enter briefly to pick up an order to go or grab a burger in a drive-thru. The restrictions don’t apply to grocery stores. So residents could also buy the ingredients they want for a cheeseburger and then grill them at home. Murphy’s tweet also leaves out the fact that the congressman’s workplace isn’t bound by the Washington mayor’s order. Eateries in the Capitol complex are continuing to serve patrons without requiring them to produce proof of vaccination, Roll Call reported last week. In fact, the Rayburn House Office Building is home to a Steak n’ Shake, which sells something called a ""steakburger with cheese.""  Criticizing Democratic opposition to voter ID requirements, Murphy said, ""The Dems demand a photo ID to get a cheeseburger."" Murphy is greatly exaggerating the effects of Washington’s latest COVID-19 rules. Adults in Washington, D.C., do need to show a form of photo ID to dine inside a restaurant or other eatery. But there’s more than one way to get a cheeseburger and we’re not aware of any Democrats or businesses withholding them from people who don’t produce photo identification. People without a photo ID can still go through a drive-thru, have one delivered, place an order to go, or head to the grocery store for beef, buns and condiments.  We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Tweet by U.S. Rep.

","A long statement is being shared on social media that looks critically at COVID-19 vaccines relative to other vaccines.  ""I have never seen a vaccine that forced me to wear a mask and maintain social distance, even when you are fully vaccinated,"" the statement says. ""I have never seen a vaccine like this one, which discriminates, divides and judges society as it is. And as the social fabric tightens… it’s a powerful vaccine!

Justin Trudeau was joking when he suggested he bribed the media
","A Feb. 2 Instagram post claims that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ""pays mainstream media $600 million to report in favor of him.""  The evidence? A clip of Trudeau saying just that.  ""You sometimes hear about liberal bias in the media these days, how they’re constantly letting our government off the hook for no good reason,"" he says in a video in the post. ""Frankly, I think that’s insulting. It’s clear that they let us off the hook for a very good reason.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video comes from the 2019 Parliamentary Press Gallery dinner, an annual event at which attending politicians give speeches with plenty of jokes, much like the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. About 39 minutes into this video of the dinner, posted on YouTube by Global News, Trudeau makes the comment that appears in the post. It was an allusion to a Canadian government program to help struggling news outlets.  But while the post cuts away from the actual speech and shows a still image of Trudeau, footage from the dinner shows unflattering headlines projected behind the prime minister such as ""Justin Trudeau is tampering with Canada’s brand"" and ""Trudeau has lost the moral mandate to govern."" Later that year, a misleadingly edited video like the one that appears in this Facebook post started to appear online.  ""It’s a small tweak that distorts the video’s meaning without sophisticated editing,"" the CBC reported at the time, ""but it’s effective because it plays on very real concerns and criticisms of the government’s so-called media bailout program.""

No, Dr. Phil and these celebrities are not endorsing CBD gummies
","Before you go out and buy CBD gummies that purportedly help to treat diabetes or to quit smoking, please know that these people are not endorsing or selling them: Baptist pastor Charles Stanley, TV evangelists Joel Olsteen and Pat Robertson, former Shark Tank contestants Donna and Rosy Khalife, neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, actor Kevin Costner, and celebrity surgeon and Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz.  We’ve fact-checked claims about all of these people — blog posts that look like news articles that are actually advertisements falsely claiming celebrity endorsements — and yet the cannabidiol misinformation continues to spread online. A Jan. 31 Facebook post suggesting that Dr. Phil McGraw was endorsing CBD gummies to fight dementia has inspired us to set the record straight about posts you might see on social media touting a celebrity-backed CBD gummy product: those posts are scams, including the one about Dr. Phil.  The Jan. 31 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We reached out to the Dr. Phil show and didn’t immediately hear back. However, in February 2021 both he and Dr. Oz appeared on TMZ Live to warn people not to fall for scams using their names to sell CBD and that they don’t endorse CBD products.  Oz told TMZ Live that he tested some of the products sold online that falsely claim to have his endorsement and that a lab testing showed high lead levels.

Claim that U.S. government is spraying ‘toxic brew of chemicals’ from airplanes is a conspiracy
","A conspiracy theory about the cloud-like plumes that trail behind airplanes as they fly has persisted for more than two decades and is still spreading via social media. In a TikTok video shared Jan. 27 on Facebook, a speaker says, ""Since 2000, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy have been spraying the entire United States sky with the toxic brew of chemicals and other biologic agents.""  A text overlay on the TikTok video says, ""Wake up! You may wanna pay attention to this.""  The TikTok video shows footage of Ilya Sandra Perlingieri, speaking in 2010 at a conference at the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover. In the video, Perlingieri also claimed that military and some commercial jets ""have been fitted with huge barrels of at least 49 different kinds of documented chemical poisons"" and are emitting pathogenic mold, fungi and weaponized viruses.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The examples cited in the post are part of a conspiracy theory that claims that the condensation trails behind aircrafts are ""chemtrails."" Some people believe that chemtrails are a ""secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program,"" said a study published in 2016 by the Carnegie Institution for Science, University of California Irvine and the nonprofit organization Near Zero.  But chemtrails are not real, said atmospheric chemists and geochemists surveyed in 2016 by the three organizations. The 2016 study said that ""well-understood physical and chemical processes"" debunk the alleged evidence for chemtrails. The alleged evidence also could be explained by typical airplane contrail formation and poor data sampling, researchers said. Contrail is a shortened term for condensation trails, which are formed by the combination of high humidity and low temperatures ""that often exists at aircraft cruise altitudes,"" according to the Air Force, which has called the chemtrails conspiracy theory ""a hoax."" The Air Force said contrails are composed primarily of water (in the form of ice crystals) and do not pose health risks to humans. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also debunked the chemtrails conspiracy theory. The agency says it is not aware of any deliberate release of chemicals or biological agents into the atmosphere. People who spread the conspiracy theory cite varying alleged purposes for the chemtrails, including weather modification, chemical or biological weapons testing and manipulating stock prices by damaging crops. In the TikTok clip, Perlingieri mentioned weather modification, and that theory also has been embraced by Alex Jones of InfoWars, who is known for spreading misinformation.  A 1996 research paper from Air University called ""Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025"" seems to have inspired the chemtrails hoax. The paper was about the ""hypothetical harnessing of weather for military objectives,"" according to National Geographic U.K.  But that paper did not ""reflect current military policy, practice or capability,"" the Air Force said. ""The Air Force's policy is to observe and forecast the weather.""  In a TikTok video shared on Facebook, a speaker says, ""Since 2000, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy have been spraying the entire United States sky with the toxic brew of chemicals and other biologic agents.""  The claim is part of a conspiracy theory about ""chemtrails,"" which are not real, according to atmospheric chemists and geochemists.  The EPA is not aware of any deliberate release of chemicals or biological agents into the atmosphere, and the Air Force says the theory is a hoax.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!   ","[('Facebook post, Jan. 27, 2022', 'https://archive.is/KZm4E'), ('National Geographic UK, ""Hot topic: should I worry about chemtrails?""

Joe Biden overstates statistics on Affordable Care Act signups
","President Joe Biden recently trumpeted that during the most recent open enrollment period, a record 14.5 million Americans signed up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance law that passed when Biden was vice president. In a Jan. 27 statement, Biden cited changes that were included in the American Rescue Plan, the coronavirus and economic relief legislation that Biden signed several weeks after his inauguration in 2021. The legislation boosted the amount of subsidies for private insurance plans offered on the ACA’s marketplaces, while widening eligibility for receiving those subsidies. The American Rescue Plan, Biden said, ""did more to lower costs and expand access to health care than any action since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. It made quality coverage more affordable than ever, with families saving an average of $2,400 on their annual premiums, and four out of five consumers finding quality coverage for under $10 a month. As a result, millions of our fellow Americans have now gained the security and peace of mind that dependable health insurance brings."" When we looked into the numbers, we found that Biden incorrectly framed that ""four out of five"" figure. He conflated two pieces of data that have been released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a federal agency. One statistic reported by the agency is that ""four out of five consumers can find a plan for $10 or less per month"" due to the changes under the American Rescue Plan. However, that refers to the percentage of potential consumers who would find themselves eligible for a plan costing $10 a month or less if they looked. It doesn’t refer to the percentage who are ""finding"" such coverage, much less deciding to purchase such coverage. The percentage of people actually signing up for coverage who are paying that little per month is much lower. About one-third of consumers who signed up for ACA coverage following implementation of the American Rescue Plan chose a plan costing $10 per month or less, the agency reported. All told, the agency said, more than 1 million consumers selected a Marketplace plan with premiums of $10 or less per month. The White House stood by Biden’s framing, arguing that the notion of ""finding"" coverage covers the availability of insurance, not just its purchase. However, a plain reading of Biden’s wording suggests that while four of five consumers may be eligible for coverage that costs that little, those consumers are not necessarily getting the message. Biden said that due to the American Rescue Plan’s changes to the Affordable Care Act, ""four out of five consumers (are) finding quality coverage for under $10 a month."" Biden has conflated two statistics. Four of five consumers would qualify for coverage costing that little if they looked for it. But only about one-third of actual insurance signups under the Affordable Care Act ended up costing $10 or less per month in premiums.  We rate the statement Mostly False.","[('Joe Biden, ""Statement on 14.5 Million Americans Signing up for Health Insurance,"" Jan. 27, 2022', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/statement-by-president-biden-on-14-5-million-americans-signing-up-for-health-insurance/'), ('Associated Press, ""Biden exaggerates $10 a month ‘Obamacare,\'"" Feb. 1, 2022', 'No link'), ('Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, ""Four in Ten New Consumers Spend $10 or Less Per Month for HealthCare.Gov Coverage Following Implementation of American Rescue Plan Tax Credits,"" June 14, 2021', 'https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-ap-fact-check-7ff503510d664067a872e546c68e7f61'), ('Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, ""HHS Announces Additional Navigator Resources to Support the Extended HealthCare.gov Open Enrollment Period,"" Dec. 16, 2021', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2022/feb/02/joe-biden/joe-biden-overstates-statistics-affordable-care/

Ivermectin study showed ‘antiviral effect,’ which is not the same as being effective against omicron
","Spotify podcaster and vaccination skeptic Joe Rogan was quick to share a headline on Twitter that portrayed the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin as effective against the omicron variant of COVID-19.  What Rogan didn’t share was a prominent correction that followed: The drug was found only to have an ""antiviral"" effect, and did not involve a clinical study of humans.  Rogan shared a tweet from Disclose.tv that said: ""JUST IN - Japan's Kowa in partnership with Kitasato University at Tokyo Medical University says ivermectin is effective against Omicron in phase III trial.""  ""Well, lookie here…"" Rogan wrote in a since-deleted quote-tweet. Rogan had taken the drug when he contracted COVID-19 in September, he said at the time. Disclose.tv was pointing to a Reuters report that said Japanese pharmaceutical company Kowa and Tokyo-based Kitasato University found ivermectin to be effective against omicron in Phase III clinical trials, which are conducted with human participants. Reuters rewrote the story with a correction. But the uncorrected claim had already spread across Twitter, with The Blaze senior editor Daniel Horowitz and Fox News host Laura Ingraham tweeting similar claims. What Kowa actually said was that scientists using non-clinical research found ivermectin to have an ""antiviral effect."" Non-clinical lab results are not the same as clinical studies, and just because something has an antiviral effect does not mean it is effective. Non-clinical studies involve experiments that are typically conducted under lab conditions, like a test tube, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Reuters said its journalists ""misinterpreted the Kowa announcement""  in a comment to Washington Post media critic Eric Wemple. Wemple said he asked why the study’s ""antiviral"" finding was newsworthy even after the correction. ""The antiviral capabilities of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 in a test-tube environment are not a matter of breaking news: Research dating to 2020 showed that ‘a single dose of ivermectin was able to reduce the replication of an Australian isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero/hSLAM cells by 5000-fold,’"" Wemple wrote. Kowa said on Jan. 31 that it is testing ivermectin in Phase III clinical trials. Per the FDA, each phase of a clinical trial involves a larger number of people, and phase III can usually involve up to 3,000. Participants are randomly assigned the drug or a placebo. ""We believe that it is our mission as a pharmaceutical company to contribute to the treatment of new coronavirus infections and protect the health of the people, and we are conducting clinical trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of ivermectin for new coronavirus infections,"" the company said. With multiple studies around the world under way, ivermectin is still not authorized to treat or prevent COVID-19 in the U.S.  ""To date, published clinical trials have shown mixed results,"" Chanapa Tantibanchachai, an FDA spokesperson, wrote in an email to PolitiFact for a Jan. 28 fact-check. Tantibanchachai said that ivermectin can be prescribed by doctors for COVID-19 if they deem it appropriate, though ""the safety and efficacy"" hasn’t been established.  The drug has many advocates who see it as an over-the-counter alternative for preventing or treating COVID-19; they tend to ignore contrary evidence or tout flawed research. Last year, poison control centers received a surge of calls from people who self-medicated with the drug.  The World Health Organization said it should only be used in clinical trials until more data is found.  The updated Reuters story points out that hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug also used to treat lupus, had been touted as a potential treatment for COVID-19 by former President Donald Trump and others after promising lab results. Subsequent studies on humans did not find a benefit.  Claims that new research shows ivermectin is effective for treating COVID-19 were based on a reporting error.

D’oh! ‘The Simpsons’ did not predict Canada’s trucker convoy
","The writers of the long-running animated Fox comedy ""The Simpsons"" have uncannily predicted several things over the years – Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl halftime show, a ""Game of Thrones"" plot twist and Donald Trump’s presidency, to name a few. Now, several videos posted on social media are falsely claiming the show predicted the so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" of truckers in Canada, who are protesting vaccine mandates and other government regulations. A video shared widely on Facebook shows Homer Simpson driving a truck with his son, Bart. He says: ""Look son. It’s one of nature's most beautiful sights…the convoy!"" Their truck is then surrounded by several others. The video then shows Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau crawling out of his office window and down the building while screaming, ""they’re coming in through the back door!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As fact checkers at Snopes and Reuters have previously reported, the video combines two separate clips from ""The Simpsons"" episodes 20 years apart to give the false impression that the show predicted the convoy and Trudeau fleeing his office to escape the protests. It’s not clear if whoever created the video meant it as satire or to intentionally deceive others, but a person who shared the video on Facebook did not make any disclaimers. Caption for the video the Facebook user shared says: ""The Simpsons even predicted the trucker convoy."" There is a similar, widely-viewed version of the video on YouTube that makes clear in its description that it’s pieced together from two episodes.  Here’s where the two video clips came from to create the video we are checking. The first part of the clip, with Homer and Bart in the truck being surrounded by a convoy, is from the season 10, episode 17 episode called ""Maximum Homerdrive"" that first aired in 1999. The clip involving Trudeau was from 2019’s ""D’oh Canada,"" season 30, episode 21, where Trudeau meets with Lisa Simpson over Skype. He is standing on his hands to prove to her that he’s not ""weak,"" after Lisa apologizes for comments Trump made about him. She then tries to ask him about the ""SNC-Lavalin scandal,"" and Trudeau nods to an aide, who then opens the window, and the prime minister, still walking on his hands, crawls out and down the building to escape. The actual episode does not have Trudeau screaming as he flees. In real life, that SNC-Lavalin scandal was about accusations that Trudeau, or someone in his administration, tried to pressure the attorney general in a criminal case against a business. A video shared on social media claims that ""The Simpsons"" predicted the Canadian trucker convoy and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s reaction. That’s not the case. The video pieces together clips from two episodes that aired 20 years apart and adds audio to give a false impression. We rate this claim False.","[('Video posted on Facebook, Jan. 29, 2022', 'https://www.facebook.com/aleah.gash/videos/1076127932934226'), ('Archived screenshot of Facebook post, Jan. 29, 2022', 'No link'), ('Reuters, ""Fact Check-The Simpsons did not predict 2022 Canada Freedom Convoy,"" Jan. 31, 2022', 'https://archive.is/DpU5E'), ('Snopes, ""Did ‘The Simpsons’ Predict 2022 Canada Trucker Protest?""

No, the ‘Freedom Convoy’ in Canada didn’t set a Guinness World Record
","We don’t know exactly how many truckers are participating in the ""Freedom Convoy"" in Canada, a protest against vaccine mandates in the country that has culminated at the capital, but some claims have been so high they defy logic.  Another way that the convoy’s supporters are boasting about the demonstration’s scope: invoking the Guinness World Records, which considers itself ""the global authority on all things record-breaking.""   ""JUST IN,"" one Jan. 30 Facebook post says.

For starters, people attempting to set a record must apply with the organization and then wait to receive guidelines before, say, organizing and executing the world’s longest truck convoy. The organization also requires a number of pieces of evidence to verify the achievement, such as video and photographic evidence, witness statements, cover letters, and statements from stewards who have been tapped to supervise the record attempt.   The longest convoy, or the ""largest parade of trucks,"" in Guinness’ words, was achieved in Egypt in November 2020 by the Tahya Misr Fund, which advocates for needy families and organized a parade of 480 trucks ""amid harsh weather and heavy rain, breaking the Guinness World Records title for the largest parade of trucks,"" according to an entry on the World Records website.

Photo shows a truck convoy in Canada, but not the “Freedom Convoy”

No, most Americans don’t believe the 2020 election was fraudulent
","Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent have been repeatedly disproven through exhaustive audits, recounts, reports and reviews. But is it true that more than 65% of the nation still believes the narrative has merit? No. But a widely shared Facebook claim asserts just as much: ""Over 65% of the country believes that (the) 2020 election was fraudulent. That number was around 35% a year ago,"" the Jan. 30 post claimed in words above a photo. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reviewed 14 surveys that fleshed out polling on Americans’ attitudes about the 2020 election outcome and found none that back up this claim. However, surveys examining public sentiment around the 2020 election showed a clear partisan divide. Democrats typically believed there was no widespread voter fraud and Biden’s win was legitimate, while Republicans overwhelmingly said they doubted the election’s legitimacy. In at least three surveys we found, the percentage of Republicans who said they didn’t trust the election came in around 65%. The number of people overall who believe the election was fraudulent has hovered around 35% since November 2020, but this percentage has not increased significantly as the claim purports. A number of surveys examined public sentiment following the election. Here are a few with findings relevant to the claim: Two Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polls conducted in February and July 2021 found that two-thirds of Republican respondents believe Biden was illegitimately elected in 2020. A January 2021 Morning Consult survey of 1,990 registered voters nationwide showed 65% responded that they believe the 2020 election was ""free and fair."" But when those results were broken down by party affiliation, only one-third of Republicans were in agreement with that statement. When asked what sources helped lead them to believe the election was fraudulent, a majority of Republicans cited former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly claimed without evidence that his loss was not legitimate. A December 2021 poll of 1,000 adults conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov, found that 58% of all respondents believed Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election was legitimate. Only one-third of respondents said it was not legitimate. Of those who view the election as illegitimate, 83% named ""fraudulent ballots supporting Joe Biden"" as the reason for their belief. Another December 2021 poll, this one conducted by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland, asked 1,101 adults: ""Regardless of whom you supported in the 2020 election, do you think Joe Biden’s election as president was legitimate, or was he not legitimately elected?"" Nearly 7 in 10 respondents said Biden was legitimately elected, while 29% said he was not. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted one month after the November 2020 election found similar results. Six in 10 respondents said Biden’s win was legitimate, versus 34% who said it was not legitimate. A majority of respondents in the Quinnipiac poll also said they did not believe there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, whereas 38% said they did believe there was fraud. When Quinnipiac conducted a second poll six months after the election, the number of respondents who believed the election to be legitimate increased to nearly two-thirds. Respondents who said the contest was illegitimate dropped to 29%. Despite Trump’s claims of voter fraud, no evidence of widespread voting malfeasance has been found in the several reviews and audits of the 2020 election conducted by the federal government, state officials, election security experts and news organizations. PolitiFact has also fact-checked more than 80 misleading or false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. A Facebook post said, ""Over 65% of the country believes that (the) 2020 election was fraudulent. That number was around 35% a year ago."" More than a dozen public opinion surveys found that a majority of Americans overall believe the results of the 2020 election were legitimate. However, many of these polls also found that many Republicans continue to hold the view that the results were skewed by voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence.

Are 60% of Virginia students testing below U.S. proficiency standards, as Youngkin says?
","Gov. Glenn Youngkin is vowing to improve student performance in Virginia’s public schools. ""Sixty percent of our children don’t meet national proficiency standards…"" Youngkin, a Republican, said during his maiden address to the General Assembly on Jan 17. He then broke the statistics down by race. We fact-checked this often-made claim by Youngkin and found that his percentage is correct, but he consistently omits the caveat that Virginia students perform better than those from most states. Across the country, 65% of students didn’t meet national proficiency standards in 2019. Youngkin is referring to Virginia's performance on a standardized test called the National Assessment of Educational Progress but is better known as the ""Nation’s Report Card."" It’s taken by a representative sample of fourth and eighth graders in each state.  In 2019, 62% of Virginia fourth graders tested below proficiency in reading and 52% didn’t reach the national standard on math. Among Virginia eighth graders, 67% were below proficiency in reading and 62% in math. The average of those results comes out at 61% below proficiency, slightly higher than Youngkin says. To grasp the meaning of that figure, however, it’s important to understand some terms used in assessing NAEP results.  ""Proficiency"" means a student has ""demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter,"" according to the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees NAEP tests. It means a student can analyze the subject matter and apply it to ""real-world situations."" Proficiency is an aspirational term that ""represents the goal for what all students should know,"" the board says. That sets a higher standard for proficiency than the definition many states - including Virginia - use to assess performance on their own standardized tests. States largely use the term to define a baseline of knowledge for students in different grades. ""This variation in terminology is often a source of confusion when it comes to understanding the NAEP achievement levels,"" the national board says. Virginia’s exams are called Standards of Learning tests, or SOLs, and are taken in third grade through 12th grade. Proficiency on the exams is defined as ""the minimum level of acceptable proficiency on the grade level or the course level,"" according to Charles Pyle, director of media relations at the Virginia Department of Education.  In Virginia, 83% of fourth graders were deemed proficient on the state standardized test for reading in 2019, and 75% reached the level in math. But on the national tests that year, only 48% of the Virginia fourth graders were proficient in math and 38% in reading. Among Virginia’s eighth graders in 2019, 77% were proficient on state math tests and 76% on the reading exam. On the national tests that year, 38% were proficient in math and 33% in reading. Youngkin wants to raise Virginia’s standards for proficiency - set by the state Board of Education - to aspirational levels. He says Virginia’s standards are the ""lowest in the nation.""  As we’ve noted in other fact checks, Virginia in 2019 had the lowest baselines for proficiency on its standardized tests in fourth grade reading and math and eighth grade reading, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics.   The NCES stresses, however, that the rigor of state standardized tests does not provide a comparison of how well students in each state are learning. On the NAEP test, which does compare states, Virginia ranked near the top in fourth grade math and reading and eighth grade math. Virginia ranked 30th on eighth grade reading. Youngkin says, ""Sixty percent of our children don’t meet national proficiency standards…"".   He accurately cites Virginia’s overall performance on standardized national tests for fourth and eighth graders in 2019. But in using this figure to criticize Virginia’s public schools, he omits key information: Virginia is doing better than most states. Nationally, 65% of students fall short of the proficiency level. Proficiency is an aspirational standard on the national test. It’s defined as the ""goal for what most students should know"" at their grade level. That’s different from the minimum amount of knowledge they need to keep up in class. Because Youngkin’s statement needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.  ","[('Glenn Youngkin, Address to the Joint Assembly, Jan. 17, 2022', 'https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/january/name-919739-en.html'), ('The Nation’s Report Card, Virginia Overview, 2019', 'No link'), ('National Center for Education Statistics, ""Scale Scores and NAEP Achievement Levels,"" last updated Dec. 9, 2021', 'https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile/overview/VA?cti=PgTab_OT&chort=1&sub=MAT&sj=VA&fs=Grade&st=MN&year=2019R3&sg=Gender%3A+Male+vs.+Female&sgv=Difference&ts=Single+Year&sfj=NP'), ('NCES, Achievement Levels, last updated May 10, 2021', 'No link'), ('National Assessment Governing Board, ""What are NAEP Achievement Levels and How Are they Determined?"" accessed Jan. 27, 2022', 'https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/guides/scores_achv.aspx'), ('Interview with Charles Pyle, Director of media relations at the Virginia Department of Education, Jan. 28, 2022', 'No link'), ('Virginia Department of Education, SOL Test Results, 2018-19', 'https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/tdw/analysis/describing_achiev.aspx'), ('PolitiFact Texas, ""O’Rourke’s claim about Texas fourth-graders’ reading proficiency supported by sample federal data,"" Jan. 28, 2022', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Virginia, ""Are Virginia\'s school standards the lowest in the nation, as Youngkin says?""

Former R.I. gubernatorial candidate John Robitaille says unemployment dropped in every state that elected a Republican governor in 2010
","
In his 1906 autobiography Mark Twain wrote ""figures often beguile me"" in describing their persuasive ability to mislead.

John Robitaille, a 2010 Republican candidate for governor in Rhode Island, cited a beguiling statistic when he Tweeted:  ""Unemployment rate dropped in every state that elected a Republican gov. in 2010""

That sure sounded authoritative. We wondered whether it was true and, if so, was there more to the story.

Robitaille told PolitiFact his claim came from an item he saw on the website of the late Andrew Breitbart, a conservative blogger and commentator.

Indeed the Breitbart blog, quoting an analysis done by Examiner.com -- a Denver-based media company that operates a network of local news websites -- says that in 2010, 17 states that had elected Republican governors had seen a drop in their unemployment rate since January 2011.

The website nods to the fact that the unemployment rate also dropped in seven out of eight other states that elected Democratic governors.

In fact, we also found that the unemployment rate has fallen in every state but one (New York) in the last year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

So, in other words, despite the implication in Robitaille’s shorthand claim, there’s no apparent  link between the party affiliation of the governor and a decline in the unemployment rate.

But it’s worth scrutinizing the assumption that any new governor would have an immediate effect  on a state’s unemployment rate.

In rating claims like these in the past, PolitiFact has interviewed experts who say it's a stretch to blame -- or praise -- a governor for the complex things that happen in a state economy.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job.""

""A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder,"" said Burtless. ""The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began.""

(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Despite this, let’s play devil’s advocate and assume a causal relationship exists between new governors and the unemployment rate.

There were 37 gubernatorial races in 2010. In 11 races, the incumbent won and in Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee,  an independent, won.

Robert Elliott, the author of the Examiner study, said in an email that he focused on the remaining 25 races because he wanted to compare ""new Republican governors vs. new Democratic governors.""

Overall, he found that in the 17 states that elected Republican governors, the average drop in the unemployment rate was 1.35 percent, compared to an average drop of 0.95 in the eight states that elected Democratic governors.

But comparing the newly elected governors from both parties doesn’t make much sense, since some replaced governors of the opposite party and some replaced governors of the same party.

Let’s look at just those governors who replaced someone from the opposite party -- cases in which their opportunity to make policy changes would arguably have been most stark.

Each of the five Democrats who replaced Republicans actually had a record as good or better than their predecessor over an equivalent period of time.

In two cases -- California and Connecticut -- unemployment went up under the Republican predecessor and fell under the Democratic successor. The average decline under the Republican predecessors was 0.3 percentage points, compared to 1.16 percentage points for the Democratic successors -- a decline four times as fast as under the Democrats.

Meanwhile, it’s true that in 9 of the 11 cases in which a Republican replaced a Democratic governor, the unemployment-rate decline was steeper under the Republican successor. But the overall differences were modest. The average decrease under the Republican successors was 1.19 percentage points, compared to 0.95 percentage points under the Democratic predecessors.

Let’s now look at the six cases in which Republican governors succeeded Republicans in 2010.

The predecessor Republicans saw average unemployment decreases of 0.71 percent, a rate that was exceeded by the successor Republicans, who saw unemployment drop by 1.6 percentage points.

So Republicans who succeeded Republicans did significantly better than Republicans who succeeded Democrats -- not what you’d expect if the Republicans had some magic formula for success.

Meanwhile, the Republican predecessors were less successful than the Democratic predecessors in reducing unemployment, a theme that runs counter to the Examiner study.

Our ruling

John Robitaille’s Tweet that the unemployment rate had dropped in every state that elected a Republican governor is true as far as it goes.

But it is also true that the unemployment rate dropped in seven of the eight states that elected Democratic governors in 2010.

The fact that the unemployment rate dropped less than one-half of a percentage point more, on average,  in those states that elected Republican governors hardly seems to support the Examiner headline of: ""New Republican governors rapidly bringing down unemployment in their states."" Particularly when experts question whether new governors can have any direct impact on an unemployment rate.

Considering the unemployment rate has fallen in 49 states in the last year, that’s stretching the statistic pretty thin.

We find Robitaille’s claim ""is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context,"" our definition of Half True.

MoveOn says Gov. Rick Scott “tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls""
","
The liberal group MoveOn.org warned its supporters in a blistering email that Florida Gov. Rick Scott is engaged in voter suppression.

The subject line: ""Secret GOP plan revealed.""

""Republican Governor Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls in his state and is now suing the Department of Justice after they stepped in to stop him,"" the June 27 fundraising email said. ""Rick Scott's racist voter purge -- which directly targets Latino voters -- is so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the state -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- has so far refused to carry it out.""

MoveOn also has run TV ads in Florida (watch them here and here) about the state-led effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls.

Some of the email’s claims struck us as a bit off, so we decided to investigate.

Here, we’ll fact-check whether Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls. In a related fact-check, we will explore whether every election supervisor has ""refused"" to carry out this project.

The origins of the list

Scott’s quest to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls began shortly after the governor took office in 2011. He asked the state’s chief elections official at the time, Kurt Browning, to look into whether noncitizens were illegally voting.

Two departments, the Florida Department of State and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, compiled a list comparing voter registration information with driver's license data.

It’s possible for a noncitizen to get a driver's license, but it’s illegal for a noncitizen to vote. So the agencies looked for noncitizen drivers to see if they had also registered to vote.

There’s a catch there, though: The driver's license data is not updated when people become citizens, at least not until they need to renew their licenses.

The state found 180,000 names that they considered potential noncitizens. But the state government itself does not have the power to remove people from the voting rolls -- that power lies with the local supervisors of elections.

It’s important to note here that the state did not send all 180,000 names to the local supervisors. Instead, the state identified a much smaller subset of potential noncitizens and sent those names to the local supervisors in April.

The first batch of about 1,200 names included people who get annual drivers' licenses because they are on work or student visas.

Another 1,400 were the first ones that the state verified that names on the driver's license list and the voter registration list matched, said Chris Cate, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Elections.

So that came to 2,600 names that the state sent to the local supervisors, not 180,000 names.

The state gave supervisors a sample letter to send to the registered voters asking for proof of citizenship. If the voters failed to comply, state law indicated they would be removed from the voter rolls within one or two months. The largest contingent came from Miami-Dade County, which has a high foreign-born population.

Democrats questioned the motives and timing of a Republican governor months before a presidential election. Republican leaders pointed out that it’s a felony for noncitizens to vote. A Miami Herald analysis determined that there were more Democrats than Republicans on the list and that about 58 percent were Hispanic.

The feds step in

And then the dueling lawsuits began.

The U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to the state ordering it to halt its noncitizen purge on May 31.

On June 11, the state Division of Elections filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, seeking access to the SAVE database, which contains information on noncitizens. The state had been trying to access that database for about a year. (MoveOn wrote that the state sued DOJ, but the state actually sued DHS.)

The next day, June 12, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against Florida.

On June 27, a U.S. District Court Judge denied the DOJ’s request for a restraining order. But that wasn’t really a game-changer, because the state hadn’t sent additional names to counties after April. By late June, many counties had either finished or halted the process. (See our related factcheck here.)

Before and after the feds got involved, state officials left open the possibility that they might send additional names from the list of 180,000 to the counties.

""When we are able to improve the information we have from the driver’s license database by accessing SAVE, we will begin sending additional names to supervisors,"" Cate told PolitiFact in an email.

We asked MoveOn specifically about the 180,000 number being overblown.

MoveOn spokesman Nick Berning said that the 180,000 are ""at risk"" of being thrown off the rolls.

""Florida’s State Department of Elections has disclosed that it has a list of 180,000 people that was assembled in connection with the purge, which is why the U.S. Justice Department has written that the purge ‘may ultimately target more than 180,000 voters.’ … To clarify, our intention was to identify for our members the large number of voters that are at risk of being purged off the rolls, and we will endeavor to use language that more accurately explains this as we continue our campaign to protect voters from this discriminatory purge.""

Our ruling

MoveOn.org said, ""Republican Governor Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls in his state....""

The 180,000 was the state’s starting point for gathering data on potential noncitizens. But the state forwarded less than 2 percent of that list -- about 2,600 -- to the counties for further review.

Also, state officials were careful to say that the list was ""potential"" noncitizens and asked counties to contact those registered voters for proof of citizenship. That means the county officials had the power to decide whether anyone should be kicked off the list.

MoveOn wildly exaggerated the number of voters that Scott tried to ""kick off"" -- it wasn’t close to 180,000. It was 2,600. If the state had forwarded the full list of 180,000 names, or even close to that number, MoveOn would have been on more solid ground.

We rate this claim False.","[('\nMoveOn.org email, ""Secret GOP plans revealed,"" June 27, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, ""U.S. Rep.

MoveOn says Florida election supervisors refuse to participate in noncitizen voter purge
","
MoveOn.org has been hitting the TV with ads in English and Spanish and emailing supporters to bash the state’s effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls.

""Republican Governor Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls in his state and is now suing the Department of Justice after they stepped in to stop him,"" MoveOn wrote in a June 27 email. ""Rick Scott's racist voter purge—which directly targets Latino voters—is so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the state—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—has so far refused to carry it out.""

In this fact-check we will explore whether all Florida supervisors of elections refused to carry out the noncitizen voter purge. In a related fact-check, we’ll look at whether Scott ""tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls"" and include more background on the history of the purge.

The origins of the list

Scott’s quest to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls began shortly after the governor took office in 2011. He asked the state’s chief elections official at the time, Kurt Browning, to look into whether noncitizens were illegally voting.

Two departments, the Florida Department of State and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, compiled a list comparing voter registration information with drivers’ license data.

It’s important to note here that the state did not send all 180,000 names to the local supervisors. Instead, the state identified a much smaller subset of 2,600 potential noncitizens and sent those names to the local supervisors in April. So Scott was not trying to remove 180,000 names, and we rated that claim False. (Read the full fact-check.)

The state gave supervisors a sample letter to send to the registered voters asking for proof of citizenship. If the voters failed to comply, state law indicated they would be removed from the voter rolls within one or two months. The largest contingent came from Miami-Dade County, which has a high foreign-born population.

Democrats questioned the motives and timing of a Republican governor months before a presidential election. Republican leaders pointed out that it’s a felony for noncitizens to vote. A Miami Herald analysis determined that there were more Democrats than Republicans on the list and that about 58 percent were Hispanic.

Flaws found in the counties

It didn’t take long for supervisors to find flaws on the list and air grievances at their statewide annual conference in mid May.

""It just doesn't seem to be consistent with the thing we always preach, which is uniformity. I'm feeling really uncomfortable about this,"" Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes told state officials, according to the Palm Beach Post.

When the supervisors and journalists started looking into the list, they found some people who were clearly eligible to vote. A few examples: Manoly Castro-Williamson was one of 13 potential noncitizen voters on the list for Pasco County. She was born in Ohio, is a registered Republican and has voted in every election in Florida since 2004. In Broward County, Democrat and Brooklyn-born Bill Internicola (who fought in World War II) was shocked to find himself on the list.

The U.S. Department of Justice ordered the state to halt its noncitizen purge on May 31. The next day, the attorney for the statewide supervisors’ association recommended that counties halt the project.

Statewide, more than 100 ineligible voters were removed before the purge came to a halt, according to the Secretary of State Ken Detzner.

""Initially almost all of us (county election supervisors) started out complying with that request,"" said Vicki Davis, president of the statewide association of election supervisors and the supervisor in Martin County. But nearly all counties stopped in June amid concerns raised by the DOJ, the association’s own attorney and supervisors’ concerns about flaws in the list.

We checked in with several counties to see if they refused to comply with the state’s direction after receiving the list of names in early April. We found that Davis’ summary was accurate: Of the counties we contacted, most sent letters to voters on the list and removed those who confirmed they were not citizens.

But most of the counties we contacted didn’t remove the individuals who never replied and halted the process in June amid concerns about the legal fights and accuracy of the list.

Here are the specific responses of the counties we contacted. We have included the party affiliation of the supervisors although some are elected to a nonpartisan position.

Miami-Dade: Of the 1,637 names, 554 provided proof of citizenship and an additional 30 said they would send that proof as soon as possible. Supervisor Penelope Townsley, who is registered as no-party affiliation, decided on May 31 not to remove any voters other than those 14 who admitted they were ineligible.

Townsley told state officials in a letter that the list for Miami-Dade had an error rate between 31 and 33 percent based on their research and ""may be potentially higher.""

Broward: The county received a list of 259 names. Seven responded that they were citizens, and six were removed after reporting that they were not citizens. Supervisor Brenda Snipes, a Democrat, did not remove the remainder who didn’t respond. Snipes halted the purge in early June after the advice from the association attorney.

Palm Beach: Palm Beach received 115 names from the state but never sent the voters letters or removed any, because Supervisor Susan Bucher said that the drivers license information was outdated. (Bucher is a Democrat but her position is nonpartisan.)

Pinellas: The county received 36 names from the state. It stopped processing the names on June 1 and reactivated 15 who had been canceled from the voter file after not responding. One man was removed from the voter roll because he confirmed he is not a U.S. citizen. Supervisor Deborah Clark, a Republican, announced that she was halting the process June 1 due to concerns about the reliability of the data.

Hillsborough: The county received a list of 72 names. Six individuals provided documents verifying their U.S. citizenship. The office contacted one person by telephone who had voted about 42 times, and he said that he was a naturalized citizen. Around May 18, supervisor Earl Lennard, a Republican, decided to stop any action unless his office received reliable information, according to the supervisor’s chief of staff. The county removed one voter who verified that he was not a U.S. citizen.

Pasco: Pasco County sent letters to 13 individuals -- two provided birth certificate copies and two asked to be removed. The county didn’t hear from the remainder. The county forwarded one name on the list -- a Canadian who never voted -- to the state attorney for review.

The remaining nine were not removed because Supervisor Brian Corley, a Republican, told PolitiFact that he lacked ""clear and credible evidence to proceed with removal."" However, these voters have been flagged, and if they show up to vote, a member of Pasco’s supervisor of elections management team will speak with the voter and advise them that if they are not citizens, it is a felony to vote.

""We complied with the law -- there was not a preponderance of the evidence,"" Corley told PolitiFact in a telephone interview. ""If I could get credible information, I would move forward tomorrow.""

Collier and Lee: These two Southwest Florida counties accounted for about 1.5 percent of the 2,600-name list, but they are noteworthy because they continued the process of removing names after the DOJ got involved. Both counties had done a separate search for noncitizens, prompted by a TV report earlier in the year that compared voter rolls with prospective jurors excused from jury duty because they were not citizens.

Lee removed 11 who didn’t respond. Collier removed seven who indicated in writing or on the phone that they were not citizens, plus two who indicated on their registration application that they were not citizens. Collier also removed nine who signed for their letter and didn’t respond and eight who still didn’t respond after a published notice. One person who provided proof of citizenship remained on the rolls.

Lee County Supervisor Sharon Harrington is a Republican, but the position is nonpartisan. Collier County Supervisor Jennifer Edwards is a Republican.

We contacted MoveOn and told them the results of our investigation.

MoveOn spokesman Nick Berning told PolitiFact in an email: ""Though election officials may have originally complied with the order, the language in our e-mail was intended to convey to our members the important point that none of the 67 officials are willing to carry out the purge.""

Our ruling

MoveOn.org wrote that ""Rick Scott's racist voter purge—which directly targets Latino voters—is so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the state—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—has so far refused to carry it out.""

Actually, many supervisors began to carry out the state directive to verify the citizenship of some voters, starting in April and continuing for several weeks. We only found one county -- Palm Beach -- that never contacted voters on the list at all. (We contacted about eight counties and the statewide association.)

Ultimately, the Justice Department and supervisors themselves raised concerns about the list. It was at this point that many supervisors halted the purge. 
We also found at least two counties that did, in fact, carry out Scott's plan.

Democrats say Mitt Romney failed to disclose offshore company in Bermuda
","
In the Democratic playbook, the more attention paid to Mitt Romney’s wealth, the better. Over the past few days, many Democrats questioned whether Romney used offshore holdings to dodge U.S. taxes and pressed him to release more of his personal financial information. Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs took the occasion during CNN’s State of the Union to say, ""Nobody knows why he has a corporation in Bermuda, why he failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures.""

We wondered if Gibbs had his facts right. Does Romney currently have a stake in a Bermuda corporation? And did he fail to disclose it seven times?

Reporting by the Associated Press and Vanity Fair teed this up. Both news organizations explored one of Romney’s overseas accounts, Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The firm is described in SEC filings as ""a Bermuda corporation wholly owned by W. Mitt Romney."" (For more details, check out the AP's interesting account.)

In his 2010 tax return and his 2011 estimated filing, Romney includes Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The beginning balance is pegged at $10,432. He and his wife Ann are the sole owners.  According to the Associated Press, Romney ran his investments in other Bain Capital deals through this offshore corporation.  

Democrats have pounced on the issue. Offshore holdings might be perfectly legal, but they also might paint Romney as one of the super-rich who may be using an offshore tax shelter.

Romney’s ownership of Sankaty is not in doubt, at least not as recently as this past December, according to Romney’s 2011 estimated tax return. So Gibbs appears to be on solid ground that Romney has the company now. We asked the Romney campaign if they could give us more current information on the status of Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, but they did not respond.

In an interview with Radio Iowa on Monday, Romney deflected the issue, saying his foreign investments are in a blind trust.

""I don’t manage them. I don’t even know where they are,"" Romney said. ""That trustee follows all U.S. laws. All the taxes are paid, as appropriate. All of them have been reported to the government. There’s nothing hidden there.""

As for Gibbs’ other assertion that Romney has failed to disclose his stake in Sankaty seven times, that also is largely accurate. We counted six disclosure forms where Romney made no reference at all to the Bermuda corporation. Those include his filings in Massachusetts when he was running for governor or holding office and his federal disclosures for his presidential bids.

The seventh appears to be his 2001 disclosure, which lists Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors LLC. Note the slight difference in those three letters -- LLC instead of Ltd. The LLC, a limited liability corporation he named on the form, is based in Delaware. The offshore corporation by the same name ends in Ltd. and there is no mention of it until Romney’s lawyers began amending his disclosures this year.

There is some question whether he was required to disclose this asset. In 2003, on the eve of running for governor, he put Sankaty into a blind trust. Thereafter, he disclosed the presence of the trust and might not have been required to say what was in it. It is also unclear whether the nominal value of Sankaty would be high enough to warrant disclosure.

In 2011, its value was $10,432. However, as the Associated Press pointed out, that could well ignore the potential income that might flow through the fund. It is possible for investments made many years ago to produce over $1 million in payoffs that suddenly appear on the books.

Our ruling

Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said Romney owns a Bermuda-based corporation and that he failed to disclose his ownership seven times.

The documentary evidence indicates Gibbs is right that Romney owned it when he filed his estimated tax return in December and that he did not disclose it earlier. The Romney campaign has not said the statements are wrong.

We rate Gibbs claim True.

Americans for Prosperity says Jon Tester ranked first in lobbyist donations in the Senate
","
A new TV ad shows big Montana skies and a succession of people saying Democratic Sen. Jon Tester isn’t representing the people the way he used to.

The ad is from Americans for Prosperity, a pro-free-market group. It released the ad in June.

Tester is in a tight race against GOP Rep. Dennis Rehberg -- Tester’s first reelection bid since winning his initial six-year term in 2006.

The ad’s narration says, in part, ""In the past, (Tester has) made a lot of promises, but when he got to D.C., that all changed."" Among the examples provided by the ad is that ""he’s the largest recipient of lobbyist money."" The ad urges voters to ""tell"" Tester to ""stop supporting President Barack Obama’s interests and start supporting Montana’s.""

The mention of lobbyist donations caught our attention, since Tester -- a first-term senator with low seniority, no chairmanship and no position in his party’s leadership -- wouldn’t seem to be the most obvious candidate to lead his chamber in lobbyist donations.

We checked with Americans for Prosperity, which pointed us to a chart from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for campaign finance information.

The chart, labeled ""Lobbyists: Top Recipients,"" shows Tester leading the pack with $348,031.

This seemed pretty persuasive, until we spot-checked some of the most influential Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to see whether Tester really outraised them. It turns out he didn’t.

For instance, CRP lists Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as receiving $1,125,051 from lobbyists. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took in $625,190 from lobbyists. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., received $579,963. Tester’s fellow Montana senator -- Max Baucus, who chairs the influential Finance Committee -- received $513,169. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., received $379,730.

To clarify matters, we checked with the Center for Responsive Politics. It turns out that the top-20 list that Tester headed only includes donations by registered lobbyists made to candidates’ campaign committees during the 2011-2012 period -- the period in which Tester, and everyone else on that list, is up for reelection.

Since donors typically give to campaign committees most heavily during the two-year cycle when a candidate is actually up for reelection, Tester was, in effect, only No. 1 in the chamber when compared to candidates currently running for reelection -- not against the entire Senate. None of the five senators we listed above who have higher totals are up for reelection this year. Consequently, none of them has made it onto the top-20 list for 2011-2012.

If you equalize the playing field by looking at a full six-year senatorial term, Tester is no longer No. 1 in lobbyist donations, though because of how the Senate staggers the reelection years of its six-year terms, there’s not a complete ranking of all 100 senators. (In a CRP's all-inclusive list of senators who have served since 1989, Tester barely cracks the top 50 in lobbyist donations. The upper levels of this list include many one-time senators who have been out of office for years, such as Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.)

Still, it’s somewhat misleading for the ad to say, without further qualification, that Tester is ""the largest recipient of lobbyist money"" among senators.

Our ruling

Americans for Prosperity claimed that Tester is ""the largest recipient of lobbyist money"" in the Senate, and it provided as backup a chart from a credible, independent organization showing Tester topping the list.

Price: 16,000 IRS agents will enforce Obama health care law
","
Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has let President Barack Obama’s signature health care law stand, Republicans are grousing like it’s 2009.

The law’s foes are dusting off 3-year-old talking points they used in their unsuccessful attempt to squelch it in Congress. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, recently revived this retro claim about Internal Revenue Service agents as he emphasized the court’s finding that the bill is constitutional under the federal government’s taxing powers:

""This is indeed a tax. We talked about it at the time with the 16,000 IRS -- new IRS agents -- that will be empowered to enforce this new tax,"" Price said during a C-SPAN call-in show June 29.  

Sixteen thousand new IRS agents? That claim sounded awfully familiar to us here at PolitiFact Georgia.

As presidential hopefuls, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann used versions of this claim, as have other politicians, including Georgia’s own U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss.  

Even the most accurate versions of this talking point earned mediocre ratings on the Truth-O-Meter. They ranged from Pants on Fire to Half True.

Did this claim improve with age like a fine wine? We contacted Price’s office, dug through past PolitiFact research and looked at a recent IRS budget request.

The main reason that past claims earned low Truth-O-Meter ratings is that the number comes from a partisan estimate based on squishy assumptions.

This is how the IRS talking point came to be:

On Dec. 19, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill that became the basis for the health care law.  

The CBO wrote that it had not completed cost estimates for the IRS and other federal agencies responsible for implementing the law. But it did say the IRS ""would probably"" need to spend ""between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years.""

The CBO suggested nothing about how those costs would translate to jobs, PolitiFact National found.  

Republicans with the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation, used the high end of the IRS’ rough budget number to estimate 16,500 employees might be hired to implement the bill.
   
PolitiFact ruled that Republicans cherry-picked the high number to favor their case. Also, even Ways and Means Republicans acknowledged that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Their calculations do not take into account the possibility that some of the money would buy things such as desks and office supplies for new workers.
     
In other words, it’s fair to assume the IRS will need to hire new employees. It may need thousands of them. But using such a specific figure suggests a degree of certainty that does not exist.

Furthermore, Ways and Means Republicans did not find that the IRS would have to hire 16,000 or more new ""agents,"" as Price and other Obama health care bill foes have said. That number was for ""employees,"" a broader category that can include other workers such as administrative assistants, phone operators and staff attorneys.

Now the IRS is hiring staff to implement these changes. Price spokesman Ryan Murphy told PolitiFact Georgia that current hiring numbers suggest that the 16,000 estimate is reasonable.

We took a look at the IRS budget requests to check out this assertion.

For the current fiscal year, the IRS requested funding for more than 1,250 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes, according to its budget proposal. Most would fill support roles in areas such as information technology or customer service. Fewer than one-quarter would be agents.

For next fiscal year, the IRS requested funding for nearly 860 employees. Fewer than 10 percent would be agents.

This places the agent tally for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 near 375.

How do we rule?

Price said that 16,000 new ""agents"" would be empowered to enforce the health care law. His claim carries a kernel of truth. The IRS will have to hire agents to implement these changes.

But his statement misstated the findings of a partisan estimate. Ways and Means Republicans said that about 16,000 ""employees,"" not ""agents,"" may be hired to enforce the bill’s provisions. They also acknowledged that the actual number of hires may be lower.

IRS budget requests for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years show they asked for about 375 more agents so far --  far less than 16,000.

And like other pols who have used versions of this talking point, Price used such a specific figure that he suggests a degree of certainty that doesn’t exist.

Price therefore earns a Mostly False.","[('\nC-SPAN, Washington Journal, ""Representative Price on the Supreme Court Health Decision,"" June 29, 2012', 'http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Priceon'), ('\n\nInternal Revenue Service, FY 2013 Budget Request, Feb. 13, 2012\n\nFactCheck.org, ""IRS Expansion,"" Feb. 22, 2011\n\nPolitiFact National, ""Kirk says health care bill will lead IRS to hire more than 16,000 new employees,"" March 29, 2010', 'No link'), ('\n\nPolitiFact Georgia, ""U.S. Sen.

David Dewhurst says he ""never"" supported a Texas payroll tax
","
Questioning his opponent for the state's Republican U.S. Senate nomination, attorney Ted Cruz asked David Dewhurst: ""Did you support a payroll tax -- yes or no -- and is that a good idea?""

""No and no,"" Dewhurst replied in their June 22, 2012, debate hosted by Dallas’s KERA-TV, Channel 13.

Cruz: ""You did not support a payroll tax?""

Dewhurst: ""No, I’ve never supported a wage tax and I’ve never supported a payroll tax.""

We previously rated Pants on Fire a claim by Cruz that Dewhurst has a record of promoting a Texas income tax. No Texas leader has come close to such a pitch since a Dewhurst predecessor as lieutenant governor, Democrat Bob Bullock, floated the prospect in 1991.

And is Dewhurst correct that he has never supported a payroll tax?

Everyone is familiar with the federal payroll tax, meaning the taxes taken from paychecks of employed Americans, primarily to fund Social Security and Medicare. But Texas has no state payroll tax.

End of story?

No, because a payroll tax feature was debated in Texas in 2004 and 2005, when Dewhurst was in his first gavel-wielding term overseeing the Texas Senate. At the time,  lawmakers were looking at ways of revising the state’s outdated business franchise tax and also generating revenue to cover sought reductions in school property taxes.
   
According to news stories we corraled via Nexis, Dewhurst steered clear of supporting a payroll tax during a spring 2004 special session called by Gov. Rick Perry toward tackling the franchise tax and lowering school property taxes. The Texas House removed a payroll tax element from its proposal before sending its revised plan to the Senate, which advanced no counter-proposal before the session ended, according to a May 18, 2004, Houston Chronicle news article.

The next year, lawmakers tried again.

As the 2005 regular legislative session began, Dewhurst joined Perry and House Speaker Tom Craddick in vowing to lower school property taxes. The trio did not commit to a particular finance plan, according to a Jan. 11, 2005, Austin American-Statesman news article, though; the story says Perry ""reaffirmed his opposition to a payroll tax and questioned whether an increased gross-receipts tax or business-activity tax could jeopardize job growth.""

A Jan. 18, 2005, San Antonio Express-News report says that two days into the 140-day session, a Senate plan presented by Dewhurst called for expanding the franchise tax to all businesses except sole proprietorships. The story says senators had discussed setting the rate at less than 2 percent of each firm's net income plus its payroll, minus a deduction for each employee.

So, the initial Senate plan of 2005 had a payroll element.

In March 2005, the House approved a revenue package that offered companies a choice of paying the existing franchise tax or a 1.15 percent payroll tax on salaries up to $90,000 a year.

Dewhurst aired misgivings about the House’s payroll element, according to a March 16, 2005, Express-News news article. The story quotes Dewhurst saying: ""I've said over and over and over again that I think a broad-based, low rate that's based upon revenue and income is fairer than a payroll tax"" which hurts firms with lots of workers. The story says House leaders had said they got around that difficulty by offering companies a choice of which type of tax to pay.

An April 28, 2005, Dallas Morning News news article, headlined ""Dewhurst lays out tax swap,"" says Dewhurst had ""laid out a preliminary tax swap plan"" offsetting some $4.5 billion in school property tax reductions with various tax increases including a revamped franchise tax extended to virtually all businesses, which would pay about 1.35 percent on after-tax earnings plus, the story says, employee compensation.
   
But by May 2005, the Senate voted to answer the House with a plan allowing companies to choose the lower of two business taxes, as long as they generated more money than a minimum tax of 0.25 percent of gross receipts -- and the adopted plan retained payroll elements.

The details are a bit eye-glazing. But as described in a May 12, 2005, American-Statesman news article, the first option for businesses was to pay 2.5 percent of the sum of their net taxable income plus payroll, though they could deduct from the tax base either half of their payrolls or $30,000 per employee plus the cost of some health benefits. The second option in the Senate plan would have required companies to pay a 1.75 percent payroll tax, capped at $1,500 per employee.
       
After the Senate acted, Dewhurst issued a press release praising the action, as Cruz’s campaign has pointed out. Dewhurst’s release includes a paragraph summarizing the tax measure, House Bill 3. ""By closing loopholes, the plan broadens the franchise tax base, and extends a lower rate to all Texas businesses—effectively treating all businesses equally under state tax law. Texas businesses will have a choice of paying either a low-rate revised franchise tax or a payroll tax,"" the release says.

In that session and a summer session, however, the House and Senate did not reach a compromise, leaving the overhaul of the franchise tax to be resolved in a different way in 2006.

For outside perspective, we shared the description of the 2005 Senate-approved plan with Richard Pomp, a University of Connecticut law professor who has written extensively on state and local taxation. By telephone, Pomp said he would say the first option in the Senate plan had a payroll tax element, while the second option was a pure payroll tax. ""It doesn’t get any less ambiguous than that, does it?"" Pomp said.

We contacted Dewhurst’s campaign about this topic and didn’t hear back.
       
Our ruling

During the state’s mid-decade tax debates, the Senate under Dewhurst’s leadership -- and to his praise -- incorporated payroll taxes in a proposal to replace the existing business franchise tax. 
No payroll tax passed into law. Still, it’s incorrect to say Dewhurst never supported a payroll tax. We rate his debate claim as False.","[('\nCompiled news articles from Texas newspapers on payroll tax proposals in 2004-05 (Nexis search)\n\nPress release, Lt. Gov.

Facebook post says “75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class”
","
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, many readers asked us to check a claim circulating on Facebook that ""75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class."" 
The claim concerns the amount to be paid by Americans who decline to pay for health insurance under a provision of the health care law known as the individual mandate. 
Starting in 2014, individuals who do not buy insurance and who aren't exempt from the mandate (say, for cases of hardship or religious belief) will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95 for an individual in 2014, rising to $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016. 
After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- 2.5 percent of household income, if that’s greater than the amount written into the law. 
The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- two nonpartisan federal offices -- have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019. 
The individual mandate was at the heart of the legal challenge to the law, and the two parties have sparred over whether the sum to be paid by those who don’t get health insurance amounts to a penalty or a tax. (We ruled that the Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate acts like a tax but stopped short of explicitly calling it a tax.) 
The Facebook post that readers sent us was created by the Tea Party Patriots, but it appears to originate from a comment made by Steve Moore, a member of the Wall Street Journal's editorial board, in a Fox News interview. ""We found that about three-quarters of whatever you want to call them -- taxes, fines, penalties -- … will fall on the backs of families that make less than $120,000,"" Moore said in an interview on the show Fox and Friends. 
This number comes from the same CBO report cited above, in a table on page 73. So we delved into the numbers. 
CBO projected that 76 percent of people paying the tax penalty in 2016 will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. By 2016, CBO expects the federal poverty level to be $24,000 for a family of four, so 500 percent of that would be $120,000, which is just as Moore said. 
So there is a grain of truth to this number. But there are a number of issues worth considering. 
First, the claim requires us to call a family of four earning $120,000 in 2016 ""middle class."" Is that reasonable? 
We looked at projections from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center for what the federal income distribution will look like in 2016. A chart from the center estimates that the threshold for entering the top 20 percent of the income distribution in 2016 will be $123,970. So the Facebook post is essentially defining ""middle class"" as the bottom 80 percent of the income scale. 
Because there is no standard definition of ""the middle class"" -- and because politicians typically use the term broadly -- we won’t quibble with defining it this way. However, we do think it’s worth noting that this definition includes poor Americans as well as ones that can be defined as ""middle class."" 
The second concern is more problematic. CBO offers another measurement that is probably a more appropriate yardstick for the Facebook post’s claim -- a tally of dollars paid rather than the number of households that have to pay. 
CBO projected that 46 percent of the tax dollars collected as a result of the individual mandate will come from the bottom 80 percent, compared to 55 percent that will come from the top 20 percent. This presents a very different picture of how the financial burden of the mandate will be borne. There’s a big difference between the ""middle class"" carrying 75 percent of the burden rather than 46 percent of the burden. 
Two tax experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and William McBride of the Tax Foundation -- agreed with our analysis. They also indicated that, given the phrasing of the Facebook post, it’s more appropriate to use dollars paid than the number of households that have to pay the penalty. ""It's a complete misinterpretation of what CBO said,"" Williams told PolitiFact. 
Third, while we think it’s pretty clear from the context of Moore’s interview that he’s talking about the individual mandate alone, the Facebook post doesn’t carry over that nuance. The Facebook post could be interpreted to mean all taxes stemming from the health care law. 
Collectively, these new taxes are a lot bigger than the individual mandate tax -- and two of the biggest of them are specifically geared toward upper-income taxpayers. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation: 
• Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. 
• Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans"" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. 
For other newly imposed taxes in the law, it’s less clear how the burden will fall. These taxes include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); an annual fee on health insurance providers begins ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years). 
Our ruling 
The Facebook post said that ""75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class."" While it’s true that 75 to 80 percent of the households paying the individual mandate penalty might be described as ""middle class,"" those households will only foot 45 percent of the bill -- a big difference. In addition, the Facebook post is worded vaguely enough to suggest that 75 percent of all the taxes in the health care bill will fall on the middle class. And that would be wrong. We rate the statement False.","[('\nFacebook post, ""75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class,"" July 3, 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""Selected CBO Publications Related to Health Care Legislation, 2009–2010,"" December 2010\n\nSteve Moore, interview excerpts from Fox and Friends, June 30, 2012\n\nUrban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, ""Baseline Distribution of Cash Income and Federal Taxes Under Current Law Share of Federal Taxes by Cash Income Percentile, 2016,"" accessed July 6, 2012\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Rhode Island, ""Federal Healthcare Reform: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Individual Mandate and Subsidy"" (summary), accessed July 6, 2012\n\nEmail interview with William McBride, economist at the Tax Foundation, July 6, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, July 6, 2012', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150899554630779&set=a.10150641687705779.384853.93228695778&type=1&ref=nf')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/09/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-75-percent-obamacare-tax-falls-/

Health law puts government in between patients and doctors, Mitt Romney says
","
The Republican position on the health care law is that it represents a government takeover of the health care system. In his response to the Supreme Court ruling to uphold the law, Mitt Romney stayed on message. ""Perhaps most troubling of all, Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor,"" Romney said.

This is a slightly different version of the broader statement about a government takeover, which PolitiFact has repeatedly found to be false and sometimes outrageously so. In fact, that claim was PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. We will try to set the record straight on this particular assertion.

We asked the Romney campaign to explain exactly how the Affordable Care Act puts the government between patient and doctor. We did not hear back, and Romney did not elaborate in his original comments.

The overarching fact about the law is that it relies on the private sector. Employers still buy private health insurance for their workers. The law doesn’t change how much doctors are paid or what services they can provide, though it does create incentives and penalties to promote better care. (One example: It penalizes hospitals if patients are re-admitted soon after being discharged.)

It establishes a minimum benefits package for insurance plans and fosters competition among health insurance companies by creating shopping websites. These sites, called exchanges, will allow customers to pick insurance plans the same way they might buy other things online, such as refrigerators or airplane tickets.The law also gives subsidies to people of limited means so they can buy their own insurance.

If the health care law did get between doctors and patients, you would think most doctors would complain loudly. While some do, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, does not. On the contrary, the AMA supports the law.

After the Supreme Court upheld the health reform act, AMA president Jeremy Lazarus issued a statement praising the decision, because the law ""will allow patients to see their doctors earlier rather than waiting for treatment until they are sicker and care is more expensive.""

Lazarus doesn’t see the law making life harder for doctors; he sees it making life easier. He said it ""simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork.""

Beyond the AMA, about nine other physician advocacy groups back all or major portions of the reform law, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Cardiology.

Specialists tend to be more concerned about the impact of health care reform than the primary doctors, and that chiefly centers on the Medicare program.

The law sets up a panel to keep Medicare spending in check. The 15-member panel is called the Independent Payment Advisory Board and starting in 2020, it can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures. Health reform law opponents sometimes speak of this panel as a backdoor to rationing, but as PolitiFact has noted many times, claims about the IPAB are often exaggerated.

The law specifically prohibits the panel from suggesting anything that leads to rationing or reductions in either benefits or eligibility. Further, Congress has the power to overrule the panel’s recommendations.

The law’s significant changes in the health insurance market are another source of concern.

Dr. Dick Armstrong, the chief operating officer of Docs4PatientCare, a group opposed to the law, says Washington will be able to define the best practices for treating patients. The government would enforce those guidelines through the insurance companies and require them to reimburse only that care that matches those best practices. Armstrong said this will ""shut out"" doctors who don’t follow those rules.

""Best practice guidelines can reduce costs,"" Armstong said. ""But guidelines become dangerous in the hands of people who tie them to money.""

The law is sweeping and is designed to have an effect on the quality and cost of care. But to assume that the outcomes will only be negative requires a very selective reading of federal law that overlooks many checks on federal authority.

First, Washington has given states the authority to set the standards for insurance plans so they can respond to local conditions.

Second, the law calls for creation of ""strategies to align public and private payers with regard to quality and patient safety efforts,"" and insurance company participation in those exchanges is part of that effort. But the law also expressly allows insurance plans to operate outside the exchanges.

Third, the strongest federal efforts to control spending lie in the federal Medicare program, not in the private market. Within Medicare, participation in the biggest cost-saving pilot -- Accountable Care Organizations -- is voluntary. The Accountable Care Organizations are intended to bring doctors and specialists together to treat patients and include financial incentives.

Fourth, all regulations must pass through an extensive public review process.

We came across one opinion poll that showed doctors evenly split on the broad question of whether the health reform law is a step in the right or the wrong direction. However, the poll’s methodology raised some red flags. It reached out to about 16,000 doctors, but only about 500 responded. In that group, specialists outnumbered primary care doctors two to one. The specialists overall were much more likely to worry that reform would drive their pay down. Surgical specialists were the most likely to say that health reform was a step in the wrong direction.

Our ruling

For three years, Republicans have insisted that the health care reform bill amounts to a government takeover of health care. Romney’s statement that the law puts government between you and your doctor is another iteration of that claim.

The law does aim to improve the quality and efficiency of care. At some level, that would change what doctors do. Physicians are wary of change, and the way the law will work is complex. But we found no hard evidence to support the claim that doctors would be forced to make bad decisions. In contrast, we found many provisions that support an open process geared toward providing better care.

Primary care doctors seem most inclined to support the law, as do a large number of physician professional associations.

Support for the law is weaker among specialists, who are more likely to question what it means for their compensation and more likely to face scrutiny for using high-cost tests and procedures. But that doesn’t mean the government is placing itself between doctors and patients. The law is complex, but it leaves intact the private sector delivery of health care.

Overall, we found some concerns that government influence over the private insurance market will dictate doctor behavior. But statements like Romney’s overstate the level of government control in the law and ignore state flexibility in setting insurance standards.

Romney’s campaign offered no evidence to back up this claim. We rule this statement False.","[('\nMitt Romney campaign website, remarks on Supreme Court ruling, June 28, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, President Obama’s health care law ""represents a government takeover of health care.""\nMay 13, 2011, accessed June 29, 2012\n\nAmerican Medical Association, AMA Applauds Court Decision - press release, Jeremy Lazarus, president, June 28, 2012, accessed June 29, 2012\n\nAmerican Medical Association, What Health System Reform Means to Physicians and Patients, accessed June 29, 2012\n\nDeloitte Center for Health Solutions, Physician Perspectives about Health Care Reform, December 2011, accessed June 29, 2012\n\nAmerican College of Cardiology, US Supreme Court Issues Ruling on Health Care Reform Law, June 28, 2012, accessed June 29, 2012\n\nGovernment Printing Office, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, March 23, 2010, accessed July 5, 2012\n\nFactcheck.org, Romney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods, June 28, 2012, accessed June 29, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, Under the new health care law, ""the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat.

Milwaukee alderman says fluoride in toothpaste is a poison
","
The debate over the use of fluoride in Milwaukee’s water supply was pretty much a one day affair. Led by Ald. Jim Bohl, in that short time frame, the public heard a barrage of unusual claims about their water, rat poison, and even their toothpaste.

Indeed, we thought the debate over fluoridation of water had long been settled.

Since 1953, the Milwaukee Water Works has added a tiny amount of fluoride to the drinking water. Many cities have done this for years to boost dental hygiene and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers it one of the most important public health efforts of the past 50 years.

Some, including Bohl, have criticized the practice.

They raise a variety of arguments including that the government is introducing poison into the water supply. Bohl tried unsuccessfully to get the Common Council to end water fluoridation in Milwaukee, arguing the money saved -- about $540,000 a year -- would be better used for dental programs in the central city.

Bohl said that fluoride was a dangerous chemical, originally created for use as rat poison. Now, not only is it in the water, but also consumer products including toothpaste, he said.

""We all know that we do not have children or anyone swallow toothpaste,"" Bohl said at a City Hall news conference May 29, cited in this report on WUWM. ""And the reason we don’t do that is because of the poison substance of fluoride. If fluoride was such an effective and non-harmful substance, why would we not encourage everyone to swallow their toothpaste?""

Bohl elaborated in a May 30 interview with the Journal Sentinel editorial board: ""We’re talking about a substance that’s rated as more toxic than lead.""

That got our attention. Poison in our toothpaste? Are folks putting themselves in danger when they polish their pearly whites?

Some -- but not all --  toothpaste contains fluoride, a substance known to prevent cavities. If it’s ingested alone, fluoride can cause serious illness in humans. So, toothpaste is regulated by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration, which limits the amount of fluoride allowed in the product.

That’s why tubes of toothpaste with fluoride carry this warning label: ""If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately.""

Apparently Bohl is not the only one who reads the fine print on their toothpaste tubes.

Flouride calls are relatively common at the Wisconsin Poison Center, in part because of the warning label, said manager Cathy Smith. The agency, part of Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, handles calls from around the state.

Experts who field the calls determine the brand and type of toothpaste used and consult database to determine the concentration of fluoride in that particular product, Smith said. They then factor in the age and weight of the human and see if there’s a problem.

And here’s where the scary talk from Bohl meets reality: Toothpaste doesn’t make people sick.

""We have never, ever had a person who has ingested toothpaste, even a child, who has been referred to the emergency room,"" Smith said.

How much toothpaste would you have to swallow before you’d be considered in any sort of trouble? A 30-pound child would have to ingest an entire six-ounce tube, according to the Poison Center.

""Kids, number one, don’t eat that much,"" Smith said. "" And, number two, they’d be puking it up if they did.""

In part, that’s because the product includes cleansers, detergents and other substances that would disagree with your stomach.

By the Poison Center’s calculations, an adult would have to swallow about  four tubes of toothpaste before they’d be a candidate for the E.R.

We checked with Froedtert Hospital, which has one of the busiest emergency rooms in the state.

Spokeswoman Kathleen Sieja said that the hospital didn’t track toothpaste-related ailments, but said she’d check with a long-time doctor there to see if he had heard of anything.

Said Sieja: ""The emergency dept physician responded that in his 17 years, he has never taken care of a fluoride overdose.""

We also checked with a few other sources, including toothpaste manufacturers, and found there’s little for people to worry about.

""The amount of fluoride found in toothpaste is usually not swallowed in large enough amounts to cause harm,"" said an article on the New York Times Health section about how people should handle a possible fluoride overdose.

And here’s what Proctor and Gamble, the maker of Crest, says about toothpaste dangers:

""Occasionally swallowing a small amount of toothpaste is not a safety risk for adults or children. Our label cautions against swallowing because eating a large amount of toothpaste would be expected to cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Certain ingredients that are common in toothpastes have the potential to cause stomach irritation if enough is swallowed.""

Finally, there’s the question of what is a poison. Here’s what a couple of dictionaries say:

-- A substance with an inherent property that tends to destroy life or impair health. Dictionary.com
-- A substance that causes injury, illness, or death, especially by chemical means. The Free Dictionary.com
-- A substance that through its chemical action usually kills, injures, or impairs an organism. Merriam-Webster.com

A tube of toothpaste doesn’t seem to fit any of these definitions.

We asked Bohl why he called fluoride a poison, and he sent us an email with links to more than a dozen websites that ""spell out the toxic nature of the substance.""

Some are from government sources, such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Others were from groups opposed to fluoride, even one by a blogger who writes about ""Energy healing program to boost the human aura, increase athletic performance and life extension.""

Bohl turned to the dictionary as well -- to define the word toxic: 1) poisonous.
2. manifesting the symptoms of severe poisoning. The FreeDictionary.com.

Finally, we asked the Poison Center: Is fluoride a poison? Smith’s answer: ""It can be toxic in certain situations.""

So, with this item adequately scrubbed, let’s put it to bed.

In raising a slew of concerns about the use of fluoride in Milwaukee’s drinking water, Bohl said the public was being exposed to a dangerous chemical -- he called it a poison -- that is regulated by the feds.

Many brands of toothpaste do contain fluoride, which is regulated by the feds. But saying toothpaste contains a poison, Bohl overstates his case and the alarm to the public. People generally don’t eat and swallow toothpaste. And if they did, it would take a massive amount to be at risk from fluoride poisoning. In fact, experts say a kid would vomit out the toothpaste long before that point.

We rate Bohl’s claim Mostly False.","[('\nWUWM-FM (89.7) ""Alderman calls to end fluoridation of Milwaukee’s drink water; Health leaders disagree,"" May 30, 2012\n\nWTMJ-AM (620), ""Dentists argue merits of Milwaukee’s fluoridated water,"" May 23, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Florida, ""Truth about flouride does not include Nazi myth,"" Oct. 6, 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board interview, Ald.

Steve Sweeney claims new legislation doesn’t eliminate teacher tenure
","
Senate President Steve Sweeney said new legislation transforms tenure into a system fit for the 21st-century while maintaining the protections it gives teachers.

Tenure has been modernized, not eliminated in a bill recently passed by the state Legislature but not yet signed by the governor, Sweeney told WNYC host Brian Lehrer in a July 2 interview.

Lehrer asked Sweeney, ""What does tenure mean if you can then remove the teachers who you don't think are doing a good job?""

""Well what happens is … tenure is after three years in the state of New Jersey, tenure you have a lifetime job. So if you, seven years, 10 years into the job … it was almost impossible to get rid of a teacher. Now, with the evaluation processes that we're going to have going forward, teachers aren't performing as they should be and they get bad evaluations we can move to remove those teachers much more quickly,"" Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said.

""So does that change tenure or does that end tenure?"" Lehrer asked. ""Should we say tenure is over in New Jersey?""

""No, tenure still exists but it's been overhauled,"" Sweeney said. ""I would say Brian it's been modernized.""

Saying that tenure provides teachers a ""lifetime job"" suggests there is no process for firing teachers. However, such a system existed prior to this legislation, though critics argue it was so costly and cumbersome that it was hardly used.

But for this fact-check, we’re only examining Sweeney’s claim that tenure for teachers still exists in New Jersey.

Last year, PolitiFact New Jersey gave Gov. Chris Christie a Half True for saying that when the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, says he wants to ""eliminate tenure, that’s not true.""

But Christie’s proposals and the new legislation differ in several ways.

The legislation creates an annual evaluation system for educators, a plan backed by Christie. Under the system teachers can receive one of four ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective.

New teachers must complete a one-year mentorship program and then receive positive evaluations in two of the next three years in order to receive tenure. Previously, teachers earned tenure after three years on the job.

The legislation also requires the filing of an inefficiency charge against tenured teachers receiving negative evaluations for two consecutive years. But teachers can contest those charges with an arbitrator. Previously, administrative law judges handled such disputes.

Under Christie’s plan and the legislation as it was first introduced teachers who received negative evaluations would lose their tenure rights and therefore could not contest their dismissal, except in narrow circumstances outlined in the original bill.

NJEA spokesman Steve Baker said tenure still exists under the new legislation.

""The fundamental issue is that a teacher, having earned tenure, retains the right to due process before she or he can be fired,"" Baker said. ""Tenure, under statute, is simply the right to due process in the form of a chance to have a hearing before a neutral third party.""

Jeffrey Keefe, a professor at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations, said there are two elements of teacher tenure: a just-cause requirement for dismissal after three years of probation and seniority in layoffs provided the teacher is certified for a potential vacancy possibly held by a less senior teacher.

Christie wanted to eliminate seniority protections during layoffs. But the ""last in, first out"" system -- which means the newest teachers are laid off first -- remains intact in the new legislation.

""I think tenure was overhauled in the bill, since schools could always dismiss a teacher for cause including poor performance (provided there were efforts to correct the unacceptable performance),"" Keefe said.

Our ruling

Sweeney said ""tenure still exists but it's been overhauled"" in New Jersey.

A bill approved by the Legislature makes it more difficult to earn tenure and requires inefficiency charges to be filed against teachers receiving negative evaluations for two consecutive years. But the bill does not eliminate a tenured teacher’s right to appeal those charges.

The law also maintains seniority protections during layoffs.

For those reasons, we rate Sweeney’s statement True.

Obama surfs for support with Google claim
","
So what role did the federal government have in helping Google blast off in cyberspace?

PolitiFact Georgia did (what else?) a Google search to find out.

Our inquiry was sparked by comments President Barack Obama made during a recent speech in Atlanta. The president was making the argument that smart government investments have been good for America -- pointing to well-known projects such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the development of the nation’s interstate highway system in the 1950s.

""Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, said it pretty well,"" Obama said. ""He said we should do for ourselves what we do best for ourselves, but we should also do together those things that we do better together. And so we made investments in science and technology, inventing the products that led to the Internet and GPS and Google and amazing medical breakthroughs. We did that because together, through our government, we made these investments in basic research.""

Maybe Al Gore created the Internet after all. Or not.

PolitiFact Georgia hadn’t heard this claim about Google before and was very curious to learn whether Obama was correct.

Obama has pushed Congress to support his plan to spend more federal dollars on infrastructure projects he believes will boost the nation’s economy. He also wants to spend more on research and development projects. The administration’s budget calls for a 5 percent increase, to $7.4 billion, in funding for the National Science Foundation. The funding would focus on research in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, wireless communications, and science and mathematics education.

An Obama campaign spokeswoman referred us to some other information we found online to back up the president’s claim.

The information comes from the NSF.

In the mid-1990s, Stanford University students Larry Page and Sergey Brin began working on research to produce better ways to rank Internet search results. At the time, Stanford received about $4.5 million in NSF funding from the federal government’s Digital Library Initiative. The students created a prototype that used well-established technology to crawl from page to page by following links. They developed a system to rank Web pages by determining whether many other highly ranked Web pages linked to it.

The students wrote a paper on their ideas and tested it on live data on the Internet. The work, called the PageRank method, survives as one of the main components of today’s Google search service, the NSF says on its website.

""Page and Brin obtained funding that allowed them to move their growing hardware facility from the Stanford campus into a friend’s garage and to incorporate Google, Inc.,"" the NSF website says. ""The rest, as they say, is history.""

Page, now Google’s CEO, and Brin, who now directs the company’s special projects, each have a reported net financial worth of about $18 billion. They no longer work from a garage.

Google’s company history does not mention the federal government. An email (Google suggests it’s easier to contact it this way) to the massive company’s media relations office wasn’t returned.

Mark Malseed co-wrote a book called ""The Google Story"" that chronicled the company’s birth and extraordinary growth. He and co-author David Vise, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, interviewed Google’s co-founders and about two dozen others for the book. Malseed believes the NSF grant played a small role in Google’s development. He doesn’t believe they even mention the NSF in the book.

""It feels like a little bit of a stretch on this one to me,"" Malseed said of Obama’s claim.

Page and Brin needed more disk space to corral their voluminous data and used computers and some other resources that Stanford had available through the grant, Malseed said. The two students, Malseed said, realized they needed additional resources not available at Stanford to continue their work and obtained private startup money to create what became Google.

Malseed guessed the president’s statement came from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who was reportedly an informal adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign.

""It’s not a false claim in that the project originated while Larry was working under the DLI,"" Malseed said. ""But to insinuate that [claim] leaves out the initial funding raised from entrepreneurs.""

Ronald Rice, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave the federal government more credit.

Rice, co-director of the university’s Carsey-Wolf Center Department of Communication, has co-written a book on the Internet and teaches courses on new media. He said the president’s statement in Atlanta is part of a larger debate that government funding of research and development leads to innovation, which leads to economic growth and strategic influence.

""NSF grants are intended to do just those kinds of things. We talk about the importance of [research and development] investment -- and this is one of the sources,"" Rice said via email.

A division within the U.S. Defense Department called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency created an early network of time-sharing computers that is widely viewed as forming the basis of the Internet, which could be credited as helping lead to Google.

Is that a better argument in support of Obama’s claim?

""If there was no Internet, there would be no search engines,"" Malseed said. ""But you can say that about a lot of things.""

It’s clear that Google’s co-founders used resources from the NSF for their work. Some, such as Malseed, say those resources were helpful, but a part of the puzzle.

We believe the president’s statement is technically accurate. But it might give a bit too much credit to the government’s role in Google’s development.

We rate Obama’s claim as Mostly True.","[('\nWhite House transcript of President Barack Obama’s speech in Atlanta, June 26, 2012', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/26/remarks-president-campaign-event-atlanta-ga'), ('\nEmail from Kara Carscaden, spokeswoman, Obama campaign, June 27, 2012\n\nEmail from Ronald Rice, co-director, Carsey-Wolf Center Department of Communication, University of California, Santa Barbara, June 27, 2012\n\n""The Google Story"" by David Vise and Mark Malseed\n\nGoogle history', 'No link'), ('\nNational Science Foundation, ""On the Origins of Google,"" Aug. 17, 2004', 'https://www.google.com/about/company/history/'), ('\nTelephone interview with Mark Malseed, co-author, ""The Google Story,"" June 29, 2012', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/09/barack-obama/obamas-google-claim/

Uncle Sam's borrowing leaves less for businesses, GOP Wisconsin Senate candidate Mark Neumann says
","
Americans have heard many times that Uncle Sam’s borrowing puts a terrible burden on their children and grandchildren, because they’re the ones who will have to pay the money back someday.

But former congressman Mark Neumann, a Wisconsin Republican running for U.S. Senate, contends the borrowing has a pernicious present-day effect as well.

In a June 13, 2012 radio interview, Neumann said that if the federal government didn't borrow $1.2 trillion every year ""to fund government operations,"" that money would be available ""for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses.""

Really?

There’s essentially one pot of money out there and every time the federal government sticks it beak in, there’s less for private businesses -- even with interest rates at near-record lows?

Neumann’s case

Here’s the relevant exchange between Neumann and talk show host Mitch Henck of WIBA-AM (1310) in Madison:

Henck: ""We need something bold, don't you, to get this economy going?""

Neumann: ""Well, I think balancing the federal budget so that the federal government stops borrowing $1.2 trillion out of the private sector is going to help our economy immensely. When you think about the federal government taking $1.2 trillion out of the private sector to fund government operations, you can see what's wrong with our economy.""

Henck: ""Aren't they taking that from the Chinese? They're borrowing that money, aren't they, Congressman?""

Neumann: ""They are borrowing that money and that's the point exactly. If they did not borrow that money, that money would be available out here in the private sector for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses.

""As it is -- and listen, I'm a business owner myself, I've been in business for 35 years here in Wisconsin creating Wisconsin jobs -- and the reality is, I understand that I'm now competing against the federal government to borrow money to expand our businesses. We just expanded into the Madison market to the Dane County area with our business and it was a monumental task to arrange the financing to do that because the federal government is taking $1.2 trillion first, before any of us entrepreneurs get to compete to borrow money.""

We called Neumann to ask him to elaborate on the relation between borrowing done by the federal government and borrowing done by an individual or business on Main Street. He repeatedly said that if the U.S. government didn’t run annual deficits of about $1.2 trillion, necessitating the borrowing, that money would be available to businesses and individuals.

Other views

We asked five experts about Neumann’s argument.

""This is a fairly straightforward, almost master of the obvious-type statement,"" said J.D. Foster, senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.

Money is loaned first to the U.S. government because it is considered ""the riskless borrower,"" and the money the U.S. borrows isn’t available to others, he said.

OK, the same dollar can only be loaned one time. But does U.S. borrowing, as Neumann claims, leave less money for businesses?

Not according to the other experts.

""The U.S. government and American entrepreneurs are not running after the same pool of money,"" said Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the economics department at Marquette University in Milwaukee. The U.S. borrows largely from overseas -- by selling securities -- while domestic businesses borrow mostly from domestic banks, he said.

The notion that the amount of federal borrowing limits money available to be loaned to businesses ""is absurd on its face,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.

""Every single measure of the interest rate (Aaa bonds, Baa bonds, mortgage loans, car loans etc.) is lower today than at any point in the (George W.) Bush administration,"" he said by email. ""If government borrowing were pulling money away from businesses, it would be by pushing up interest rates.""

Barry Bosworth, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, agreed. Neumann’s statement ""makes little sense right now because the basic problem is the opposite -- no one wants to borrow, and hence interest rates are near zero.  If we could get more people to borrow and invest, the economy would quickly recover,"" he said.

Bosworth, a former adviser to Democratic President Jimmy Carter, said Neumann’s claim might have been true prior to 1970, when ""capital markets were closed at the borders."" But since the 1990s capital markets are global and U.S. government borrowing doesn’t ""crowd out"" businesses seeking capital, he said.

Andrew Reschovsky, professor of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that among other reasons, Neumann is proven wrong by ""basic economics.""

Increased federal borrowing should increase demand for money and raise interest rates, which would discourage businesses from borrowing, but interest rates have been at or near historic lows, he said.

Our rating

Neumann said that if the federal government didn't borrow $1.2 trillion every year ""to fund government operations,"" that money would be available ""for entrepreneurs and business people to put to work creating jobs and building and expanding their businesses.""

While it’s true you can only lend the same dollar once, the consensus among experts we consulted is that the level of federal government borrowing does not leave less money available for businesses to borrow -- or as Marquette’s Chowdhury put it: ""It’s not a zero-sum game.""

We rate Neumann’s statement False.","[('\nWIBA-AM, Mitch Henck interview of Mark Neumann (at 10:10), June 13, 2012\n\nInterview, Mark Neumann, June 22, 2012\n\nInterview, Heritage Foundation senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy J.D.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims state senator promised no tax hikes in state budget, but later voted to raise income taxes by $800 million
","
The Democrat-led Legislature has promised to cut taxes if Gov. Chris Christie hits his revenue targets in the coming months, but the Republican governor has a warning for New Jerseyans:

""Be very suspicious.""

After offering such advice at a June 26 town hall meeting in Ocean County, Christie suggested that Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, had broken a promise not to have any tax hikes in the new state budget.

""Oh, and by the way, that same senator, Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget,’ voted – voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million,"" said Christie, according to a video posted June 26 on YouTube.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that the governor’s statement is mostly accurate, but missing a couple of critical details.

Sarlo (D-Bergen) vowed to not include new taxes in the upcoming budget during a February TV interview and then voted last month to raise income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year.

But the governor failed to mention two points: that tax hike technically was separate from the budget bill approved by the Legislature, and it only would have affected taxpayers with more than $1 million in taxable income.

First, let’s discuss Sarlo’s earlier comments and recent vote.

In a Feb. 22 interview on NJToday, Sarlo said the following in regard to the spending plan for fiscal year 2013, which started July 1: ""There will be no new taxes in this budget.""

But at the June 21 meeting of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Sarlo voted for a bill raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million.

That tax hike -- known as the so-called ""millionaires tax"" -- would generate between $754 million and $836 million in fiscal year 2013, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. The money would be used to boost property tax relief payments.

By June 28, the Legislature -- with Sarlo voting yes -- had approved the tax hike. Christie conditionally vetoed the legislation on July 2 and called on legislators to amend the bill to implement a tax cut.

Democrats, who set aside $183 million in the fiscal year 2013 budget for a possible tax cut, have said the reduction only would occur if Christie meets his revenue projections between now and December.

Now, let’s address the points missing from Christie’s claim.

When discussing Sarlo’s vote ""to raise income taxes $800 million,"" the governor failed to mention that the tax hike only would apply to taxable income exceeding $1 million. Unless they’re millionaires, the people at that town hall meeting would not pay higher income taxes.

Also, Christie’s statement suggests that the tax hike was part of the budget sent to him by the Legislature. But it technically wasn’t.

The millionaires tax bill was separate from the fiscal year 2013 budget bill approved by the Legislature on June 25. Christie approved the budget, with various changes, on June 29.

The millionaires tax would have added money to the fiscal year 2013 budget, but it was still considered separately.

In a statement issued before Christie’s conditional veto, Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said: ""This bill was not considered in conjunction with the budget, is not part of the budget, and whatever happens to it will have no impact on the budget."" 
The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment.

Our ruling

At a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Sarlo ""said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget’"" and ""voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million.""

It’s accurate that Sarlo said ""there will be no new taxes in this budget"" and later voted to increase income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year. But Christie failed to mention that the tax hike was considered separately from the budget bill and that it only would have affected millionaires.

For better or worse, health-care changes are on the way.

During the June 29, 2012, edition of Rhode Island Public Television's ""A Lively Experiment"" program, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts, who is helping to implement the federal program in Rhode Island, said most of the uninsured Rhode Islanders who will benefit are working people.

""Two thirds to three quarters of people without insurance in Rhode Island work, but don't have access to affordable health insurance,"" she said, pegging the number of uninsured Rhode Islanders at about 120,000.

The survey asks questions every year about who has health insurance and whether they are working. The most recent state data are from 2010.

When the elderly were excluded (they are covered by Medicare), the Census Bureau found that 119,100 Rhode Islanders were without health insurance, essentially the 120,000 number cited by Roberts.

The Census Bureau also found that 77 percent of the uninsured are from families in which at least one person has a part-time or full-time job. The remaining 23 percent are from families where nobody is working.

Because that 77 percent includes children and adults who aren’t working at all, the actual percentage of workers who are uninsured is less than 77 percent -- probably significantly less.

As Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller noted, insurance is often sold by family unit, which is why the numbers are framed that way.

Koller sent us to another source, a 2010 ""Study of Rhode Island's Uninsured"" done by the consulting firm Mathematica Policy Research.

It estimated that in 2010 there were 103,400 uninsured Rhode Islanders age 20 to 64. That included 49,600 people (or 48 percent) who were employed, significantly less than Roberts' estimate.

The remaining people make up two groups, 22,000 (21 percent) traditionally classified as unemployed and 31,800 ""not employed"" (31 percent). Project director Deborah Chollet said the ""not employed"" group consists of people who are not looking for work, such as early retirees, people who regard themselves as too disabled to do their job, or parents staying home to care for a child while the other parent works.

Koller said the best numbers are probably from the census because they use data that are more recent and they're not extrapolated, as the Mathematica numbers are.

""The point that we're trying to make is that the uninsured are people who are working. They're in working situations,"" said Koller, the health insurance commissioner. ""It's not that they're layabouts or something like that. They're working and they don't have access to it, or they have access to it and they can't afford it.""

Our ruling

Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts said, ""Two thirds to three quarters of people without [health] insurance in Rhode Island work.""

Unfortunately, none of the data precisely match up with the way she cast her statement.

The Kaiser numbers Roberts cited to support her claim represent families, not individuals.

The Mathematica study showed far fewer working people without insurance, but it's based on a projection using older data.

In cases where the facts don't precisely match up with the statement, PolitiFact tries to use the data that are available and triangulate to get the truth.

Roberts' larger point, that a lot of Rhode Islanders without health insurance are working people, is true.

But she gave a range of two thirds to three quarters -- 67 percent to 75 percent. The Rhode Island studies we consulted suggest the true number is higher than 48 percent but lower than 77 percent.

We rate her statement as Half True.

"['Tennessee', 'Voting Record', 'Nick Ciparro']","
Opponent says Duncan has sponsored on piece of legislation in 10 years
","
U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, has been in Congress for nearly 2½ decades, so his voting record should be chock full of fodder for his political opponents to exploit.

But one of his opponents in the 2012 primary, Republican Nick Ciparro of Knoxville, sees Duncan’s record as sorely lacking substance.

""In the last 10 years, only one piece of legislation has been cosponsored and passed by Mr. Duncan Jr.,"" Ciparro wrote on his campaign website.

Lawmakers routinely sign on as cosponsors of scores of bills, so it seemed doubtful to us that just one of the bills that Duncan has cosponsored in the past 10 years has become law.

Ciparro backed off a bit when we asked him to back up that claim. What he meant, Ciparro said, was that Duncan has written just one bill over the past decade that has been signed into law. He has since changed his website to say that only one piece of legislation ""has been written and passed"" by Duncan.

While recognizing that Ciparro adjusted the wording on his website, at PolitiFact we fact-check the original claim, not revisions made after a fact-based claim is questioned. Ciparro makes other claims about Duncan’s productivity on his website, but we wondered if he did overreach with the original claim about how much legislation had been ""cosponsored and passed"" by Duncan.

Duncan’s spokesman, Patrick Newton, called Ciparro’s claim ridiculous and provided us with a list of bills that the congressman has authored and cosponsored over the past decade.

Based upon that count, Duncan has cosponsored 334 bills since 2001. Seventy-three of those bills have become law.

We did our own research using the Library of Congress’ Thomas online bill-tracking system. Our numbers were a little higher than those provided by the congressman’s office. According to our search, Duncan has sponsored or cosponsored 102 bills that have become law since 2001.

Duncan’s office also points out, rightly so, that it can be misleading to judge a lawmaker’s productivity by the number of bills he has sponsored or cosponsored that have been signed into law.

Both the House and the Senate often combine several pieces of legislation into one larger bill and then push the larger bill through the legislative process. So a measure that a congressman has championed could be attached to a larger bill and become law without the lawmaker’s name ever appearing anywhere on that legislation.

In fact, one measure that took that route was a resolution that Duncan sponsored to name a veterans outpatient clinic in Knoxville after William C. Tallent, a World War II hero who also served as Knox County’s finance commissioner for 28 years. The resolution was enacted and eventually became law after it was included in a broader veterans appropriations bill. Duncan’s name does not appear on the final legislation, even though he introduced the original measure.

It’s also worth noting that few bills ever become law. In the 111th Congress, which spanned the 2009 and 2010 calendar years, 13,683 measures were introduced in the House and Senate, yet only 385 of them became law, according to the Congressional Record.

Our ruling

The public record shows Rep. Duncan has sponsored or cosponsored at least six dozen bills that have been enacted into law over the past decade. At its best, Ciparro’s claim showed a basic lack of understanding of how Congress works. At its worst, it is a ridiculous distortion of the truth. We rate it Pants on Fire.","[('\nNick Ciparro campaign website\n\nPhone interview \xa0and email from Nick Ciparro, June 19, 2012\n\nPhone interview and email from Patrick Newton, spokesman for U.S. Rep.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Julián Castro']","
Julián Castro says Rick Perry's administration left “12,000 teachers without a job”
","
In his June 8, 2012, keynote speech at the Texas Democratic Party convention, San Antonio’s mayor told the crowd that cuts to education spending harm future economic growth.

""Every Texan knows that, except (Governor) Rick Perry,"" Julián Castro told the crowd. ""His Republican administration cut $4 billion out of our public schools. That's 12,000 Texas teachers without a job.""

Castro’s reference to a $4 billion cut is very familiar. As we noted in an April 2012 fact check, the 2011 Legislature changed school finance formulas so schools would get $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same. Perry signed the formula changes into law.

But Castro’s claim about 12,000 teachers going jobless as a result was new to us. Is he right?

We’ll also look at whether it’s reasonable to hang the funding decision on Perry.

Castro’s political consultant, Christian Archer, offered as backup a December 22, 2011, National Public Radio news story that begins, ""School funding in Texas is in turmoil. State lawmakers slashed more than $4 billion from education this school year — one of the largest cuts in state history — and more than 12,000 teachers and support staff have been laid off.""

NPR education reporter Claudio Sanchez told us by email that he got the number from lobby groups representing teachers and school boards. A spokesman for one of the groups, Clay Robison at the Texas State Teachers Association, told us by email that his group drew the figure from Moak, Casey and Associates, a research and lobbying firm whose clients include school districts.

Lynn Moak, a partner in the firm, told us by phone that the number was a preliminary projection based on results from the firm’s September/October 2011 survey of 60 districts.

So, the 12,000 figure was not a count of how many teachers had left school employment as a result of the $4 billion reduction in formula aid. Rather, it was a projection of how many more teachers schools would have employed in 2011-12 if lawmakers had increased school aid in proportion to enrollment growth -- as past legislatures had done for decades.

We sought other sources for the number of teachers left jobless.

Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us by email that according to the agency’s online database, the number of full-time Texas public school teaching jobs decreased by 10,717 from the 2010-11 school year to 2011-12. School districts had 334,930 full-time teaching positions in 2010-11 and 324,213 in 2011-12.

Does that mean 10,717 teachers were left without a job?

Cindy Clegg, an administrator at the Texas Association of School Boards, told us by phone: ""We have that many fewer teachers, but a large number of those have left the profession."" A significant number of teachers retired, she said, allowing some districts to reduce budgets through attrition -- not hiring replacements. There were layoffs, but Clegg and Culbertson said TASB and TEA don’t record those numbers.

Clegg emailed us a May 2012 article from the association’s HR Exchange publication, which it produces for members, indicating that retirements by Texas public school and university employees have risen steadily since 2009 and climbed steeply in 2011, according to Teacher Retirement System of Texas figures.

Among the reasons cited in the article: 

According to the article, TRS reported that for all public school/university employees, retirements from September 2010 through August 2011 were up 25 percent from the same period the year before. In the first part of the 2011-12 school year, September to January, retirements were up 28 percent over the same period a year before.

We sought to learn how many of the reported 21,854 retirements in 2011 were public-school teachers. TRS director of government relations Ray Spivey told us by email that the retirement system doesn’t break down its numbers by job title.

Next, we looked into whether Perry is responsible for the reduced number of teacher positions, as Castro also said.

The 2011 NPR story Archer sent us quotes state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, as saying lawmakers could have softened the blow by tapping into the rainy day fund, but Perry told them not to: ""The governor drew a very, very sharp line in the sand (saying) that the rainy day fund, which was specifically designed for periods of economic slowdown, would not be touched.""

Moak said he believed Perry’s stance was instrumental in forcing the legislature to cut into public education.

""Day-to-day control"" of changes to the state budget, he said, fell under Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus and the chairmen of the Senate Finance and House Appropriations committees. ""And they certainly don’t operate as part of the Perry administration, if you will, to use (Castro’s) words,"" he said.

""What Perry was instrumental in doing, I believe, he played a greater role in limiting access by the Legislature to the rainy day fund,"" Moak said. ""And once that became clear, that the House with very much Perry’s support was not going to consider above an emergency level of funds from the rainy day fund, the Lege had a limited series of choices as to where it’d make funding cuts.""

An Austin American-Statesman news article published June 19, 2011, in the wake of the state budget passing into law, opens: ""GOP legislators didn't budge this session from their commitment to reduce Texas' education spending even in the face of protests, negative ad campaigns and reams of criticism."" Perry reinforced the pressure to make deep budget cuts, the story said.

For his part, the governor was quoted in a March 9, 2011, Statesman news story as saying that local administrators and school boards, not state government, would be laying off the teachers. ""The lieutenant governor, the speaker, their colleagues aren't going to hire or fire one teacher, as best I can tell,"" Perry said.

""Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to school rolls,"" Perry said, a statement we later rated Mostly True. ""So are the administrators and the school boards going to make a decision to reduce those, or are they going to make a decision to reduce the number of teachers in the classroom? I certainly know where I would point.""

Culbertson gave a similar answer when we asked if TEA could provide context on how staffing has changed because of state budget decisions: ""Hiring and personnel decisions are a local issue,"" she said.

Our ruling

Castro’s reference to 12,000 unemployed teachers is based on an out-of-date, what-if projection -- not actual job losses. Still, school districts shed nearly 11,000 teaching positions in the first school year affected by the $4 billion cut signed into law by Perry. And while it’s uncertain how many of the eliminated positions resulted in unemployed teachers -- retirements also came into play -- it seems reasonable to speculate that many teachers were left jobless. Without more precise information, this statement rates Half True.","[('\nSan Antonio Mayor Julián Castro, keynote speech at Texas Democratic Party State Convention in Houston, \xa0June 8, 2012\n\nEmail and phone interviews with Christian Archer, political strategist for Julián Castro, June 12-July 6, 2012\n\nNational Public Radio news story, ""Texas schools grapple with big budget cuts,"" December 22, 2011\n\nEmail interview with Claudio Sanchez, National Public Radio education reporter, July 5, 2012\n\nEmail interviews with Clay Robison, Texas State Teachers Association public affairs specialist, June 26-July 2, 2012\n\nMoak, Casey and Associates report, October 29, 2011\n\nEmail and phone interviews with Lynn Moak of Moak, Casey and Associates, June 28-July 2, 2012\n\nEmail and phone interviews with Amanda Brownson of Moak, Casey and Associates, June 29-July 2, 2012\n\nEmail and phone interviews with Texas Education Agency information specialist DeEtta Culbertson, June 26-July 3, 2012\n\nEmail interview with Cindy Clegg, director of HR Services Division at Texas Association of School Boards, June 28-July 2, 2012\n\nNews article in HR Exchange in-house publication of Texas Association of School Boards, ""Teacher retirements up in the midst of budget cuts, new high stakes tests,"" article, May 2012.
