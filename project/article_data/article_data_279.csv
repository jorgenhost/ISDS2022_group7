Gov. Haslam links his jobs plan with state’s improved economic picture
","
Gov. Bill Haslam delivered his second State of the State address last month and he was clearly pleased.  After campaigning for governor in 2009-10 on the need for new jobs, he was able to report after one year in office that job creation is on the rise: ""In 2011, there were more than 28,000 new Tennessee jobs created and over $4 billion in capital investment.  Our Jobs4TN plan is working.""

Jobs4TN is the governor’s economic development plan, unveiled in outline form last April. And 28,000 is a lot of new jobs in a state that had a higher unemployment rate than the national average all of last year. So we checked it out.

For factual claims like this one, PolitiFact treats the claim in two parts: 1) Are the numbers right? 2) Is the job gain caused by the official or their policies?

If Haslam had stopped at his first point – 28,000 new jobs – he’d be on fairly firm ground.  In fact, he could have cited a more impressive statistic: the number of employed Tennesseans jumped by 57,550 from January 2011 through December 2011, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. While those numbers don’t distinguish between a brand ""new"" job and jobs that were lost to the recession but are now returning, the important thing is that the number of people with jobs in Tennessee is up, from 2,782,167 in January 2011 to 2,839,717 in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

Though the governor didn’t say ""I created"" or even ""we created"" those jobs, the mere mention of them in a political speech implies some level of credit taking. And the next sentence he uttered took it even further: ""Our Jobs4TN plan is working.""
  
On the jobs claim, Haslam spokesman David Smith referred us to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development’s (ECD) 2011 annual report that samples nine of the larger job announcements during the year, such as Quaprotek’s Aug. 17 announcement that it would create 126 jobs over five years in Ripley, Tenn. ECD generated a more complete document that details most of 28,535 jobs that it says shows ""an aggregation of jobs created as a direct result of ECD recruitment and expansion projects,"" job creation supported and reported by regional economic development agencies, and jobs created by selected industries reported to ECD in a year-end survey.

But the ECD-generated number includes jobs announced in 2011 that actually will not be filled by newly hired employees until sometimes years late. For example, the list includes the 2,350 jobs at General Motors’ Spring Hill, Tenn., plant even though GM’s own Nov. 21, 2011, press release  announcing the plant’s re-opening has a smaller number. The GM press release says it will add ""594 hourly jobs and 91 salaried positions,"" in the second half of 2012, and that ""timing was not announced (for) an additional 1,090 hourly and 106 salaried positions"" to be added sometime later.

ECD also says only 18,175 of the 28,535 are jobs created as a direct result of ECD recruitment and expansion projects. The rest include ""job creation supported and reported"" by regional economic development agencies and jobs reported to ECD through a year-end survey of select industries.

So, the ""28,000 new jobs"" figure the governor cited from ECD is questionable, but it’s mitigated – in our view – by the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that 57,550 more Tennesseans were working at the end of the year than at the start.

Now for the ""Our Jobs4TN plan is working"" component. We find it's a stretch to credit the job gains to it because the plan is just taking effect.

Jobs4TN is the ""economic development strategy"" for Haslam’s administration to help private businesses create new jobs that the governor and his ECD Commissioner Bill Hagerty unveiled with great fanfare on April 20, 2011. But most of Jobs4TN was not put into place at all until late 2011. The nine ""regional strategic plans"" outlining how ECD’s field staff ""will lead new economic development efforts in their regions"" were announced Dec. 16, for instance. Athough the governor and Hagerty announced on May 5  the creation of ""INCITE,"" a $50 million ""innovation support"" fund as a component of Jobs4TN, the guidelines for the fund were not issued until Dec. 28 and the supporting documents and applications were not released until about three weeks ago.

And although ECD announced a competitive grant program to create nine regional ""business accelerators"" across Tennessee, the grant recipients were not announced until Nov. 3 and there is no word on when they’ll be operating. Finally, the governor and Hagerty released a ""Regulatory Reform Report"" on Jan. 6 of this year.

Another key element of the governor’s jobs strategy, although not technically part of Jobs4TN, is the new law limiting civil liability lawsuits -- the ""Civil Justice Reform Act of 2011"" that he pushed through the legislature last year to create a more business-friendly environment. It did not go into effect until Oct. 1.

Smith, Haslam’s press secretary, said the governor was not trying to claim credit for the jobs. ""When there’s an economic development project, it’s a team effort by the state, the company and local communities that take months to come about. We thought the State of the State address was an opportunity to announce the jobs number that ECD was releasing that same day. There was a full stop between it and the governor’s statement that Jobs4TN is working. There are multiple entities that play a role in Jobs4TN and we think it is working and was working.""

But we think anyone who heard or read the governor's speech would indeed come to the conclusion that by saying ""Our Jobs4TN plan is working,"" he was taking credit for the job gains.

We asked two university economists to assess the governor’s statement and specifically whether he deserves credit for 28,000 new jobs created last year.

Dr. David H. Ciscel, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Memphis, said labor data he tracked through 2011 shows 31,200 more jobs in Tennessee at the end of the year than at the beginning. His email response: ""So both establishment and survey data show a positive story for Tennessee. Can Governor Haslam claim credit? That is a tough question. He is, of course, just puffing. He has little or no power to increase the number of jobs with or without his Job4Tn program. But we usually allow politicians to accept the blame or the honor for what happens when they are in office.""

Dr. Malcolm Getz, associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, was even more blunt. He gave a brief point-by-point analysis of Jobs4TN and concluded: ""None of the initiatives in the governor's Jobs4TN program have yet had time to influence the growth of employment over what it would have been in the absence of the change in policies. Employment is growing nationally and in Tennessee as we regroup after the massive fraud in the financial system. The governor's program may prove beneficial in time but it does not address the causes of the recession -- that's primarily a matter of Federal policy -- and it shouldn't seek credit for the rebound.""

Our ruling

The governor said the state has added 28,000 news jobs thanks to his jobs plan. We find he's right about the gains -- he actually understated the number -- but that it's a big stretch to even imply Jobs4TN should get credit for the increase. Much of that plan took effect late in the year and economists told us the job growth is largely a function of the slow but steady nationwide economic recovery. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/04/bill-haslam/gov-haslam-links-his-jobs-plan-states-improved-eco/

Rhode Island state Sen. Beatrice Lanzi says 1 in 4 young people are victims of dating violence
","
As part of the weekly Rhode Island Public Television show ""A Lively Experiment,"" guests are often asked for their ""outrage of the week.""

On the Feb. 24 program, state Sen. Beatrice Lanzi focused on attitudes toward dating violence and cited reaction to the performance of singer Chris Brown at the 2012 Grammy Awards. In 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to brutally beating his then-girlfriend, Rihanna.

""After he performed, many women across the country took to social media and were making comments about dating violence in a joking way,"" Lanzi said.

We located some of those Tweets. People were sending out messages such as ""I'd let Chris Brown beat me up anytime,"" ""Chris Brown u can punch me in the face any time u want!!!!"" and ""Any girl that hates on Chris Brown is stupid. Do you realize that it would be an honour if he hit you?""

Said Lanzi: ""One out of four of our young people say that they are victims of this violence. To me, it's outrageous.""

One in four is 25 percent. We decided to check to see whether that was on the mark.

When we asked Lanzi for her source, she said she had actually understated the scope of the problem, and it was really one in three, which would be 33 percent.

She referred us to the website of the Lindsay Ann Burke Memorial Fund, based in North Kingstown, R.I., where the Teen Dating Violence Statistics page says ""1 in 3 teens experience some kind of abuse in their romantic relationships.""

The web page doesn't cite a specific reference, but Ann Burke, the organization's president, said it came from a 2001 study in the American Journal of Public Health by Carolyn Tucker Halpern at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It analyzed the responses of 7,267 adolescents who reported being in at least one exclusive heterosexual romantic relationship during the 1994-1995 school year.

""Overall, 32% of respondents reported experiencing any violence in a heterosexual romantic relationship occurring in the 18 months before the interview,"" the researchers reported. ""Most violent behaviors were psychological, with swearing being most common. Twelve percent reported being the victim of physical violence. Approximately 10% of respondents reported having been pushed and 3% reported that something was thrown at them.

""The patterns of victimization indicate that about 1 in 5 adolescents reported only psychological violence and about 1 in 10 reported physical violence, usually accompanied by psychological violence,"" the report said.

Males were just as likely to be victims as females, but the females were more likely to have been injured.

There are a few caveats to the Halpern study. It only looked at heterosexual relationships so the findings do not apply to same-sex relationships or teens who were not dating at the time. In addition, it only asked about violence in the previous 18 months. Lanzi's comment suggest lifetime experience with dating violence. So the percentages would be higher.

But on a key issue -- how many young people had reported physical violence -- the study doesn’t confirm Lanzi’s statement. She said the incidence was 25 percent. The study found it was closer to 12 percent.

We consulted other, more recent, studies with their own strengths and limitations. Sample conclusions:

* 9.8 percent of students nationwide reported dating violence from their boyfriend or girlfriend (being hit, slapped or physically hurt on purpose). It only covered the previous year and didn't include verbal assault. (Results from the national Youth Risk Surveillance System from 2009.)

* Up to 35 percent of adolescent girls were victims of ""interpersonal violence, according to a 2008 report by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency. That summary defines that as ""physical, emotional or verbal abuse by one partner towards another in a dating relationship."" Lanzi didn't say she was only talking about girls, but other surveys show that males experience similar levels of dating violence.

* 13 percent of 638 youth age 13 to 18 who had been in a relationship said in 2005 they had been repeatedly verbally abused, 11 percent said they had been punched, kicked, pushed, slapped or choked at one time, and 5 percent said they had been physically hurt, like a bruise or a punch. (Teenage Research Unlimited for Liz Claiborne)

And when the Rhode Island Department of Health surveyed high school students in 2011, it found that the incidence of dating violence -- defined as having been hit by a boyfriend or girlfriend -- had declined from 14 percent in 2007 to 8 percent in 2011. But those rates are only for the previous year, not whether they had ever been hit by a partner.

Our ruling

Beatrice Lanzi said ""one out of four of our young people say they are victims"" of dating violence, following a reference to singer Chris Brown, known for physically assaulting his once-girlfriend, Rihanna.

The studies we found, however, show that the risk of such physical attacks for teens isn't close to 1 in 4; it's more like 1 in 10.

As with most social science research, the numbers can vary depending, for example, on how broadly dating violence is defined and the timeframe examined.

A teen who is asked whether he or she has ever experienced dating violence may answer ""no,"" but then respond with a ""yes"" if asked if she has ever been pushed in anger by a boyfriend or girlfriend.

What is clear is that to get to the types of numbers Lanzi is talking about, one must include all kinds of aggression, from physical attack to swearing at someone. In fact, when we talked to her, that was how she defined dating violence.

No matter what the definition, all relationship abuse is reprehensible. But because Lanzi’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we rule it Half True.

Santorum attack on Obama off the mark
","
If President Barack Obama has his way, it won’t pay for some to give anymore.

Well, that’s the message Republican presidential contender Rick Santorum told an audience of about 3,000 people at a recent campaign stop in Georgia.

Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, accused the president of attacking religious freedom in a political speech at the First Redeemer Church in Forsyth County. For the record, the church’s pastor has not endorsed a candidate in the race and said he’s invited every candidate, including Obama, to speak at his church.

About 45 minutes into his remarks, Santorum made this statement: ""Now we have an administration that’s trying to wipe the decks. Yes, remember, the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers to cripple further these … churches and nonprofits.""

Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Jim Galloway reported the remarks in his Political Insider blog. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about this line about Obama’s proposal to eliminate charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers.

Obama has consistently proposed changes in charitable deductions that some religious organizations and nonprofit groups say would reduce giving by the rich. The White House counters that his ideas would result in ""modest"" changes, while others say the wealthy will still give.

The president has proposed in his budget for fiscal year 2013 a reduction -- but not eliminating deductions for individuals making more than $200,000 a year or families reporting income greater than $250,000. The fiscal year will begins Oct. 1 and end Sept. 30, 2013.

The proposal is similar to other plans Obama has put forward since taking office in 2009, experts on the matter told PolitiFact Georgia. The president has talked about reducing the deduction for the wealthiest income earners from 35 percent to 28 percent. None could recall an outright proposal to completely eliminate the deductions for higher-income Americans.

""It’s limiting, not eliminating,"" Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said of the Obama plan.

Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said he was not aware of any effort by the Obama White House to eliminate charitable deductions for the highest income earners. He wondered whether Santorum was referring to the Pease Limitation, which reduces most itemized deductions by a complicated formula (we’re talking about the government here) that involves an individual’s adjusted gross income. But the Pease Limitation would not completely eliminate deductions for the wealthy.

Williams suggested Santorum may have slipped up in this part of his speech to the Forsyth County audience.

""It could be a loose statement,"" Williams said, being charitable.

The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional committee, said in a report last year that charitable deductions cost the federal government $30 billion to $40 billion a year.    

PolitiFact Georgia filled out a form on Santorum’s campaign website with questions about this statement, but it didn’t get a reply. We also called the Santorum campaign, which cheerfully asked us to send an email to a campaign spokesman. We emailed the spokesman twice but didn’t get a reply.

Santorum’s statement seems off base from anything we’ve seen or read.

The Obama administration has talked repeatedly about reducing charitable deductions, not eliminating them. We rate Santorum’s claim as False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/03/rick-santorum/santorum-attack-obama-mark/

Do most child abuse reports come from people required to report?
","
While the 2012 Legislature has been hung up on some issues, lawmakers approved a law that expanded the sorts of professionals required to report child abuse and neglect.

The legislation came in response to the recent scandal at Penn State University. There, former assistant Coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with more than 40 counts of child sex abuse involving multiple boys over a 15-year period. Longtime coach Joe Paterno, who had supervised him, was fired.

Before the bill passed, a long list of professionals were required to report abuse, but employees of higher education institutions and organized youth activities were not.

During the Senate debate on the legislation, Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, a Gresham Democrat, spoke briefly in favor of the mandatory reporter expansion.

""It really will help all adults recognize their responsibility to protect our kids,"" she told her colleagues. ""In 2010, about 75 percent of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by those required to report by law. It is clear, very clear, that mandatory reporting is a very important tool to keep our kids safe.""

We thought a quick check on her 75 percent figure would be interesting.

As always, we started with the speaker and gave Monnes Anderson’s office a call. Molly Woon, a spokeswoman for the Senate Democrats, pointed us to the 2010 Child Welfare Data Book published by the Oregon Department of Human Services.

According to the report, which was released last March, 74.4 percent of the abuse and neglect cases were reported by school and medical officials, police, clergy, child-care providers, court and mental health personnel and therapists -- all of whom are required to report.  

The other 25 percent of reports came from the abusers themselves, parents or, according to department spokesman Gene Evans, victims, relatives, friends, neighbors, ex-live-ins, ex-spouses and anonymous reporters.

The figures make this claim an easy one to rule on. Monnes Anderson said 75 percent of the abuse and neglect reports the state collected in 2010 came from mandatory reporters. The Department of Human Services backs her up. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/02/laurie-monnes-anderson/do-most-child-abuse-reports-come-people-required-r/

On March 1, 2012, Comedy Central’s Stephen Colbert moved in on Florida’s controversial new election law for a recurring segment, ""People Who Are Destroying America."" The target: a Panhandle teacher named Dawn Quarles, who turned in 76 voter registration forms from her students beyond the state’s new 48-hour deadline. She could face a $1,000 fine. 
  
One of the people Colbert interviewed for his sarcastic report is Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Florida officials claimed they needed to pass the law to prevent voter fraud, but these cases are actually pretty rare, he said. 
  
""There are probably a larger number of shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud,"" he said. 
  
We couldn’t resist diving in: Are there more shark attacks than cases of voter fraud in Florida? 
  
We compiled this chart using data from the Florida Department of State, which monitors elections, and the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, which has a renowned ichthyology department. (Ichthyology  is the study of fish.) 
  
The shark attack figures include documented instances of sharks attacking human victims. The voter fraud cases indicate the number of cases deemed legally sufficient for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

If we were considering 2011 alone, when voter fraud cases exceeded shark attacks, this could have been ruled False. But spreading our data out over four years shows shark attacks happen more frequently than voter fraud cases. 
  
Florida regularly leads the country in unprovoked shark attacks. In 2011, Florida’s 11 attacks comprised 38 percent of the nation’s total and 15 percent of the world’s attacks. Volusia County, home to the spring-break mecca of Daytona Beach, had the most attacks (six). 
  
While the shark attack figures are cut and dry (sorry!), the voter fraud numbers are not. There could be more cases than we know about, involving more people. The numbers may not represent total voter fraud cases, as those could be handled by local supervisors and state attorneys. 
  
Also, one ""case"" may represent multiple counts of voter fraud, perpetrated by multiple people, said agency spokesman Chris Cate. He points to a November 2011 case that resulted in the arrests of nine people from the North Florida town of Madison, including the supervisor of elections. 
  
On the other hand, the fraud list does not count only convictions. So some of these cases could be proven unfounded. 
  
The ACLU’s claim is true on its face, but we’re knocking it down a peg with consideration of a few things. One, the state’s count doesn’t represent a complete set of possible fraud being prosecuted in the state. Two, a ""case"" does not always include just one instance of fraud. 
  
Using the Madison case as an example, we know nine people were arrested in just one case.

Ad accuses Mitt Romney of leaving 'Massachusetts $1 billion dollars in debt'
","
An ad sponsored by the Red White and Blue Fund -- a pro-Rick Santorum super PAC -- attacks former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over his record of fiscal stewardship while in office.

The ad says that Romney ""left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt.""

We decided to see if that was accurate.

In the ad, the Red White and Blue Fund cites three articles that were included in an opposition-research document attributed to the campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who faced Romney in the Republican presidential primary four years earlier.

One of the articles ran in the Boston Globe on Dec. 30, 2006, during the transition period between the governorships of Romney, who didn’t seek reelection, and his successor, Democrat Deval Patrick.

The Globe reported that aides to Patrick said the state ""is facing a deficit that could reach $1 billion next year, a looming budget gap that observers say could force Patrick to scale back his ambitious agenda, slash spending, or raise taxes.""

The Globe reported that in a Nov. 27, 2006, briefing to Patrick, Romney aides projected a budget deficit of between $400 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2008, which was to begin in July 2007, six months into Patrick’s term. The total state budget at the time was $26 billion.

So the ad has some justification for using the $1 billion figure. But based on our discussions with budget experts in the state, we find the ad ignores important details:

• The number in question was a projection of a possible future budget deficit. It was an estimate, based on a snapshot of economic data, of what might happen, and it was offered to allow Patrick to figure out how to balance the budget for a fiscal year beginning more than six months later. It was not a final scorecard on Romney’s time as governor. 
In fact, about a month after the private briefing, Romney issued an updated projection that was more optimistic, based on healthier revenue projections. In the Globe article, aides to Patrick accused Romney of offering the public sunnier projections in public than they gave in private. But it eventually became clear that the revenue picture was indeed improving -- enough to allow Patrick to restore $383.6 million in emergency budget cuts Romney had made a month earlier.

""The revenue did come in a bit better than planned, and ultimately Patrick presented a balanced budget,"" said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent budget think tank. Widmer informally advised Patrick’s transition team. ""There was a tight budget, and it couldn’t fund some of the increases Patrick had proposed in the campaign, but it didn’t result in major cuts, either.""

• The ad’s use of the term ""debt"" is inaccurate. The figure cited in the 2006 briefing referred to a projected shortfall for one fiscal year. ""Debt"" in the budgetary context refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. And this wasn't even a deficit -- it was a projected shortfall that state officials had to address in order to balance the budget. 
• Using the $1 billion figure means taking the high end of a range that begins at $400 million.

• Massachusetts, like most states, has a requirement that the governor must submit, and the Legislature must pass, a balanced budget. So contrary to the ad’s suggestion, there was never an official deficit, much less one 10 digits in scope.

And even if there had been a deficit that big, Romney wouldn’t get full blame.

""The final budget document is the creation of the Massachusetts Legislature, which now has and did have a veto-proof Democratic majority during Romney’s reign,"" said Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program. ""Governors submit the first budget draft, which then goes through major changes in the Legislature. It is disingenuous for any governor to take the credit or blame for the final budget.""

Our ruling

The ad says Romney ""left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt."" 
That is inaccurate or misleading in several ways. The Red, White and Blue fund cherry-picks the highest number from a range of estimates. Also, it was not a ""debt.""  It was just one projected shortfall for the upcoming year -- and one that ultimately didn't materialize. 
Like most states, Massachusetts must have a balanced budget every year. And in keeping with that requirement, Patrick, the incoming governor, submitted a balanced budget within a few months.

Pro-Santorum super PAC ad says Gingrich supported individual mandates
","
The Red, White and Blue Fund, a super PAC supporting Rick Santorum, released a TV ad in Super Tuesday primary states charging that Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are just like President Barack Obama on many core issues.

Among them: ""Like Obama, Gingrich supported individual insurance mandates.""

This attack has been leveled at Gingrich before, and we’ve found it is correct.

His comments on the subject

In 1993, when the Clinton administration was trying to pass health care reform, Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press and addressed the individual mandate.
   
""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance.""
   
He went on to criticize Clinton’s plan as ""destructively big-government."" But he also said, ""I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that.""

More recently, Gingrich joined a health care discussion with none other than Hillary Clinton in 2005 and said people should have to buy insurance or post a bond to pay for future care.
   
Quick comparison: An individual mandate requires people to buy insurance or pay a tax penalty. The bond idea also requires people to buy insurance, and if they don’t, to put up money to be set aside to pay for their future medical care.
   
Gingrich repeated his support for a bond in a 2007 column for his think tank Health Transformation.

""In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond,"" he wrote
   
He advocated it again in his 2009 book Real Change: the Fight for America’s Future: ""Those who oppose the concept of insurance should be forced to post a bond to cover costs. Allowing individuals to pass their health costs on to others reinforces the attitude that their health is not their problem and adds to the irresponsible, unhealthy behaviors that bankrupt the current system.""  

This story in The Atlantic magazine reveals audio from a conference call Gingrich participated in that was hosted by Siemens Healthcare months after Obama's inauguration.

""We believe that there should be ‘must carry’ -- that is, everybody should either have health insurance, or if you’re an absolute libertarian we would allow you to post a bond. But we would not allow people to be free riders failing to insure themselves and then showing up at the emergency room with no means of payment,"" Gingrich said.
   
Finally, in May of 2011, while a candidate for president, he appeared on Meet the Press and called this concept ""a variation"" on the individual mandate.
   
""Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care. And, I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond … or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable,"" he said.
   
(That remark kicked up so much controversy in Republican circles that Gingrich released a video statement the next day clarifying that he is ""completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional."")
       
The bond option, we learned, has been kicked around for a while.
   
""A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in (Mitt) Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable.""

Our ruling

Red, White and Blue Fund’s ad says ""Gingrich supported individual health insurance mandates.""

When we rated this before, we gave a Mostly True to Santorum's claim that ""Speaker Gingrich for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate"" because it was true for 20 years but Gingrich is now opposed. The wording is different for this one. The ad doesn’t put a timeframe on when he supported the policy, nor does it portray that as being his position now. As stated, it’s accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/02/red-white-and-blue-fund/pro-santorum-super-pac-ad-says-gingrich-supported-/

DNC ad says that 'under President Obama, U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high
","
To defend President Barack Obama against Republican charges that he’s been a shaky ally of Israel -- and to lay the groundwork for a presidential speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in early March -- the Democratic National Committee released a Web advertisement on Feb. 29, 2012.

Among the claims in the ad is this one: ""Under President Obama, U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high.""

As we do with claims like this, we are splitting our analysis into two parts. Are the numbers right? And is it fair to credit Obama?

First, the numbers.

In its budget request for fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration requested $3.1 billion (the same amount cited in the ad) for foreign military financing for Israel. That’s higher than the $3.08 billion spent in fiscal 2012 and the $2.99 billion in fiscal 2011.

It’s also higher than most -- though not all -- prior years, according to the Congressional Research Service. In 2000, military funding to Israel was slightly higher, at $3.12 billion.

Meanwhile, if you take inflation into account, two years would surpass 2013. In 2000, the inflation-adjusted amount would be $4.11 billion, and in 2003, the inflation-adjusted amount would be $3.80 billion.

What about Obama’s right to crow about it?

The amount of military funding for Israel was set in August 2007 when the Bush administration signed a memorandum of understanding that created a funding framework for the next 10 years. This agreement was negotiated and signed by the administration of George W. Bush.

It’s true that the Obama administration didn’t renege on the agreement, which it theoretically could have done, perhaps by citing severe constraints in the federal budget.

And more broadly, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates testified to the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee on March 2, 2011, that ""in terms of concrete steps to improve the security relationship between (the U.S. and Israel), more has been done in the last two years than in any comparable period in my entire career."" Gates has served in several administrations, both Republican and Democratic.

Still, it’s an overreach for the DNC to give Obama credit for a number that was essentially set a year and a half before he took the oath of office.

Our ruling

The ad says ""U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high."" Actually, it was higher in one or two years, depending whether you use inflation-adjusted dollars. In addition, the ad oversells the credit Obama can take for this year’s number. The amount was outlined by a memorandum signed in 2007 under President George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/02/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-under-president-obama-us-security-fund/

Rick Scott says some Floridians pay $1,500 for PIP premiums
","
Gov. Rick Scott says abuse of Florida’s auto insurance law is forcing drivers to pay more for their car insurance. 
He’s made reforming the law, also known as personal injury protection, or PIP, his second-highest priority this legislative session. He appealed to people’s purse strings in a recent interview with WTSP Tampa Bay. 
""It impacts the poorest families in our community the most. In some communities, for $10,000 worth of coverage it’s $1,500 a year,"" Scott said. ""It’s just money out of families’ pockets that they could put into education, food, shelter."" 
If Scott’s right, that’s a steep annual fee for not much protection. We wanted to know if it’s true, and for whom. 
A primer on PIP before we get rolling: The requirement is meant to guarantee treatment from injuries sustained during auto accidents, regardless of who is at fault. Over recent years, officials say, the system has been abused by people staging car accidents to collect money for treatment they do not need. 
We previously checked a claim from Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater that Florida is the No. 1 state in the country for staged car accidents. We rated that Mostly True. 
For this fact-check, we asked an array of people interested in the PIP fight if Scott’s figures are right. State officials and insurance industry representatives pointed us to a report from Florida’s PIP Working Group, coordinated by the state’s insurance consumer advocate at the request of her boss, Atwater. 
The 65-page report bills the information in its PIP review as the ""most reliable and current insurance and claims data available."" It offers average PIP premiums from two insurance companies for different kinds of motorists with mostly clean driving histories. It focuses on three cities with high allegations of PIP fraud: Tampa, Orlando, Hialeah. 
The working group only examined premiums from State Farm, which insures one in five vehicles in Florida, and Direct General, a ""non-standard"" company that typically takes on high-risk motorists. 
The other major state insurers -- Geico, Allstate and Progressive -- are not included. 
The report shows instances of high PIP premiums that match Scott’s estimate. For instance, a young Hialeah professional with State Farm and one minor violation and one not-at-fault accident paid $1,765 for PIP coverage in 2011. In Tampa, the premium for the same person was $1,077. According to the same report, an average family with teen drivers and two vehicles purchasing Direct General insurance would pay $1,571. 
The cost is even higher in some cases, escalating more than $800 over three years. In Hialeah, the average family with teen drivers and two vehicles and no accidents or violations on State Farm paid $2,450 in 2008 and $3,270 in 2011. 
We asked the state how many drivers might be included in each of these categories -- since the report targets specific insurance companies, specific cities and specific types of drivers --  but we did not receive an answer by our deadline. 
So while we do not know the sample size of the data, we do know that $10,000 worth of PIP coverage in Florida can cost $1,500 or more each year. 
But Scott made a broader claim in his WTSP interview  -- that the cost of coverage is dependent on your community, not necessarily your personal situation, your insurance carrier or how large your deductible is. 
The information to substantiate that claim is much more difficult to pinpoint -- largely because insurance coverage is tailored to individual situations. 
We found a wealth of information on PIP premiums across the state from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. We received several spreadsheets from the office detailing average PIP premiums in 2010 from Florida’s top five insurers. 
The numbers are required of insurance companies when they file for rate requests, which has been pretty often lately. They’re broken down for different types of drivers by coverage areas. 
Our takeaway: There are plenty of good drivers who don’t pay nearly $1,500 a year. 
Through Geico, a Hialeah retiree with a clean driving history would pay $450 a year for $10,000 in coverage. 
A married, middle-aged couple who share two vehicles with their adult children and have a clean driving record would pay $406 a year in Central Orlando through Geico, anywhere from $327 to $860 a year in Hialeah and $253 a year in St. Petersburg. 
In rural cities and counties, the family would pay even less: Ocala, $179; Central Jacksonville, $193; Northeast Florida counties, $153; Panhandle counties, $128. 
With so much variance between drivers, driving histories, plans and location, pulling an average statewide PIP premium from this data wouldn’t be wise-- even if it was easily available. 
We requested a median premium but did not hear back from the Office of Insurance Regulation by our deadline. 
But consider this: In 2011, Insure.com determined Florida’s overall auto insurance premium costs were $1,476, below the national average ($1,561). Another measure used by the Insurance Information Institute found Florida’s average car insurance expenditure to be $1,006 (based on 2009 statistics). PIP is just one part of your car insurance bill. 
Our ruling 
Scott said, ""In some communities, for $10,000 worth of coverage it’s $1,500 a year."" 
A state report shows that in some instances, drivers pay $1,500 a year -- or even more -- for $10,000 worth of coverage. The report also makes clear that the instances of high premiums are in places where fraud allegations are highest.  
Still, those high premiums also depend on individual circumstances. People in Hialeah could pay $1,500 or more for coverage. But people also could pay less. What you pay depends on how many cars you own and what kind of driver you are. It doesn't depend solely on which community you live in. 
  
With that clarification in mind, we rate Scott's statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2012/mar/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-floridians-pay-1500-pip-premium/

Lee Leffingwell lists as accomplishment ""invested $90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes""
","
Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, seeking re-election in May, invited residents to the grand opening of his campaign headquarters in a mailer touting accomplishments such as luring jobs to Austin -- and investing ""$90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes.""

We were curious about Leffingwell’s proclaimed investment in ""traffic fixes.""

His campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said Leffingwell’s declaration reflected voter approval in November 2010 of Proposition 1, authorizing $90 million in bonds to be issued to pay for Austin road, sidewalk, trail and bikeway projects.

Let’s briefly check the tax part of the claim and then turn to accounting for ""traffic fixes.""

Littlefield told us the approved bonds aren’t expected to require higher taxes because future city revenues for debt are projected to cover their costs. In a telephone interview, Greg Canally, the city’s deputy chief financial officer, confirmed the costs will be covered without changing the city’s debt tax rate of a little under 13 cents per $100 valuation. ""Anything above (the approved) $90 million, we would have had to look at a tax rate increase,"" Canally said.

A sampling of the bond amounts and 30 or so projects that voters approved:

-- $1 million for new Wild Horse Street in far northeast Austin;
-- $2 million for Slaughter Lane extension;
-- $2.3 million to reconfigure the Interstate 35/East 51st Street interchange;
-- $2.7 million for Waller Creek trail improvements;
-- $4.4 million for sidewalks, neighborhood matching funds;
-- $10 million for Americans with Disabilities Act sidewalk improvements;
-- $14.4 million to build a boardwalk as part of the Lady Bird Lake hike-and-bike trail.

And each of the projects is a ""traffic fix,"" as Leffingwell says?

Well, not all the projects would improve or build roads. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story published Oct. 24, 2010, before the election, 57 percent of the proposed spending was described as going to road work with 43 percent identified as backing projects related to alternative forms of transportation such as biking and walking. That story quotes Leffingwell as saying: ""We have to start thinking about transportation as a system, a system that's connected, compatible, complementary. We can't think strictly in terms of 'We need more roads.'""

Even that split was in question, the Statesman said in the story. The 57 percent statistic touted by proposition supporters, the story said, counted one project that could increase congestion on a downtown street. This item reflected $8 million penciled in to make over seven blocks of Third Street by converting three existing one-way lanes with parallel parking often on both sides into two one-way lanes with sidewalks nearly doubled in width, plus bike lanes as part of the Lance Armstrong Bikeway. ""One less lane for cars, in other words,"" the story said, ""and perhaps fewer parking spaces.""

The story said too that the 57 percent calculation folded in $2.7 million in the bond proposal for ""traffic calming"" -- which slows down cars -- and spending to put in place ""quiet zones"" at railway crossings so trains don't have to blow their horns.

At least $38.7 million of the $90 million was to go to sidewalks, bike lanes and other projects for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists, the story said. ""That's in contrast with transportation lists put before voters between 1992 and 2006,"" the story continued. ""Under those proposals, all approved by voters, the city spent between 87 percent and 100 percent on road projects.""

Asked if the 57 percent of city-identified road projects adds up to Leffingwell’s touted ""traffic fixes,"" Leffingwell’s consultant, Littlefield, replied by email: ""We can fix traffic two ways, right?  We can build more lanes or we can get people out of their cars. I think that was the best part about Prop 1 — it attempted to rethink traffic solutions.""

In a telephone interview, Leffingwell agreed he did not personally invest $90 million in traffic fixes. His mailer was vague on this, listing among his accomplishments: ""Invested $90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes.""

Leffingwell told us: ""Obviously, it was ultimately the voters that invested $90 million,"" though he pointed out that he led the group that advocated for voter approval after encouraging the Austin City Council to put the proposed bonds on the ballot.

""I’m contending the whole thing is traffic fixes,"" all $90 million worth, Leffingwell said. ""A traffic fix is something that in some way or another makes mobility better than it was before.""

Leffingwell said his Webster’s dictionary defines traffic as the ""movement of vehicles and pedestrians."" Merriam-Webster.com includes this definition of traffic: ""the movement (as of vehicles or pedestrians) through an area or along a route,"" though the entry also includes this definition: ""congestion of vehicles,"" as in ""stuck in traffic.""

And who in fast-growing Austin hasn’t been stuck in traffic?

According to research by the Texas Transportation Institute, based at Texas A&M University, Austin and Orlando in 2010 ranked fourth among 32 large urban areas for annual hours of delay in traffic per auto commuter, at 38. A footnote says this figure reflects extra travel time in an area during the year divided by the number of people who commute in private vehicles.

In another institute comparison of the situation in similarly sized areas, Austin ranked No. 1 for its 2010 travel time index of 1.28, meaning the ratio of travel time in the peak period to the travel time at free-flow conditions. A footnote says a value of 1.30 indicates a 20-minute free-flow trip takes 26 minutes in the peak period.

We asked Leffingwell if each of the projects referenced in his claim was expected to relieve car traffic congestion. For non-road projects such as bike paths and sidewalks, he said: ""It’s intuitive; if people have other options for mobility, then that impacts (car) traffic to some degree.""

And so how much is each of the projects expected to relieve vehicular congestion?

""I don’t think anybody has that number,"" Leffingwell said. If not, then how does the city know each  project would do so? Leffingwell said he’d have to check with city staff.

On our own, we asked the city for information on the impact on vehicular traffic congestion of each of the voter-approved projects.

One of 11 factors that helped determine which projects were put on the ballot was tied to the ""person capacity added"" by each project. We learned, though, of no direct assessments of the effect of each project on vehicular traffic congestion.

For outside-of-Austin perspective on ""traffic fixes,"" we turned to Tim Lomax, a senior engineer at the transportation institute, who told us in a telephone interview that depending on circumstances including location, a bikeway or sidewalk project can be counted on to alleviate car congestion. ""It all comes down to the people who might use that sidewalk,"" Lomax said. ""What are they doing now? Does the sidewalk (or other project) offer what people will choose?"" In Texas, he noted, brutal summer heat sways many residents to avoid walks.

Lomax said he and other engineers would accept ""traffic fixes"" as a term that encompasses road and other types of mobility projects — which would be in alignment with Leffingwell’s interpretation. But, Lomax said, ""most of my non-Ph.D. traffic-engineer friends would think of (a traffic fix) as a road project.""

Our ruling

We see the hope that every one of the $90 million in voter-approved projects will, one way or another, prove a ""traffic fix."" That’s almost surely correct by the broad definition of traffic touted by Leffingwell.

But it’s also reasonable to assume that ""traffic fix"" refers to cars and trucks on roads -- and less than 60 percent of the mayor’s cited ""fixes"" would improve or build roads.

Finally, Leffingwell’s mailer can be read as his claiming all credit for the $90 million in projects, when that credit should be spread among many parties including city staff members, City Council members and, especially, voters who supported the 2010 proposition.

Obama says he supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades
","
Countering Republican attacks on gas prices, President Barack Obama gave a hard-hitting speech on energy policy in Miami on Feb. 23, 2012. In his speech, Obama laid out a defense of his oil-related policies and reiterated his commitment to diverse energy sources.

One of his speech’s shortest lines caught our attention: ""We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades.""

Thirty years -- really? And why has it been so long? To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to check it out. (We fact-checked Obama’s claims about drilling in a separate report.)

If you haven’t been keeping tabs on the nuclear energy industry, it has indeed been awhile since a new reactor was built. But Obama’s 30-year claim hinges on licensing.

On Feb. 9, 2012, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license for two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. The electricity giant Southern Co. intends to build them at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. (The White House pointed us to news coverage of the approval when we asked for evidence of Obama’s statement.)

Prior to this year, the last time the commission granted a license to build a new reactor was in 1978, which was 34 years ago, according to a commission spokesperson. The permit was for the Shearon Harris plant operated by Carolina Power & Light near Raleigh, N.C. But it takes a long time to build nuclear reactors, so the plant didn’t get operational approval until 1986.

And the North Carolina plant isn’t the most recent to go operational. That distinction goes to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar site in Tennessee. It received a construction license in 1973 and an operating license in 1996, or 16 years ago.

Still, as we ran this claim by people who watch the nuclear industry closely -- both those opposed to nuclear energy and those in favor of it -- they agreed Obama’s claim to have ""supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades"" was largely accurate.

A technical note: The Georgia project adds two reactors to an existing electricity generation site with two existing reactors. We wondered if that diminished the accuracy of Obama’s statement, but the experts said it’s fair to call each reactor its own ""power plant.""

Nuclear’s long wait

So why has it been so long since a license was granted?

Interestingly, the experts we spoke with said it’s not because of bureaucratic hassles or super-stringent rules. Rather, it’s because building new plants is expensive, and the dynamics of the energy market haven’t made new reactors a good deal for energy producers.

The Nuclear Information and Resource Service opposes nuclear energy as ""dangerous, dirty and expensive,"" said executive director Michael Mariotte. It’s the expensive part that’s made for the long wait, he said.

Energy companies have struggled to build plants in a cost-efficient manner, and the Georgia plants are a long way from being finished, he said. The Southern Co. is trying to construct two reactors at once, which makes for more operational complexity.

""If history repeats itself, then they won’t get built. We’ll have to see how much the industry has learned in the past three decades in terms of managing construction costs,"" he said.

His group is part of a lawsuit to stop the construction, on the grounds that the reactor designs need to be updated with lessons learned from the recent nuclear disaster near Fukushima, Japan. (The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license on a 4-1 vote; the dissenting vote was cast for that reason.)

A sunnier take on the three-decade wait is that the nuclear industry has been really good at innovating and getting more electricity out of its existing plants. That’s what Steve Kerekes of the pro-nuclear Nuclear Energy Institute told us.

""From essentially a static number of facilities -- a little over 100 --we’ve increased our electricity output roughly 40 percent. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 new reactors since 1990, and we’ve done that from existing facilities,"" he said.

Nuclear executives say they would build more plants if the current energy markets were different. The Georgia plant is going forward in a state where regulations allow utilities to bill customers for construction costs before the plant is finished.

By way of contrast, the Illinois-based nuclear energy company Exelon operates in many states where that’s not the case. Exelon executives have said plainly it makes little economic sense for them to build new plants, citing two more factors. First, natural gas prices are very low. Second, Congress has abandoned plans to address global warming through a cap-and-trade system or other attempts to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired electricity generation. Both those things work against the business case for building new reactors. (Exelon executives, by the way, donated to Obama’s 2008 campaign, as we noted in this fact-check.)

The administration’s support

Obama said in his speech that his administration ""supported"" the new nuclear plants. Again, experts agreed this was so, particularly since the administration is in final negotiations to support the Southern Co.’s construction with $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees.

Back in February 2010, when the project received conditional approval, Obama himself praised the deal, connecting it to the need for climate change legislation.

""To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to increase our supply of nuclear power, and today’s announcement helps to move us down that path,"" he said.

Our ruling

Obama said, ""We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades."" He is right that it’s been that long since a new nuclear reactor has been licensed. However, because it takes so long to construct nuclear power plants, the most recent plant actually opened in 1996.

The experts we spoke with, both those who support nuclear power and those who oppose it, said that Obama’s statement was largely accurate, given that the last time a nuclear reactor received federal approval was 1978. And, his administration has so far supported the recent approval of new reactors in Georgia with $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees.

Milwaukee Brewers pitcher John Axford says even babies need a passport to enter the U.S. by air
","
For the third year in a row, the Milwaukee Brewers’ lights-out closer John Axford faced a challenge when it came to getting to spring training on time.

In 2010, it was an auto accident; in 2011 a case of food poisoning. This season it was red tape involving his 8-month-old son, J.B., also known to Axford’s Twitter followers as ""Little Ax."" The boy was born in Milwaukee, and is a U.S. citizen.

The elder Axford, however, is a Canadian. And his trip to Arizona was delayed because he didn’t have a passport for the baby when he was planning to fly from Canada into the United States.

His Twitter followers (@JohnAxford) got a play-by-play of his travel travails.

Among the offerings: ""Thank you Homeland Security for not letting my AMERICAN son into AMERICA! #3YearValentinesCurse #WontBeSeeingYouTodayWarmWeatherInPhoenix""

He was more expansive in an interview with the Journal Sentinel, which is what prompted us to turn our version of the radar gun -- the Truth-O-Meter -- on Axford.

""Homeland Security requires passports for every age, no matter what,"" Axford said in the interview. ""You can arrive by land or sea if you're under the age of 15 with a birth certificate, but if you go by air Homeland Security requires passports for everybody, no matter what the age.""

Is he right?

Passports only by air, though birth certificates suffice by car or boat?

Now, it’s true Axford is a sports figure. But his statement touches squarely on U.S. policy. So we checked with the State Department, Homeland Security, border control and several federal government websites.

Turns out the rules are different for border-crossing babies, depending on the mode of travel.

If you’re traveling by air, you need a passport. Period.  

And, yes, you have to get a photograph of the kid.

A kid passport costs $105. However, if you’re coming by land -- such as the border crossing in Detroit -- the rules are less strict, and less expensive.

""U.S. children ages 15 and under arriving by land or sea from a contiguous territory may present an original or copy of his or her birth certificate (issued by the Vital Records Department in the state where he or she was born), a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or a Naturalization Certificate.  If the child is a newborn and the actual birth certificate has not arrived from the Vital Records Department, we will accept a Hospital issued birth certificate.""

Each year, the federal government issues about 450,000 passports to infants, a spokeswoman for the State Department said in an email. The department even provides helpful hints for how to take a passport picture of your little one.

Kiddie passports are valid for five years.

In the end, Axford got to spring training the hard way, again. His father drove the family across the border to Detroit and they caught a flight from there to Arizona.

Our conclusion

Axford’s trip back to the mound took a detour. He said it was because of travel delays and said federal law required his baby to have a passport to fly back into the country. He learned a valuable lesson about border crossing: The feds are always right.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says that Rhode Island has the second-most heavily deployed National Guard in the nation.
","
On Feb. 24 at Quonset State Airport, in a scene that has played out time and again over the last decade, members of the Rhode Island National Guard were given a send-off before being deployed to active duty.

Public officials paid tribute to the eight members of an Army National Guard unit leaving that day for Kuwait. Among the officials was U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who praised the soldiers  for ""serving with great distinction"" and then shared a fact about the Rhode Island National Guard.

Despite hailing from the smallest state in the nation, he said, ""they are the second most heavily deployed National Guard in the United States.""

We have heard this claim made before about the Rhode Island National Guard -- in Journal stories and in speeches by state officials -- and decided to find out whether it’s really true.

To be clear, although he didn’t say it at the ceremony at Quonset, Whitehouse was referring to per-capita deployments. That phrase -- per-capita deployments -- is what he used in a speech on the Senate floor in November, and it is the same language used by other public officials, including former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy.

Whitehouse’s office told us they got the information on deployments from the Rhode Island National Guard and directed us to a letter to the editor published Dec. 15 in The Bristol Phoenix to mark the 375th anniversary of the National Guard.

""Rhode Island, with slightly more than 3,200 National Guard members, has the nation’s second highest per-capita deployment rate as we have answered the call to more than 5,600 deployment requests,"" Maj. Gen. Kevin R. McBride, adjutant general of the Rhode Island National Guard, wrote in the letter.

Lt. Col. Denis J. Riel, spokesman for the Rhode Island National Guard, told us the information came from a Department of Defense document that looked at per-capita deployments for each of the nation’s 50 states and 4 territories. Specifically, the analysis, which Riel said was released before 2010, divided the number of deployments for each state or territory by its number of Guard personnel.

Riel tried to track down a copy of the document for us, but couldn’t find it.

""I can assure you that the Senator has heard us repeat this fact multiple times and we were likely the source of it,"" he said in an email.

We called the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Va.,  and asked whether it or another branch of the Department of Defense had indeed done a state-by-state analysis of deployment rates.

While we waited for a response, we tracked down a per-capita analysis of Army National Guard deployments done in 2007 by the National Journal, a nonpartisan magazine on politics. (Air National Guard troops were not included because they typically deploy for short periods instead of the 12-month or longer deployments normal for the Army Guard, according to a story that explained the analysis.)

The analysis used National Guard data to look at overseas deployments from Sept. 11, 2001, onward. It took into account multiple deployments by any individual service member -- if a soldier was deployed twice, he or she was counted twice.

Hawaii topped the list with 976 deployments for every 1,000 soldiers in its Army National Guard. Rhode Island came in second with 883 deployments per 1,000, followed by South Dakota, Maine and Washington state.

According to the magazine, the 350,000-member Army National Guard had deployed soldiers a total of approximately 190,000 times nationwide, for a national average of about 550 deployments per 1,000 soldiers. 

Populous states, such as Texas or California, were far down the list of deployments per capita, while smaller states were generally near the top.

The reason for the high rates of deployments in some states and not others had to do with the types of units in each state.

""National Guard forces in different states have different kinds of units,"" the National Journal’s story says. ""Some states have more infantry brigades or military police; others have more artillery or tank units. ... Historical accident, local tradition, and varying levels of education among a state's population also factor into the mix. Some kinds of units are in high demand for Iraq and Afghanistan; other types are called up much less frequently.""

Hawaii had a high rate because it has a concentration of combat arms units. South Dakota’s rate was also high because it has engineers, artillery soldiers and transportation units, all of which were heavily needed in Iraq.

And what about Rhode Island and its 3,200 Guard members?

""... our force structure here in [Rhode Island] is unique in that we have what are commonly known as combat support units which are typically called into the fight with direct combat units,"" Riel, the Rhode Island National Guard spokesman, said in an email. ""These are Field Artillery, Military Police, Combat Engineers, General Purpose helicopters, and on the Air Guard side, Tactical airlift and combat communications units.""

According to Riel, more Rhode Island Guard members have been deployed since 9/11 than any other individual conflict since the Civil War. Seven Rhode Island Army National Guard units, totaling 540 soldiers, are currently deployed in Kuwait and Afghanistan.

Our ruling

The National Journal analysis is five years old, but we couldn’t find any new study of deployment rates that had been done since then. (We never heard back from the National Guard Bureau.)

If the rates in other states increased in a similar fashion to Rhode Island’s -- and there’s no reason to believe they didn’t -- then the rankings in 2007, in all likelihood, are the same today. Rhode Island then would still have the second-highest number of deployments per capita in the nation. 

Lacking any evidence to the contrary, we rate Whitehouse’s claim True.

The letter said the outcome was ""unexpected"" and posed the rhetorical question: ""Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?"" At times during the election, the New York Times presidential poll forecast predicted Hillary Clinton had more than a 90 percent chance of winning the election, and that turned out to be incorrect. ""Doesn’t that speak volumes about the coverage?"" Cheung said of the inaccurate predictions at the New York Times and elsewhere. ""It wasn’t just a disservice to President-elect Trump, but it’s also a disservice to the voters looking for reliable coverage — which they obviously didn’t get during the election."" But predictions and polling are just two aspects of the New York Times’ Trump coverage throughout the campaign season. They also broke the story that he likely didn’t pay federal income taxes for years, on top of stories about women who claimed Trump groped them. On the other side, the New York Times also broke the news that Clinton used a private email server. The letter from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet praised the organization’s work overall. It said reporters consistently covered the election ""with agility and creativity"" and that they will cover the new president with ""the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence"" that they already do. So it’s a stretch to say the letter’s line about an inaccurate prediction is an admission of ""bad coverage"" of Trump overall, nor is it an apology. A spokeswoman for the New York Times told PolitiFact: ""We're incredibly proud of our coverage of the 2016 campaign. There was no suggestion either in our note to staff, or the note to subscribers, that we were apologizing."" Certainly, the New York Times and other media outlets are reflecting on their coverage from the year and why they so underestimated Trump’s support. The New York Times public editor Liz Spayd, for example, wrote Nov. 9 that reporters could have done more to immerse themselves in Trump supporters’ lives. Our ruling Trump said, ""The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me."" The New York Times sent a letter to subscribers thanking them for their loyalty and promising to provide strong coverage of Trump going forward. While the letter does note that the New York Times underestimated support for Trump, it does not say their coverage of him throughout the campaign was bad. In fact, the letter praises New York Times reporters’ work. The note does not include any semblance of an apology.

Donald Trump wrongly tweets that he 'never said' more countries should have nuclear weapons
","Two days after telling CBS that he planned to be ""very restrained"" on social media going forward, President-elect Donald Trump lashed out at the New York Times on Twitter. ""Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena,’"" Trump tweeted Nov. 13. The New York Times communications team responded to say the news organization actually had a surge in digital and print subscriptions after the election. He also tweeted, wrongly, ""The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?"" He’s referring to a Nov. 13 letter from the news organization’s editor and publisher, in which they thank readers for their loyalty and admit that they underestimated support for Trump. The letter does not include an apology. Lastly, Trump wrote, ""The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.’ How dishonest are they. I never said this!"" The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ""more countries should acquire nuclear weapons."" How dishonest are they. I never said this! New York Times reporter Max Fisher did, in fact, write about Trump's nuclear views on Nov. 11 as part of a larger story about Trump's foreign policy. The line in question contained a touch more nuance than Trump's tweet: ""Trump has suggested that more countries should acquire nuclear weapons, to protect themselves without Washington’s help."" Fisher has it right. Trump has said it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons in self-defense — including in interviews with, you guessed it, the New York Times. While Trump’s stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, it is highly misleading for him to say that he ""never said"" more countries should acquire nuclear weapons. ""Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons,"" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told PolitiFact for a prior article on this subject. Here are some of Trump’s key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons. March 27, 2016 The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump responded, ""At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem."" He added later in the same interview: ""If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us."" March 29, 2016 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, ""If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?"" As part of a meandering response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation (""No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any,"" and ""I don't want more nuclear weapons"") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time. ""Wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" he asked Cooper. Cooper also asked Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?"" Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, absolutely."" Cooper: ""You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?"" Trump: ""No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us."" April 3, 2016 Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Trump, ""You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?"" Trump said, ""In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.""   Trump later added of Japan and South Korea, ""Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" May 4, 2016 CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, ""You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?"" Trump responded, ""I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world."" Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.’ How dishonest are they. I never said this!"" Trump accused the New York Times of mispresenting his belief, but the newspaper did not. The reporter portrayed his comments on arming other countries with nuclear weapons as something Trump ""has suggested"" to further U.S. security interests. Trump has said he is opposed to nuclear proliferation while also repeatedly saying some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be ""better off"" if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea.

No, Donald Trump is not beating Hillary Clinton in the popular vote
","Donald Trump unquestionably won the 2016 presidential election, but he is trailing in the popular vote. That might come as a surprise to people who Googled the phrase ""Final Election Count"" as late as 2 p.m. on Nov. 14. The first entry in Google’s news category -- above those from news links to the Washington Post and Politico -- was a Nov. 12 post (updated the following day) from a little-known site called 70news. ""Final election 2016 numbers: Trump won both popular (62.9M-62.2M) and Electoral College Votes (306-232),"" the post’s headline said.  Further down the page, the site’s anonymous author wrote, ""To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the finals results are in. Trump got 306 Electoral College vote while Hillary Clinton got 232. For #PopularVote: #Trump: 62,972,226 #Clinton: 62,277,750."" According to its Facebook page, the site launched in August and seeks to ""share news that matters to you. What liberal media will try to hide, we will uncover."" Here’s a screenshot of how that particular Google search displayed the 70news post -- prominently.  The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Clinton led Trump by 784,748 votes -- specifically, 61,422,098 for Clinton, 60,637,350 for Trump, and 6,691,311 for other candidates. Other tallies showed similar results. CNN at that time showed a Clinton-over-Trump margin of 668,059, while the Associated Press had a margin of 668,483. (Different media outlets may report different numbers at a given time because of delays in obtaining and uploading new data.) Here’s CNN’s tally by mid-day Nov. 14, showing Clinton ahead by half a percentage point.  And given the votes left to be counted, it’s almost impossible to imagine that Trump will gain back ground in the coming days. That’s because California -- a state where Clinton is beating Trump by a 62 percent-33 percent margin -- has the most votes still to count of any state. Nearly a week after the election, CNN estimates that only 70 percent of the California vote had been counted. In addition, only 87 percent of the vote in Oregon had been counted; Clinton beat Trump 52 percent-41 percent there. And Washington state had counted only 87 percent of its vote; Clinton beat Trump there by a 55 percent-38 percent margin. So it’s entirely plausible that Clinton could end up winning the popular vote by 1 million to 1.5 million votes -- roughly two or three times the popular-vote margin assembled by Al Gore when he lost the Electoral College, and the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000. By Nov. 14, the Washington Post and Business Insider both posted articles questioning why Google still had the 70news article at the top of their news category. A Google representative said the company was looking into the issue. And on Nov. 14, 70news posted an update: ""Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. … If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already."" (The Twitter post cited by 70News was this one.) But as of 3 p.m. on Nov. 14, 70news still had the article up. Our ruling Social media was abuzz with the claim that the ""final election 2016 numbers"" showed that Trump had won won both the popular and Electoral College contests. Trump certainly won the Electoral College vote, and as a result, he will become president. But he clearly trails in the popular vote. As of this writing, Clinton is ahead by nearly 800,000 votes, a margin that is likely to expand further as late returns trickle in from California, Oregon and Washington state, all of which are strong Clinton states.

Pat Robertson absurdly says Sanger, King conspired in black genocide
","Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson recently said that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. partnered in a conspiracy to promote black genocide. ""Margaret Sanger was the head,"" Robertson said. ""She wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman."" Robertson made the statement on the Nov. 8 broadcast of ""The 700 Club,"" his long-running television show that airs from Virginia Beach. It came during his interview of Wellington Boone, a black Christian minister and author from Duluth, Ga., who shares many of Robertson’s socially conservative views. Both men are unrelenting critics of Planned Parenthood, a woman’s health care organization that is the largest single abortion provider in the U.S. Boone, during his interview with Robertson, accused Planned Parenthood of being in cahoots with ""the left"" in a plan to slow black birthrates. That’s when Robertson weighed in with his comment on Sanger and King. Let’s unpack it. Sanger In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League to distribute contraceptives and promote their use. The organization changed its name to Planned Parenthood in 1942. Robertson and Boone are hardly first to accuse Sanger of espousing black genocide. The charge initially was made by some African-Americans in the early 1930s who distrusted the efforts by Sanger, who was white, to set up a birth control clinic in their Harlem neighborhood, according to Jean Baker, a Goucher College professor and author of the biography ""Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion."" Baker, in an email, told us Sanger’s motives at the time were misunderstood and that Sanger was ""far ahead of her time in opposing segregation"" and ""saw birth control as a solution to black poverty."" Baker added, ""... to not offer clinics to blacks would have been a racist action by a woman who promoted contraception for every woman."" But Robertson and many other foes of Planned Parenthood say there’s smoking-gun proof that Sanger had racist intent. They point to a Dec. 10, 1939, letter she wrote to a benefactor discussing her plans to begin The Negro Project - an effort to offer birth control and other social services to Southern blacks. ""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members,"" Sanger wrote. Baker told us it’s a ""far stretch"" to interpret those words as evidence of a conspiracy to eliminate blacks. She said that Sanger, sensitive to the criticism she had received in Harlem, concluded that if she was to ease suspicions about her goals in the South - during a time of lynchings and segregation - it was essential to teach black ministers and physicians about birth control and convince them to encourage it. It should be noted that Sanger enlisted two prominent black civil rights leaders to serve on the advisory board of The Negro Project: W.E.B. DuBois and Mary Bethune. It’s hard to imagine either would have joined an effort to exterminate blacks. That brings us to another civil rights leader. King Robertson, you’ll remember, also said that King was the black minister who was chosen to be ""spokesman"" for Sanger’s efforts. Chris Roslin, a spokesman for Robertson, says the claim is based on a 1966 event. Planned Parenthood that year gave King its Margaret Sanger Award in honor of his support of family planning. King could not attend the event, but his wife, Coretta, showed up to accept the award and read his speech. In it, King wrote: ""There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist – a nonviolent resister."" In other words, King did not regard Sanger as a racist. Sanger, who was suffering from congestive heart failure, did not attend the event. She died four months later. It should be noted that Planned Parenthood started providing abortions in 1970, four years after Sanger’s death, according to Katherine Lozada, a spokeswoman for the organization. They were offered by the chapter in Syracuse, N.Y., after the repeal of a state law that criminalized abortion. Planned Parenthood’s role as an abortion provider took off after the U.S. Supreme Court, in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision, ruled that women have a right to abortions. Sanger, in a 1932 article for The Nation, wrote, ""Although abortion may be resorted to in order to save the life of the mother, the practice of it merely for the limitation of offspring is dangerous and vicious."" Baker told us that ""in time, she became upset by the rise in incidence of illegal abortion and pushed the idea of staff physicians administering pregnancy tests and referring pregnant women to hospitals for ‘therapeutic’ abortions. ""Sanger's ideas were changing, but she was always sensitive to the idea because she believed that birth control could effectively prevent conception, and abortion would be unnecessary,"" Baker said. Our ruling Robertson said that Sanger ""wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman."" His statement twists a sentence Sanger wrote in a 1939 letter - discussing the need to seek the support of black ministers in a program to promote birth control in the South - into a murderous conspiracy. His claim that King became the spokesman for the effort is just as preposterous and rests on a 1966 award the civil rights leader received from Planned Parenthood for his support of family planning.

No, Jerry Brown hasn't declared California a 'separate nation'
","Following Donald Trump’s upset victory on Election Day, a group in deep blue California gained attention for its calls to create a sovereign Golden State. The Yes California independence campaign hopes to place a referendum on a future state ballot asking voters to decide whether to leave the United States. A Calexit, as the hypothetical separation has been called, would require two-thirds approval of both houses of Congress, and permission from 38 state legislatures. Leaders of the group have made some questionable statements as they pursue this seemingly implausible feat. They claim to draw inspiration from Gov. Jerry Brown, who they allege has already declared California ""a separate nation."" ""Two years ago, the longest serving leader of the California republic, Jerry Brown, boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation,"" Louis Marinelli, president of Yes California, told a conference in Moscow on Sept. 26, 2016.  Marinelli makes his claim at the :28 minute mark in the video above.  The sovereignty group’s vice-president made a similar claim in a 2015 interview. We wondered what evidence, if any, the group had about Brown declaring California ""a separate nation."" We set out on a fact-check. Our research Brown visited China on a trade mission in 2013 with the goal of spurring Chinese investment in California. We found no evidence he told the Chinese that California was a ""separate nation"" on that trip. Reached by email, Marinelli pointed us to a March 2015 Desert Sun news article in which the governor was quoted as saying California is, indeed, ""a separate nation."" The article says Brown made that comment, however, at an event in San Francisco marking the release of a report on California’s collaboration with China to combat climate change, not on his trip to China. Here are Brown’s comments from the article: ""It is a little bold to talk about the China-California partnership as though we were a separate nation, but we are a separate nation. We're a state of mind. I include Silicon Valley, I include the environmental activism, the biotech industry, agriculture. This is a place of great investment in innovation."" A video from the event shows Brown added a bit more context than was captured in the article. Immediately after saying ""we are a separate nation ..."" the governor says ""... in our own minds. Or maybe I should put it this way: We're a state of mind.""  A California independence group has seized on comments made by Gov. Jerry Brown's at the 11:30 minute mark in this video.  A spokesman for the governor said in an email that the ""Context of (Brown’s) statement is clear: California’s footprint—it’s geography, economy and innovation—gives it as much influence / impact as a nation and that’s the point."" The governor released a statement this week reacting to Trump’s election, calling for national unity. ""With the deep divisions in our country, it is incumbent on all of us – especially the new leadership in Washington – to take steps that heal those divisions, not deepen them. In California, we will do our part to find common ground whenever possible."" Hypothetical comparisons From the governor’s follow-up comment ""We’re a state of mind,"" in the 2015 news article, it seems clear Brown was speaking symbolically about California being a distinct country. For years, the Brown Administration has made hypothetical economic comparisons between California and major nations across the globe. In June, for example, it released GDP figures showing California would be the sixth largest economy on the planet, if it were a nation. With nearly 40 million people, California has a larger population than many countries. Brown has positioned California as an international leader on climate change, working with major countries on the topic at venues such as the Paris climate change conference last year. In doing so, however, he’s never called for California to break away from the U.S. Our ruling Louis Marinelli, president of the sovereignty group Yes California, recently claimed that Gov. Jerry Brown ""boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation."" There’s no evidence Brown ever declared California’s independence, in China or anywhere else. Instead, Marinelli greatly distorted comments the governor made not in China, but at a San Francisco climate change event. Brown did say California is ""a separate nation,"" but it was hardly a bold declaration. He immediately followed it up saying California ""is a state of mind,"" indicating he was speaking symbolically. Brown has elevated California to an international stage in his climate change fight, and has talked about the state being the sixth largest economy in the world, if it were a nation. Marinelli ignored all context and greatly misconstrued Brown’s comments. We rate his claim Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Ann Coulter history tweet forgets George W. Bush presidency
","As Election Day results came in pointing to a presidential victory for Donald Trump and wins for other Republicans in Congress, conservative pundit Ann Coulter offered a nugget of history. ""1928 was last time Republicans had the White House, the House and the Senate,"" Coulter tweeted Nov. 9 at 12:19 a.m. Coulter’s public account has more than 1 million followers, and within days had been retweeted nearly 10,000 times and liked more than 15,000 times. 1928 was last time Republicans had the White House, the House and the Senate. We wondered, has it been that long since the Republican party had such control? We didn’t have to go back too many years to find out Coulter was wrong. We reached out to Coulter via Twitter and to the publisher of her latest book to find out the source of her information, but did not hear back. George W. Bush presidency George W. Bush, a Republican, served as president from 2001 to 2009.  During his administration, Republicans controlled both houses of Congress for a total of four years, from 2003 to 2007. From 2003 to 2005, GOP House members outnumbered Democrats 227 to 205, with one independent and two vacancies. In the Senate, Republicans held 51 seats, Democrats 48, with one independent. House Republicans increased their edge in the 2005 to 2007 Congress, gaining three seats for a total of 230. They also improved in the Senate, holding 55 seats. Donald Trump presidency So Bush had Republican majorities not too long ago. President-elect Trump’s majorities will either match or surpass the majorities Bush had. CNN election results said Republicans had 51 seats in the Senate and Democrats 48 (including two Independent senators who caucus with Democrats). One seat had not been called by Friday morning. In the House where 218 seats are need to control, Republicans had 238, and Democrats 193. Four had not been called yet by CNN. While Republicans’ unified control has clearly happened after 1928, it is still rather rare, said Michael Bailey, professor of American politics at Georgetown University. ""Unified government definitely makes it easier for the majority party to pass legislation. President Trump will likely be unpredictable, but at this point the Republicans appear to be able to pass almost anything they want,"" Bailey said. The Democrats only defense is the filibuster in the Senate, but that can be defeated if the Republicans are unified and willing to overturn long-standing procedural traditions, Bailey said. A 2008 Congressional Research Service report notes that most issues in the Senate are determined by a simple majority vote (51). But the Senate also has imposed super-majority requirements, such as needing a three-fifths vote, or 60 of the 100 senators’ votes, to invoke cloture on debates. Cloture ""is the only formal procedure,"" for breaking a filibuster, according to Senate rules. Though Trump’s administration will begin with a Republican-leaning Congress, ""you do not always win in unified government or lose in divided government,"" pointed out Michele L. Swers, an American government professor at Georgetown University. For instance, President George W. Bush passed the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 with a Democratic Senate, and President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, got welfare reform and budget deals with a Republican Congress, Swers said. ""At the moment, I expect Republicans and Trump will try to start with the things they agree on like repealing Obamacare and the infrastructure bill, but there are still divisions within the Republican caucus, and between congressional Republicans and Trump, so it is not clear that everyone will just agree on policy,"" Swers added. Our ruling Coulter tweeted, ""1928 was last time Republicans had the White House, the House and the Senate."" Republican president George W. Bush served from 2001 to 2009, during that time there were two Congresses with Republican majorities in the Senate and House, 108th Congress (2003-2005) and 109th Congress (2005-2007).

Lamar Smith 'first member of Congress to contribute to Donald Trump'
","A re-elected U.S. House member from Texas offered congratulations to Donald Trump while laying claim to a financial first with the Republican president-elect. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, said in a Nov. 9, 2016, web post that voters chose a president who won’t expand government control. ""They have rejected bad trade deals, open borders, heavy-handed regulations, Obamacare, a liberal Supreme Court, political correctness, and business as usual in Washington,"" Smith wrote. Smith went on: ""When I learned I was the first member of Congress to contribute to Donald Trump, I didn't know whether to smile or frown. Now I realize that few actions have given me as much satisfaction. The walk-on quarterback has won the Super Bowl!"" Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science & Technology, joined several fellow Republican House committee chairs in endorsing Trump’s candidacy on May 14, 2016. Was he also the first member of Congress to make a contribution to the New York businessman? Smith reported donations starting in May 2016 We emailed Smith consultant Jordan Berry seeking Smith’s factual backup. Then we called the Federal Election Commission, repository for candidate finance reports, where Julia Queen helped us ascertain that Smith’s campaign committee, Texans for Lamar Smith, reported giving the Donald J. Trump for President committee $2,000 on May 27, 2016. Our searches of FEC-posted summaries of Trump’s campaign finance filings show too that Trump reported fielding $1,913 from Smith’s campaign on Oct. 5, 2016. Trump’s campaign also listed $5,000 received Oct. 5, 2016, from the Maryland-based Longhorn PAC, a ""leadership PAC"" affiliated with Smith, according to a PAC filing with the FEC. Trump’s finance report also states ""excess to be refunded"" from the $5,000, without elaboration. Our request for research help from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions and spending, drew an email from spokeswoman Viveca Novak noting the Smith-led Longhorn PAC earlier reported giving Trump’s campaign $3,000 on May 27, 2016 According to the FEC-posted summary of the Longhorn PAC’s donations to campaigns, the group also gave $1,000 on June 14, 2016 to a Massachusetts-based Trump Victory group. Even earlier, the Smith-steered group donated $5,000 in May 2015 to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. All told then, Smith’s campaign and his Longhorn PAC reported making three Trump campaign donations totaling $6,000 from May 27, 2016 into October 2016. Trump’s campaign reported $6,913 in two Smith-connected contributions in October 2016. A wrinkle: The contributions reported by Smith didn’t show up in the FEC-posted summaries of Trump’s reports, far as we could tell, nor did some of what Trump reported getting from Smith’s committee or leadership PAC appear in Smith’s filings. Significantly, though, Berry told us by email that Smith’s records show the May 2016 Smith campaign committee and leadership PAC checks made out to the Trump campaign were each cashed in mid-June 2016. Other members of Congress? So, how about other members of Congress ponying up for Trump? Our review of Trump’s FEC list of other campaigns giving to his effort didn’t turn up other House members making donations prior to July 2016. Starting that month, five other Republican House members made donations from respective campaign funds. Listed among more than 60 contributions from other political committees reported by Trump up to Oct. 18, 2016: --The Lone Star Leadership PAC, affiliated with Texas Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Flower Mound, gave two donations totaling $10,000 on July 21, 2016, the same day Burgess’ campaign gave two donations totaling $4,000. --A $2,000 donation from Rep. Ken Calvert of California on Sept. 9, 2016. --Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana donated $2,000 on Sept. 26, 2016. --Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina gave $1,994 in multiple in-kind donations in October 2016. --Rep. Tom McClintock of California gave $2,000 on Oct. 5, 2016. Trump’s campaign otherwise reported that a former House member, Dan Burton of Indiana, made two contributions totaling $2,700 in July 2016 and Todd Wilcox, a former Florida U.S. Senate aspirant, donated $2,000 in October 2016. The center’s Daniel Auble said by email that for candidate committees and leadership PACs, Smith was the first sitting member of Congress to contribute to Trump’s bid. But in 2017, Smith will be sworn in with a new member of Congress who gave even earlier to Trump. Paul Mitchell, a Michigan Republican, made a $292 in-kind donation to Trump’s campaign in February 2016, Auble said. No personal donations by Smith We also explored whether Smith put personal money, not campaign funds, into Trump’s cause. Our search on the FEC website for Trump donors whose names include ""Lamar"" didn’t reveal personal Lamar Smith contributions to the presidential hopeful. Across Texas, according to the FEC, Trump’s campaign reported accepting 135 contributions totaling $45,253 from September 2015 through Oct. 19, 2016. Those donors in 2016 included three San Antonio Smiths, Trump’s committee reported, none named Lamar. And did other House members make personal donations to Trump before Smith’s campaign chipped in? We didn't close in on this ourselves but Auble said his ""quick scan"" of individual donations posted by the FEC didn’t turn up anyone. Our ruling Smith said: ""I was the first member of Congress to contribute to"" Trump for president. Corroborating records appear to be imperfect. But Smith reported contributions to the Trump cause in May 2016 and we didn’t find any sign of other members of Congress donating to Trump before July 2016. We rate this statement True.

Viral image debunked: KKK was not marching in North Carolina after Trump victory
","It’s a grainy photo that many woke up to Wednesday morning, hours after Donald Trump won the race for president – shrouded figures carrying flags or signs on a bridge above a busy North Carolina highway. ""KKK on the bridge in Mebane, NC this morning,"" wrote Twitter user @kelbi1lewis, along with the photo. That tweet alone has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times and has also been picked up by people ranging from football player Chad Johnson to terrorism expert Charles Lister and actress/activist Yvette Nicole Brown. But is it true? The Twitter user who started the viral rumors didn't respond to our requests for comment. After spending some of Wednesday retweeting news that her post was trending internationally, she later deleted her account. Trump was endorsed by the KKK’s official newspaper. And after his victory became official Wednesday morning, former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke tweeted: ""This is one of the most exciting nights of my life. Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!"" However, there's no proof that the Klan was on the march in North Carolina, like the viral post claimed. The photo appears to show a group of Trump supporters that local media also interviewed. And according to that news report and follow-up interviews, none of them were wearing KKK regalia, carrying Confederate flags or doing anything else that would link them to the racist group. The scene on the bridge Although the tweet claimed the marchers were on the bridge in Mebane Wednesday morning, they were actually there on Tuesday afternoon and night. Natalie Allison Janicello, a reporter for the local Burlington Times-News, was there interviewing them. She said she’s sure the group in the viral post is the same group she spoke with; she could recognize the same flags and the neon yellow shirt of someone in the photo. None of them were wearing any KKK regalia, she said, or carrying flags associated with the Confederacy or white supremacy movements. Instead, they had Trump signs, red-white-and-blue scarves and an assortment of American, Christian and ""Don’t Tread On Me"" flags. ""There was no one claiming or professing to be part of the KKK,"" Janicello said. ""These were just local conservatives who were out there for Trump."" Janicello said they had actually come to that spot a few times a month, since February, to wave flags to passing traffic. Furthermore, neither the Mebane Police Department nor the Alamance County Sheriff’s Office received complaints of KKK activity close to the election – either at that bridge or anywhere else in the area. The sheriff’s office said in a press release Wednesday that calls only started coming in after the photo went viral, and that there’s nothing to substantiate the rumors. ""Several members of law enforcement had observed these individuals over the past weeks, and never observed any paraphernalia related to the KKK nor Confederate symbols,"" the press release said. ""No suspicious activity was observed nor reported."" The newspaper’s photos from the bridge show that some of the marchers were affiliated with the group Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC). It received some notoriety this summer when it began raising money to buy and install Confederate flags along Interstate 40, which is the busiest road in a number of North Carolina counties. But there were no Confederate flags or KKK regalia visible at the Trump celebration, Janicello said. She also interviewed an Alamance County Republican Party official at the bridge, but party leaders later told us there was no formal connection. ""I haven’t even heard of what you’re talking about,"" said Ben York, the Alamance County Republican Party chairman, several hours after the image had gone viral. The KKK in North Carolina Despite there being no proof behind the viral claim, Alamance County was one of the major early hotbeds of KKK activity in North Carolina. In an 1870 incident known as the Kirk-Holden War, a band of Klan supporters from Alamance and Caswell counties attempted to capture the town of Pittsboro in neighboring Chatham County. They were defeated by a militia formed by Gov. William Holden, who also arrested some prominent Klan supporters. That infuriated white supremacist state lawmakers, who soon made Holden the first governor in U.S. history to be impeached and removed from office. Holden was pardoned by the N.C. Senate in 2011. The contemporary KKK has also found support in the central area of the state, called the Piedmont, which includes Alamance County. ""In North Carolina, one of its banner states, the modern Klan thrived among mill workers and other blue-collar laborers in the Piedmont,"" according to the 2006 book Encyclopedia of North Carolina. Our ruling A viral post on social media claimed to show KKK members marching in Mebane, N.C. on Wednesday morning after Trump won the election. Trump has been supported by the KKK, and that area of North Carolina does have longstanding ties to KKK activity. But thanks to a newspaper reporter who was at the scene, and whose reporting was corroborated by local law enforcement, we know that there’s no substance to the rumors. The people were not wearing KKK regalia and didn’t even have a Confederate flag amongst them. They also were never overheard saying anything about the KKK – they were simply excited for Trump. We rate this claim False.  UPDATE After we wrote this, the KKK did hold a widely publicized ""victory"" parade in North Carolina, celebrating Donald Trump's presidential win. But that doesn't change anything about this rating, since they were separate events on different days and in different places. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a38543ff-c4c5-4840-a02d-937ad5424535",/factchecks/2016/nov/09/viral-image/viral-image-debunked-kkk-was-not-marching-north-ca/

Didn't vote for president? You'll be shamed, comedian Amy Schumer says
","Now that the election is over, according to comedian Amy Schumer, some Americans truly have something to fear. Public shaming. ""People are going to know if you voted or not,"" Schumer intoned in a video posted online Nov. 3, 2016, five days before the historic presidential contest. ""Your voting history is public record. It doesn’t say who you voted for, but it says if you voted at all. Anyone who knows you can just look that s*** up …. ""Your decision to vote or not is obviously up to you,"" she added. ""But judging you for that decision could be up to the Internet. And everyone has access to that. Even our parents."" Schumer ended the video (which showed up in the Facebook feed of more than one Wisconsinite) with a call to vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, while making disparaging comments about the Republican nominee (and now president-elect) Donald Trump. So, Schumer doesn’t explicitly state that you can simply go online to see if someone voted. But her just-look-it-up reference makes it sound easy. Elections experts told us that, as Schumer stated, voter records generally are public records (except, of course, who you voted for). So, by and large, a person’s voting history is generally available by request. But not everywhere. And don’t expect it to be as easy as typing a name onto a website. Let’s start with Wisconsin, one of the states that, unexpectedly, helped carry Trump to victory. In Wisconsin If you know a voter’s full name and date of birth, you can search that person’s voting history on  a website maintained by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. It’s super quick. But voter participation isn’t instantly recorded. For the just-ended election, local election clerks have up to 45 days to record voter participation. And if you don’t know a person’s date of birth, the look-up is more difficult. You can still make a request of the state election commission -- or at the municipal clerk’s office, if you know where the voter lives. The request can be made by mail, email, fax or in person and, depending on how busy an office is, the records are provided as quickly as possible, state elections commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Other states In other states, accessing voting histories can be more difficult -- or, in at least one state, not allowed. To search online in Nevada, the state requires a date of birth plus either the voter’s drivers license number or the last four digits of his or her Social Security number. Alabama doesn’t offer an online search option. Secretary of State spokesman John Bennett told us that if you make the request in person, by email or via phone from his office, often the record can be provided the same day (for 1 cent per voter, a fee that can be rounded up to $1). In Virginia, however, a voter’s voting history is not a public record that is available to the general public, the Virginia Department of Elections told us. Individual voting histories are provided, for a fee, only to groups such as candidates or political groups. That being said, it’s possible to pull up a Virginia resident’s voting history online -- but at the risk of violating the state’s computer fraud law. You must click a box certifying that you are searching for your own voter record, or that you are authorized to search for someone else’s record. (Schumer's publicist didn't respond to our requests for information.) Our rating Schumer said: ""Anyone who knows you can just"" look it up to ""see if you voted."" Generally speaking, an individual’s voting history is a public record, though how easy it is to access can vary. Depending on the state, you might need information such as a date of birth to do an online search. And if you don’t have such details, you might have to make a request from a state elections office. Moreover, an individual’s voting history is not a public record in at least one state (Virginia). For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23001946-d8d0-4426-b34d-3209ac90ff47",/factchecks/2016/nov/09/amy-schumer/didnt-vote-president-youll-be-shamed-comedian-amy-/

No evidence to support rumors of 'We hate Muslims' chant at Trump victory rally
","A viral tweet allegedly sent from the ground of an election night rally for President-elect Donald Trump said that ""thousands"" of his supporters were chanting a racist message. The claim was fake. I am at a Trump rally in Manhattan, and thousands are chanting ""We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back"". Disgusting As Buzzfeed and others have reported, the tweet was sent from the account of a fake British sports journalist who has a history of making allegations about racist chants in mass crowds. Another ""Simon Rowntree"" account was suspended over the summer, but Buzzfeed managed to screenshot his Twitter bio, which said he was a soccer writer for Forest Echo News. The site‘s account has also been suspended but it declared itself to be a parody in its bio, per Buzzfeed’s screenshot.  The parody news site was the creation of a group of friends who set up fake sports journalist accounts, a person who responded on behalf of Forest Echo News told Buzzfeed. Rowntree is likely a Forest Echo fan jumping on the bandwagon. Here are some examples of Rowntree tweets alleging chants of racial epithets at British soccer games from his current account. I am at Old Trafford and I can hear racist #MCFC fans chating ""You're just an expensive dabbing golliwog"" at Paul Pogba. This is disgusting. Atmosphere at Hampden Park building up. #RFC fans have now started to chant ""Refugee scum, fuck off back to Calais"". Absolutely disgusting. Racist chants are not uncommon at British soccer matches, so Rowntree’s tweets are believable though unverified and likely satirical (see Poe’s law for internet parodies). As for Rowntree’s allegation about the Trump rally, we have not found video footage or other evidence supporting it. Trump held his victory party at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan, which can accommodate 3,300 in its grand ballroom. Rowntree claimed the chant began at 7:04 p.m., about 30 minutes after the event had began. According to videos, the crowds were rather subdued around that time. News reports indicate Trump supporters inside and outside the Hilton did not get rowdy until about 10 p.m., when projections began favoring Trump as the winner. A few dozen — not ""thousands"" — supporters roaming Midtown shouted ""T-R-U-M-P, we will beat Hill-ar-y,"" ""U-S-A""  and ""CNN sucks"" at about 10:25 p.m., according to Patch New York. And Trump supporters inside the Hilton began to chant ""lock her up"" around 2 a.m., CBS’ Sopan Deb and NBC’s Katy Tur both reported. Our ruling A viral tweet said, ""thousands"" of people at a Manhattan rally for Trump chanted, ""We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back.""

Most people clueless on U.S. foreign aid spending
","Secretary of State John Kerry aired an old complaint about the public and foreign aid. In a speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kerry bemoaned a persistent misconception about how much money Washington sends overseas. ""Do you know that amazing surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid?"" Kerry said on Oct. 26, 2016. Foreign aid covers both military aid and more humanitarian forms of assistance such as fighting disease and boosting economic growth in other countries. Kerry’s comment accurately reflects what pollsters have seen for many years. Americans greatly exaggerate the scale of those items compared to everything else Washington spends on. To do our part to set the record straight, this chart comes from numbers in the president’s 2017 budget request. There are different ways to tally expenses across more than a dozen agencies, but by and large, foreign aid represents about 1 percent of all spending. To support Kerry’s claim, the State Department press office pointed to several reports including a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely respected source of impartial data. In January 2016, Kaiser found that only 3 percent of Americans correctly estimated spending at 1 percent or less of total spending. The average answer was that foreign aid accounts for 31 percent of the U.S. budget; 15 percent of the people thought it represented over half of all spending.    That misconception is a stubborn one. In a 1998 survey, the average answer put foreign aid at 26 percent of the budget. And decades before that, nearly a quarter of respondents in a 1963 Gallup poll said Washington spends between 10 to 25 percent of its budget on foreign aid. Another 13 percent said it might go as high as half of all government spending. So the surveys back-up Kerry’s statement. Which raises the question, why do so many people get it wrong? There are many possible reasons. The first and most obvious factor is that most Americans might not know much about foreign aid. In a 2010 poll, almost 70 percent said they had heard about the World Bank, but less that 30 percent had heard about the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government’s main overseas health and development body. Boston College political scientist Emily Thorson points the finger at a more fundamental problem. It seems we aren’t very good with numbers. ""People don’t think in terms of percentages,"" Thorson said. ""We do best with ‘more than’ and 'less than.’ And they also don’t have a sense of how big the federal budget is. So if they hear we’re spending billions, they don’t see how that can be a small slice of the total."" Researchers Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley, professors at Harvard and Princeton universities respectively, suggested that the way surveys ask about foreign aid might make that problem worse. ""No study that we are aware of asks individuals to assign percentages to an array of government programs, with a mandatory limit at 100 percent,"" they wrote in 2013. In other words, asking only about foreign aid might lead people to ignore the big ticket budget lines for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and defense. It’s also possible, Thorson said, that news coverage that touches on aid can be graphic and compelling -- such as scenes from refugee camps or fighter jets in flight -- which leaves the impression that these programs play a bigger role in the budget than they actually do. Our ruling Kerry said that surveys show that many Americans think that a quarter to a third of the U.S. budget is spent on foreign aid. The actual number is about 1 percent, and surveys back up Kerry’s statement. One 2016 poll found the average estimate was about 30 percent of all government spending. A survey done nearly two decades ago found an average estimate of 26 percent. There’s nothing wrong about Kerry’s summary. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/abaebb34-ae3b-41cf-8c1c-6b7ed1c8a219",/factchecks/2016/nov/09/john-kerry/yep-most-people-clueless-us-foreign-aid-spending/

In closing argument, Donald Trump wrongly says he outdraws Beyonce, Jay Z
","It's been a long campaign season. At PolitiFact, we've fact-checked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a combined 509 times since they announced their campaigns for president. If you add in the other presidential candidates -- from Lincoln Chafee to Ben Carson to Jill Stein -- the number shoots to 889. That's a lot of words, about a lot of policy and a lot of political attacks. So please allow this last fact-check of the 2016 campaign to be a little different. As Trump made his closing argument in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 7, he decided to spend a few seconds telling voters that he's a bigger draw than Beyonce and Jay-Z. NOW: Trump: ""Jay-Z and Beyonce, I like them, but I get bigger crowds than they do!"" https://t.co/CVBZ2Af4zC pic.twitter.com/nlFeFIrvib ""Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them,"" Trump told the crowd. ""And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds."" It’s not true. For the sake of argument, let’s take Trump at his word on the size of his crowds. (We do this full-well knowing Trump is guilty of exaggerating the size of his crowds.) ""We go to Oklahoma, we have 25,000 people,"" Trump said in August. ""We had 21,000 people in Dallas, we had 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. We get these massive crowds. Look, if (Clinton) had 500 people I would be surprised."" Here’s a photo from that Mobile rally:  Anyway, if you take Trump as his word, that’s an average of 27,000 for those three big rallies.  That’s a good draw. But it’s not Jay Z/Beyonce level. Jay Z last toured in 2014 with Beyonce to promote her self-titled album and his Magna Carta Holy Grail. The couple played 16 shows across North America, and one in Paris, raking in over $100 million in ticket sales. All were sold out and averaged a crowd size of 45,700 per night, according to data assembled by Billboard. The biggest one-night performance drew a crowd of nearly 53,000 while their two-night Paris show topped 147,000. Here’s a photo from their Seattle show, via Wikimedia Commons  Beyonce, who wrapped up her $210 million Formation tour in October, performed 49 sold-out shows across North America and Europe. She drew an average crowd of 45,423 per night and a record one-night crowd of 75,106 in Paris this July. Beyonce and Jay Z campaigned with Clinton Friday in Cleveland at an event that drew about 10,000 people, according to estimates. That's comparable to the size of many Trump crowds but certainly smaller than some of Trump's bigger crowds.  To fully vet this bizarre claim, it’s worth noting that Trump’s rallies are free. Tickets to Beyonce in the swing state of Florida cost $40-$275 this year. Based on the latest Billboard numbers, Trump draws crowds similar to Phish. Our ruling Trump said, ""Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them. And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds."" There is no question Trump is fixated on the size of his crowds. And there is no question, this claim -- as it relates to Beyonce and Jay Z -- is incorrect.

Obama says Republicans tried to 'purge' black Democrats from voter rolls in North Carolina
","While campaigning on Hillary Clinton’s behalf, President Barack Obama has told people not to take their right to vote for granted, ""Don’t boo, vote!"" At a Nov. 2 rally in North Carolina, Obama told the story of a 100-year-old woman from the town of Belhaven, N.C., whose voter registration status had been challenged by Republicans just a few weeks prior. The woman, Grace Bell Hardison, contested the challenge, and her county elections board upheld her status as a registered voter. ""And you better believe she's going to vote,"" Obama said. ""But this 100-year-old woman wasn't alone in being targeted. The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds black and Democratic. That didn’t happen by accident. It's happening in counties across the state. Now, there was a time when systematically denying black folks the right to vote was considered normal, as well."" Two days after Obama spoke, a federal judge ordered three North Carolina counties to restore voter registrations for about 4,000 individuals whose registration had been revoked within 90 days of the election. The NAACP brought the lawsuit. Still, we were curious about Obama’s claim that Republicans in North Carolina tried to purge a list of voters that was two-thirds black and Democratic. In his remarks, it was unclear if Obama was talking about the state as a whole or a smaller area. A spokesman told us that he was referring specifically to Belhaven, the town where Hardison lives. For the local area, Obama’s numbers are close to on target, according to figures we received from the Beaufort County Elections Board. Ricky Radcliffe, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Belhaven mayor in 2015, and three of his associates submitted 138 voter registration challenges to the election board. Radcliffe had sent out mailers for his campaign to Belhaven residents based on voter registration information, and 138 of the mailers returned as undeliverable, so he and his associates contested their registration status. Of these 138 people who had their voter registrations challenged, 80 were black Democrats. That’s about 58 percent — just shy of the two-thirds Obama said. It appears that black people were at least slightly overrepresented in this group; black people of all political parties make up about 66 percent all the Belhaven challenged voters. But the town of Belhaven overall is about 54 percent black. We don’t have city-level political party data for Belhaven, so we can’t know if Democrats were overrepresented, too. Obama used this case to support his claim that Republicans are stopping black Democrats from voting in counties ""all around the state"" of North Carolina. Of North Carolina’s 100 counties, just three were involved in the most recent legal proceedings over voter roll purges: Beaufort, which we already discussed, Moore and Cumberland. Moore County removed 374 voters from the rolls, and 14.4 percent were black Democrats. Black people of all parties made up about 18 percent of the removed voters and 14 percent of the Moore County population overall. Jay Delancy, director of the Voter Integrity Project, an anti-voter fraud advocacy group that brought the challenges in Moore County, told us that his group strips out race and party when it looks for potentially fraudulent voter registrations in order to avoid bias. We were unable to get data from Cumberland County in time for publication. We were, though, able to get data for North Carolina overall. The state elections board told us that there were 6,612 total voters removed from the rolls in 2016, though many were re-added due to the recent court order. A plurality of those removed, 25.7 percent, were black Democrats. For comparison, white Republicans accounted for 18.44 percent. Black people are overrepresented among those removed from the rolls in 2016, compared to the North Carolina voting population at large, and white voters are underrepresented. Race Voter roll challenges North Carolina voters Black 37.07 percent 22.23 percent White 50.69 percent 69.54 percent Other 12.24 percent 8.23 percent Obama’s remarks may give a listener the impression that Republicans have tried to remove a selection of voters that’s two-thirds black and Democratic statewide, and that’s not the case, based on the state’s data. It’s worth noting that a federal appeals court found in July that North Carolina’s strict voter identification law was designed to ""target African-Americans with almost surgical precision,"" potentially making it harder for black people to vote. The court struck down the law. Our ruling Obama said, ""The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds black and Democratic."" Obama’s phrasing left the scope of his claim open for interpretation. One could think he was speaking of the state of North Carolina as a whole, in which case his claim would be incorrect, as about 25.7 percent of the statewide list of people removed from the voter registration rolls were black Democrats. But Obama’s staff told us he was talking specifically about just 138 challenges in the town of Belhaven, N.C. Of those challenges, 58 percent were black Democrats — just under two-thirds. Republicans did bring these challenges. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/nov/07/barack-obama/obama-says-republicans-tried-purge-black-democrats/

Trump misses details when saying Florida insurance premiums going up by double digits
","GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been on the stump trying to chop down Obamacare, warning that Floridians are on the hook for big premium increases next year. ""It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike,"" he said at a Nov. 3, 2016, campaign rally in Jacksonville. It’s a favorite talking point for Trump, who vows to repeal Obamacare and replace it with an unspecified option. But in this instance, Trump's talking point is missing a lot of context. Trump is talking about a small portion of people who get health insurance in Florida, and he neglects that most of the plans with increases will get subsidies to offset the cost. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, which oversees insurance company requests for changes in premiums, did not answer our questions about increases next year. But the agency announced in September that premiums for individual health insurance plans sold in Florida in 2017 would go up an average of 19.1 percent. That is for any individual plan that meets the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements, whether it’s sold on the federal exchange’s HealthCare.gov or not. The premium changes depend on the company: For plans sold on the exchange, Health First’s increase is the lowest at 11.7 percent. Humana’s premiums are going up at the highest rate, 36.8 percent. Changes for compliant plans sold off the exchange range from a high of 27.3 percent for AvMed, to a decrease of 1.5 percent for premiums with Cigna. The nationwide average for premium increases is about 25 percent, according to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. One thing Trump didn’t mention is that customers who buy plans off the exchange won’t necessarily be paying the full price of those increases. About 1.53 million Floridians bought their coverage off the federal exchange in 2016. Out of those, 1.42 million -- 93 percent -- were subsidized in part by the federal government to make the plans more affordable. The average premium tax credit in Florida was $305. About 1 percent of customers who buy a plan off the exchange earn too much income and do not qualify for any subsidies. They will have to pay the full increase. Also, people have the option to choose a different, cheaper plan. For 2017, Health and Human Services has estimated that 86 percent of Floridians who buy a plan off HealthCare.gov will be able to find a plan for $100 a month or less. Amid double-digit increases last year, average premiums after subsidies went from $82 to $84, the agency said. Again, Trump is talking only about people who buy insurance on the exchanges. People who get insurance through work wouldn’t necessarily see the same increase. Small group plans, for example, will see an average premium increase of 9.5 percent, for example. In Jacksonville, Trump also said that ""over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year."" For 2017, every Florida county still has at least one Obamacare option on the exchange. Last year, Florida Blue and UnitedHealthcare were the only two insurance companies to offer policies in all 67 counties. UnitedHealthcare announced earlier this year it would leave the exchange in Florida and dozens of other states. Our ruling Trump said, ""It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike."" The state announced in September that ACA-compliant plans would see an average premium hike of 19.1 percent. That’s lower than the national average of 25 percent, but is still a sizable increase. Most people who buy those policies qualify for federal subsidies, however, so they likely won’t see an increase as high as Trump is implying. And the vast majority of Floridians get their insurance through their job, where increases aren’t going to be as high. Those are important points he didn’t mention, so we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc6699ef-5777-4860-a17e-dcf06d0032a5",/factchecks/2016/nov/07/donald-trump/trump-misses-details-when-saying-florida-insurance/

Donald Trump correct that 1 in 4 working-age Americans not employed
","During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump has gotten some things about the labor market very wrong, notably suggesting that the unemployment rate may be 42 percent. (It’s not; that got a Pants on Fire.) But at a Nov. 4 rally in Atkinson, N.H., Trump offered a statistic that was much closer to the mark. ""At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, about time,"" he said, later adding that ""nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working. They want to work. They're not working."" When we checked with several economists, they said the most commonly used age span for defining the ""prime working years"" is 25 to 54. So we looked at the ""employment-to-population ratio"" for ages 25 to 54 -- that is, the percentage of people in that age range who are working, divided by the total number of people in that age range. (We also spot-checked the data for 18 to 64 and for 25 to 64 and did not find significant differences from 25 to 54.) According to the most recent data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- covering October 2016 -- 78.2 percent of the population between 25 and 54 was working. Flip that percentage and 21.8 percent of the population between 25 and 54 was not working. So Trump is on solid ground saying ""nearly one in four."" That said, we’ll try to put this number in some historical context. Here’s a chart for this statistic that goes back to 1948. The chart shows the percentage of people working.  First, simply citing this figure ignores that the percentage of people in this age range who are working has risen steadily during President Barack Obama’s presidency. The chart below shows that this ratio has risen by 3.4 percentage points since its most recent low point during the Obama presidency -- 74.8 percent in November 2010. So just citing the number ignores that the figure has been going in the right direction for the past six years. Second, it’s worth noting that the current ratio is not all that far from its all-time high -- 81.9 percent in April 2000. Prime working age happens to be the prime childbearing and child-rearing age, and it makes sense that some people will choose not to work during at least some of those years. So it’s not as if this number has always been pushing 100 percent and now is suddenly down dramatically. On the other hand, economists say that Trump has put his finger on a legitimate concern about the current labor market -- that the employment rate among prime-working-age Americans has not recovered to its level prior to the Great Recession. Despite more than six years of steady job growth, the employment-to-population ratio for those 25 to 54 has not yet returned to its immediate pre-Great Recession peak of 80.3 in January 2007. Today, it’s still 2.1 percentage points below that peak. And every single month but two of President George W. Bush’s two terms in office had a higher percentage than today’s, even though Bush took office during an economic downturn, albeit a milder one. The trend line for men has been particularly problematic. As the following chart shows, the employment ratio for men in this age range was almost always above 90 percent prior to 1980, and in the immediate pre-Great Recession period, it was in the 87 percent range. Under Obama, it has rebounded from a low of 80.6 percent, but it was still only at 85 percent in October 2016 -- lower than its pre-recession level.  In other words, we may be looking at a new, lower normal for prime-working-age employment, particularly for men -- and unlike some other employment statistics, this is one that is not shaped by an ongoing surge of baby boomer retirements. Our ruling Trump said that ""nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working."" The actual percentage is 21.8 percent, so Trump’s phrasing is reasonable. Putting it this way does ignore that this number has declined steadily under Obama for the past six years, and it also ignores that it’s not that far from the all-time low. Still, economists agree that Trump is raising a legitimate concern, since even after six years of improvement, the percentage today remains worse than it was prior to the Great Recession, suggesting that it might represent a new, more worrisome ""normal.""

GOP mailer uses tricky wording to attack Ohio House candidate
","A PolitiFact Ohio reader suggested that we look into claims found on a mailer that appears to question the patriotism of Democratic House District 37 candidate Casey Weinstein. So we obliged. ""Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military,"" reads one side of the flier, which was paid for by the Ohio Republican Party. On the opposite side: ""Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein."" We wanted to know more about the story behind this claim, so we reached out to the Ohio Republican Party. Though the flier literally reads, ""Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military,"" Ohio’s GOP spokesperson Brittany Warner told PolitiFact Ohio, ""Under no circumstances is this written to imply that Mr. Weinstein has no faith in the service of our men and women in uniform."" The candidate’s military background makes the words in this ad all the more puzzling. Weinstein, 34, is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. He is an Air Force Reserve captain currently separated from active duty. His father, his brother, and his wife are also graduates. Confused?  Turns out, ""no faith in our military"" is a paraphrase of Weinstein’s stance in a 2004 lawsuit against the Air Force Academy. The lawsuit asked for renewed enforcement of the constitutional separation of church and state on the military campus. The lawsuit was filed by Weinstein’s father, Mikey Weinstein, a former Air Force officer. Four cadets at the Air Force Academy, including the candidate Casey Weinstein, joined the suit, and claimed that the Air Force Academy imposed a hostile environment by pushing Christianity on the non-Christians in their ranks.   One of the incidents detailed in the suit was an Air Force Academy-promoted screening of Mel Gibson’s film, The Passion of the Christ. (Weinstein is Jewish, and Gibson’s movie has been criticized for portraying Jews as enthusiastic participants in the crucifixion of Jesus.) The movie screening was not the plaintiffs’ only example of pervasive religious activities occurring on duty. We contacted Mikey Weinstein, who wanted to be clear that his participation in this fact-check is not an endorsement of his son nor an opinion on the race.  The elder Weinstein is the founder and president of the nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, dedicated to restoring ""the obliterated wall separating church and state in the most technologically lethal organization ever created by humankind: the United States armed forces."" He is a 1977 graduate of the Air Force Academy who went on to serve for ten years in the Judge Advocate General Corps (as a ""JAG"" officer), and as legal counsel to President Ronald Reagan's administration in the White House.  Mikey Weinstein pointed out that the campaign flier gets the ""sued our soldiers"" claim wrong on two points. First, it implies that the suit targeted individuals for their individual acts, which is not accurate. A lawsuit filed against a military branch and its highest civil servant -- in this case, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force -- is an action against the institution, not the individual. Secondly, the servicemembers of the U.S. Air Force are referred to as airmen and airwomen, not soldiers. ""Soldiers"" applies to members of the Army. Mikey Weinstein said that his organization has represented over 48,000 service members across every branch of the military and any faith (or lack thereof). As for the lawsuit against the U.S. Air Force, it was dismissed by a federal judge after Weinstein and his co-plaintiffs graduated, losing their legal standing against the institution. An internal Air Force investigation later substantiated the claims brought by the Weinsteins’ lawsuit and prompted the issuance of new religious tolerance policies. Our ruling A GOP-funded campaign flier stated, ""Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military,"" and, ""When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein."" The mailer twists many facts about a lawsuit to present Weinstein, an Air Force reservist from a military family, as hostile to the armed forces. There is an element of truth in that Weinstein did sue the Air Force Academy, asserting that the institution unconstitutionally promoted the evangelization of Christianity by its leadership and cadets on duty. His lawsuit did not target fellow ""soldiers,"" but the institution itself (also, Air Force members are not called ""soldiers"").  The flier further capitalizes on the two possible interpretations suggested by the phrase ""no faith in our military."" A cursory read of the flier could easily leave voters with the impression that Weinstein was critical of the armed forces.

Tim Kaine is right, Spanish was first European language spoken in United States
","Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine touted his language skills in Phoenix by delivering a speech in Spanish, saying his ticket would focus on immigration reform and an economy that works for all. Kaine spoke to a crowd in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood about the United States’ immigrant fabric, comprised over centuries with people from all parts of the world. ""And people sometimes forget – and some may not even know – that the Hispanic community has been part of our country since the Spanish arrived in St. Augustine in 1565. That was well before the British landed in North America,"" Kaine said Nov. 3. ""Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country."" We decided to follow Kaine on his history tour and wondered if he was right about the Spanish language’s roots in the United States. The United States does not have an official national language, yet 31 states have laws establishing English as their official tongue, according to the CIA World Factbook. English is the dominant language across the states and Spanish the second-most common. Of about 291.5 million people, 5 years and older, an estimated 37.6 million speak Spanish at home, according to 2011 Census Bureau data (the latest we could find). Chinese follows, spoken by more than 2.8 million people. And while there is no definitive data, the Census Bureau estimates there are more than 300 languages spoken in the United States. Se habla español Linguist experts we interviewed all agreed with Kaine, saying he was right about Spanish being the first European language spoken in the United States. It all ties back to Florida. In many textbooks that deal with the history of the Spanish language, there are statements similar to Kaine’s, said Sonia Ramírez Wohlmuth, a senior instructor of world languages at the University of South Florida. She referred us to page 211 of a textbook on language and linguistic diversity in the United States that says: ""Of the European explorers who reached North America during the Age of Discovery, the Spanish arrived first. ... Exploration of the Southeast began in 1513, when the first governor of Puerto Rico, Ponce de León, arrived on the coast of Florida during his quest for the fountain of youth. This marked the first recorded presence of the Spanish on what would eventually be U.S. soil."" In the late 1520s, an expedition led by Spanish conquistador Pánfilo de Narváez landed near present-day Tampa Bay. But it was a failure, because almost everyone was killed or died before they could report back, said Richard A. Rhodes, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley. Then there’s St. Augustine. Founded in 1565, St. Augustine is regarded as the United States’ oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin. It was founded by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, a conquistador from Spain. ""Spanish was the first language spoken by conquistadors and settlers who founded St. Augustine (San Agustín in Spanish, after the saint),"" said Evelina Guzauskyte, an associate professor of Spanish at Wellesley College. The British and the French did not arrive until later, and the Portuguese were occupying other lands, Guzauskyte said. The Observatory of the Spanish Language and Hispanic Cultures in the United States at Harvard University also told us about an explorer (born in what’s now Mexico to parents from Spain) who left an inscription in New Mexico in 1605, that says in Spanish: ""pasó por aquí el adelantado Juan de Oñate."" Archeology Southwest translates the full inscription to: ""There passed this way the Adelantado (conqueror) Don Juan de Oñate from the discovering of the South Sea on the 16th of April 1605."" The first permanent English settlement in North America was in 1607 at Jamestown, Va. The Pilgrims arrived until 1620 in present-day Massachusetts. Clinton’s campaign highlighted a PBS post about the history of Spanish in the United States. ""Spanish actually antedates English in the areas that now make up the composite United States — a fact that surprises many Americans,"" says part of the post. ""In terms of continuity and longevity in the United States, the Spanish language is second only to Native American languages that were spoken for centuries prior to colonization."" Our ruling Tim Kaine said, ""Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country."" Linguistic experts tell us that’s accurate. Even though English is the dominant language in the United States, the first permanent English settlement came 42 years after explorers from Spain founded St. Augustine in Florida. Their primary language was Spanish. Kaine’s statement rates True.",/factchecks/2016/nov/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-right-spanish-was-first-european-languag/
