Biden says Sanders has raised ‘a lot more money.’ He’s right
","Since the South Carolina and Super Tuesday primaries have dramatically winnowed the Democratic presidential field, two of the remaining candidates — former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — have focused their attacks on each other.  During a March 5 interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, Biden dismissed Sanders’ argument that Biden is winning because corporate interests want him to. ""It's ridiculous,"" Biden said. ""Bernie, you got beaten by overwhelming support I have from the African American community, Bernie. You got beaten because of suburban women, Bernie. You got beaten because of the middle class, hard-working folks out there, Bernie. You've raised a lot more money than I have, Bernie."" Here, we’ll focus on the last part of Biden’s statement, that Sanders has ""raised a lot more money"" than Biden has. We turned to the campaign-finance tracking site OpenSecrets.org for fundraising totals that have been reported by each candidate to the Federal Election Commission. These totals are complete through Jan. 31, but we added to them the totals announced (but not yet officially reported to the FEC) by each campaign through early March. We also collected data for the outside groups supporting each candidate, as reported by OpenSecrets through Feb. 21. Sanders has the support of a group affiliated with National Nurses United and a few smaller entities. (A different group, Our Revolution, which was created by Sanders aide Jeff Weaver, is not included in the data because it hasn’t yet released 2019 numbers.) Biden had the support of groups called Unite the Country, founded by Biden allies, as well as a now-defunct pro-Biden group called American Possibilities. Here’s the rundown:   So, even with a significant bump for Biden following his victories in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, Biden’s campaign fundraising still trails Sanders’ by a significant margin.  Combined, Sanders and his allied groups have raised more than $180 million, compared with $109 million for Biden and his allied groups. That’s a lead of about $71 million for Sanders — a figure we think qualifies as ""a lot more."" The money spent by outside groups supporting Biden narrows the margin a bit, but not much. We’ll note that Biden is more dependent on larger donations than Sanders is. According to OpenSecrets, more than 55% of Sanders’ donations have come from small donors — those giving less than $200. The comparable figure for Biden is 36%. Biden said, ""You’ve raised a lot more money than I have, Bernie."" The numbers change quickly, and there’s a lag in official reporting to the Federal Election Commission. Still, the best estimate is that Sanders has raised about $71 million more than Biden has since the start of the 2020 campaign.

Fact-checking Pence’s defense of response to Indiana HIV outbreak
","Vice President Mike Pence has pointed to his response to health crises in Indiana as a reason why he’s now the Trump administration’s top messenger on the U.S. coronavirus response. But his response to an HIV outbreak in Indiana while he was governor is getting new attention. A reporter challenged Pence about it in a Feb. 29 press conference, saying Pence did not follow the advice of his public health advisers who pushed for a needle exchange program at the outset.  Pence said he responded quickly. ""My health officials came to me. We immediately deployed health resources, but the truth was, is, HIV AIDS was being spread by people sharing needles and intravenous drug use,"" Pence said. ""And the state of Indiana did not allow for providing a needle exchange to citizens. But the CDC came in and made a recommendation, and I declared a public health emergency and made, for 30 days, a needle exchange available in the state of Indiana."" PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at Pence’s response to the Scott County HIV outbreak to examine whether his response was as swift as he claimed.  Scott County in rural southeastern Indiana saw a spike in HIV cases several years ago. Typically, the county had fewer than five HIV diagnoses a year. But from December 2014 to March 2015, health officials diagnosed HIV in about 80 people. By May 2016, nearly 200 people had been diagnosed with HIV. The outbreak was driven by people sharing needles to inject drugs, particularly the opioid pain medication Opana. Health investigators found that some people were injecting themselves between four and 15 times a day, and sharing needles with as many as five other people in one session. In January 2015, after the confirmation of about eight new cases, state health officials worried behind the scenes about an epidemic and began investigating. While the state knew about the number of cases, the public and Scott County health officials learned of the issue only by late February. (People were being diagnosed in a nearby county, and the lab results were sent there and to the state, but not to Scott County.) On March 26, 2015, Pence signed an executive order declaring a public health emergency in Scott County attributable to the HIV epidemic. The order allowed county officials to establish a short-term needle exchange program — which would have been illegal under Indiana law — so that drug users could turn in used syringes and needles and get new, sterile ones. The goal was to stop needle sharing and prevent the transmission of HIV and other diseases. Pence said he was ""opposed to needle exchange as anti-drug policy,"" but because there was a public health emergency, he would ""put the lives of the people of Indiana first."" The program began April 4, 2015. It was limited to Scott County residents. Pence in May 2015 signed a law making needle exchange programs, also known as syringe access programs, legal with limitations. The programs could be approved for a certain time, under specific circumstances (as a response to an outbreak, not to prevent one), and could not use state or federal funds. (A 2020 bill in the Indiana Legislature would extend syringe service programs in the state.) The state’s immediate response did not include what health policy experts say was the most important component: the needle exchange program. ""All the scientific research on the outbreak that I am aware of backs up this claim: The response was unnecessarily slow and was delayed by Gov. Pence's objections to needle exchange,"" said Forrest W. Crawford, an associate professor at Yale University who co-authored a 2018 study on the Scott County HIV outbreak and response. The state moved fast to identify cases through screening and interviewing sex- and drug-sharing partners, said Beth Meyerson, a research professor at the University of Arizona’s Southwest Institute for Research on Women and co-director of Indiana University's Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention. But the response was ""significantly delayed"" in terms of access to the needle exchange program, said Meyerson. This isn’t the first time Pence’s response to the outbreak is under scrutiny. Several media reports went over it when Pence was tapped as President Donald Trump’s running mate in 2016. Politico and the New York Times reported then about the amount of effort needed to persuade Pence to allow Scott County to implement a needle exchange program, which health researchers say is an effective tool to prevent disease transmissions and help drug users seek treatment. ""It was disappointing that it took so much effort to bring the governor on board,"" Indiana state Rep. Ed Clere told the New York Times. Clere, a Republican who has long advocated needle exchange programs, is cited among those who lobbied Pence to allow the program.  ""Pence intervened after significant pressure,"" Meyerson told PolitiFact. Scott County’s health officer in May 2016 said that the needle exchange program had ""a tremendously positive and dramatic impact"" in the community, notably decreasing new cases of HIV and hepatitis C. Needle exchanges aren’t the only response to an HIV outbreak, Meyerson noted. Access to screening and referrals to treatment are also needed, she said, and for that Scott County did open a ""one-stop shop."" It provided free HIV testing and information about HIV prevention, treatment and resources. The center also offered substance abuse help and assistance enrolling in the state’s health insurance program. Pence’s press secretary did not provide comment to PolitiFact. She referred us to Joey Fox, a former legislative director for the Indiana State Department of Health who served during the HIV outbreak in Scott County. Fox said he believed that when Pence spoke about an immediate action, he was referring to his response after a March 2015 meeting with federal and state health officials. After hearing recommendations to implement a comprehensive response that included syringe exchange among other measures, Pence declared the public health emergency, Fox said. ""The Pence administration had been engaged in the response from the first day,"" Fox said. The state sent epidemiological support, worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and implemented a public affairs campaign, he said. Fox said Scott County health officials also had to be reassured about the needle exchange program. ""If you didn't have the local public health and public safety officials on board, the program would fail and no one would be helped,"" Fox said. ""So, when the locals were ready and the governor was on board, he signed an executive order to suspend the application of state law and allow the local community to implement a program."" Pence said his administration ""immediately deployed health resources"" in response to an HIV outbreak in an Indiana County. After noticing a spike in HIV cases, state officials began investigating the causes of the outbreak and identifying people who might have been infected. However, a crucial component of the response — a needle exchange program — was authorized months after officials noticed the increase in HIV cases. Pence publicly opposed needle exchange programs, which were illegal in Indiana. He had to be persuaded to sign an executive order to suspend the law and allow the county to establish the program. Pence’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Rev. Barber slams DSCC for overlooking black candidates in NC Senate primaries
","When it comes to endorsements, North Carolina’s political parties mostly refrain from picking favorites in primary elections. The same is not true for organizations in Washington. This year the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is supporting Cal Cunningham in North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race. The DSCC picked Cunningham over Erica Smith, Trevor Fuller and Atul Goel, who are all vying to face incumbent Republican Thom Tillis. The DSCC’s decision didn’t go over well with the Rev. William Barber, a liberal activist from North Carolina. Smith, who is black, along with Cunningham is considered a top primary competitor. ""Every time this has happened in the past & the person they didn’t support was black, the candidate they picked ended up losing in the fall b/c Dems unnecessarily divided themselves in the primary,"" Barber tweeted on Feb. 20, adding that the DSCC should stay out of the primary. Is it true that every time the DSCC has endorsed a candidate in North Carolina’s US Senate primary, and overlooked a black Democrat, the endorsed candidate went on to lose? Martha Waggoner, a spokeswoman for Barber, said Barber had one race in mind, back in 2002. That year, ""the Democratic establishment went outside its normal way of doing business and endorsed Erskine Bowles in a primary race that included Dan Blue,"" she said. Bowles beat Blue in the Democratic primary, then went on to lose to Republican Elizabeth Dole. Blue is now the minority leader in the state Senate. ""Since Blue was the only previous Democratic African American candidate for U.S. Senate here, his use of ‘every time’ was referring to this instance,"" she said. But the claims by Waggoner and Barber are both inaccurate.  In recent years, several black candidates filed to run for Senate in North Carolina. And in 2008, the DSCC overlooked a black candidate to support Kay Hagan, who went on to win the seat. To check Barber’s claim, we searched for an election where: A black Democrat filed to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina, In the primary, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee supported a candidate who is not black, The DSCC’s chosen candidate went on to win. This situation happened with Hagan. North Carolina voters have only elected two Democrats to the U.S. Senate over the last 22 years: Hagan in 2008 and John Edwards in 1998. In 2008, five Democrats signed up to run against incumbent Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole: Hagan, Duskin Lassiter, Jim Neal, Howard Staley, and Marcus Williams. Williams, an attorney, was the only black candidate in the race. News reports show that the DSCC not only backed Hagan in the primary, but talked her into running.  Indyweek reported in 2008 that the DSCC, along with state Democratic leaders, ""talked Hagan into running last fall just weeks after she announced that she wouldn't."" The News & Observer reported in 2007 that Hagan was recruited by former Gov. Jim Hunt and New York Sen. Charles Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, after they had tried unsuccessfully to recruit state Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh. DSCC spokesman Matt Miller told Politico in 2008 that his group ""worked hard to get Hagan; we really thought Dole was vulnerable,"" he said, adding: ""Hagan has turned out to be a great candidate, all under the D.C. radar.""  Campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show the DSCC spent tens of thousands of dollars on Hagan’s campaign prior to the May 6, 2008, primary. In North Carolina, several black candidates have run for U.S. Senate in recent years. And the DSCC hasn’t endorsed any of them. But the DSCC’s pick has not usually worked out in the general election. In 2016, Ernest Reeves and Chris Rey were defeated in the Democratic primary by Deborah Ross, who was endorsed by the DSCC. In the general election, Ross lost to incumbent Republican Richard Burr. In 2014, Hagan was the incumbent. Reeves ran against her in the primary and lost. Hagan went on to lose to Tillis. In 2010, there were three black candidates: Ken Lewis, Ann Worthy and the same Marcus Williams from 2008. As in 2020, the DSCC supported Cunningham in the primary.  But it was Elaine Marshall who won the Democratic nomination. She then lost to Burr in the general election. Another of Barber’s Feb. 20 tweets was a little more on-point. ""People from DC picking candidates in NC hasn’t been a winning formula & opens up criticism of racial favoritism,"" Barber tweeted. Dating back to 2008, there have been four US Senate elections in North Carolina.  In one case, the DSCC’s candidate won the primary and the general election. In two cases, the DSCC-supported candidate won the primary but lost the general. And in one case, 2010, the DSCC backed a candidate who didn't even win the primary. When PolitiFact shared its findings with Barber, he credited Hagan’s 2008 win to ""Obama’s coattails."" ""It was an election like no other, and the endorsement still wasn't right. Let North Carolinians choose their own candidate. After the primary, everybody can get behind that person,"" he said in an email. Barber said that ""every time"" the Democratic establishment overlooked a black candidate and endorsed someone else in the U.S. Senate primary, that candidate went on to lose.  Records show that there was a black candidate, Marcus Williams, in the 2008 U.S. Senate race. That year, the DSCC backed Kay Hagan in the primary and she went on to beat incumbent Republican Elizabeth Dole. Barber’s claim was too sweeping. He’s right that the DSCC doesn’t have a great record in North Carolina. But he’s wrong to say the DSCC-backed candidate has lost ""every time"" it overlooked a black Democrat.

Mass shooter complained of racism at work, but noose incident occurred 5 years earlier
","Hours after a mass shooting in Milwaukee, claims surfaced that the gunman had been the victim of racism at the beer brewing complex where he worked and where the shooting occurred.

Police have withheld other details. But with regard to the claim we’re checking, here is what was known as of March 3, 2020, as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Shooter was black: It is confirmed that the shooter was black. Four of the victims were white. One was a Hispanic. They all knew each other. The shooter had not been fired: Ferrill, an electrician, worked for about 17 years at Molson Coors. Co-worker dispute: The shooter had been involved with a long-running dispute with a co-worker, one law enforcement source told the Journal Sentinel. A co-worker told the newspaper the shooter believed he was being discriminated against because he was African American, and that he had ongoing tensions with at least one of the victims. No formal racism complaints: Molson Coors said it is not aware of any formal complaints by the shooter to the company or government agencies about racist harassment. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission told the Journal Sentinel it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of employment discrimination charges, citing federal privacy laws. The state Equal Rights Division told the newspaper it has no record of any complaints filed by Ferrill against the brewery. Racism not a factor: Police issued a statement on March 4, 2020, saying that based on their preliminary investigation, ""neither race nor racism has been identified as a factor in this incident."" Noose incident: Five years ago, a noose was placed on or in the shooter’s locker at work. ""The employee was not working that day, our HR team notified him of the incident, it was investigated fully,"" Molson Coors said. The company said it offered human resources and security services to the employee, talked to managers about incident ""and we ensured everyone knew about our confidential paths to share discrimination or harassment complaints."" A few months after the noose incident, several racist notes were put through the slit of Ferrill's locker, a former employee told the Journal Sentinel.

Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Moore on target with prescription drug cost claim
","If there’s one issue many Democrats and Republicans agree on, it’s that prescription drug costs are too high. That point becomes particularly striking when U.S. costs are compared with drug prices in other developed nations. But just how much more expensive are prescriptions here than elsewhere? U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, made this claim in a Dec. 11, 2019 tweet: ""Prescription drug companies are charging Americans prices that are on average 4x higher than what's charged in other countries.""  Does that comparison check out? When asked for backup, Moore’s press secretary Samara Sheff pointed us to findings from the U.S. House’s Ways and Means Committee as well as an editorial from The Hill.  The committee compared drug prices in the U.S. with 11 countries using 79 drugs that were sold across 2017 and 2018.  The U.S. was compared alongside the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Australia, Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. Individual drug prices in the U.S. ranged from 708% to 4,833% higher than the combined mean price of the other 11 countries measured. On average, U.S. drug costs were 3.7 times higher than the combined average of the other 11. So that conclusion essentially matches Moore’s claim. A 2017 report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, which specializes in health care research, compared six top selling drugs between the U.S. and six other countries: Canada, the U.K., Germany, France, Australia and Norway. The study examined Advair which is often used to treat asthma, Humira, commonly used for arthritis and Crestor, a cholesterol prescription. On average, Advair was about four times higher in the U.S. than the compared countries. Humira was about twice as much and Crestor was also four times more.  In another study, conducted by the London-based International Federation of Health Plans, overall prescription drug costs were found to be about three times higher than the U.S. compared to the six countries of the U.K., United Arab Emirates, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa and the Netherlands.  Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, says there can be difficulties in accurately measuring global drug price comparisons. ""The broad qualitative conclusion that drug prices are much higher in the United States than in other countries is surely correct,"" Fiedler said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""But measuring drug prices — both in the US and abroad — is challenging because manufacturers often pay confidential rebates to purchasers."" Simon Haeder, assistant professor of public policy at Penn State University, said there are a few factors that make U.S. drug prices higher than other countries.  The primary reason cited by most scholars is a lack of competition in the U.S. For most medications, there is a lack of generic drug options available that could be cost efficient alternatives to more expensive brands.  Haeder argues that the path from the pharmaceutical company to the hands of the consumer is also full of middlemen who take a cut of profit of the drug, such as manufacturers, wholesalers and insurers.  ""There’s a bunch of different entities that want to make money,"" Haeder said.  That ultimately drives up the cost of the drug once it is ready to be sold.  Additionally, the federal government does little compared to other countries when it comes to negotiating drug prices. In a tweet, Moore said ""Prescription drug companies are charging Americans prices that are on average 4x higher than what's charged in other countries."" We found studies that support this claim, though at least one pouts the gap somewhat smaller. Other factors, of course, include which drugs and which companies are included in the comparison. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.

No, Bernie Sanders is not a communist, contrary to Scott Walker claim
","In his life out of public office, Scott Walker is nothing if not direct. The former Republican governor of Wisconsin has been prolific on Twitter since leaving office, and he has recently turned his attention to Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. One word keeps coming up. ""Bernie is a Communist who admires Communist dictators and he should never be President of the United States of America,"" Walker tweeted on Feb. 24, 2020. The label is hardly a first for Sanders.  Walker also made the claim in a column and several earlier tweets, one of which invoked Sanders’ oft-cited Soviet Union honeymoon. President Donald Trump said the same in a Feb. 2, 2020, interview before the Super Bowl. And former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg invoked communism while criticizing Sanders’ monetary policy at the Feb. 19, 2020, Democratic primary debate. Seems like it’s time to separate fact from rhetoric. Based on Sanders’ political views, is he a communist? When we asked Walker for evidence of his claim, a spokesman cited a laundry list of past actions, including Sanders praising leaders of communist governments, visiting the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and traveling to several communist countries. For the record, PolitiFact National rated a claim that Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union Mostly True in 2015 . It wasn’t exactly a traditional honeymoon, but Sanders and his wife left the day after their wedding to be part of a 12-person delegation for a sister city program between Burlington, Vt. — where Sanders was mayor — and the city of Yaroslavl. Fidel Castro was a diabolical dictator who Bernie Sanders praised because he had a great reading program. Bernie is a Communist who admires Communist dictators and he should never be President of the United States of America. 3/3 pic.twitter.com/0VEHXCKFy6 As further support, Walker’s spokesman, Jim Dick, described Sanders’ socialist policies and cited a Vladimir Lenin quote that ""the goal of socialism is communism."" (Walker tweeted the same line shortly after this statement was sent to PolitiFact Wisconsin.) That’s not exactly hard evidence. So let’s dig deeper. Sanders has distinguished himself in the presidential field with a platform that calls for universal health care and free access to public colleges and universities. Sanders — an independent in the U.S. Senate — describes himself as a democratic socialist. And for the record, he has said he is not a communist, in responding to Trump’s pre-Super Bowl assertion. Experts point to several clear dividing lines between Sanders’ philosophy and communism — while unanimously calling Walker’s label an exaggeration. Encyclopedia Britannica defines communism as a form of socialism, noting that Karl Marx and others in the 19th Century used the terms interchangeably. But the ideologies have diverged since, said Joshua Tucker, professor of politics at New York University. Socialism, as it plays out today in some European countries, is generally associated with a large social welfare state, including free healthcare and education, generous pensions and general ""cradle to grave"" security. Communism on the other hand typically involves a one-party government that owns all property and controls the means of production. In other words, the government exerts a great deal of control over both economic and individual behavior. ""(Under communist ideology) the state would own all the sort of large level companies – airports, factories, hospitals, all these sorts of things, and this is not what Sanders is talking about at all,"" Tucker said. ""He does want to see the state playing more of a role in reducing inequality in society, and one of the ways you do that is providing more social welfare benefits."" The means of reaching the desired outcome is also a key split between modern democratic socialism and communism, said Russell Muirhead, a professor of political science at Dartmouth College. ""Democratic socialists are committed in the first case to persuading citizens of their particular policies and views, and if they can’t persuade, they refuse to try to implement those policies. Democracy comes first,"" he said in an email. ""Communists are so sure that they have the whole truth that they’re willing to impose their policies even if they can’t persuade other people, even if it requires a sustained and brutal application of violence. That’s why we associate communism with tyranny."" Lowell Barrington, associate professor of political science at Marquette University, said Sanders has made himself ""vulnerable"" to attacks like Walker’s because he has spoken positively of communist leaders like Cuba’s Fidel Castro. But he echoed others in saying Sanders’ proposals are more in line with the northern European brand of socialism than the authoritarian communist regimes seen in the Soviet Union, Cuba and the People’s Republic of China. Said Tucker: ""The bottom line is, the way we classically think about communism, there’s no way you can call what Bernie Sanders is pushing for … communism. That’s scare-mongering."" Walker says without qualification that Sanders ""is a communist."" He offers as evidence Sanders’ past visits to communist countries and statements praising communist leaders.  But experts detail clear differences between Sanders’ democratic socialism — which focuses on democratically achieved expansion of social welfare programs — and any commonly accepted definition of communism. Sanders isn’t pushing for authoritarian rule, government ownership of all private property or an end to capitalism.

Wisconsin Assembly speaker's prison claim falls short
","Wisconsin Republicans sometimes zero in on Gov. Tony Evers’ pledge to reduce the state’s prison population by half as a sign Evers isn’t tough on crime. The latest to do so is Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Burlington. In a Feb. 13, 2020 newsletter to constituents, Vos touted the Assembly’s passage of a series of Republican-backed bills that proponents say would keep the state safer. Vos took aim at the governor in the email, saying Evers ""wants to release half of the prison population."" Evers has said for years he wants to address overcrowding in Wisconsin’s prison system. But he and his administration have also expressed the need to do it carefully and gradually. How does Vos’ claim rate? During the 2018 campaign, Evers told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he would consider releasing some inmates early, overhauling truth-in-sentencing and treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults, among other policies. He also said, during a Democratic debate, that cutting the prison population in half is ""a goal that’s worth accomplishing."" Former Gov. Scott Walker cited that exchange when we fact-checked a claim from Walker that Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" We rated Walker’s claim Half True. Evers stated that a 50% reduction is a goal, but didn’t put a timeframe on achieving it, while Walker’s claim made it sound as if the reduction would happen overnight. Experts noted that it’s possible to reduce the prison population over a longer period of time without releasing violent offenders before their sentence is up. When asked for backup for Vos’ new claim, his office cited our previous fact check — specifically the Evers comment from the debate. Vos communications director Kit Beyer also pointed to other media reports in which Evers or administration officials discussed the goal. But those articles don’t entirely bolster Vos’ position. They instead echo what we already considered in rating Walker’s claim. For instance, according to a June 30, 2019 article from Wisconsin Watch cited by Vos, the governor ""expressed optimism about his ability...to reduce by 50 percent the state’s prison population."" That article also included an interview with Corrections Secretary Kevin Carr in which Carr said they need to cut the population in a ""thoughtful, deliberate way.""  ""The governor didn't appoint me to this position and say, ‘Here's the keys to all the jails. Let 50 percent of the people out tomorrow,’"" Carr told Wisconsin Watch. Beyer also cited Evers’ support of legislation aimed at reforming the state’s prison system.  The three bills, introduced largely by Democrats, would allow inmates to potentially be eligible for parole if they complete an educational, vocational or treatment program; specifies situations in which a person’s parole or extended supervision can be revoked; and allows certain inmates to be released early from extended supervision.  Evers told the Wisconsin State Journal in a Jan. 9. 2020 article that the package ""would only move the needle slightly"" when it comes to decreasing the number of inmates. In any case, the bills didn’t make it to the Assembly floor before lawmakers adjourned for the year.  Does Evers want to reduce or release? There’s a distinct difference between the definition of ""release"" and ""reduce.""  Release, as defined by Merriam Webster, means ""to set free from restraint, confinement, or servitude."" Reduce is defined as ""to diminish in size, amount, extent, or number."" ""It’s unfortunate that Wisconsin Republicans continue to use falsehoods and fearmongering to push our state in the wrong direction on reforming our criminal justice system,"" Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said he hasn’t seen a specific inmate-reduction plan from Evers, which makes it easy for Vos to put words in the governor’s mouth.  No matter what, Streit said, there is no quick way to achieve such a goal. ""There are strategies,"" he said. ""They’d take 10 years or more. You can’t promise that you’re going to turn around on a dime."" Vos claimed in a newsletter that ""Evers wants to release half of the prison population."" The governor has, more than once, expressed the goal of reducing the state prison population by 50% as part of broader criminal justice reform. He also supported recent legislation that would have made changes to parole and extended supervision rules, in some cases allowing certain inmates to be released early. But that’s a far cry from releasing half the prison population overnight, which is what Vos’ claim suggests. And Evers and his supporters have been clear from the start that this is a goal to be achieved over time, through steps that prevent fewer people from entering prison in the first place. Our definition for Half True is a statement that ""is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That’s how we rate Vos’ claim.

Joe Biden’s Pants on Fire claim about his arrest in South Africa
","An unsubstantiated story told by former Vice President Joe Biden about getting arrested while trying to see Nelson Mandela inspired a wave of fact-checking, a pointed interview on Fox News about his inability to get the facts right, and a skit on Saturday Night Live. ""Now here’s an honest-to-goodness true story based loosely on fake events,"" said John Mulaney, playing Biden in the show’s cold open. ""The year was 19-Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. And me and Nelson Mandela were pallin’ around South Africa, Green Book-style."" The actual version of the story Biden told didn’t go exactly that way. But reviews by journalists have found it similarly unsupported by facts. Here’s what Biden said at a Feb. 11 rally in Columbia, S.C.: ""This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island."" (It’s actually Robben Island.) The New York Times recounted how Biden made similar statements two other times, but reporters could not find evidence to back up his claim that he was arrested. The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker then gave Biden Four Pinocchios. Snopes and Factcheck.org also fact-checked his statements. In the language of PolitiFact, it was a Pants on Fire story. We contacted Biden’s campaign to ask about his initial claims that he was arrested, and the later accounts in which he said he was stopped, and did not get a reply.  In February, Biden said that the incident in South Africa occurred in 1977, but Snopes found news reports that showed that it was December 1976 when 13 members of Congress traveled to Lesotho. (Lesotho is a small country within South Africa, so it would be possible to visit both countries.) The African-American Institute of New York sponsored the conference the politicians attended, UPI reported. We searched articles by major newspapers for any accounts of Biden’s trip in 1977 and found no mention of any arrest. Over his career, Biden spoke out against apartheid in South Africa and criticized the South African government, but the accounts never stated he was arrested. When Mandela died in 2013, Biden’s written statement recounted his visit to South Africa decades earlier. In that account, he made no mention of an arrest, but he did describe airport officials trying to separate him from his African American colleagues. ""When I exited the plane I was directed to one side of the tarmac, while the African American congressmen traveling with me were sent to the other side,"" said the written statement. ""I refused to break off, and the officials finally relented."" When Biden signed the condolence book for Mandela during a visit to the South African embassy, he recounted that he traveled to South Africa in 1977 but was unable to meet with Mandela. Biden did not mention an arrest or being detained. In Biden’s 2007 book ""Promises to Keep,"" he mentions traveling to South Africa in 1977 but makes no claim that he was arrested. In his February telling, Biden said that he was arrested with our ""U.N. ambassador."" Andrew Jackson Young Jr., a Georgia congressman, was on the trip in 1976, UPI reported. President Jimmy Carter appointed Young as ambassador to the United Nations in January 1977. When we interviewed Young on March 4, he said neither one of them was arrested in South Africa. ""I wouldn’t say we were arrested,"" he said.  Young told PolitiFact that he was arrested twice in his life — once in Atlanta and once in Savannah. He said that it often happens that when people recount stories about civil rights decades ago, they have memories that result in conflicting stories.  ""I get this all time, (people say) ‘I went to jail with you in Birmingham.’ I say, no, you didn’t go to jail with me in Birmingham. I didn’t go to jail in Birmingham,"" he said. Young, who said he visited South Africa multiple times in the 1970s, did recall traveling with Biden to South Africa. Young said that either South African police or the military would not allow the congressmen to get back to their plane at the airport and detained them briefly behind a chained fence before letting them through to their airplane. Young recalled U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York arguing with authorities. The South African authorities ""were used to black people bowing heads and being humble, and Charlie Rangel was anything but humble,"" Young said. Young said he considers Biden a longtime friend and would love to see him as president, although he told PolitiFact he hasn’t endorsed him.  By late February, Biden and his campaign had changed his story. Following the South Carolina debate Feb. 25, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Biden was ""separated from his party at the airport."" Days later, Biden himself walked back the arrest remark in an interview on CNN on Feb. 28 . Biden said when he exited the plane with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, officials tried to separate him from the African American congressmen. ""They had me get off a plane — the Afrikaners got on in the short pants and their guns. Let me off first and moved me in a direction totally different. I turned around and everybody, the entire black delegation, was going another way. I said, 'I'm not going to go in that door that says white only. I'm going with them.' They said, 'You're not, you can't move, you can't go with them.' And they kept me there until finally I decided that it was clear I wasn't going to move,"" Biden said. The officials then took the members of Congress through a baggage claim area to a restaurant.  ""When I said ‘arrested,’ I meant I was not able, I was not able to move, cops, Afrikaners would let me go with them, made me stay where I was. I guess I wasn't arrested, I was stopped. I was not able to move where I wanted to go."" On March 1, Fox News’ Chris Wallace asked Biden about his story about being arrested and asked: ""Were you confused, or were you just trying to embellish a story?"" Biden replied: ""No. No, what I was trying to — what I was doing was talking about the fact that I was strongly opposed to apartheid. When we landed and we were going to Soweto actually. We landed in Johannesburg and the Afrikaners took me off the plane and took me into one direction, wanted me to go through a white-only door, and in fact, I wouldn't move. I said everybody else is going through to another door, I'm going with the black delegation that I came with."" He continued: ""They said, no, you can't. And I said, I'm staying here, I'm not going to move. And they would not let me move anywhere, so I guess I should have said, I was detained, I was not able to move forward.  So what they finally did was they went out, and they cleared out a baggage claim area, took us all up through the baggage claim area, up through a restaurant."" One other part of Biden’s story doesn’t match up. He said that he was arrested on the streets of Soweto trying to see Mandela at Robben Island. Soweto is a neighborhood in Johannesburg. Robben Island is more than 700 miles away off the coast of Cape Town.  Biden said, ""I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see (Nelson Mandela) on Robbens Island."" There is no evidence to prove that Biden was arrested in South Africa in the 1970s while trying to visit Mandela. Biden has since walked back his remarks to say that when he exited the airplane, officials tried to separate him from African American congressmen or detained him. This statement rates Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/04/joe-biden/joe-bidens-pants-fire-claim-about-his-arrest-south/

Lou Dobbs says United States ‘screening fewer people’ for coronavirus than other countries
","Fox Business host Lou Dobbs, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and his allies, challenged the president’s top health official recently on the administration’s handling of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. Dobbs criticized Health and Human Secretary Alex Azar over a lack of transparency in the agency’s handling of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 91,000 people globally across 73 countries and led to more than nine American deaths.  ""There’s a better ratio of testing for the coronavirus in other countries than we maintain here,"" Dobbs said during the March 2 interview on his TV show. ""We’re actually screening fewer people because we don’t have appropriate testing."" Azar countered that the Trump administration has taken recent steps to roll back regulations and increase the availability of diagnostic test kits to ""hundreds and thousands and millions.""  The United States is set to significantly expand its testing capabilities in the coming days and weeks, but Dobbs is correct that the country has lagged behind other nations so far. ""It is true that diagnostic capacity in the U.S. has been lower than in some other countries, but that is changing,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. It’s hard to pinpoint how many people have been tested for the coronavirus, both in the U.S. and around the world. The World Health Organization doesn’t track the number of tests administered in each country, and the numbers that are available are constantly updating. In a statement to PolitiFact, a Fox News spokesperson representing Dobbs cited data from the WorldOMeter, a real-time tool that ""shows estimated current numbers based on statistics and projections from the most reputable official organizations,"" according to its website. Using estimates derived from official government sources, the WorldOMeter says at least eight countries — South Korea, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Vietnam and Turkey — have given more tests relative to the size of their populations than the United States.  That lines up with experts’ analyses and with what multiple news outlets have reported.   Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said South Korea ""has screened at least thousands, and Guangdong, China, has screened at least hundreds of thousands,"" citing a WHO report on the outbreak in China, where the virus was first detected. South Korea ramped up testing by building drive-thru screening clinics for speedy assessments, according to local reports. Other countries, like Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Italy have also conducted thousands of diagnostic tests. ""We have done nothing like what other countries have done,"" Lipsitch said, noting that the U.S. had, until recently, limited not only the number of labs that were allowed to conduct tests on suspected cases, but also the number of patients that were eligible to be screened. It’s difficult to say just how far behind the U.S. has fallen, due to the murkiness around the number of administered tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped releasing a public count of tests on March 2. The administration’s public statements haven’t cleared it up. On Feb. 29, the CDC reported testing 472 Americans. A day later, Azar told ABC News the U.S. had tested over 3,600 people. And a spokesperson for HHS, Azar’s agency, told us on March 3 that the CDC had tested samples from more than 1,200 patients. ""I don't know how to track U.S. tests any more,"" Lipsitch said.  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar speaks at the White House about the coronavirus on Feb. 28, 2020, in Washington. (AP/Vucci) The CDC stopped posting testing data as more state and local public-health labs have been brought into the fold, said Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, said during a March 3 briefing. ""With more and more testing done at states, these numbers would not be representative of the testing being done nationally,"" she said. An HHS spokesperson told us that the department doesn’t know how many additional tests have been administered by those state and local labs, adding that those labs can now test up to 15,000 people and are expected to be able to test as many as 75,000 people by March 6. The U.S. test count should rise into the millions as IDT, a commercial manufacturer, and other commercial and academic labs begin producing their own tests soon, according to HHS. The government’s initial testing effort was hindered by flaws with the CDC’s early test kits and restrictions that had limited which labs could run the tests and which patients could be tested. When the first U.S. coronavirus was detected, the country brushed aside the WHO test used by other nations and leaned on the CDC to develop and mass produce a more complicated test capable of detecting other viruses in addition to the coronavirus, according to reports. The test kits went out in early February. But some state labs that received them reported that flaws in the tests were triggering inconclusive results. Those states had to ship samples out to the CDC’s offices in Atlanta for results until the CDC fixed the problem weeks later. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration has given labs and hospitals across the country the go-ahead to administer their own tests before the FDA finishes reviewing them, so long as those tests are proven to work. That should lead to more testing, experts said. The CDC also modified its screening criteria to expand testing for some people with severe respiratory symptoms who did not travel to China or come into known contact with a coronavirus patient. Previously, travel to China or exposure to the virus were preconditions for screening. Adequate testing is essential to getting an accurate count of U.S. cases, experts said. Testing is also key for treating patients and identifying people who might be infected but don’t show symptoms, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. ""The latest data suggests the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as a couple of weeks,"" Watanabe said.  Despite the recent acceleration, Lipsitch said U.S. testing is happening ""very slowly and at a level that is still paltry"" compared with some other countries. Dobbs said that the United States is ""actually screening fewer people (for the coronavirus than other countries) because we don’t have appropriate testing."" Experts told us that to date, the United States has lagged behind other countries, though numbers are imprecise. An error with the CDC’s early test kits contributed to the United States’ relatively low screening numbers. The administration has taken steps to make testing more widely available. With that additional information, we rate Dobbs’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/04/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-says-united-states-screening-fewer-peopl/

Bernie Sanders is right: Saudi Arabia is more focused on the conflict in Yemen than fighting ISIS
","Bernie Sanders delivered his long-awaited speech on democratic socialism last week, also outlining his plan for fighting ISIS. Sanders called for a broad international coalition but stressed that Muslim nations must shoulder the fight, which he called ""a struggle for the soul of Islam."" So far, he said, wealthy and powerful countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have done very little. ""Saudi Arabia, turns out, has the third-largest defense budget in the world,"" Sanders said on Nov. 19. ""Yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."" Sanders is correct that Saudi Arabia’s military budget is the third largest in the world. But is he also right that the Saudis aren’t prioritizing ISIS? In a word, yes. A striking scaleback The Saudi embassy in Washington did not return our requests for comment. But the Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times article that says, ""Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."" In 2014, the Houthis — a longstanding Shiite separatist group in northern Yemen, a country with a Sunni majority — rebelled against the Yemeni government and seized the presidential palace. After months of tense peace brokered by the United Nations, the Houthis took over the government and placed the president under house arrest in early 2015. Saudi Arabia, which has a Sunni majority and is ruled by a Sunni monarch, led a 10-state Arab coalition and launched airstrikes against the Houthis on March 26. It pledged to use 100 warplanes and 150,000 soldiers. In a month, the Saudis conducted 2,415 sorties (a deployment of an aircraft), releasing at least 1,000 air-to-ground weapons. Meanwhile, as part of the U.S.-led coalition of 60 countries, Saudi Arabia has also been involved with the international effort against ISIS since September 2014. Since then, it has deployed just four F-15 fighter jets and an unspecified number of Typhoon combat jets against ISIS. (Saudi state media trumpeted the participation, releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them.) Experts said Saudi Arabia doesn’t publicize the exact number of airstrikes it has carried out, but the data shows that the amount of non-U.S. airstrikes overall has been scaled back since the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen began in late March. Conversely, the United States has beefed up its strikes. Here’s a chart from Airwars.org, a project tracking the international air war against ISIS, that demonstrates this point:  Data compiled by Airwars.org shows that from Dec. 1, 2014, to Nov. 16, 2015, Arab allies conducted just 143 of the 2,827 airstrikes in Syria, 90 of which occurred before April 3 (intervention in Yemen began March 26). For comparison, Saudi Arabia sometimes conducted as many as 125 strikes a day against the Houthis, according to the BBC. ""Bottom line, Bernie Sanders is right. All the evidence points to it,"" said Chris Woods, an investigative journalist who leads the Airwars project. ""Clearly, we saw with the Saudis a capability unleashed in Yemen that we never saw in Syria."" ""The volume of Saudi military forces deployed to combat the Houthis puts the Saudi deployment against ISIS to shame,"" said David Weinberg, an expert on the Gulf monarchies at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy. Weinberg looked at tallies from the Defense Department which are consistent with Airwars.org data. He also noted a decline in the number of non-U.S. airstrikes in Syria and ""a pitiful lack of participation by America’s Arab allies in what was supposedly unveiled as a joint U.S-Arab effort when it was launched last fall."" According to the New York Times article cited by the Sanders campaign, the Saudis flew their last strikes in Syria in September, Jordan in August, and the UAE in March. Conflicting crises Riyadh has its reasons for prioritizing the Houthis over ISIS. Among them: Yemen’s proximity, Iran’s gains in the region, sectarianism and, simply put, practicality. ""Yemen is the soft underbelly of the kingdom, and Iranian presence there through its support of Houthis is viewed as an existential threat to the kingdom,"" said David Ottaway, the Middle East specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center. ""In the end, Syria doesn’t border Saudi Arabia like Yemen does,"" said Lori Plotkin Boghardt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""And more fundamentally, the Saudis view Assad as the root of the ISIS problem and have argued from the beginning that Assad has to be defeated first in order to defeat ISIS."" Saudi Arabia is also somewhat relying on the United States to take on ISIS, added Weinberg of the Defense of Democracies. It’s also politically easier for the Sunni kingdom to mobilize public opinion there against radical Shiites like the Houthis rather than radical Sunni terrorists like ISIS, he said. The United States, for its part, supports the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen (the Houthis’ slogan is ""Death to America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews, Victory to Islam""), despite concerns over civilian casualties and possible war crimes. What’s more, Boghardt pointed out, ""the irony and the danger"" is that the conflict in Yemen has given al-Qaida and ISIS room to operate there. As for ISIS, there’s no question that the Saudis are aware of the threat it poses. The terrorist group has repeatedly targeted the kingdom, bombing mosques and detonating car bombs. Beyond military engagement, the Saudis have foiled terrorist plots and arrested hundreds of ISIS supporters. But experts say the kingdom could be doing a lot more. ""Saudi Arabia really should be doing more to militarily combat the twin scourges of ISIS and al-Qaida,"" Weinberg said. ""Bernie Sanders is right that we should expect more from our Saudi allies in the fight against terror in Syria as well as beyond."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."" This is an accurate assessment. The Saudis have prioritized the conflict in Yemen over the fight against ISIS, as evidenced by the amount of resources it has committed to both crises.

Gov. Greg Abbott says traffic congestion costs Texas drivers up to $1,500 a year
","Two weeks before the Nov. 3, 2015, election, Gov. Greg Abbott penned an op-ed that ran in the Dallas Morning News on Oct. 16, 2015, and again in the Austin American- Statesman three days later, urging voters to support a state constitutional proposition to funnel more dollars to funding Texas roads. He made the case by citing what daily traffic congestion costs Texas motorists in dollars, over the course of a year. ""Road congestion costs rush-hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year,"" Abbott said. ""And in Houston, it’s even more -- almost $1,500 a year."" Traffic in the state’s major cities can be awful. Does it really cost Texans up to an extra $1,500 a year? Replying to our inquiry, Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the governor drew on research in the 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard issued August 2015 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute. The institute has been compiling this data since 1984. In fact, the institute was subject to a 2012 PolitiFact Georgia fact-check questioning the costs Atlanta residents bear to get around town. That claim was ruled Mostly True. For our part, we reached out to Tim Lomax, a senior research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, to get a better handle on the math. The group calculates the cost of traffic congestion using four sets of numbers: - the travel delay (amount of extra time a trip takes compared to ""free-flowing conditions"") during commuting times (6-10 a.m. and 3-7 p.m. Monday-Friday) divided by the commuter population, using figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. - the travel delay during off-peak non-commuting times (all other times) divided by the total number of people in the urban area. - excess fuel consumption from being stuck in traffic calculated using the state average cost per gallon for gasoline during peak commuting times. - excess fuel consumption during off-peak non-commuting times. And, according to the institute, the peak congestion cost for Texans in 2014 came out to $17.67 per hour for personal travel. In Houston, the number-crunchers found a 61-hour average yearly delay per commuter and an excess fuel consumption of 29 gallons at $3.12 (average price for a gallon of gasoline in Texas in 2014) for a total congestion cost of $1,490 per commuter, according to the scorecard. When we took a look, however, the math worked out differently. We multiplied the yearly delay (61 hours) by $17.67, and added that to the excess fuel consumption rate (29 gallons at $3.12 per gallon) and got a lower annual average cost of $1168. Our calculations for Austin and Dallas also came up short ($987.48 instead of TTI’s $1159; Dallas came out to $1005.15 compared to the scorecard’s $1185; we found San Antonio to have a cost of $839.88, instead of $1,002). We went back to Lomax to explain the math discrepancy. He said the total congestion cost Abbott and others cite ($1,490 per year per commuter for Houston) includes both peak travel and off-peak travel times; the tables in the scorecard only show figures for peak travel times. Lomax said the scorecard focused on ""numbers that seem relevant,"" and that most people are concerned with what their daily commute costs them. However, he also said that total congestion cost is important to use because it calculates for all times of the day. Critics question calculations Joe Cortright, an urban economist at City Observatory, has been critical of the Urban Mobility Scorecard for years, and often is cited by other urban transportation organizations, as well as in the  2012 PolitiFact Georgia fact-check. We spoke with him over the phone to better understand his qualms. For him, the congestion cost figure is overblown and used mainly to justify the need for more roads by transportation departments. City Observatory is a Knight Foundation-funded think tank focused on debunking ""misconceptions"" in urban research and city planning. The Transportation Institute’s travel delay compares the extra time it takes to get to your destination due to congestion, compared to how long it would take in free-flow conditions. Cortright argues it’s unreasonable to expect there to be zero congestion on roads during peak times, and impossible to increase the supply of roads to the extent that there would be no travel delays. Also, he says if roads are increased to handle that demand, more people could end up on the roads creating congestion after all. If you can’t drive faster than the speed limit, that represents a cost to you, he said. ""I’m not sure anybody, as a matter of public policy, would argue that makes sense."" Another component of the total congestion cost is excess fuel consumption. Lomax said the institute uses the state average fuel price for each year. While fuel costs have declined steadily since August 2014, that won’t be reflected until next year’s scorecard. Lomax added that fuel prices account for less than 10 percent of the total congestion cost, and most of that congestion cost is travel time. The Transportation Institute partnered with Inrix, a Seattle-based traffic data provider for this year’s scorecard. Inrix had its own travel time index, which didn’t account for traffic volumes on different roads. The Inrix method would give ""every piece of road the same weight,"" Lomax said in an email, so a portion of the West Loop in Houston would be considered equal to a more sparsely traveled road. The Institute’s method gives more weight to heavily traveled areas such as the 610 Loop because ""it carries a lot more people."" ""Our swings, whether up or down, were not nearly as big as their changes,"" Lomax said. Cortright with City Observatory also criticizes the Transportation Institute’s lack of peer review in its research. Asked about how the group gathers its data and why a peer review doesn’t occur, Lomax said TTI has a timely topic with a limited shelf life, and does not ""wait around six months"" for other people to look at the data. Todd Litman with the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, a Canadian independent research organization based in Victoria, British Columbia, criticizes the Urban Mobility Report for ""overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits"" and for not incorporating research methods, such as a dedicated literature review. PolitiFact Georgia’s claim from TTI on congestion costs for Atlanta residents cited a University of Connecticut civil and environmental engineering professor Norman Garrick, who said the report doesn’t take other factors such as health care and the environment into account. Research sponsors of the Texas Transportation Institute include the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Texas Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation, often the same organizations that cite the institute’s research as proof of a need for more funding for new roadways. Asked how this could affect the work done, Lomax said it’s not a factor. While TTI has several sponsors, he said the mobility scorecard only has two sponsors: the institute and Inrix. At any given time, anywhere from 250 to 300 projects could be going on at once at TTI, he said. Our ruling Greg Abbott said ""Road congestion costs rush hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year. And in Houston, it’s even more -- almost $1,500 a year."" Abbott’s claim was based on an annual Urban Mobility Report produced by the Texas Transportation Institute. While his figures match those in the report, critics have raised significant questions about how the numbers are calculated, as well as the premise that normal traffic conditions result in a congestion cost to motorists. They also point to the institute’s sponsors, most of which are transportation agencies that can be expected to use the report to advocate for additional funding for road projects.

"['Florida', 'Guns', 'Greg Steube']","
Oregon college shooting was on a gun-free campus, lawmaker says
","The sponsor of a bill that would allow concealed weapons on Florida’s college campuses said his legislation would help prevent mass shootings like the attack at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, which he described as a gun-free zone. Whether the school was a gun-free zone or not emerged as a point of contention at a Nov. 19 House Judiciary Committee hearing on HB 4001. Its sponsor, state Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, disagreed with testimony against the bill from Austin Engelbrecht, a lobbyist for Florida State University. Engelbrecht said Oregon law allows students to bring guns on campuses, but it was still the police, not a gun owner, who stopped the Umpqua attack. Steube responded that guns were not allowed at Oregon schools. ""Oregon is a gun-free zone. The state of Oregon allows each university the ability to decide for themselves whether it's a gun-free zone or not,"" Steube said. ""The community college where the shooting occurred was a gun-free zone. Don't believe me, look it up on your cell phones."" We decided to figure out whether Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., allowed guns on its campus or not. Exception to the rule Christopher Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old enrolled at Umpqua, killed eight students and an assistant professor and injured nine others before police arrived and wounded him in a shootout on Oct. 1, 2015. Harper-Mercer then killed himself, ending the deadliest mass shooting in Oregon’s modern history. Some gun rights advocates said the shooting could have been prevented if campuses weren’t gun-free zones — that is, the schools restrict students, teachers or anyone else from having a gun on school property. Steube used the shooting as an example of why HB 4001 is necessary, citing an Umpqua policy that bars guns from campus and therefore exposed students to danger. The school’s student code of conduct lists the ""possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms,"" among other weapons and dangerous chemicals or devices, on college property or at college-sponsored events as a punishable offense. There’s a similar policy spelled out on Umpqua’s website. The clause ""without written authorization"" is important. There is a policy prohibiting guns at Umpqua Community College, as Steube said. But students are allowed to have guns on campus if they have a concealed carry permit — essentially what Steube’s HB 4001 wants to codify in Florida. His bill, which cleared the committee process to be heard in the 2016 legislative session, would apply to all colleges and universities, which would not be able to restrict concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns. While the Oregon University System banned guns in the 1970s, a concealed weapons law from 1989 said only the state’s Legislature can make rules on gun possession. The law was at the center of a challenge by a Western Oregon University student who was suspended in 2009 for bringing a concealed handgun on campus. The student had a permit for the gun. The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the university system’s ban was beyond its authority and was invalid, so concealed carry permit holders could bring weapons on campus. (Having the gun out in the open was still not allowed.) Oregon is currently one of eight states that allow students to carry concealed handguns on postsecondary campuses — the others are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah, Wisconsin and Texas, which recently passed a bill that takes effect in August 2016. Legally speaking, community colleges can neither arm their own security guards nor remove people with guns from campus. On Nov. 9, Umpqua began paying for an armed sheriff’s deputy to act as armed security, because the school couldn’t directly hire an armed guard. Steube acknowledged the 2011 Oregon court ruling to PolitiFact Florida, but he said schools are now allowed to set their own policies prohibiting weapons. ""I stated in committee that state law allows (concealed) carry in Oregon but the school banned guns,"" Steube told PolitiFact Florida via email. ""My statement was an accurate reflection of the law and policy."" The State Board of Higher Education in 2012 did create a policy that banned students, employees, contractors, ticketholders to university events and people renting university property from carrying guns on university property, according to The Oregonian newspaper. If someone had a concealed carry permit, they could bring the gun on campus, but he or she could not take it into a building or sports venue. There were exceptions for police, ROTC members, people in off-campus housing, and shooting and hunting clubs. But keep in mind, that policy was for the state’s seven universities, not its 17 community colleges. Their governing boards each set their own rules. Umpqua’s ban on guns doesn’t prevent students with a valid concealed weapons permit from bringing guns on campus. Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis told us the school’s gun-free policy didn’t apply to students with a valid permit. ""UCC was never designated as a ‘gun-free zone’ by any signage or policy,"" she said. ""Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus."" It has been widely reported that students with firearms were on the Umpqua campus on the day Harper-Mercer attacked. One particularly harrowing account included the experience of student John Parker, an Army veteran who was carrying a concealed handgun on Oct. 1. ""When I got into the room that was locked down, one of the professors asked if anyone was concealed carry,"" Parker told Reuters. ""I raised my hand and said: ‘Don’t worry, nobody is coming through that door.’ "" Parker was in a building away from the shooting. He told MSNBC that a professor convinced him to stay put lest he be targeted by the shooter or mistaken for the suspect by police responding to 911 calls. Our ruling Steube said Oregon’s Umpqua Community College ""was a gun-free zone."" The school does have a policy generally prohibiting firearms on campus. However, Oregon law allows for students with valid concealed carry permits to bring guns on school grounds with some restrictions. An Umpqua official confirmed that students with concealed carry licenses are allowed to bring them on campus in compliance with state law, just as Steube wants to see in Florida. Steube’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/24/greg-steube/oregon-college-shooting-was-gun-free-campus-lawmak/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Women', 'Texas', 'Wendy Davis']","
Wendy Davis says Texas lawmakers cut 150,000 women from health care, drove up Medicaid-funded births
","Wendy Davis recalled recent Texas history while weighing in on the Republican push to defund Planned Parenthood. In a September 2015 interview on MSNBC’s ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,"" the former Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee and state senator responded to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida telling a Des Moines TV station he favors transferring all funding from Planned Parenthood to health centers that do not provide abortions. The funding shifts that Republicans seek nationally, Davis charged, will diminish women’s access to breast cancer screenings, contraceptive care and other health services. Looking back, Davis said that after Texas reduced funding for family planning care, ""over 150,000 real women lost the only health care that they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs. So, not only does it harm real women, it costs taxpayers more."" Did she get that all those effects right? Legislative moves To recap, the 2011 Legislature drove down spending in a state family planning program by more than $70 million (from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million) in 2012-13 and block family planning aid that flowed through a Medicaid-supported program from going to providers associated with abortions. Republican lawmakers also moved to remove Planned Parenthood from the state’s Women’s Healthcare Program, which provides low-income women access to family planning care. About two years later, legislators imposed stricter health and safety standards on clinics that perform abortions, a move expected to reduce the number of clinics from around 40 to 10; the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in November 2015 to review the law. Davis’ comments seemed curious in part because we found True in September 2015 a claim that Texas state government is ""funding women’s health services at historically high levels."" Most recently, the 2015 Legislature signed off on nearly $285 million in spending on several women’s health efforts, including $50 million for family planning services, in 2016-17. Per what Davis said, we  looked into whether more than 150,000 women lost the only health care they had and whether the Texas actions drove up the number of births paid for through Medicaid. Davis offers backup Davis told us by phone her ""over 150,000"" figure came from a Texas Department of State Health Services report filed during a 2013 meeting of the State Health Services Council, which consists of nine members who gather feedback on the agency’s proposed rules and make recommendations to the agency and the overarching Health and Human Services Commission. Davis said: ""The report in the hearing showed that in 2013, the amount of women served (by the DSHS Family Planning Program) was 47,322, which was a decrease from 202,968 clients served in 2011,"" indicating ""a 77 percent decrease in the number of women served."" That would be a decrease of 155,646 women served—more than 150,000. That program, the state says, helps clinics provide comprehensive low-cost family planning and reproductive health care services to women and men. According to the state, the services help individuals determine the number and spacing of their children, reduce unintended pregnancies, positively affect future pregnancy and birth outcomes, and improve general health. A 2013 report An online search landed the report Davis mentioned and her cited figures as part of the council’s Nov. 21, 2013, meeting agenda. Yet the report, ""DSHS Family Planning Program Client Count and Average Cost Per Client, FY 2010-2013,"" didn’t specify women served; rather, it presented the ""number of women and men"" combined who received services from the DSHS Family Planning Program in the chosen years. So, how many women may have lost services? Additional inquiry led us to Enrique Marquez, a commission spokesman, who emailed us a chart indicating 181,460 women were served by the DSHS Family Planning Program in the state’s fiscal 2011, which ran through August 2012, while in fiscal 2013--after the actions by the 2011 Legislature--45,335 women were served. That’s a difference of 136,125--though that’s also without taking into account a decrease of 12,096 in women served by the state’s Women’s Health Program, which provides birth control, cancer screenings, annual exams and STD tests for low-income women. Women served by DSHS Family Planning Program and Women’s Health Program, FY 2011 - FY 2013 Program FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Difference (FY 2013 - FY 2011) DSHS Family Planning Program 181,460 76,898 45,335 136,125 decrease Women’s Health Program/Texas Women’s Health Program 127,536 126,473 115,440 12,096 decrease Total Decrease 148,221   Add those up and you get 148,221, close to the 150,000 figure offered by Davis. Did women lose their only health care? Davis did not show nor could we determine the number of women who lost the only health care they had, as she put it. By email, HHSC spokesman Bryan Black said the agency has no way of estimating the number of women who were solely getting care through a state program. Separately, Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Texas, agreed with Davis that many women relied on its clinics for health care as did Janet Realini, who chairs the Texas Women’s Healthcare Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that says it’s dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women, babies and families by assuring access to preventive care for women. Researchers for the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, a project partnering with Ibis Reproductive Health, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, have been studying the effects of the changes legislated in 2011 and 2013. The researchers told us Davis was likely right about the women losing their only health care, but they also said there’s no way to pin that. Medicaid-funded births We previously found True a claim that more than half the state’s births are paid for by Medicaid. For this story, we looked into whether Davis was correct about Medicaid-funded birth costs increasing more than $130 million in a year. Davis told us she drew that figure from a January 2013 report, ""Texas Women’s Healthcare in Crisis,"" by the coalition chaired by Realini. That report noted a state projection of 23,000 additional Medicaid births in 2014-15, according to HHSC’s request for legislative appropriations covering 2014-15. The report, drawing on the same state projection, went on: ""Budget cuts to DSHS Family Planning program will increase Medicaid costs by at least $136 million by 2015."" The HHSC’s appropriations request at the time said those costs were projected to total $33 million in the year through August 2013 and an additional $103 million in fiscal 2014-15. By phone, Davis conceded she was off by saying the $130 million would accrue in a year; it was over two years. Separately, Realini cautioned, when we asked, that the presented projections covered three years, not one. Also, she said, the coalition hadn’t done a follow-up report. Over seven weeks, we asked the commission how much Medicaid births have cost taxpayers for each of the past five years, but didn’t field a response to that. Separately, neither the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare in Washington, D.C., nor outside experts could immediately provide such detail. So, did the rate of Medicaid-funded births surge? We inquired into whether the projections played out. To our inquiry, Marquez emailed a chart stating that in 2011, the year the family planning cuts were approved, there were 215,114 Medicaid-funded births in Texas. The tally dropped to 204,322 the next year. Medicaid-funded births in Texas, FY 2011 - FY 2014 Year Medicaid-paid births 2011 215,114 2012 204,322 2013 207,058 2014 213,253 In 2014, after the cuts had taken effect, there were fewer--not more--Medicaid-funded births than in 2011, though the count had escalated in both 2013 and 2014. Our ruling Davis said that after the Texas cutoff of aid to women’s health services including Planned Parenthood clinics, ""over 150,000… women lost the only health care they had. Our Medicaid birth rate shot up. It cost taxpayers over $130 million in one year alone in extra Medicaid birth costs."" There was about that much of a drop-off in women participating in state-backed family planning and cancer screening programs. But Davis didn’t provide nor did we find confirmation all the women lost the only care they had or that Medicaid-funded birth costs actually spiked by the predicted $130 million-plus. In fact, there were fewer Medicaid-covered Texas births in 2014 than in 2011. We rate this multi-part claim Mostly False.

"['State Budget', 'Transportation', 'California', 'Jeff Morales']","
Have costs dropped 'several hundred million dollars' for California’s bullet train?
","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  California’s high-speed rail plan is perhaps best known for its sky-high cost estimates, which at one point spiked to $98 billion. The project’s budget was subsequently cut to $68 billion -- still well above the state’s $33 billion price tag in 2008, when voters approved bond funding for the rail network. But questions about cost overruns continue to dog the California High-Speed Rail Authority. A consultant’s draft report was recently made public and indicated the system’s Merced-to-Burbank stretch could cost $8 billion more than expected. Rail authority officials said the report was preliminary, and hasn’t increased the current budget. In recent weeks, Jeff Morales, the rail authority’s chief executive officer, and other authority leaders, have tried to change the narrative about mounting costs. They’ve started to say that expenses are, in fact, trending down. ""The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates. That’s the reality of where we are in the program,"" Morales said during a press conference in Madera in late October, captured in the video clip below.  KSEE TV Fresno, Nov. 1, 2015 Several hundred million dollars is miniscule compared with the project’s overall cost. But because the CEO’s statement goes against the project’s past financial history, it inspired us to check the facts. Checking Morales’ claim Rail authority officials clarified that Morales was referring to the project’s first two major construction contracts. We dug out those documents for a look. The first is for a 29-mile stretch of track from Madera to Fresno, including a tunnel and several raised crossings, one over the San Joaquin River. The authority’s lowest cost estimate was $1.2 billion. The winning bid was significantly less, at about $1 billion. The authority’s second major project is a 60-mile leg from Fresno south to the Tulare-Kern County line. It projected the price as low as $1.5 billion. The winning bid was a slightly more than $1.2 billion. Doing the math, the bids were a combined $480 million less than the lowest estimates. That qualifies as ""several hundred million dollars."" Morales, the rail authority executive, doesn’t call this a ‘savings’ in his statement. He says only that bids came in below estimates, which the authority set for itself. On the right track? These bids are significantly less than estimated. But is that the end of the story? And does this mean the rail authority will see a cost savings? Not likely, said Jan Whittington, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects across the globe. That’s because there are always unforeseen consequences. Crews could hit harder rock than anticipated, find an endangered species along the route or encounter unstable soil, all adding to the time and cost of the project. ""There’s always going to be something that either the project manager or the contractors themselves did not foresee in design that they encounter during construction,"" Whittington said. ""It’s nice to hear that they received bids that were lower than anticipated. But you don’t know how much it costs until they finish constructing it and it’s begun operating."" Still in the hole Steve Boilard, who heads Sacramento State University’s Center for California Studies, said any implication that lower construction bids lead to actual savings is wrong. He said these lower bids do little to remove the bullet train’s overall financial uncertainty. The authority lacks funds for the bulk of the project, which would link the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas. ""With an overall cost of $68 billion, it just means that the hole that we’re in and having to find money, maybe is going to be a little bit less as a result of these lower bids,"" Boilard said. Morales isn’t the only rail authority leader to tout the low bids. Dan Richard, the authority’s chairman, recently told Capital Public Radio that that ""costs are coming down"" for much of the system, in part, due to the bids. In a follow up interview, Richard explained that the authority is using design-build agreements that shift some cost overruns to the construction contractor. He said, however, there is no way for the authority to completely avoid unexpected, added expenses. Our ruling Jeff Morales, the rail authority’s chief executive officer, said in late October: ""The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates."" After digging out the original documents, the winning bids are a combined $480 million below the authority’s cost estimates. That works out to ""several hundred"" million. Still, the lower bids do nothing to wipe away the overall project’s financial uncertainty, several experts said. Its funding gap remains in the tens of billions of dollars. The implication behind Morales’ statement about the bids is that the authority is either controlling its costs or could potentially save money. Officials probably wouldn’t talk about the bids otherwise. Even the authority’s chairman said there’s no way to safeguard against all possible higher expenses. The phrase ""to date"" in the CEO’s carefully worded comment may be the most critical going forward. Every independent expert we spoke with suggested future cost overruns are likely for the project. Even so, our fact checks evaluate the here and now, and not predictions. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Jeb Bush wrongly claims Obama didn't host a Republican senator for dinner until 2013
","During a campaign stop in Atlantic, Iowa, on Nov. 11, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush told a very detailed and specific story to underscore Democratic President Barack Obama’s alleged unwillingness to work with Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Here's what he said: ""The story I tell all the time is about a Republican senator that was invited by the White House to have dinner with the president. And so he’s going up the rickety elevator to go up to the residence, the second floor, and the eager aide to President Obama says with great excitement, ‘Senator, you’re the first Republican he’s had dinner with in the residence since he’s been president.’ And that’s the fifth year."" Obama is so unwilling to work with Senate Republicans, Bush alleges, that he didn't even invite one to dine at the White House until his fifth year in office. But is it true? Did Obama really wait until 2013 to host a Republican for dinner at the White House? Bush’s campaign declined to provide more information or sources for the anecdote. (Instead, a spokeswoman issued a statement saying the president has pursued ""a policy of divide and conquer"" and refused to work with Republicans.) The White House, meanwhile, referred us to the official White House Visitor Access Records, which are posted online in a series of spreadsheets. The Visitor Access Records contain extremely detailed – albeit inconsistently organized – entries for hundreds of thousands of White House visits. The 2012 database, for example, included more than 930,000 separate records. To vet Bush’s statement, we filtered these voluminous results first to show only visits in which ""POTUS"" – that is, the president of the United States – was listed as the ""visitee."" Then we filtered them further to capture visits to the ""Residence"" and other White House rooms in which it’s conceivable that a private dinner could occur. Among that filtered database, we searched for Democratic and Republican U.S. senators. Here’s what we found. When possible, we paired the results found in the database with news reports or White House statements concerning the meeting or a concurrent event. 2009 U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar. R-Ind., visited the residence area of the White House on Sept. 1, 2009, for an evening event. The day and time corresponds to a dinner celebrating Ramadan that included numerous guests. 2010 There appear to be no dinners or other events involving the president and members of the Senate in 2010. It should be noted, though, that Obama did invite Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Jon Kyl of Arizona, along with top Republicans from the House and Democratic leaders from both chambers, to a dinner following the midterm elections that November. That meal-time meeting was dubbed the ""Slurpee Summit"" after Obama promised to serve the drinks for dessert, but Republicans declined to attend, and the dinner was canceled. 2011 Obama hosted a dinner in the East Room of the White House (which is on the State Floor in the residence) attended by both Democrats and Republicans on May 2, 2011. McConnell was among those present.  U.S. Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Mark Udall, D-Colo., visited the White House residence with a larger group during a state dinner for German Chancellor Angela Merkel on June 7, 2011. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, visited the White House residence on Nov. 11, 2011, with a larger group. That same day, Obama called Murray to discuss budget and deficit reduction negotiations that were occurring at that time. 2012 McConnell attended a lunch with the president on Feb. 29, 2012, in a room labeled ""POTUS dini"" in the White House logs. Also at the table were House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Lugar visited the White House residence during a state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron on March 14, 2012. Democratic Sens. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Charles Schumer of New York also visited the residence at that time. Democratic Sens. Kerry, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ben Cardin of Maryland, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Richard Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Jon Tester of Montana visited the White House residence during a St. Patrick’s Day reception on March 20, 2012. Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina was among 706 guests to visit the White House Residence on Dec. 12, 2012, during what appears to be a White House Christmas party. 2013 Democratic Sens. Casey, Durbin, Kerry, McCaskill, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia, visited the White House residence on Inauguration Day in 2013. Obama hosted a bipartisan dinner for women senators on April 23, 2013.  U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., visited the White House residence during a ceremony honoring Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients on Nov. 20, 2013. Democratic Sens. Durbin, Leahy, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Brian Schatz of Hawaii also attended. U.S. Reps. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, attended a lunch with the president in a room labeled ""Private Di"" in the White House logs on March 7, 2013. Obama dined with two large groups of Republican senators on March 6, 2013, and again on April 10. The first dinner took place at the Jefferson Hotel, while the second was held in the Old Family Dining Room on the State Floor of the White House. Ten Republican and 21 Democratic senators were among 878 guests to the White House residence on Dec. 12, 2013, during what appears to be a White House Christmas party. Our ruling Based on our review of visitor logs, there are a handful of instances in which Republican U.S. senators visited the White House residence between 2009 and 2012, including a 2011 dinner attended by Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. There’s also that high-profile 2010 case in which Obama invited two Republican senators to dinner – the famous Slurpee Summit – only to be publicly snubbed. And it’s worth noting, too, that the records indicate that Obama hasn’t dined privately with Democratic senators all that often either – suggesting that private evening meals just aren’t part of Obama’s congressional relations strategy.  We rate this claim False.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/23/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-obama-didnt-host-republican-senato/

A nondenominational Protestant, Obama has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He has also attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. We should also note that segments of the public have long told pollsters that they think Obama is a Muslim. In 2010, a Pew Research Center survey found that 18 percent of Americans said that Obama is a Muslim. We found two polls in recent months that asked a question along these same lines: • CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Sept. 4-8, 2015. The pollsters asked, ""Do you happen to know what religion Barack Obama is? Is he Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, something else, or not religious?"" Among all respondents, 29 percent said Obama is ""Muslim."" While that’s 11 percentage points higher than Pew had found five years earlier, it’s still not as high as the 59 percent figure Iftikhar cited on Meet the Press. The percentage was higher for Republicans alone -- 43 percent thought Obama is Muslim, compared with 15 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents. CNN/ORC surveyed 1,012 adult Americans by landline and cell phones, for a sampling margin of error of 3 percentage points. • Public Policy Polling poll, Aug. 28-30, 2015. The pollsters asked, ""Do you think Barack Obama is a Christian or a Muslim, or are you not sure?"" Public Policy Polling only asked ""usual Republican primary voters"" -- 572 of them -- this question. The automated survey was conducted by landline and the Internet, with a sampling margin of error of just over 4 percent. The survey found that 54 percent of the Republican primary electorate thought Obama is a Muslim, compared with just 14 percent who thought he is Christian and 32 percent who said they didn’t know. So with this survey, we reach a number within striking distance of Iftikhar’s Meet the Press statistic -- but it just describes the views of ""usual Republican primary voters,"" which is only one subset of ""Americans."" When we reached out to Iftikhar, he quickly and good-naturedly copped to mangling his talking point. ""You are correct,"" he wrote via email. ""I did mean Republicans from the PPP poll. Nobody is perfect :-)"" Our ruling Iftikhar said that ""59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim."" He later acknowledged to PolitiFact that he’d meant to say ""Republicans"" instead of ""Americans,"" a switch that would have made his claim closer to accurate (though still a bit high according to recent polls). In any case, PolitiFact fact-checks statements as they were made originally and to the widest audience, so we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2015/nov/23/arsalan-iftikhar/do-59-percent-americans-believe-barack-obama-musli/

Campus carry claims tangled in definitions
","When Texas lawmakers agreed to allow people to carry concealed handguns in college and university buildings, the law included wiggle room for school presidents and boards to determine rules and regulations for their campuses. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 11 - the ""campus carry"" measure - into law on June 1, 2015, but the rancorous debate over whether the law willl prevent mass shootings continues. Some groups are using risque tactics to draw attention to their opposition, like the student-organized ""Campus Dildo Carry"" day, scheduled to take place next summer at the University of Texas in Austin. Gun Free UT, which opposes the law, is taking a more serious approach in its opposition, in part through a website that drew our attention thanks to this claim posted Oct. 28, 2015: ""29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."" The same day, we took a screenshot of the blog post containing the claim, headlined ""Guns in Classrooms: Report from the trenches and tasks."" After we asked for some clarification on the relationship between the two sources cited in the claim, the post was taken down. Joan Neuberger, UT professor of history and a co-chair of the Gun Free UT steering committee, said the claim made on the site in a bullet point left no room for nuance. ""We can see that our statement needs more context."" Still, is the claim -- suggesting mass shooters won’t be stopped even if more students carry weapons -- accurate? We looked first at whether 29 mass shootings have been committed by licensed concealed carriers since 2007. Then we turned to whether only one licensed civilian ""meaningfully"" intervened in a mass shooting in the period. Counting mass shootings In an Oct. 28, 2015 post, The Washington Post’s Wonkblog cited an Oct. 14, 2015 report from the Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy group that promotes gun control, stating that since 2007, there had been 29 mass shootings by people with concealed weapons in the U.S. The National Rifle Association, which backed SB 11, has taken issue with the center’s breakdown. NRA Institute for Legislative Action spokesman Lars Dalseide directed us to a criticism of the center’s methodology on Bearing Arms, a Second Amendment rights advocacy blog. The Oct. 26, 2015 Bearing Arms post looks at each of the shootings compiled by the center and concludes that only six instances were actually mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders using concealed weapons. That’s a whopping difference. So what gives? For one thing, the Violence Policy Center and Bearing Arms define ""mass shootings"" differently. In its analysis, the center defined a mass shooting as the killing of three people or more. According to VPC Communications Director Avery Palmer, this definition is ""consistent with the federal definition contained in the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012."" This is also the definition used in ""A Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013,"" the FBI report from which Gun Free UT pulls its statistic on civilian interventions. On the other hand, the Bearing Arms post author, Bob Owens, defines a mass killing as the killing of four people or more, thus disregarding incidents in which three people were killed. His definition is actually consistent with the FBI definition of a mass murder (as opposed to a mass shooting). In a 2005 report on serial murder, the FBI defined mass murder as ""a number of murders (four or more) occurring during the same incident."" Only one civilian intervened? We come to the second part of the claim, that ""during this period (since 2007), only one licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."" Gun Free UT pulls this figure from the aforementioned FBI study on active-shooter incidents. It’s worth noting that while Gun Free UT implies the FBI report contains data on interventions from 2007 through the present, it actually only examines incidents through 2013. According to the report, there were five instances in which ""the shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the shooters."" Gun Free UT did not count four of these incidents because the intervening civilians were security guards armed for their jobs. When we took a closer look at the one case where an armed civilian stopped the shooting, we found something interesting. The FBI report didn’t just look at mass shootings -- it focused on all ""active shooter incidents"" (in which ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area"") during a 13-year period. As it turns out, the situation cited by Gun Free UT was not what either the center or the FBI would define as a mass shooting in that two people died, rather than three. In that case, Ernesto Villagomez, 30,  killed two people and wounded two more inside Player’s Bar and Grill in Winnemucca, Nevada. He was then shot and killed by another patron at the bar. Other analyses Unlike the FBI report, the center’s analysis considered only mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders. A third tally of mass shootings,  published Dec. 15, 2012 by the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine, found there had been 62 mass shootings over 30 years, with not a single case in which the killing was stopped by a civilian with a gun. The Mother Jones investigation used the more restrictive ""mass murder definition""-- four or more killed at once  in its count of shootings. Meantime, the  Wonkblog post that cited the center’s shooting count reached its own -- higher -- tally of eight instances that someone with a concealed-carry license intervened in a mass shooting situation. That count was attributed to an Oct. 3, 2015, Washington Post blog post, by UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh; two more incidents were added later to his list. In his post, Volokh acknowledged that the effect of more widespread gun possession on the outcome of mass shootings remains unknown. Of his examples, he conceded ""at least some examples are ambiguous, because it might be unclear… whether the shooter had been planning to kill more people when he was stopped."" By either FBI definition, the death toll only climbed high enough to count as a mass shooting in one of the 10 incidents identified by Volokh. In all the others, it is unsure whether the shooter would have continued shooting had he not been shot himself, making it difficult to do an authoritative count of interventions. For instance, in a 2014 incident at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital near Philadelphia, a psychiatric patient shot his caseworker in the face and wounded his psychiatrist before the psychiatrist shot him. He was then wrestled to the ground. The shooter, Richard S. Plott, had more than 30 additional rounds of ammunition on him when he was stopped. There are drawbacks to any attempt to compile and compare statistics from different sources; there’s also a good reason comprehensive data on gun violence is hard to come by. Since 1996, Congress has restricted research into gun violence with a budget that states: ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" The CDC read the restriction broadly and radically reduced research on gun violence as a result; Obama reversed the funding rule by executive order in 2013. Our Ruling When we looked, the Gun Free UT blog included this claim:  ""29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."" The first Gun Free UT claim is accurate in that in that 29 mass shootings, according to a definition provided by the FBI, were carried out by people with concealed weapons. An attempt by Bearing Arms to refute the claim calls the incidents mass killings, but uses the FBI definition for mass murder. The claims leaves out information that could clarify the tangle of definitions used.  By Gun Free UT's own admission, the website claim lacks context. The second claim that only one licensed civilian intervened in a mass shooting is false by the FBI definition of a mass shooting, but bolsters Gun Free UT’s cause because no armed civilian has intervened in a mass shooting. We rate this claim Half True.    ",/factchecks/2015/nov/23/gun-free-ut-gun-free-ut/campus-carry-claims-tangled-definitions/

Trump's Pants on Fire tweet that blacks killed 81% of white homicide victims
","Update (June 8, 2020): This viral image started recirculating on social media after the death of George Floyd. It remains Pants on Fire false. A day after a black activist was kicked and punched by voters at a Donald Trump rally in Alabama, Trump tweeted an image packed with racially loaded and incorrect murder statistics. The image shows a masked, dark-skinned man with a handgun and a set of points, ostensibly about deaths in 2015: ""Blacks killed by whites -- 2%"" ""Blacks killed by police -- 1%"" ""Whites killed by police -- 3%"" ""Whites killed by whites -- 16%"" ""Whites killed by blacks -- 81%"" ""Blacks killed by blacks -- 97%’ The image cites the ""Crime Statistics Bureau - San Francisco"" Here is the image:  None of the numbers are supported by official sources. The figures on black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate. And, as several news organizations quickly noted, the ""Crime Statistics Bureau"" doesn’t exist. We looked for that agency as well and the closest we found in San Francisco were a number of crime scene clean-up services. Interracial homicides While the image references 2015, the year is not over, and no official numbers have been released. The latest data comes from the FBI for 2014. This table contrasts Trump’s figures with the official ones. Blacks killed by whites Trump Number: 2% FBI Number: 8% Error factor: 4 times Blacks killed by blacks Trump Number: 97% FBI Number: 90% Error factor: Just a little off Whites killed by whites Trump Number: 16% FBI Number: 82% Error factor: 5.4 times Whites killed by blacks Trump Number: 81% FBI Number: 15% Effor factor: 5.4 times Killings by police We also looked at what percentage of each race the police have killed. The official tally of deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers is well known to be incomplete. A study this year by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that official counts miss between 30 to 40 percent of all police-related deaths. The Washington Post has worked to fill the gap by compiling a database of police shootings for 2015. The most recent figures from the Post show 414 whites killed, compared to 223 blacks, as of Nov. 23, 2015. Trump’s tweet said police were responsible for 3 percent of all white homicides and 1 percent of all black homicides. If that were true, then applying those percentages to the FBI report of all homicides in 2014, 91 whites would have died at the hands of police and 25 blacks. That’s a ratio of nearly 4-to-1. In contrast, the Washington Post data show slightly less than two white deaths for each black death. One of the official, and incomplete, sources for people killed at the hands of police is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention violent death database. It shows a ratio of about 1.5 white deaths for each black death, in the period 2009 to 2013. Trump’s number is about double the most accurate figures we could find. That makes him about 100 percent off. Parenthetically, the website Little Green Footballs traced the original image back to a Twitter stream that appears to originate in the United Kingdom and features a modified swatiska with the line ""Should have listened to the Austrian chap with the little moustache."" Our ruling Trump tweeted an image that made various statistical claims, including that blacks kill 81 percent of white homicide victims. Almost every number in the image is wrong. The statistics on white victims are exaggerated five-fold. The police-related deaths are off as well.

Hillary Clinton says 'the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections'
","During the presidential race, any discussions about Hillary Clinton and Libya have typically focused on the deadly attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012. But after a recent foreign policy speech, Clinton was asked about the success -- or lack thereof -- of democratization in Libya, a country ruled for decades by dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The question focused on Donald Trump’s argument that removing dictators in the Middle East leads to more chaos in places like Iraq, Yemen and Libya. Wasn’t Trump right, the questioner asked? Clinton responded, ""Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named."" She then zeroed in on the situation in Libya: ""The Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want,"" Clinton said in the Nov. 19, 2015, speech. ""They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So I think it's too soon to tell, and I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely."" We wondered whether Clinton was correct to say that ""the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want,"" so we took a closer look. The big picture Finding anything to cheer about in Libyan politics and governance today requires a lot of squinting. ""Libya has no leadership at all at the moment,"" said Amanda Kadlec, a project associate in defense and political sciences at the RAND Corp. who specializes in Libya. ""Even though two governments -- one based in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk -- are competing for power, it is essentially a non-governed state, because the mandate of the most recent elected government expired at the end of October this year. Its members extended the mandate, a decision that foreign governments on the whole have not supported."" In other words, Libya’s government is pretty close to non-functional right now, so any victories in the democratization process are hard to find. That said, Clinton did acknowledge that point in her answer, so we’ll focus on the more specific assertion she made -- that the Libyan people have participated twice in ""free and fair elections."" Free and fair elections? There have been three major elections held in Libya since the fall of Gaddafi -- parliamentary elections in July 2012, elections for the constitutional drafting assembly in February 2014, and parliamentary elections in June 2014. Each received at least some praise from outside observers for integrity of the balloting process, but each, to one degree or another, also faced problems. (A Clinton campaign spokesman said she was referring to the two parliamentary elections, not the constitutional drafting assembly.) Here’s a brief rundown: • Parliamentary election, July 2012. This election, which took place in something of a honeymoon between Gaddafi’s fall and the emergence of armed fighting, offers the strongest support for Clinton’s claim that free and fair elections have been held in Libya. The Carter Center -- an organization founded by former President Jimmy Carter that offers election assistance to newly democratizing countries -- released a post-election report in May 2013 that found Libya’s first national vote to be ""a major step forward in the country’s transition from authoritarian rule to participatory democracy."" ""Despite overwhelming challenges,"" the center wrote, ""Libyan authorities organized the election in a timely, orderly, and impartial manner that offered Libyans a historic opportunity to exercise their franchise."" The report described most of the country as ""peaceful and jubilant"" on election day, with about 62 percent turnout among registered voters. Still, even in this relatively successful election, problems lurked. ""Security challenges in Benghazi, Ajdabiya, and Kufra both immediately preceding the polls and on election day significantly marred polling in these areas,"" according to the Carter Center. ""Attacks on materials and polling stations led to the death of (a Libyan election official) and caused polling stations to be consolidated or to open late. Looting of offices in Benghazi and Tobruq and destruction of election materials in (a government) warehouse in Ajdabiya also had significant impact on the process."" And Kadlec of RAND suggested that this vote was a step forward, albeit a small one. ""In theory, Libyans expressed their genuine desire for a democratic Libya by voting in elections,"" she said. ""But after generations under a completely closed dictatorship, Libyans who had never been exiles had little to no frame of reference as to how elections would translate into an effective form of governance."" • Constitutional drafting assembly election, February 2014. By the time of the next election, a year and half later, the ""jubilance"" had begun to fade and problems increased. The Carter Center, which observed this election as well, found it ""soundly administered"" but added that it ""failed to achieve the desired inclusiveness to have a truly representative body."" The center praised national election officials for ""making the polls accessible to the vast majority of the Libyan population"" but added that 13 seats of the 60-member assembly remained unelected, ""including five of the six seats for Libya’s Amazigh, Touareg, and Tebu communities as well as one of the six seats reserved for women."" The Carter Center also expressed concern about falling turnout rates, stemming in part from security problems. ""Due to security concerns resulting from attacks on polling stations and resistance in some communities to the elections, 115 polling stations, including 34 planned for the Amazigh community, were unable to open at all, and 34 were forced to close during the day,"" the Carter Center found. ""Polling for these centers was adjourned and rescheduled."" ""The low levels of participation and the general fatigue with the country’s political road map may well be an indication that Libya’s political institutions remain in danger of being hollowed out — valued more by the people for what they can deliver in patronage than as real institutions through which the country’s political future can be charted,"" the report concluded. • Parliamentary elections, June 2014. The problems that emerged in the February 2014 vote continued to plague the vote four months later. In addition to low turnout -- documented by empty polling places shown on television -- security problems had become a distinct problem. In Benghazi, Islamist insurgents opened fire on a local security headquarters, killing at least five and wounding at least 30, according to the BBC. In another incident in the same city, gunmen assassinated human rights activist Salwa Bughaighis as she returned home from voting. Polling places in cities such as Derna, Kufra and Sabra were closed for security reasons. In addition, the vote itself proved not to have a lasting positive impact. While the results amounted to ""a devastating defeat for the Islamists"" -- as Mohamed Eljarh, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center, wrote at the time -- Libya’s highest court in November 2014 ruled the results unconstitutional, in a decision that critics said came ""at gunpoint"" from militias that controlled Tripoli. This resulted in a split government -- one in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk in eastern Libya. The elected representative body in Tobruk is now all but defunct, its mandate expired. ""Libyans have had difficulty in establishing effective government due to the reasons (Clinton) describes -- internal divides, external actors, terrorism -- but it does go much, much deeper than that, and totally depends on who you ask,"" Kadlec said. ""Some point to the NATO intervention, while others point to post-revolution neglect by western powers."" Ali Abdullatif Ahmida, a University of New England political scientist who specializes in Libya, places at least part of the blame on Clinton. ""She and the Obama administration dropped the ball and left the Libyan people to armed militias who lost in the election and terrorized people and prevented (the elected representatives) from working in Tripoli,"" Ahmida said. Our ruling Clinton said that ""the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want."" Even acknowledging that Clinton mentioned some of the problems with Libya’s democratization in the rest of her comments, she is spinning the facts of recent Libyan elections in the most favorable way. Security concerns kept some polling places closed, and the most recent election was punctuated by a mass shooting by Islamist attackers and the assassination of a leading human-rights advocate. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/23/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-libyan-people-have-voted-twic/

Hillary Clinton says she helped usher Iran to the negotiating table
","If it weren’t for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, there likely wouldn’t yet be an Iran nuclear deal, according to the former Secretary of State . While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her, Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department. ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table,"" she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov. 6. She’s said this line a few times throughout her campaign, so we decided to dig into it. According to her campaign, Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary -- from January 2009 to June 2010. During this time, U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of President Barack Obama’s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office. During this time period, the State Department -- top aides and Clinton herself -- led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran -- including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them ""the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government."" Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts ""to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929."" Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. The RSVP The State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He added that her claim doesn’t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct. Clawson specifically noted that he is ""not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton."" The international sanction ramp-up ""shocked Iran's leaders,"" Clawson said. ""Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more -- worse -- was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks."" There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation, she said. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution -- Clinton’s lobbying success -- it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes. ""Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy -- and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth -- you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting,"" Nephew said. Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table."" Clinton’s claim is for the most part accurate, though a little exaggerated. During her first 18 months as secretary, the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran, culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. And experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table. However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks. We rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/23/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-helped-usher-iran-negotia/

Chris Abele says since he took office, county hasn't raised bus fares, yet added route miles
","With Democratic state Sen. Chris Larson entering the 2016 race for Milwaukee County Executive, incumbent Chris Abele is trying to show residents he has been -- per his campaign tagline -- ""working for us for a change."" In an Oct. 29, 2015 interview on WisconsinEye, Abele was asked about the impact borrowing $200 million for state highway funding would have in Milwaukee County. At the time, Scott Walker had just asked the Legislature to approve the borrowing to keep road projects on track. ""Decisions like that necessitate related decisions that lead to the county right now, for instance,  getting less in transit funding still than we did five years ago,"" Abele said. ""But what I can tell you (public transit is) a priority to me."" Then Abele shared this accomplishment:   ""This year there’ll be a million route miles more than there were five years ago and we have never raised fares."" He echoed the claim in a TV ad released Nov. 17, 2015 by his re-election campaign, which declared: ""Chris Abele expanded the (bus) lines without increasing the fares."" Is Abele right that, thanks to his actions, fares have been kept flat and route miles increased since he took office? Background on fares and routes Abele was elected in April 2011 and is up for reelection in April 2016. It’s the county executive’s job to propose the transit budget. In the 10 years before Abele took office, a period that includes Gov. Scott Walker’s time in the job and the last of Tom Ament’s tenure, fares increased and routes were cut nearly every year. Fares rose from $1.50 in 2001 to $2.25 by 2011. The total number of miles traveled by county buses fell from nearly 22 million in 2001 to about 17.1 million in 2011, a drop of 22 percent. In 2011, soon after Abele took office, the state made a 10 percent cut in transit aid. Abele obtained federal funds to keep fares flat and routes running Where do things stand now? His team sent us budget documents from the Milwaukee County Transit System that showed fares at $2.25 in 2011 and the proposed fare for 2016 still at $2.25. We double checked and fares did not go up and then back down in that time frame. So, fares stayed the same for the last five years. The same documents backed up Abele’s route miles claim. In 2015, Milwaukee County buses are projected to travel 18,313,725 miles, that’s over a million more than five years ago. The 2016 budget estimates route miles will increase again, to 18,416,499. The transit system calculates the route miles by multiplying the length of each route by the number of times the route runs in a day, multiplied by the days in the year, taking into account weekends and other days when busses run fewer trips. Most of the additional miles were added in the last year: Year Route miles Mile increase from 2011 2011 17,107,116 2012 17,369,736 262,620 2013 17,244,868 137,752 2014 17,457,798 350,682 2015 18,313,725 1,206,609 The large increase mostly attributed to the addition of three new routes that go from the central city to the suburbs. But they were not Abele’s doing. These routes were created as part of a 2014 settlement between the state and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin, Inc. and Milwaukee Inner-city Congregations Allied for Hope. The lawsuit originally sought to block reconstruction of the Zoo Interchange, saying transportation officials discriminated against urban minorities by not including improvements to public transit in $1.7 billion project. Route miles are expected to increase another 100,000 miles in 2016, due to increased funds in the transit budget from Abele and the Milwaukee County Board.

Sanders says it costs more to go prison than to the University of Virginia
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says society needs to figure out a way to focus more on educating people and less on throwing them behind bars. After all, Sanders told an Oct. 28 rally at George Mason University, it’s a simple matter of dollars and cents. ""And here’s the simple truth: It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia,"" Sanders said. Sanders invoked U.Va.’s attendance costs to help buttress his call for reforming the criminal justice system with an eye toward lowering incarceration costs. We wondered if the truth really is as simple as Sanders says it is, so we asked his campaign how he justified his claim. Warren Gunnels, the Sanders campaign policy director, sent us two figures to prove his point. Cost of incarceration For the cost of imprisonment, Gunnels cited a statistic from the Federal Bureau of Prisons published in March that says the average cost of incarcerating federal inmates was $30,619 in fiscal 2014. But federal prisoners represent the smallest proportion of the U.S. inmate population. About 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the U.S., according to figures from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 200,000 are in federal prisons. Another 1.3 million are in state prisons, while another 700,000 are in local jails. Looking just at state prison inmates in the U.S., a 2014 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the average per-prisoner cost was $28,323 in 2010, the latest year for which figures were available. And that per-prisoner cost varies from state to state. The Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit that researches criminal justice issues, in 2012 published a report that listed state-by-state spending per inmate in 2010. The annual cost per inmate ranged from a low of $14,603 in Kentucky to a high of $60,076 in New York. In the Virginia prison system, the average inmate cost for fiscal 2014 was $27,462, according to a report by the state Department of Corrections. Cost of attending the University of Virginia For the cost of sending someone to U.Va., Gunnels pointed us to a ""Tuition, Fees and Cost of Attendance"" table on the school’s website. Gunnels zeroes in on a part of that table that says undergraduate in-state tuition for a freshman was $10,016 in the 2013-14 school year. For students in U.Va.’s engineering school, tuition was a bit higher at $12,016. These tuition figures would be lower than any of the prison costs. But there are major expenses that the tuition figure does not take into account. Many students have to pay for other things, such as room, board and books, among other expenses. A link to the U.Va. student financial services website provides an overall estimated cost to attend the school during the 2013-14 academic year that lumps tuition along with all those other costs to attend. The annual estimated in-state cost ranged from $26,166 for nursing students to $31,276 for commerce students. For students who commute and don’t have to pay for housing, the estimated expense is much smaller: $18,436. Beyond the amount students and their parents pay, the state contributes some money to help pay for the education of U.Va. students who live in Virginia. In the 2013-14 school year, state support for every ""full-time equivalent"" in-state student at U.Va. came to $8,845, said Dan Hix, the finance director at the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the state agency that tracks state spending on college costs. You add everything up - tuition, housing and other expenses along with the state contribution of a Virginia student’s educational costs - and the overall cost easily would outpace the nearly $31,000 figure that Gunnels cited. Also, these expenses are only for in-state students. Anyone attending from out-of-state pays a lot more. Virginia does not contribute a dime to the cost of educating out-of-state residents, who saw the price of tuition alone of about $36,720 in the 2013-14 school year, according to the U.Va. table Gunnels cited. That cost doesn’t include any room and board fees those non-Virginia students would pay. The U.Va. financial aid website says the total for tuition and other expenses for out-of-state residents could range from $53,942 to $59,922. Of U.Va.’s 15,669 undergraduate students, 31 percent are attending from out of state, said Anthony de Bruyn, a university spokesman. Prison sentences vs. college tenure These prison and college costs all are annual figures. The final price tag for housing a prisoner easily could be lower than the full in-state cost of attending U.Va., if that inmate is serving a sentence of less than the four-year span of a typical bachelor’s degree education. On the other hand, if that prisoner is serving more than four years, it easily could outpace the cost most students pay to attend U.Va. The Pew Charitable Trusts this month released a report that said the average amount of time federal prisoners served was 37.5 months in 2012, or just over three years. Those serving time for drug crimes spent an average of nearly 5 years behind bars. Pew estimated in a previous report that state prisoners released in 2009 had been incarcerated for an average of 2.9 years, but Pew doesn’t have more recent figures. Local jails typically are short-term facilities where inmates are held while awaiting trial or while serving sentences of less than 12 months, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. For Virginia state prisoners released in 2014, the average length of time served was 42.8 months, or roughly 3.6 years, according to the Department of Corrections. Our ruling Sanders said ""It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia."" He starts his calculation with a figure of the nearly $31,000 average cost for a federal prisoner. Prisoners held by state corrections systems in the U.S., on average, cost closer to $28,000, based on the latest figures available. In Virginia, that is a little more than $27,000. Sanders’ campaign compares prison costs only to the cost of tuition at U.Va. That figure represents a significant low-ball for many U.Va. students, who pay the added costs of room and board as well as other fees. U.Va. estimates of the full cost for attending in the 2013-14 school year ranged from $26,000 to $31,000 for in-state students. That price doesn’t include an additional $8,800 the state provided to pay for Virginia undergraduates’ education. Out-of-state students’ bottom-line cost can range from $54,000 to $60,000. When all those costs are put together, they exceed the annual prisoner costs Sanders cites. Still, the truth behind Sanders’ statement rests to some extent on the length of sentence for each prisoner and where they are held. If their incarceration surpasses four years, then it easily could surpass the cost of sending a student to the University of Virginia. Also, if that prisoner is held in a state such as New York, with high state prisoner incarceration costs of roughly $60,000 annually, it also could outpace the cost of sending someone to U.Va.

Is the private sector ‘unwilling’ to fund California’s bullet train?
","LISTEN TO THIS STORY:  Plans for California’s high-speed rail network hinge on the private sector paying for much of the $68 billion project. Voters agreed to kick-start the rail plan with public money in 2008 by passing a nearly $10 billion state bond. The project has also received a limited supply of federal dollars. Increasingly, however, the California High-Speed Rail Authority has looked to the private sector for help. This summer, the authority asked businesses to offer financial advice and ideas on how to make the venture more efficient. It allowed the authority to gauge private investment interest. More than 30 companies responded. None pledged any funds, though the rail authority’s solicitation said it was asking only for advice, not money. Soon after, Assemblyman Jim Patterson, R-Fresno, told the LA Times in a November news article: The rail authority has ""failed to disclose huge cost overruns and after they boasted private firms were interested in funding this project, we now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money."" We decided to focus on his claim that the private sector is ""unwilling to put up any private money."" He’s made similar statements elsewhere, including to a TV news station in Fresno.  KSEE TV Fresno interview with Assemblyman Jim Patterson, Nov. 1, 2015 Was Patterson right? Did the responses amount to corporations writing off the bullet train as a bad investment? We decided to check the facts. Our research First stop: A look at the role the private sector was expected to play when Californians voted for the high-speed rail network in 2008. Dan Richard, chairman of the rail authority, told us this month that the authority originally envisioned private funds paying about one-third of the project’s cost. It’s expected companies would invest their own capital to build, operate and maintain large portions of it -- once an initial government-funded Merced-to-Burbank segment opened in 2022 and showed strong ridership and revenue. Language in the ballot measure approved by voters requires the authority to seek private funds to cover the project’s cost, though it does not specify what percentage. Richard said the state still plans on private funds covering about one-third of the cost. Connecting the network from San Francisco to Los Angeles depends on it, he added. Richard also recently said opening the initial operating segment in 2022 could be delayed. The project broke ground in January in Fresno. ""There’s really no question about interest from the private sector,"" Richard added. ""The only question is when that money comes in."" Challenges ahead The rail project continues to face numerous legal and financial challenges and has lost voter support in recent years. Cost projections have seesawed from $33 billion to nearly $100 billion, and most recently to $68 billion. Patterson’s statement about a lack of private funds raises a key concern. Responses from many private firms mirrored those by Madrid-based Acciona. It said it was ""concerned about the financial market capacity to raise the required capital"" unless the project’s contracts are broken into smaller pieces. Many also said they need a revenue guarantee from the state to reduce their investment risk. That’s prohibited by the law voters passed in 2008, though Richard has said such guarantees won’t be necessary once the project can demonstrate strong ridership. The proposed rail network would be one of California’s largest ever public works project, and the first high-speed rail system in the United States. Early stages Still, rail authority leaders, members of the private sector and the head of the project’s oversight panel all said it’s much too early to conclude the private sector has given up on high-speed rail. ""We’re only at that very first stage where the authority has asked for expressions of interest, not (funding) proposals,"" said Stephen Polechronis, a senior vice president at AECOM, one of the private firms that responded to the rail authority’s request for advice. Michael Cahill of Siemens Industry, another firm that responded, told the Sacramento Bee recently: ""We didn’t propose anything concrete in terms of private money going in, because there wasn’t an opportunity to do that. Which doesn’t mean we wouldn’t be interested. Quite the opposite."" The company confirmed those comments, but declined our request to elaborate. No one is saying the private sector will soon jump onboard with gobs of cash. They are waiting and watching to see if the rail authority can successfully start the project and eliminate financial risks, said Louis Thompson, chairman of the California High Speed Rail Peer Review Group, an independent oversight group that issues reports to the Legislature on the project. ""What the private sector has said,"" added Thompson, a retired federal rail administrator, ""is that it is not willing to take many of the risks that the project would entail as of now."" Thompson said the claim by Patterson, the Fresno lawmaker, about the private sector being unwilling to fund the project ""isn’t strictly correct."" A spokeswoman for Patterson said the lawmaker stands behind the statement. She pointed to recent news articles that outline private sector concerns with the project. Our ruling Assemblyman Jim Patterson said this month: ""We now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money."" He was referring to the more than 30 companies that submitted financial advice to the rail authority, without offering any funding. Many of those companies identified financial concerns, including the need to reduce the size of the project’s contracts and guarantee revenue. But Patterson does not mention that the rail authority’s request was for advice, not money. And we simply don’t ""know"" how willing those companies will be once a formal funding request is made. Some of the firms that responded, along with rail authority leaders and the head of the project’s independent oversight panel, all said it’s too early to conclude the private sector has given up on the project. Patterson’s statement implies they already have.

Did the United States accept two-thirds of the world's refugees in 2013?
","After a week of intense debate following the terrorist attacks on Paris, two-thirds of Americans now say they oppose President Barack Obama’s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees, according to a Fox News poll. This message from the people is not one of one callousness, but of common sense, said Michael Needham of the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action. ""America’s an extraordinarily compassionate nation. We accept 50 percent. In 2013, we accepted 67 percent of the world’s refugees,"" Needham said on Nov. 22’s Fox News Sunday. ""Compassion doesn’t require being stupid, however."" Does the United States accept two-thirds of refugees worldwide? The statement description is imprecise, if not misleading. The figure refers to the United States’ share of a very specific and small subset of the total refugee population. Let’s break it down. The numbers ""The world’s refugees"" currently total 14.4 million under the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, up from 11.7 million refugees in 2013. Needham’s phrasing makes it sound like we have 8 million refugees in the country. But that’s not the case. In reality, about 264,000 refugees, or 2.3 percent, resided in the United States in 2013. So where does the 67 percent come from? A spokesperson for Heritage Action referred us to a State Department report. According to the report, 67 percent of refugees referred for resettlement by the UNHCR were resettled in the United States. In other words, after fleeing their country of origin and residing in another country, these refugees were then relocated to a third country. For 48,000 of those 71,000 refugees in 2013, the United States was that third country. (The UNHCR confirms those figures.) Beyond resettlement It’s important to note that less than 1 percent of all refugees are resettled by the process we just described. These people tend to be the most vulnerable, those unable to go home and unable to survive where they currently are. (For example, half of Syrian refugees admitted into the United States so far are children.) The United States doesn’t have to deal with 99 percent of refugees directly, because ""we have the advantage of geography,"" said Lavinia Limón, president of the advocacy group the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Most countries offering asylum for refugees are geographically close to war-torn states like Syria. As we noted in a previous fact-check, Turkey shelters the greatest number of refugees within its borders (1.6 million), with Pakistan and Lebanon not too far behind. While Limón noted that ""nobody wants to host refugees,"" she also pointed out that Turkey has spent a lot of money in recent years (about $1 billion in 2012). And relative to their populations, ""Lebanon and Jordan pull more than their weight,"" said Kevin Appleby, the director of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Office of Migration and Refugee Policy. ""Their infrastructures and resources are stretched. They’re on the frontlines."" Refugees who don’t return home or aren’t resettled sometimes languish in limbo for years or even decades. The average length of stay in a refugee camp is 17 years. ""We call it warehousing,"" said Limón. ""You keep them alive, but they have no future, they have nothing they can look forward to, their rights to work, basic education, moving around, are constantly being violated."" Because the vast majority of refugees don’t get to leave these camps and resettle elsewhere, some advocates argue that humanitarian aid gets you the most bang for your buck. Japan, for example, is a top donor but doesn’t take in refugees for resettlement. The United States in contrast is also the largest provider of international assistance in the world, a fact noted by both Limón and Appleby. ""The United States is No. 1, no question,"" Limon said when asked which country does the most for refugees. ""The U.S. can be proud of what we’ve done, but we could do more."" ""We have the capacity to do more,"" Appleby said, noting that we could feasibly take in 100,000 refugees every year. ""Every slot in the refugee program is a life."" Our ruling Needham said, ""In 2013, we accepted 67 percent of the world’s refugees."" Needham’s claim refers to a specific way of accepting refugees — through a process known as resettlement. In 2013, about 48,000, or 67 percent, of 71,000 resettled refugees were resettled in the United States. But that’s a tiny fraction of the ""world’s refugees,"" which totalled 11.7 million in 2013. Of the overall refugee group, just 2.3 percent resided in the United States.

Fact-checking Trump's claim that thousands in New Jersey cheered when World Trade Center tumbled
","Arguing that there are terrorist sympathizers in the United States, Donald Trump says he saw ""thousands"" of New Jerseyans celebrating after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. ""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,"" the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. ""And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering."" The next day, ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he misspoke, noting that ""the police say that didn't happen."" Trump -- who has said he was in his Manhattan apartment the morning of the attack -- doubled down. ""It was on television. I saw it,"" Trump said. ""It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don't like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good."" We looked back at the record to see what we could find about American Muslim celebrations in New Jersey on 9/11. While we found widely broadcast video of people in the Palestinian territories celebrating, we found no evidence to back up Trump’s description of events on American soil. Urban myth We conducted an exhaustive search of newspaper and television transcripts on LexisNexis, looking for reports from September 2001 through December 2001 that made any mention of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Regarding Jersey City, which Trump mentioned specifically, we found two uncorroborated and unsourced mentions.  Neither begins to approach the scale Trump described. The Associated Press, on Sept. 17, 2001, described ""rumors of rooftop celebrations of the attack by Muslims"" in Jersey City. But the same report said those rumors were ""unfounded."" The Washington Post, on Sept. 18, 2001, published an article that claimed ""law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river."" The Post story includes no source for this information, and we found no evidence that any of these allegations ever stuck. A more rampant rumor of Muslim or Arab-Americans cheering the attacks centered around nearby Paterson, N.J. But that turned out to be just a rumor, spawned by chain emails and perpetuated by shock jock Howard Stern’s radio show. The Star-Ledger reported that as the rumors spread, ""Paterson police rushed to South Main Street, the center of the city's Middle Eastern community."" ""When we got there, they were all in prayer,"" Paterson Police Chief Lawrence Spagnola said. Three percent of New Jersey residents are Muslim -- the highest of any state -- according to Pew Research Center. Suspected 9/11 terrorists had ties to Jersey City and Paterson. But there is no conclusive evidence that any New Jersey residents celebrated the attacks, and there is no evidence whatsoever of any demonstrations where ""thousands and thousands of people"" cheered. Nor is there any evidence Trump saw these events play out in any way, be it on TV or in person. We reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back. What we did find are many stories of Muslims living in New Jersey speaking out against the attacks and bracing themselves for anti-Muslim backlash. For example, Paterson residents put up a banner on the city’s main street that said ""The Muslim Community Does Not Support Terrorism.'' Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop responded to Trump’s statement on Twitter, saying Trump ""has memory issues or willfully distorts the truth."" Our ruling Trump said he ""watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" as the World Trade Center collapsed. This defies basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people beyond Trump would remember it. And in the 21st century, there would be video or visual evidence. Instead, all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations that were either debunked or unproven. Trump’s recollection of events in New Jersey in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks flies in the face of all the evidence we could find.

Missouri politician wrongly claims 'zero' evidence of swastika incident on Missouri campus
","Turmoil at MU has opened the door for politicians and bloggers to comment on recent racial incidents that fueled protests and a hunger strike. Some latched onto to one incident: a swastika found smeared on a bathroom wall in a campus residence hall. Peter Kinder, Missouri’s lieutenant governor and a GOP candidate for governor, appeared on the conservative radio show ""Breitbart News Daily"" on Nov. 12 to speak about the racial turmoil on the campus. He was asked by host Stephen K. Bannon, ""Are there any facts?"" Kinder replied that evidence of racism is slim. As an example, he talked about the swastika incident. ""This incident of supposed feces depicting a swastika on the wall of a bathrooms in one of the halls … has been supported by zero fact,"" Kinder said. Zero fact? We had to look into that. We reached out to Kinder’s press secretary regarding this claim. We didn't hear back from him until after this story first published, but during Kinder’s talk on Breitbart, he cited two sources. The first was an article by The Federalist published Nov. 10, which originally began as an attempt to prove the swastika was a hoax. Two days after the article was published, it was updated to include information about a police report of the incident. ""On Thursday afternoon, pursuant to a public records request previously filed by The Federalist, the University of Missourireleased photos of the incident,"" it read. The second article Kinder mentions is a Fox Sports article written by Clay Travis. This article focused on the question:What if the MU protests were based on lies? In the article, Travis originally said there’s no evidence of the swastika drawn in feces, but later he updated the story to include the police report. We reached out to Department of Residential Life Director Frankie Minor for more information, and he sent us to MU spokesman Christian Basi, who provided the police report. MUPD filed the report about an incident that occurred on Oct. 24. The report describes the incident as ""vandalism."" At the end of the report an officer provides a narrative of what he saw when he entered the restroom of Gateway Hall. ""I noticed there was a swastika drawn on the wall by someone using feces,"" the report reads. You can see the entire report here. We also looked at media reports about the incident. The Columbia Missourian, The Maneater, Columbia Daily Tribune, KOMU and others reported Oct. 30 that at 2 a.m. on Oct. 24, staff members in the Department of Residential Life found a swastika drawn in feces in the bathroom of Gateway Hall. Residence Hall Association President Billy Donley released a statement critical of Residential Life’s response. He found out via a flier in the hall.  This tweet was posted on the evening of Oct. 29.  We will not stay silent. Read the statement below from @RHAPresident pic.twitter.com/xJbPT1oIrI On Nov. 20, after this story was initially published, Kinder spokesman Jay Eastlick contacted us to say, ""The lieutenant governor misspoke based on information"" from ""two sources that later updated the information. At the time the police report was made public, the lieutenant governor realized it was a real incident that happened, and he stopped referring to it as a potential hoax. ""There was no intention to purposefully mislead. He based it on information he had at the time."" Our ruling Kinder made his ""zero fact"" statement 19 days after the swastika was discovered, and 12 days after its discovery was reported by multiple news outlets, including the Missourian, The Columbia Daily Tribune, the Jefferson City News Tribune, the Associated Press and every local television station in the Columbia-Jefferson City market. These stories were based on information supplied by the MU Police Department and the MU News Bureau. On Nov. 6, then-Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin issued a letter condemning the swastika and other forms of hate speech. His response was also widely reported. The sources Kinder cites updated their articles on Nov. 12 to include the police report. Although Kinder’s spokesman said the lieutenant governor stopped saying there was no evidence of a swastika after those two websites updated their stories, the majority of local news sources reported its existence based statements from named MU officials.
