No, Hillary Clinton did not meet with Broward elections supervisor Brenda Snipes
","As early voters in Florida started casting votes, conservative websites buzzed about new evidence of crooked campaign tactics by Hillary Clinton to secure the crucial battleground state. The alleged scheme centered on left-leaning Broward County, already in the news for distributing some mail-in ballots without Amendment 2, a proposal to legalize medical marijuana. The claims originated from Roger Stone, a Donald Trump supporter and former campaign operative who talked of a ""secret"" meeting in an interview to conspiracy theorist and radio show host Alex Jones on Oct. 26. ""Yesterday Hillary Clinton shows up in Broward County — slips into a private meeting with the woman who runs the board of elections,"" said Stone, who lives in Fort Lauderdale. It’s common for election supervisors to meet with party officials if they have questions about election procedures. But a meeting directly with a presidential candidate would be unusual. Broward has about 600,000 Democratic voters — the highest number in Florida — so it is a key county for Clinton. Jones has millions of followers. The claim about Clinton secretly meeting with Brenda Snipes took off on social media, and some suggested that it was part of a voter fraud scheme. We found no evidence that such a meeting took place — because it didn’t. Within days, Stone retracted his claim. (A retraction doesn’t allow a political figure to avoid the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain what he initially said and then his latest explanation.) No meeting When we first heard the claim about a Snipes-Clinton meeting we were skeptical. Although Snipes is a Democrat, the former school administrator is not known for partisan or political involvement. In fact, a long list of politicians endorsed her opponent in the primary, although Snipes then won in a landslide. Snipes was first appointed to the position in 2003 by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush. In an Oct. 27 interview, Snipes told us she hadn’t met with Clinton. ""She has not requested a meeting from me,"" Snipes said. ""I haven’t met with anybody and neither has my staff.  I don’t even know who the members of her staff are. Neither I nor my staff met with Hillary Clinton."" Snipes told the Sun Sentinel that it was a ""big fat lie"" that she met with Clinton. A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida also denied that such a meeting took place. Stone said he would post photos of the Clinton-Snipes meeting on Jones’ website Infowars ""shortly"" but never did. When we spoke to Stone on Oct. 28, he explained how he heard the allegation -- third-hand. He lacked even the most basic details, such as where this alleged meeting took place. He said information came from a coordinator for Citizens for Trump, a grassroots group. Stone said that the coordinator told him he spoke with two women from Citizens for Trump. The women said that they saw Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. ""They claim they were inadvertently in a secured area of a presidential candidate visit,"" when they spotted Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. ""Both admit they ran, they left the place in a hurry because they were shooed off by security."" The women tried to take photos and video while they were dashing away, Stone said. The photos didn’t show anything, and Stone said he is waiting for video. ""If Snipes denies it and there is no evidence to the contrary, I can say this is an incorrect report, but I’m not ready to conclude that yet,"" Stone said. After giving Stone a few more days to track down information, we circled back with him Oct. 31. That’s when he retracted his story -- or rather moved his story to a different county. Stone told PolitiFact Florida that he went back on Jones’ show Oct. 30 to say he was wrong about Snipes meeting with Clinton in Broward. ""I was incorrect about that,"" he said on the radio show. ""In fact, I was off by a county. The Clinton entourage pulled up behind the West Palm Beach office of the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. Hillary Clinton was physically seen by at least three witnesses meeting with officials from the building. These observers were shooed away. ... Palm Beach is of course ground zero of the Democrats’ vote stealing operation."" (We sought contact information from Stone for these alleged witnesses but Stone said they were too scared to talk.) Again, the Clinton campaign said no meeting took place -- and Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher also said she didn’t meet with Clinton. It is true that Clinton was in Broward and Palm Beach counties the week that Stone made these claims. She gave speeches at Broward College on Oct. 25 and Palm Beach State College on Oct. 26. During his interview with Jones, Stone tried to portray Snipes as incompetent and pointed to ballots missing the medical marijuana amendment. Stone said that Snipes announced that the amendment ""isn’t going to be on the ballot in Broward County because of some kind of a screw up."" That’s an exaggeration. The amendment is on the ballot in Broward, but four absentee ballots so far have turned up missing the amendment. A group supporting marijuana legalization sued Snipes over the ballots omitting Amendment 2. On Oct. 28, a Broward judge ruled in Snipes favor and concluded that she had taken appropriate steps to remedy the errors including providing replacement ballots. Our ruling Stone said Clinton showed up in Broward County and slipped into a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes. Stone was wrong. He heard it third-hand from Trump supporters who claim they stumbled across such a meeting. Snipes and a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida denied such a meeting took place and we found no evidence that it did. Days later, Stone admitted he was wrong but then claimed that Clinton met with elections officials in Palm Beach County. He lacks evidence for that claim, too -- and both the elections supervisor and the Clinton campaign deny it.

"['City Budget', 'Education', 'Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Levar Stoney']","
Levar Stoney weakly claims that Jack Berry voted to cut $23.8 million from Richmond schools
","There’s a photo of a sad-looking girl sitting at a school desk on a new flier being circulated by Richmond mayoral candidate Levar Stoney. ""Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our public schools,"" the handbill states in capital letters. Berry also is among the seven candidates in the mayor’s race. He’s held a number of key administrative posts in the Richmond region but never has held elective office. So we wondered if he had, indeed, voted to cut millions from city schools, as Stoney said. Footnotes on Stoney’s flier base the claim on an April 17, 2012, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that updated a funding feud between Mayor Dwight C. Jones and the city’s School Board. The controversy began in February 2012, when the board passed a school budget with $263.7 million in projected expenses but only $239.9 million in projected revenues. Rather than cut expenses, the board opted to approve its underfunded budget and ask Jones and the Richmond City Council to make up the difference. Jones responded in March by appointing a task force of 11 public and private executives to look for savings in the School Board’s budget that wouldn’t hurt classroom instruction. Berry, a former Richmond budget director, was one of the appointees. The panel hired two outside consultants, including former Richmond City Manager Robert C. Bobb, to find possible short- and long-term cuts. The consultants’ $35,000 fee was paid by the Greater Richmond Chamber Foundation.   On April 16, 2012, the panel voted 10-1 to recommend $23.8 million in cuts to the School Board’s proposed budget. Berry voted with the majority. An article in the next day’s Times-Dispatch - footnoted in Stoney’s flier - said the task force ""leaned heavily"" on the consultant’s recommendations in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. The list included: •cutting 20 teacher positions; •cutting 25 teacher aides; •cutting 50 non-teacher positions; •imposing three furlough days; •changing various health care benefits; •changing the structure of plant service and security; and •eliminating the employee bonus pool. Stoney’s flier calls the package of cuts ""Berry’s plan,"" but there’s nothing in The Times-Dispatch’s coverage that suggests he was the mastermind. To the contrary, the article cited by Stoney says the task force ""heavily leaned"" on the recommendations of its consultants in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. It also should be noted that Berry was not one of the two people Jones appointed as co-chairmen of the panel. A week later, Jones asked City Council to contribute an additional $5.1 million for education - far below the extra $23.8 million the School Board sought. The mayor rejected the task force’s recommendations for furlough days and eliminating health benefits for the school system’s pre-Medicare retirees. The council increased that amount to $5.6 million. In the end, Richmond schools were left with a $250 million budget for the 2012-13 school year, anchored by a $129.4 million appropriation from the City Council and with the rest coming from state and federal sources. That was slightly higher than the $249.1 million for the 2011-12 school year, which included $123.8 million in city funds. Our ruling Stoney’s flier says, ""Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools."" The Richmond School Board passed a budget in 2012 that exceeded its revenues by $23.8 million and asked the city to make up the difference. Mayor Jones refused and appointed an 11-member advisory committee, which included Berry, to find savings. The panel voted 10-1, with Berry’s support, to recommend a plan that itemized $23.8 million in cuts to the board’s proposed budget. The City Council largely adopted that plan. Stoney’s statement suggests that Berry had an official role in the budget deliberations. He didn’t. Berry served as an adviser to the mayor with instructions to find efficiencies. He didn’t have a say in the actual appropriation of city funds for education; that remained in the hands of the City Council. It’s also misleading to say, as Stoney does, that the plan ""cut"" $23.8 million from schools. Most of that sum was hoped-for new money from the City Council that the School Board never received.   So Stoney’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B18640>],/factchecks/2016/oct/31/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-weakly-claims-jack-berry-voted-cut-23/

Russ Feingold says Ron Johnson doesn't believe 'there's a man-made role in climate change'
","With just over a week until the rematch between Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, the volley of attacks is at full speed. The two candidates met separately with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board. About 40 minutes into his visit,  Feingold offered a series of issues he believes Johnson has overlooked, including climate change. Johnson ""doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change,"" Feingold said. Later in the meeting, he added climate change ""is an issue that was bipartisan before people like Senator Johnson were elected and started saying absolute nonsense about sunspots and other reasons to avoid the issue."" We wondered whether Feingold is right that Johnson has denied a human role in climate change. Johnson’s record When Johnson and Feingold first ran against each other in 2010, Johnson definitively told the Journal Sentinel’s editorial board his position at the time:  ""I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused climate change. It’s not proven by any stretch of the imagination."" The far more likely cause, he said,  is ""sunspot activity or something just in the geologic eons of time where we have changes in the climate."" Ben Voelkel, a Johnson campaign spokesman, told us Johnson later acknowledged humans played a role in climate change in a 2014 interview with Boston Public Radio. ""There are other forces that cause climate to change,"" Johnson told Here and Now’s Robin Young. ""So climate does change and I don’t deny that man has some effect on that. It certainly has a great deal of effect on spoiling our environment in many different ways."" But Johnson softened his view as soon as the next sentence: ""I’ve got a very open mind, but I don’t have the arrogance that man can really do much to affect climate."" The next year, Johnson voted against a Senate amendment to affirm that human activity significantly contributes to climate change. While all but one senator supported an earlier amendment affirming the existence of climate change, only five Republicans this time voted to acknowledge there is a human impact. The amendment, seen as a symbolic effort by the Democrats to force GOP senators to take a position, failed 50 to 49 (it required a 3/5 majority). Meanwhile, an energy policy position that appeared on Johnson’s campaign website in 2015 questioned human’s impact on climate change: ""Man-made global warming remains unsettled science. World-renowned climate experts have raised serious objections to the theories behind these claims. I believe it is a bad idea to impose a policy that will raise taxes on every American, will balloon energy prices and will hurt our economic competiveness (sic) – especially on such uncertain predictions."" That passage has since been removed. In August 2016, when asked about global warming on WRJN-AM radio in Racine, Johnson seemed to think it settled — before tempering his response. ""Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it,"" he said. ""The climate has always changed, it always will. … The question is, how much does man cause changes in our environment, changes in our climate, and what we could possibly even do about it?"" Since Feingold made the claim, Johnson’s statements have been a similarly mixed bag: He called himself a ""skeptic"" of man-made climate change in a meeting with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s editorial board Oct. 21, 2016. He downplayed the issue of global warming three days later — saying mankind flourishes in warmer weather — while admitting humans ""obviously"" play a role. But these statements aren’t relevant to a claim made weeks earlier. Our rating Feingold said Johnson ""doesn't even believe that there's a man-made role in climate change."" Johnson did not support a Senate amendment to acknowledge a man-made role in climate change and expressed skepticism each of the few times he acknowledged humans might contribute. He has acknowledged at times that humans can play a role but downplayed how significant that role might be. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3BDF00>],/factchecks/2016/oct/31/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-doesnt-believe-ther/

Clinton campaign says Comey letter violates Justice Department protocols
","Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager criticized FBI Director James Comey for sending a bombshell letter to Congress that the bureau is looking to examine new evidence relevant to Clinton’s email case. Comey’s letter, sent less than two weeks before the election on Oct. 28, informed committee chairmen and ranking members that the FBI is pursuing options to review newly discovered emails that may be ""pertinent"" to the case. But given that Comey can't provide more details about the emails, according to reports, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called the move ""very curious."" ""Let’s just get all the information out there so that the rumors and the hypotheticals can be put to rest. And again, we’re hearing a lot of criticism now from former Justice Department officials, from former Clinton administration, former Bush administration, pointing out this is unprecedented,""  Mook said Oct. 30 on Meet the Press. ""There are Justice Department policies against doing something like this so close to an election."" Mook is right that the Justice Department — which oversees the FBI — not only explicitly prohibits employees from interfering with elections but urges employees avoid the appearance of interfering with elections. In August 2008, President George W. Bush’s attorney general, Michael Mukasey, sent an internal memo entitled ""election year sensitivities"" to employees on the department’s policies on political activities. Part of it reads: ""Simply put, politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department's mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution."" Attorney General Eric Holder resent the memo in March 2012. While the memos don’t discuss limitation of timing specifically, former U.S. attorneys have alluded to an unwritten guideline about not filing cases or commenting on investigations in the 60 days before an election. Citing the policy, several former prosecutors and department employees have aired concerns and criticisms. Two former deputy attorney generals under the Clinton and Bush administrations called Comey’s actions a departure from the department’s traditions and ""real-time, raw-take transparency taken to its illogical limit."" Conservative Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a former prosecutor and New York county court judge, said Comey’s letter ""disgraces and politicizes"" the bureau.   ""You know I support Donald Trump and want him to win, but whether it's Hillary Clinton or anyone else, Comey's actions violate not only longstanding Justice Department policy … but the most fundamental rules of fairness and impartiality,"" Pirro said.   Daniel Richman, a former prosecutor and current Columbia Law School professor, noted that while the Justice Department’s election sensitivities policy does stand, Comey also had different obligations to consider. Department policies ""are subject to judgments by the highest officials in extraordinary circumstances,"" Richman said. ""Less flexible is the FBI’s directors duty of absolute candor to Congress, requiring the correction of statements when new facts arise."" Others experts we reached questioned Comey’s action. It was ""premature to say anything before he knew more facts,"" said Peter Zeidenberg, a former prosecutor at the department’s Public Integrity sector who supports Clinton. Even if Comey had turned up new evidence — for example, more classified emails — Zeidenberg told PolitiFact he doesn’t believe director should have prioritized transparency over the election sensitivity policy if the evidence didn’t change his analysis that there’s no case against Clinton. Our ruling Mook said, ""There are Justice Department policies against doing something like this so close to an election."" The department prohibits its employees from interfering with elections. That policy generally has included being sensitive about what information is released about pending or active investigations in the days and weeks leading up to the election. However, there is no hard and fast rule, and an expert said Comey has the ability to exercise his judgment based on the facts as he knows them. Mook’s claim is accurate but needs that additional information.

Clinton wrongly says FBI director sent letter about emails 'only' to Republicans
","Hillary Clinton has called on FBI Director James Comey to make public any information he has on recent developments into the agency’s investigation into her emails.

The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. Back in July, Comey said the FBI recommended that no charges be brought in this case. With just over a week to go until the Nov. 8 election, the Clinton campaign has said they are concerned that Comey’s vague letter will fuel unfounded rumors about the email investigation, so he should make available any additional information the FBI has.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Brian Kemp']","
Ga. election official off base on voting interference
","With Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s talk of a rigged election and ""large-scale"" voter fraud, the rhetoric has trickled down to state offices. On Oct. 19, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the state’s election chief, tweeted, ""Stand with me in opposition to the left’s blatant attempts to disrupt Georgia’s elections!"" But how rampant is election interference in the state? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Stormy situation Following Hurricane Matthew, the issue of extending voter registration took hold in some Southern states where deadlines in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas loomed as state offices closed to prepare for the storm. In one Georgia lawsuit, the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union sought to extend the state’s deadline. In response to the lawsuit, Kemp, a Republican, tweeted Oct. 18: ""The ACLU wants to create chaos in our local elections offices. Stand with me & protect Georgia’s elections."" The numbers We reached out to Kemp’s office about the tweets regarding supposed interference from the left and to see how prevalent voter fraud is in Georgia. His spokeswoman, Candice Broce, sent us a spreadsheet with every election incident from July 2014 to September 2016. In it, there are 152 complaints ranging from felons attempting to vote to signatures being rejected. To be clear, voter fraud isn’t a generic term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud refers to illegal interference in voting. It is rare and includes activities such as voter impersonation, vote buying and ballot stuffing. A recent poll by the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute showed many feel their vote may not be counted, though studies of voter fraud do not back this up. The spreadsheet Kemp’s office sent us includes names but no party affiliations. About one-third of the complaints say ""dismissed."" For some perspective, there are about 6 million registered voters in the state. About 1 million ballots have been cast so far in early and absentee voting for the 2016 general election. Broce said the office has received about 10 complaints in the past week or so. That equals to about 0.001 percent of votes receiving complaints. Election rolls Kemp’s office has previously been accused of poor practices. Three lawsuits have alleged his methods disenfranchise people. One of the suits claims the majority of the people blocked from the registry are minorities, who tend to vote Democrat. Georgia is traditionally a conservative state, or red state. Recent polls show Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a close race with Trump. A 2012 Pew Center study estimated about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the U.S. are no longer valid or are inaccurate. But no evidence of voter fraud was found — this is about poor record keeping. ""Voter fraud is thankfully not widespread in the United States,"" said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who specializes in African-American politics and political participation. She said the issue comes down to ideologically different ways the two parties see voting. Democrats tend to favor policies such as same-day registration that open up the process. Republicans view it as a responsibility, something the individual should plan for and execute. Georgia requires voters to show a state-issued ID card when voting and additional proof of residence, such as a utility bill, upon registration. ""If Kemp wants to say it’s a partisan issue to demand greater access, he must own the ways groups in power have resisted opening up the process,"" she said. In a recent editorial, Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute said the system’s flaws do not equate to election rigging. Shapiro asserts that ""allegations of voter fraud have increased in parallel with our country’s political polarization during the (past) three presidencies."" He also says voter-ID laws have little purpose, as most voter fraud is not done in person. Additionally, most secretaries of state are Republican. Issues On Thursday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a voting machine in Bryan County was removed after voters reported it changing votes. Voters who spoke to the AJC said the machine changed their votes from Clinton to Trump. Bryan County Election Supervisor Cindy Reynolds said the machine was removed. Merle King, the executive director of the state’s Center for Election Systems at Kennesaw State University, said the issue was likely related to the machine’s calibration. Kemp’s office is investigating the incident. Our ruling Brian Kemp, Georgia’s chief elections official, said in an Oct. 19 tweet that the ""left"" is trying to disrupt Georgia’s election process. When contacted, Kemp’s camp was unable to supply much evidence. The left-leaning ACLU did file suit, seeking to extend Georgia’s voter registration deadline due to Hurricane Matthew, but a judge refused a statewide extension. Georgia has a few reported cases of voting problems, but they do not amount to a left-wing conspiracy to disrupt the vote. We rate Kemp’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4E6F00>],/factchecks/2016/oct/29/brian-kemp/ga-election-official-base-election-interference/

N.C. legislator accuses opponent of creating a non-existent tax increase
","Chris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, took a pretty standard tactic of accusing his Democratic opponent of having raised taxes in a recent mailer. Many races for seats in the North Carolina General Assembly are not very closely contested, as we found in a Mostly True fact-check about gerrymandering. But Malone’s is. John Wynne, a conservative analyst for the website PoliticsNC, rates the district as ""leans Republican."" Malone faces Democratic challenger Terence Everitt in House District 35, which represents the suburbs in northeastern Wake County. Malone’s mailer is clearly aimed at parents who might still be feeling the pinch of their back-to-school shopping bills. ""Terence Everitt raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!"" declares the mailer, sent to homes in the area. ""That’s right. As a member of the Wake County Transit Advisory Committee, Everitt engineered a $78.5 million tax increase. Not one cent of his tax increase will even go to our schools! We can’t trust Terence Everitt!"" Everitt has never held elected office before, so we were intrigued by the claim that he ""raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!"" This isn’t the only controversial mailer that Malone has sent out. He has also called for the repeal of the controversial ""bathroom bill"" HB2 – in a mailer paid for by the North Carolina Republican Party, which raised some eyebrows. The tax mailer we’re looking into now was also funded by the NCGOP. Local government 101 There are multiple problems with the mailer’s accusation. The biggest is that the $78.5 million tax increase it references doesn’t actually exist. The mailer is very specific on where it gets its claim, so we’ll break it down. City and county governments’ budget decisions are up to the elected officials. But for large or controversial projects, officials often let voters decide though a municipal bond referendum. It’s a community-wide vote to raise funds, which can be done by raising taxes, borrowing money or both. State law since 2007 has allowed a handful of North Carolina’s largest counties to raise sales taxes by half a cent to fund mass transit programs. The Wake County Board of Commissioners decided it wanted to use the option, so it asked for volunteers to study transit plans. Everitt was one of 72 people who ended up on the Wake Transit Advisory Committee. The county commissioners liked the committee’s plan, so they decided to let the county’s nearly 700,000 registered voters choose at the ballot box whether it’s worth a sales tax increase. But that vote won’t happen until the same day that many of them will also be choosing between Malone and Everitt. So to say Everitt has already raised taxes is simply not true. Malone did not respond to our request for comment. The number Malone cited is right, for what it’s worth. If the bond does pass, it will raise the county’s sales tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.25 percent. County estimates show that will bring in an estimated $78.5 million in its first year. If it passes, Wake County residents will pay an additional 50 cents on every $100 in goods they purchase. But wait…there’s more We should also note the irony of Malone attacking an opponent for increasing sales taxes on school supplies. Two years ago, state Republicans cut income tax rates and paid for it by broadening the sales tax base and eliminating some exemptions. We looked at some of the details in this Half True claim from Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for governor who said Gov. Pat McCrory raised taxes on the middle class ""in 67 different ways."" One part of the new tax law was eliminating North Carolina’s tax-free, back-to-school-shopping weekend after 2013. From 2002 until that change, families shopping for school supplies such as clothes, laptops and binders could go to stores across the state on one particular weekend and pay no sales taxes. North Carolina and Kentucky are now the only states in the Southeast without a tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping. Although businesses fought its repeal, the state said doing so could mean $13.6 million extra in tax revenues. Malone wasn’t in office when the legislature created the tax-free weekend. In 2013, he voted for the bill that eliminated it. So if anyone in this race could be said to have raised taxes on clothing and school supplies, it would be Malone – not Everitt. Our ruling Chris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, said his Democratic challenger Terence Everitt ""raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!"" That’s not true. No one has raised these taxes, including Everitt. There will be a vote on whether to raise them, but it hasn’t happened yet. This doozy of a mailer is dishonest in multiple ways. It’s too bad Malone can’t save money on a new pair of slacks during a tax-free weekend, since we rate this claim Pants On Fire.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4ec19f47-e6bd-43ac-8f57-9805b12dee3b

For his part, Lt. Gov.

We watched one video, uploaded to YouTube Oct. 14, 2016, that shows state Sen. Konni Burton, R-Colleyville, talking about her adoption of two girls. ""My husband and I are adoptive parents,"" she says in the video. ""They were fostered by wonderful, loving families who opened their homes to care for them before joining our forever family."" Elkins said the video rotation began Oct. 10, 2016 and others would roll out each Monday for several weeks. Next, we looked for independent confirmation that the officials identified by Patrick’s office — several legislators and a statewide elected leader — had fostered or adopted children. In each instance, we found, the official had adopted one child or more. It looked to us like two of the officials provided foster care before adopting. What we found: Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick adopted her daughter Catherine, according to a January 2015 profile in SHALE Oil & Gas Business magazine. In a March 2014 video in which she talked about the experience, Craddick, a single mother, said her daughter was 2 years old and that Craddick became an adoptive parent during her 2012 campaign. State Sen. Konni Burton of Colleyville years ago adopted two daughters, who were both adults as of October 2016, from the Gladney Center for Adoption in Fort Worth, according to an October 2016 YouTube video in which Burton speaks about the experience. She has not been a foster mother, Burton told us by text. Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels, was described as the adoptive parent of four children in a May 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story. She hasn’t been a foster parent, Krista Heiden in Campbell’s office told us. State Rep. James Frank of Wichita Falls, has adopted two boys, Eli and Isaiah, in 2016, per an Oct. 5, 2016, post on Frank’s Facebook page. He was a foster parent, an aide to the representative, Jim Johnson, said by phone. Rep. John Lujan of San Antonio, is the adoptive father of three sons, including one he and his wife adopted in 2012 after years of foster care and two other children who they adopted in 2015 after about a year of foster care. Lujan told us by phone that in spring 2016, he served as a foster parent to three other children. Wondering if other state officials had provided foster care or adopted children, we queried the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. In reply, spokesman Patrick Crimmins said by email that due to privacy concerns, the agency could not discuss such details. For years, CPS has struggled to find homes for approximately 29,000 children needing foster care, according to an Oct. 7, 2016, Austin American-Statesman news story. Also, as of October 2016, 6,388 children in Texas foster care were eligible for adoption, DFPS spokesman John Lennan told us by phone. To be a foster or adoptive parent, Texans must attend an informational meeting and meet basic requirements, such as being at least 21 years old, agree to a home study, and allow for a criminal background check. More information has been posted by the state-created Texas Adoption Resource Exchange. According to the website, foster families are offered monthly reimbursements to help pay for each foster child’s clothing, food and transportation, paid from a combination of local, state, and federal funds. The site states that foster parents must inform caseworkers, who visit with the child at least once a month, about changes at home or school. Foster parents also must ""make efforts as team members with children’s caseworkers toward reunifying children with their birth families,"" it reads. Our ruling Patrick, calling for help finding families able to provide foster care, said: ""Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families."" Five Republican elected officials singled out by Patrick’s office have all adopted at least one child. Two also provided foster care, leaving plenty of opportunities for other elected leaders to consider such a commitment. We rate this statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23c3081f-e1d1-4985-befd-974c63da2b12",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F7E680>],/factchecks/2016/oct/28/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-calling-more-foster-parents-says-state/

Ron Johnson says he got a law passed so fans can watch Green Bay Packers, not Minnesota Vikings
","Aiming to defeat Democrat Russ Feingold and win re-election on Nov. 8, 2016, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is turning to Green Bay Packers fans for support, confident that they aren’t fans of the rival Minnesota Vikings. A Johnson radio ad released Oct. 25, 2016 starts with a strong claim, as the male narrator says: ""There’s nothing like watching the Packers win on Sunday. But for some in Wisconsin, that’s not possible. They’re forced to watch Viking games."" Not possible to watch Packers games? ""Ron Johnson believes all Wisconsinites deserve to enjoy Packer games, and their local news,"" the narrator continues. ""That’s why, when he went to Washington, he got a law passed to fix it. And he did it in his first term. One broadcast station already plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties. And other broadcasters across northern Wisconsin will have the opportunity to offer coverage."" Rescuing thousands of Wisconsinites fans from having to watch Vikings games sounds like the politician’s equivalent of returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. So, why haven’t we heard the crowds cheering? The problem isn’t as pervasive as the ad states. And, so far, the law only offers the possibility of fixing the problem. ‘Not possible’ in ‘orphan counties’ There is a phenomenon in broadcasting called ""orphan counties."" It occurs when a county in one state is assigned to a local television market in a neighboring state. In 13 northern Wisconsin counties, including Ashland and Iron, according to a broadcast industry blog, the local channels, including the local news, are from stations in either the Minneapolis-St. Paul or Duluth TV markets. That means that if the Packers and Vikings play at the same time on the same network, but not against each other, viewers in the orphan counties are shown the Vikings game, not the Packers game. That occurred six times in the 2015 season and is expected to occur twice in the 2016 season (NFL game times are subject to change), according to the Ashland Daily Press. On those days, viewers in orphan counties can see the Packers games only if they subscribe to a satellite service and pay an additional fee for NFL package. So, Johnson overstates the problem when he says it’s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games. That happens, at most, several times per season. But it’s true that on those days, Wisconsinites in ""orphan counties"" are shown Vikings games rather than Packers games. Now to the fix Johnson talks about. The law to ‘fix it’ In 2014, when Congress reauthorized a satellite television law, a provision was included to address the orphan counties problem. But it requires a petition to be filed and the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. So, when Johnson says he ""got a law passed,"" it’s not as though the law itself fixes the problem. Johnson takes credit for the petition provision. And while it’s clear he supports the provision, doing so in a December 2015 letter to the FCC, his campaign could not cite evidence that he was responsible for the provision. So, that part of the claim is unclear. But to be fair to Johnson, there isn’t necessarily a formal record on how provisions get inserted into a law. Johnson does support the first petition filed under the new provision -- one filed in September 2016 by WSAW-TV in Wausau (part 1 and part 2). But when the ad says one station ""plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties,"" that’s misleading in that WSAW’s petition must get FCC approval. The petition seeks to have satellite providers -- there are two in the United States -- DirecTV and DISH Network -- carry its signal to some orphan county viewers, those in Ashland and Iron counties. That would allow satellite TV subscribers in those areas to see Packers games that aren’t shown there now, without any additional fees. ""In a state where the Packers are publicly owned and religiously followed, orphan county viewers feel an affront akin to forcing Washington (Redskins) football fans to watch nothing but Dallas Cowboys,"" WSAW wrote to the FCC, which is based in Washington, D.C. But the petition applies to only two of the orphan counties. Moreover, DirecTV told Johnson in October 2016 it was technically possible to carry WSAW’s signal to only to four of 11 ZIP codes in Iron County. In short, there are many unknowns. The FCC told us it has until Feb. 6, 2017 to decide on WSAW’s petition. WDIO-TV in Duluth is objecting to it. The FCC must determine whether granting the petition is in a county’s interest and whether it would be economically and technically feasible for satellite providers to carry the WSAW signal. And if it approves the petition, the FCC might order only order one satellite carry to pick up WSAW’s signal, not necessarily both. Indeed, one of Johnson’s Senate staff members has essentially said that no fix has been achieved yet. ""Everything in government is slow, but we do think we are very close to a real solution that will give Wisconsinites real change,"" aide Brooke Ericson told the  Ashland newspaper in commenting about the WSAW petition. ""Just this petition going to the FCC, I think, is a further step in the right direction. It’s more than any other senator or congressman for that matter has been able to achieve."" Our rating Johnson says it’s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games, ""they’re forced to watch Viking games,"" so he ""got a law passed to fix"" the problem. In some northern parts of the state, viewers in markets served by Minnesota TV stations are not shown some Packers games, whenever they happen to conflict with Vikings broadcasts. But those residents still see the vast majority of Packers games. As for the ""fix,"" Johnson backs a new provision in federal law that allows for petitions to be filed that, if granted by the Federal Communications Commission, could alleviate the problem in at least some of the so-called orphan counties. But whether that will occur remains to be seen. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. President John F. Kennedy released star Packer Paul Hornung from military reserve duty so he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game. True. Wisconsin’s right to work bill would ""likely apply to"" Packers players and their union. Mostly True. The Packers a ""socialist organization."" Mostly False. Gov. Scott Walker once compared himself to Packers quarterbacks Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers after being criticized by Donald Trump.

Clinton says kids are healthier
","When Hillary Clinton holds a rally, it’s usually someone else who introduces her. But at an event in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 27, it was Clinton who teed up the keynoter, Michelle Obama. It was the first time the current first lady has stumped side-by-side with Clinton, and Clinton was effusive in her praise. She noted Obama’s work on behalf of veterans and young women around the world, and she highlighted Obama’s signature campaign, ""Let’s Move."" ""She has worked for healthier childhood for our kids here at home,"" Clinton said. ""Better nutrition, more exercise and we are seeing the results. We are seeing kids who are healthier."" Are America’s kids healthier? We decided to check that out. The first thing to note is that there is no single agreed-upon measure for children’s health. The Clinton campaign pointed us to material on obesity. That’s one yardstick, and while there are some signs of improvement, so far they are limited. The latest government data show that the country has made headway among kids 11 and under, but not among older children. Obesity researcher Ashleley Cockrell Skinner at the Duke University Medical School assessed the data cautiously. ""We aren’t seeing significant reductions, but there are not continued increases, especially among young children,"" Skinner said. The first lady has pushed for healthier eating habits, and there’s encouraging news on that front. The government has the Healthy Eating Index. It measures what people eat against the federal dietary guidelines, as in, are we eating our fruits and vegetables, the right amount of whole grains, and so on. The higher the index, the better. For children 2-17, the index has gone up from 49.5 in 2005-06 to 55.1 in 2011-12. That’s good, but Skinner said that while better diet is important, she’s ""not convinced that improving nutrition alone will improve obesity rates."" And in any event, Skinner said it would take a long time to see any effect on obesity nationally. By other measures, especially ones that fall outside of Michelle Obama’s work, the trends are negative. We looked at the work of the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, a body that dates back to the Clinton administration. The forum posts a number of benchmarks. For adolescent depression, the percentage of youth ages 12–17 who had at least one major depressive episode in the past year rose from 9 percent in 2004 to 11.4 percent in 2014. The fraction of kids 5-17 who had their activities limited due to a chronic condition went from 7 percent in 2000 to 9.3 percent in 2014. Asthma for all children 17 and under increased slightly from 12.3 percent in 2000 to 13.5 percent in 2014, although that could be due to better reporting of the disease. On the other hand, because there is no single measure of children’s health, some researchers see longer term gains. Janet Currie is director of the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University. Currie looks back to how things stood in 1990. ""There have been dramatic reductions in mortality rates among all children,"" Currie said. ""The declines are even greater among poor children than among non-poor children, so that inequality in mortality has declined."" Currie also noted that drug and alcohol abuse is down, as is the teen pregnancy rate. Our ruling Clinton said that ""we are seeing kids who are healthier."" She said that in the context of First Lady Obama’s work on nutrition and exercise, and her campaign staff drew our attention to obesity trends. The latest numbers show less obesity for kids 11 and under, but a continued rise for young teens 12 to 17. As for diet, the government’s index for healthy eating has gone up. On the flip side, several measures such as depression, asthma and curtailed activity are moving in the wrong direction. At best, in the areas that lie at the heart of the first lady’s work, the picture is mixed.

Chris Sununu says N.H. law protects drug dealers from prosecution if they overdose
","New Hampshire has a big problem with heroin and opioids -- the state is on track to hit over 480 overdose deaths in 2016 and currently ranks third nationwide for per-capita drug overdose deaths. Candidates up and down the ballot have explained their plans to deal with the crisis. Earlier this month, gubernatorial candidates Chris Sununu, a Republican from Newfields, and Colin Van Ostern, a Democrat from Concord, were asked separately about their plans to tackle the heroin and fentanyl epidemic at a candidate forum in Manchester. Asked about law enforcement’s response to the drug crisis, Sununu gave a lengthy answer on New Hampshire’s Good Samaritan Law, which gives people suffering an overdose immunity from arrest if they call 911 for help. Sununu said the bill has had an unintended effect - making police unable to prosecute drug dealers. And the executive councilor went one step further, saying drug dealers have started overdosing on purpose because they know they won’t be prosecuted. ""So what I’ve heard from police officers, police chiefs, they’ve said we’ve gone in and revived folks with Narcan, with 10 fingers of heroin on the table knowing that was going to kill somebody, and they could do nothing,"" Sununu said. ""Those are well intended laws with massively unintended consequences."" He went on. ""Drug dealers have smartened up right away, they've overdosed on purpose. They're buying Narcan themselves and they've overdosed, they've called 911 so all the drugs they have in the house are now immune from prosecution."" Narcan is an overdose reversal drug carried by first responders in the state. Also known by its generic name naloxone, the drug has been made available over the counter at pharmacies because the state’s heroin problem has grown so dire. PolitiFact decided to look into the matter. Are police rendered helpless when responding to a report of an overdose? Are drug dealers intentionally overdosing? The Good Samaritan Law was one of many new pieces of legislation dealing with the drug crisis that went into effect in 2015. Advocates who backed the bill in the New Hampshire legislature argued it would save more lives by allowing people to call for help without fear of arrest. However, the bill was opposed by some in law enforcement for fear it could make it more difficult to arrest low-level drug dealers. The law states that anyone asking for help during a drug overdose ""shall not be arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for possessing, or having under his or her control, a controlled drug in violation."" But the law only shields individuals from drug possession charges, not charges related to drug dealing. We reached out to Sununu’s campaign, which said he based the statement about drug dealers overdosing on purpose from conversations with ""sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement officials"" on the campaign trail. So we called a few of the people Sununu said he’s been talking to. He is correct at least that some law enforcement officials are still concerned about the bill’s effects. Enfield Police Chief Richard Crate, the former president of the NH Chiefs of Police Association, says there was little evidence to show fewer people were calling for help during an overdose before the law was passed and removing the threat of arrest puts police at a disadvantage.   ""I think we’ve lost a valuable tool by being able to use the threat of prosecution and the threat of incarceration to keep people clean,"" he said. However, Crate said he is not aware of any drug dealers intentionally overdosing to try and avoid prosecution. We asked around to see if other departments had seen anyone intentionally overdosing to avoid prosecution. In Manchester, the state’s largest city, the police department’s drug unit was ""not aware"" of any intentional overdoses, said Lt. Brian O’Keefe. Police in Concord, the state's capital, and police in Laconia to the north, also said they had not seen anyone overdosing intentionally to gain immunity. Police in Nashua and the State Police Department did not respond. Even if a drug dealer did overdose on purpose to avoid prosecution, it wouldn’t work. If police respond to an overdose and find a significant amount of drugs, ""we’re going to do an investigation regardless if the person overdosed on purpose,"" said Laconia police officer Eric Adams, the department’s prevention, enforcement and treatment coordinator and an advocate for the ""good samaritan"" law. While the law protects people who overdose with immunity from drug possession charges, it does not - as Sununu claims - give people with intent to distribute drugs protection from prosecution. A recent local case demonstrates this. On Sept. 30, Concord police responded to the Comfort Inn for a report of two people overdosing. Upon arrival, police treated the people with Narcan and observed hypodermic needles, a large amount of cash and multiple packages of pills. Police arrested both for possession with intent to distribute and seized 115 grams of methamphetamine. The law doesn’t prevent police from seizing drugs either, Concord Police Lt. Tim O’Malley said. ""If we walk into living room and there’s heroin on the table, we’re going to seize that,"" O’Malley said. ""We will not walk away from any kind of controlled substance."" Our ruling Republican candidate for governor Chris Sununu said drug dealers have ""overdosed on purpose"" to avoid prosecution on drug charges. That’s not how the law works. New Hampshire’s ""good samaritan"" law shields people from drug possession charges if they call for help during an overdose. The law does not shield individuals from drug dealing charges and police can still investigate a crime and seize drugs when responding to an overdose. Police in various departments reported no instances of anyone intentionally overdosing to avoid drug charges. We rate the claim False.    ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2A5840>],/factchecks/2016/oct/28/chris-sununu/chris-sununu-says-nh-law-protects-drug-dealers-pro/

Donald Trump says half of young black children are in 'abject poverty'
","On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has often recited statistics about the economic plight of African-Americans, arguing that Democrats have done little to improve the lives of one of their core constituencies. The Republican presidential nominee did so again during a rally in Springfield, Ohio, on Oct. 27. ""Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty,"" Trump said. It turns out that the poverty rate for young African-Americans is disproportionately high, but not nearly as high as Trump suggests. While the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article, we suspect that he came across the statistic in a ""State of Working America"" report published by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. An infographic packaged with the report said, ""45.8 percent of young black children (under age 6) live in poverty, compared to 14.5 percent of white children."" If that were a current statistic, Trump would be on pretty solid ground. But it’s not. It’s not obvious from the infographic, but the State of Working America report was published in 2012. And the data itself is now six years old. The full text of the report says, ""In 2010, close to half (45.8 percent) of young black children (under age 6) were in poverty, compared with 14.5 percent of white children."" The problem is that 2010 was during and just after the Great Recession, so poverty rates were unusually high. To find out what the rates are now, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The most recent data we found is for children under age 5 and covers 2015. That’s slightly different, but Census data specific to poverty levels among children age six do not change the percentage significantly. For African-Americans under five, the poverty rate was 37.4 percent. That’s quite a bit lower than the ""almost half"" of African-American children that Trump cited. The percentage falls even further if you give weight to Trump’s use of the term ""abject poverty"" and look at the poorest of the poor -- those with incomes at half of the poverty level or less. For African-Americans under 5, that half-of-poverty rate is 20.4 percent. That’s even further from ""almost half."" We should note that compared to other racial and ethnic groups, the poverty levels for African-Americans are indeed high. Here’s a summary for children under 5: Group Percent at poverty level Percent at half-of-poverty level African-American 37.4 percent 20.4 percent Hispanic 30.2 percent 13.1 percent White 12.8 percent 8.4 percent Asian 11.9 percent 5.0 percent Our ruling Trump said, ""Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty."" The poverty rates in question were as high as Trump says they were at the depths of the Great Recession, but they have since eased, to somewhere between 20 percent and 37 percent, depending on which income threshold you use. Still, the rates for African-American children are disproportionately high, so Trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F021C0>],/factchecks/2016/oct/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-half-young-black-children-are-ab/

Al Gore claims global warming will lead to faster spread of Zika virus
","In a nod to environmentally oriented voters, Hillary Clinton campaigned in Miami with Al Gore to detail her plans for investing in green energy and combatting global warming. During his speech, Gore highlighted the dangers that global warming poses to public health in the United States. While discussing Florida’s Zika outbreak, he claimed that increased temperatures energize Zika-carrying mosquitoes and make the disease spread faster. ""The change in climate conditions changes the places where these tropical diseases become endemic and put down roots,"" he said. ""Increased temperature from global warming makes mosquitoes mature faster, makes them bite more due to a having a higher metabolism, and makes the Zika virus inside of them incubate faster, leading to much quicker spread of the disease."" Gore’s overall message was focused on Zika transmission in the United States. But scientists across the world have expressed concerns that global warming could increase transmission of tropical diseases such as dengue fever and malaria in many countries. We decided to take a closer look at the effect of global warming on mosquitoes and the diseases they carry. Global warming and mosquitoes Research suggests that higher temperatures from global warming could increase the habitat range of Aedes aegypti, the species of mosquito that transmits Zika virus, yellow fever and dengue. For example, a recent study simulated the change in habitat for Aedes aegypti in two different global warming scenarios until the year 2080. The researchers found that even in a model with moderate greenhouse emissions, the mosquitoes would be able to expand into areas that were previously too cool to live in, such as the northeastern United States and southern Europe. They concluded that up to an additional 298 million to 460 million people could end up exposed.  Graphs showing the projected spread of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in two global warming simulations. Figure A shows the mosquito’s current distribution, where red regions have the highest level of activity and blue regions the lowest. Figure B models changes in habitat between 2061 and 2080 with moderate greenhouse emissions. Figure C is the same, but assumes a higher level of emissions. Purple shading shows regions where the mosquitoes would become more prevalent. Source: Monaghan et al. But how do rising temperatures directly affect the metabolism and life cycle of Zika-carrying mosquitoes? Andrew Monaghan, lead author of the mosquito habitat study and a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that global warming has the potential to elevate transmission risk due to changes in the mosquito’s behavior. ""Warmer temperatures increase Aedes mosquito development and survival rates, affect biting behavior, and speed up the extrinsic incubation period for Aedes-transmitted viruses such as Zika,"" he said. ""There is strong scientific consensus on these aspects, based on numerous laboratory and field studies."" This effect isn’t unique to mosquitoes with the Zika virus. According to Laura Norris at USAID, the reproduction rate of a variety of mosquito-borne viruses is directly correlated to the mosquito’s metabolism. Because all mosquitoes are cold-blooded, increased temperatures would lead to faster reproduction of the virus and would yield mosquitoes that can spread disease earlier in their life cycle. A complicated picture Scientists suspect that global warming is playing an increasingly large role in outbreaks of tropical disease. A World Health Organization report notes that dengue and malaria transmission increased in several Asian countries during unusually warm El Niño years. Other trends include the spread of ticks that carry Lyme disease and encephalitis into northern Europe and the resurgence of malaria in the East African highlands. However, experts stressed that climate change is an extremely complex phenomenon that could have different and unpredictable effects on mosquito ecology and disease transmission, depending on the region. Monaghan noted that in regions where the temperature is already near the upper threshold for mosquito habitability, global warming could actually reduce transmission risk due to decreased survival rates in extreme heat. However, these areas of lower risk would likely be small compared to areas that would end up with a higher transmission risk. Additionally, other changes in climate such as rainfall and humidity complicate the picture. Mosquito-borne disease could increase in regions that experience more rainfall due to wider availability of potential breeding pools. Other locations could see decreases in the mosquito population due to droughts. Finally, it’s important to remember that disease transmission isn’t affected by just one variable, but rather by an intricate mosaic of factors involving modern human travel, poverty, ecology, habitat modification and genetic variation. The challenge for scientists lies in sorting out the effects of global warming from these other issues. Greg Lanzaro, professor at University of California at Davis, said he wasn’t aware of any compelling evidence that linked Zika spread to global warming. He instead identified increased human travel and trade as the major drivers behind the spread of mosquitoes and pathogens to new environments. Walter J. Tabachnik, a professor at the University of Florida’s Medical Entomology Laboratory, thinks that climate change will change disease transmission, but cautioned against making any sweeping conclusions.  He directed us to several of his papers that highlighted the shortcomings of current disease models and called for more research in the field. The lesson is that although global warming could change mosquito behavior and potentially facilitate disease transmission, there’s so many different variables involved and so many separate regions to study that it’s impossible to make any clear-cut predictions. Our ruling Gore claimed that global warming makes mosquitoes mature faster, bite more, incubate the Zika virus faster, and spread the disease quicker. There is strong scientific consensus that higher temperatures do speed up the mosquito’s metabolism, resulting in the biological effects Gore described. But scientists haven’t conclusively proved that global warming leads to faster spread of mosquito-borne diseases. More research is needed to understand how a changing climate fits into an already complicated mesh of human and environmental factors.

Minnesota doesn’t have the highest unemployment rate in US history
","Minnesota ranks near the middle of the states on the number of confirmed coronavirus cases per capita. So is it possible that the pandemic has left it with the highest-ever unemployment rate in the country? ""Well, we did it!"" a Facebook post declares. ""Minnesota now has the highest unemployment rate in U.S. history. Yesterday we surpassed the peak of the Great Depression.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was updated a few times in subsequent days with different numbers, but was taken down after we started work on this fact check. The post is ambiguous about whether it refers to a record high for Minnesota or for all states throughout U.S. history. The post alluded to the national unemployment rate of roughly 25% during the Great Depression as a benchmark, but state records are not available for that period. And there is no officially reported unemployment data for Minnesota to back up the claim. As of May 6, the date of the Facebook post, Minnesota’s most recently reported unemployment rate was for March. At that time, its jobless rate was among the lowest in the country, at 2.9%. Minnesota has since reported data for April, which reflect more pandemic-related shutdowns and show unemployment jumping to 8.1% — still second-lowest in the country behind Connecticut’s 7.9%; Nevada was highest, at 28.2%. The national rate was 14.1%. There are indications that Minnesota’s jobless rates could head much closer to that Depression-era mark, though at this point, that is speculative. The time lag in reporting unemployment rates means that the officially reported data don’t fully reflect the trends in the number of people filing unemployment insurance claims week to week. So even as Minnesota was reporting strong jobs numbers, signs of a much greater unemployment problem were already appearing. On April 16, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on data suggesting that close to one in five Minnesota workers was unemployed or had lost work in the previous six weeks. On May 6, Minneapolis TV station Fox 9 reported that Minnesota had received 624,873 unemployment filings, amounting to 20% of the state's workforce, since mid-March. Mixing measures, that news report said the percentage rivaled unemployment rates during the Great Depression, when rates pushed towards 25%. The Facebook post attacks Minnesota Gov.

Yes, the CARES Act has a tax break that benefits 43,000 millionaires
","The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was a roughly $2 trillion bill passed in March that provided economic assistance to everyone from unemployed workers and beleaguered small businesses to overwhelmed hospitals and state governments. Was it also a giveaway to millionaires?  Yes, according to a May 14 Facebook post. Using simple text on a black background, the post says: ""Hidden in the CARES Act was an obscure $135 billion tax break for 43,000 millionaires. Apparently, no one asked, ‘How are we going to pay for it?’"" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post is more or less on target. The CARES Act, which sailed through both houses of Congress, did include language that temporarily suspended a tax provision known as the excess loss limitation. The language is not hidden, but it’s safe to say that given how fast the $2 trillion bill sped through Congress, it mostly escaped media attention. The excess loss limitation was part of the 2017 tax overhaul bill signed by President Donald Trump. It applied to pass-through businesses, which are companies whose profits are reported on the owner’s individual returns, and taxed as individual income, rather than being subject to corporate taxes.  The 2017 provision limited how much in business losses a business owner could claim to lower the taxes on their non-business income. The temporary provision in the CARES Act suspended those limits, meaning business owners could deduct business losses without a limitation on the amount and could apply those losses to past or future  tax years. After this provision in a very big bill came to light, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, offered bills to roll back the temporary suspension of the tax limitation that was included in the CARES Act.  The ""$135 billion tax break"" figure in the Facebook post is backed up by the analysis by the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the official arbiter of the cost of tax proposals considered by Congress.  In its analysis of the CARES Act, the committee found that the tax provision would cost the Treasury about $135 billion between 2020 and 2030, with the bulk of the cost occurring in the first two years, and small gains coming in later years. As for the 43,000 millionaires figure, that comes from an analysis requested by Whitehouse and Doggett that showed the estimated impact of the provision on different income groups. It was included in a letter that the committee sent to the two lawmakers.  The committee found 43,000 taxpayers earning $1 million or more would indeed benefit from the provision, and they would reap nearly 82% of the total money saved.  Notably, this is a tiny group. While the term ""millionaires"" is often defined as people whose net worth is north of $1 million, this table refers to Americans earning $1 million a year in income, a much rarer accomplishment.  A bit more than 10% of households have at least $1 million in net worth, but fewer than 1% of all workers, by some estimates, earn more than $1 million a year. Other taxpayers below the $1 million income group would also benefit — 87,000 in all — although to a smaller extent.  Tax experts say there is a logic to making a change to loss limitations during a dire economic situation.  Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said that while he believes the provision in the CARES Act is too generous, he does see some benefit to a scaled-back suspension. Allowing such taxpayers to carry back net losses ""makes it possible for firms and individuals to generate cash quickly by effectively amending a past-year return and use current losses to lower prior-year taxes,"" he wrote in a recent blog post. Other tax specialists say the provision is more than just a giveaway to the rich. Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that loss deductions ""are an essential part of a well-functioning income tax. Businesses typically make multi-year investments. Those investments may lose money in some years and make money in other years. The ability to either carry back losses to offset previous years’ taxes or carry forward losses to offset future taxes ensures that the tax system accurately measures income."" This is especially important during recessions, Pomerleau said, because they help provide stressed companies with liquidity. ""To the extent this allows firms to hold on to a few more workers than they otherwise would have, it might benefit lower-income individuals more than the tables suggest,"" he said. The Facebook post said, ""Hidden in the CARES Act was an obscure $135 billion tax break for 43,000 millionaires."" This refers to a real provision in the CARES Act that eases restrictions passed in 2017 that limited how extensively pass-through corporations can apply business losses to the owner’s individual tax burden. Congress’ official tax arbiter pegged the 10-year cost of the provision at $135 billion, and that committee also projected that 43,000 taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year would benefit.  However, it’s worth noting that 87,000 taxpayers earning less than that would also benefit.

Biden uses arbitrary, conflicting definition to slam small business loans
","In a virtual campaign stop focused on La Crosse on May 20, 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden took aim at the federal government’s response to small business woes. As of early May 2020, almost one in three small businesses reported closing their doors temporarily, and nearly one-fourth said they were within two months of closing permanently, according to a survey by MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The government’s primary response has been the Paycheck Protection Program, which distributed more than $500 billion in forgivable loans for small businesses to use for payroll, mortgages, rent and utilities. But Biden claimed much of that effort missed the intended target — small businesses. ""Small businesses are the foundation of our communities and of this country and the American dream. And they also hire more people than all those major corporations combined,"" Biden said in the livestream appearance. ""Now because of what I’d call a corrupt recovery that’s focused on helping the wealthy, the well-connected, not the millions of mom and pops facing financial ruin, the warning signs are flashing. ""Forty percent of the initial small business funds didn’t go to small businesses at all."" We’re going to focus in on that last line.  Did 40% of the PPP funds really go somewhere other than small businesses? The PPP was intended as a lifeline to weather the economic shutdown, but funds disappeared quickly. The first pool of nearly $350 billion was exhausted April 16, with 80% of applicants unable to get funding, the Washington Post reported. A second round of funding was made available starting May 1. As of May 21, 2020, the program had approved 4.4 million loans for a total of $512 billion. The average loan was $116,232. The loans can be fully forgiven if funds are used for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The loans are subject to various requirements, such as recipients using at least 75% of the funds for payroll and maintaining or quickly rehiring employees. But there has been controversy over who received the funds. Many larger companies have returned funds they received through the program in the wake of public outrage, including Shake Shack and Potbelly. More than $1 billion from the first round of funding went to publicly traded companies, the Washington Post reported. And 43 loans went to companies with more than 500 workers. The Small Business Administration, which administers the PPP, typically defines a small business as one with less than 500 employees, though that figure can vary by industry. And the PPP included exceptions for some businesses above that level. The SBA hasn’t released any data on the size of the firms receiving loans. Agency spokeswoman Carol Chastang said they intend to do so, but not until the PPP has ended. So the only available data that speaks to business size is the size of the loans. Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said that’s what the former vice president based his claim on, assuming that larger loans meant larger businesses since the funding is intended primarily to cover payroll. Biden referred to the ""initial"" round of PPP funding, which ended April 16. Within that group, about 44% of the money was doled out in loans of more than $1 million. There was more recent data available at the time Biden said this, though, factoring in all loans through May 16. At that point about 36% of all funding was part of loans of more than $1 million. So 40% of the PPP funding went to larger loans, around the figure Biden cited.  But is it accurate to refer to that portion as not going to small businesses? Biden’s statement hinges on the definition of small business — and he uses two himself. The program Biden referenced is run by the SBA and specifically allows loans for businesses that meet that agency’s definition — generally 500 or fewer employees. So under that definition every company receiving a loan is a small business. We gave U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson a True rating when he leaned on that SBA definition in May 2019 to say ""99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses."" And Biden himself indirectly used this definition moments before making the 40% claim, when he said small businesses ""hire more people than all the major corporations combined."" Gwin confirmed that was a paraphrase of an SBA statistic showing small businesses employ about half the private workforce.  That SBA stat only holds true if you define small businesses as companies with 500 employees or less. If you drop the threshold to 100, that group employs one-third. If the cutoff is 20 employees, that’s less than one-quarter of the private workforce. So Biden used the 500-employee cutoff to demonstrate how important small businesses are, then immediately abandoned it to claim companies getting the larger loans aren’t actually small. That’s problematic. It’s fair for Biden to make the case that some businesses receiving the loans aren’t what many would consider ""small,"" but it’s not fair to use two different definitions to make adjoining points. Biden said ""40% of the initial small business funds didn’t go to small businesses at all."" We don’t know how big the businesses getting the loans actually are, so Biden is creating his own definition of ""small businesses"" based on loan size. A definition that conflicts with the official government definition this program uses. What’s more, that definition conflicts with how he referenced small businesses a few sentences earlier to discuss the impact they have on the economy. There’s an element of truth here. The 40% figure roughly matches the portion of loans that topped $1 million, which given the purpose of the loan means these companies have operating budgets of at least several million dollars. But the way Biden explained this figure conflicts with both the government definition and his own definition from a moment earlier. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F27280>],/factchecks/2020/may/26/joe-biden/joe-biden-small-business-loans-ppp-wisconsin/

"['Public Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Coronavirus', 'Janel Brandtjen']","
Yes, children do get coronavirus. It just might not be as serious.
","There are several diseases that are especially tough on kids.  Measles, chickenpox and even this year’s most common strain of influenza in Wisconsin target children and can cause serious, even life-threatening complications.  So the world breathed a sigh of relief when the first reports about children and COVID-19 seemed to show that this novel coronavirus wouldn’t be one of those diseases.  A preliminary report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published April 6, 2020, found that children make up only a small portion of U.S. coronavirus cases thus far and are less likely to become seriously ill.  As the debate continues about how quickly to relax restrictions and reopen the country, that information has become a key part of the reopen-now argument. State Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, dove into the issue in the comments section of an April 28, 2020 post on her Facebook page that criticized Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for not opening playgrounds and restrooms at parks.  Replying to a commenter, she wrote, ""In fact, New York is considering opening schools because children don’t seem to be getting this virus.""  A few days later, though, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared that all schools in the state would be closed for the remainder of the academic year. (Evers made the call weeks earlier that Wisconsin schools would be closed through June.) But is Brandtjen right about the rest of her claim — that ""children don’t seem to be getting this virus""? As of May 21, 2020, the CDC reported that 40,457 of the country’s more than 1 million coronavirus cases occurred in patients 17 and under.  To be sure, that is a tiny fraction of overall cases, clocking in at just 3% of the 1.2 million cases listed by the CDC. But it’s still more than 40,000 children who have gotten sick with COVID-19, in the official count. Others, of course, may have gotten sick and never been tested.  In Wisconsin, the same pattern holds: 257 cases have been reported in patients 9 and under, and 695 in patients ages 10-19 (the state Department of Health Services uses different age breakdowns than the CDC).  The two age groups account for just 7% of the state’s total coronavirus cases, and even less for whom the disease turned more serious. Just 32 people under the age of 20 have been hospitalized by the virus, according to the DHS website.  Although the numbers are small, they’re there — and there, too, are the rare cases that have turned fatal. Wisconsin has avoided the death of a child from the virus so far, but nationally, a handful of deaths have occurred in pediatric cases.  So, children do seem to be getting this virus.  But what early data and the raw numbers show is that they seem to be contracting it far less, and less seriously, too.  That’s what Brandtjen pointed to when asked to back up her claim. In a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin she said her choice of words in saying that children don’t ""seem"" to be getting the virus acknowledged that nuance.  Brandtjen cited a CDC webpage on kids and coronavirus which notes that children don’t appear to be at higher risk, and most U.S. cases appear in adults.  She also quoted a Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin news release stating that ""one of the main understandings was that (COVID-19) didn’t affect healthy kids as seriously as adults."" In the release, the hospital wrote that only a handful of children there tested positive for the virus, and all went home after brief hospitalizations.  The Children’s release, however, brings up another distinction in the conversation about kids and COVID-19: a new, more serious disease known as Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or PIMS.  No kids at Children’s have presented with PIMS symptoms, the release says, and research on the link between PIMS and the coronavirus is still limited. But doctors in New York, which as of May 12 was investigating 102 cases of the syndrome and three deaths, suspect COVID is involved. Though rare and treatable, it’s likely another way the virus is affecting kids.  And one more bit of nuance: As schools across the country mull over opening their doors this fall, research is still being done on whether and how much children can spread the virus. The answer could be critical to the discussion of what reopening schools, day care centers and other places where kids gather should look like moving forward.  Brandtjen claimed ""Children don’t seem to be getting this virus."" Hundreds of kids in Wisconsin, and tens of thousands in the U.S., have fallen ill with COVID-19.  That said, children do not seem to be contracting the virus as much, or as seriously, as the rest of the population. That’s an important nuance, particularly amid such a contentious debate.   We rate Brandtjen’s claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F19980>],/factchecks/2020/may/22/janel-brandtjen/yes-children-do-get-coronavirus-it-just-might-not-/

More to the point, Newsom is not on vacation in Montana, nor has he been there in recent weeks.

Newsom has provided live updates about the state of the coronavirus in California throughout May, broadcasting them to his YouTube channel and social media pages. On May 18, he gave a press conference from Mustards Grill, a restaurant in Napa, California. Montana officials said they’re not aware of any recent trips Newsom has made to their state. ""Gov.

We searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no credible reports to indicate that Newsom has been to Montana in recent weeks. Other fact-checkers and local news outlets also concluded that posts saying Newsom went there were wrong. California law dictates that Newsom must be within the state’s borders to have the powers of his office, according to the Los Angeles Times. When Newsom has left California in the past, he has typically transferred the governor’s duties to Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis. ""When the governor leaves the state, he is required to give notice, and the lieutenant governor serves as acting governor in his absence,"" said Katie Hanzlik, a spokesperson for Kounalakis. But Kounalakis’ office hasn’t received notice that Newsom would be out of California since early February, Hanzlik said. She shared with PolitiFact a pair of press releases, from Feb. 7 and Feb 11, that said Newsom ""has left the state"" and ""has returned to the state.""   On Feb. 10, Newsom appeared as a guest on ABC’s ""The View,"" which is filmed in New York.

Farm income is up, but federal aid accounts for much of the increase
","President Trump claimed at a Jan. 30 Des Moines campaign rally that farm net income has increased 50% since he has taken office. The claim remains noteworthy because income is on the minds of farmers completing their planting season and the coronavirus pandemic has led Congress to allocate billions of dollars in federal aid, with additional legislation pending. ""You suffered a lot with people that were stupid,"" Trump said at the rally. ""Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50% and will now be rising even faster."" Whether that income has gone up 50%, however, requires some explanation. Alejandro Plastina, an assistant professor of economics at Iowa State University, said net income has increased, but mostly because a large portion of it came from federal aid to farmers in 2017 through 2019 to counter the effects of a United States trade dispute with China.  Plastina said removing direct government farm program payments would show 2016 through 2019 net income, which accounts for total yields and additional revenue farmers collect, increasing 42% and net cash income that covers only total crop yields and livestock increasing 17% percent. Why the different net income figures, and why are they different from Trump’s? Because the U.S. Department of Agriculture calculates net farm income by taking into account farmers’ inventories, total yield revenues, and machinery and other costs applied to the production process that offset income. For example, the net cash income that only encompasses total yields increased 25% with direct farm program payments from $95.6 billion in 2016 to $120 billion in 2019, according USDA Economic Research Service data. According to that USDA data, farm net income increased 50% from 2016, the last full year Barack Obama was president, through 2019, from $62.3 billion to $93.6 billion. The Daily Iowan reached out to the USDA for data on how much direct farm payments account for the total of farm net income since Trump has been in office, but only received the following statement via email attributed to a USDA spokesperson: ""From 2016 to 2020, net farm income has increased 55%."" In 2015, federal aid to farmers accounted for an average of 13% of their overall net income. In 2016, that number increased to about 21%. In 2017, federal aid accounted for about 15% of overall net farm income, in 2018 it accounted for about 16%, and in 2019 it accounted for 25% of farmers’ net farm income. We calculated these figures using two data tables from the USDA — one listing the federal aid payments and other listing net income trends. The USDA forecasts that federal aid could account for about 15% percent of overall net farm income in 2020, based on data as of February, which does not include some COVID-19-related relief packages. The next 2020 income and federal aid forecast is to be released in September.  In 2013 when Obama was president, net farm income reached a record high of $124 billion, but Plastina said that can be attributed to farm fields being more productive. On April 17, Trump announced a $19 billion federal aid package for the agriculture sector that includes $16 billion in direct payments to farmers. This additional income is not factored into the USDA’s 2020 net income forecast. More agriculture relief bills are on the horizon, including a bipartisan House bill that would lift the Commodity Credit Corporation’s annual borrowing cap to $68 billion — an amount adjusted to catch up with inflation, according to the American Farm Bureau.  If you look at net income year-by-year, the increase from 2017 through 2019, when Trump was in office, was 25%. When factoring in 2015 and 2016, during the Obama Administration, the increase in farm net income was 15% over the five-year period. According to the USDA 2020 Farm Income Forecast, net farm income is projected to increase $3.1 billion, or about 3%, from 2019 through 2020. In inflation adjusted dollars, that expected increase would be $1.4 billion, or about 1%, from 2019 tthrough 2020. Net cash income is expected to decrease by 9% from 2019 through 2020, the forecast showed.  According to the forecast, the anticipated net cash income decline could be attributed to $14.7 billion in cash receipts from crop sales in 2019 and $0.5 billion in sales in 2020. Tom Vilsack, former Iowa governor and former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, countered Twitter Trump’s claim on net farm income by noting that farm bankruptcies in the U.S. had increased 20%. Vilsack wrote: ""The reality is that when @JoeBiden was VP and Barack Obama was president farmers had the highest income in the history of the United States of America. Today we’ve seen a 20% increase in farm bankruptcy.""  According to the American Farm Bureau, farm bankruptcies in the U.S. increased 20% from 2018 to 2019, even with direct farm payment programs. In 2019, 595 family farms nationally declared Chapter 12 bankruptcy, up by 100 from the previous year and the highest since 2011, according to the American Farm Bureau. According to the bureau report, an increase in bankruptcy filings was anticipated because of uncertainty on the trade front, record farm debt, and recent changes to the 2019 Family Farmer Relief Act, which increased the debt ceiling to $10 million to broaden the definition of what it means to be a family farmer.  Trump said net farm income has increased 50% since he has taken office. Data from the USDA shows that while net income has increased by 50%, but federal aid to farmers accounts for a large portion of that increase and the aid was not the usual kind of federal assistance farmers receive. Rather, it was given because of a Trump Administration decision to take on a trade war with China.

""If ur (sic) refused service at a store for no mask call the dept of health and report the store. Masks are suggested, not required,"" says a post shared on April 28. The number listed in the post calls the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s 24/7 phone line that’s intended for people to report a ""public health emergency."" But this is bad advice. In many states, Pennsylvania included, employees and customers are required to wear masks inside stores. It’s when businesses don’t enforce those rules that they should be reported, the health department says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Pennsylvania’s Worker Safety Order states that essential businesses must require that all customers ""wear masks while on premises, and deny entry to individuals not wearing masks, unless the business is providing medication, medical supplies, or food, in which case the business must provide alternative methods of pick-up or delivery of such goods."" It also says that the measure doesn’t apply to individuals who cannot wear masks due to their medical condition, or to children under the age of 2 per CDC guidance. ""This is incorrect,"" said Nate Wardle, press secretary for Pennsylvania’s DOH. ""Stores and businesses that are not following guidance regarding wearing a mask are what are to be reported. Stores have the right, as defined in our Worker Safety Order, to refuse service to anyone not wearing a mask."" States differ on mask policies right now, but businesses largely have the right to refuse service under U.S. law, as long as it isn’t on discriminatory grounds, which includes turning people away based on their race, religion, sex or national origin.  We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D6580>],/factchecks/2020/may/22/facebook-posts/post-falsely-claims-people-should-report-pennsylva/

No, House Democrats did not sneak long recess into HEROES Act
","A Facebook group called Donald Trump 2020 Voters reposted a meme that skewered House Democrats. ""The House Democrats snuck a provision into their $3 trillion bailout bill today that would keep the House in recess until July 21,"" the May 16 post said. It’s wrong, and the original author of the meme admitted as much. The bill in question is HR 6800. Called the HEROES Act, it offered billions to state and local governments, extended an emergency loan program for small businesses, and would send Americans up to $1,200 in a second round of stimulus money. It passed the House late in the evening May 15.

That means the language of 'refusing to go to work' was inaccurate in this specific meme."" So, nothing snuck into a bill, and nothing anywhere that would keep the House in recess until July 21. Before the vote on the HEROES Act, the House adopted HR 967, a resolution setting the rules for the vote. That measure said the House could adjourn ""on any legislative day during the period from May 19, 2020, through July 21, 2020.""

The Italian government doesn’t want to arrest Bill Gates
","Philanthropist Bill Gates has been making headlines for months due to his foundation’s efforts to create a coronavirus vaccine, but not all the claims you see online can be trusted.  A recent blog post from an organization called Live News 24 suggests the entire Italian government is at odds with Gates. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Italian Parliament calls for the arrest of Bill Gates,"" reads the headline. The headline’s claim is a misleading exaggeration, and this becomes clear when readers continue past the headline and into the article. A single member of the Italian Parliament, Sara Cunial, made a speech in which she called for Gates’ arrest. But there is no evidence that Cunial’s speech was supported by the entire Italian Parliament.  This claim has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations, including Snopes, Republic World and Polygraph.info.  In her speech, which was recorded and posted online with an English translation, Cunial criticized mass media and made wildly inaccurate claims about Gates, including that he used vaccines to sterilize millions of women in Africa and said that only a genocide could save the world. Cunial was once part of Italy’s Five Star Movement, a political party that has opposed vaccines and once advocated for Italy’s withdrawal from the eurozone and NATO. Some experts have linked the Five Star Movement’s opposition to vaccines to a measles outbreak in Italy. Cunial was expelled from the party in 2019. ""‘Dear President Conte,"" Cunial said in her speech, ""next time you receive a phone call from the ‘philanthropist’ Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.""  Cunial’s speech was interrupted by vocal objections from other members of parliament who appeared to disagree with her viewpoint. This further suggests that Cunial’s calls for the Gates to be charged with crimes against humanity are not widely supported by the Italian government. We rate this claim False. Correction, May 26, 2020: This story was corrected to reflect that Cunial was expelled from the Five Star Movement party in 2019.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFE3840>],/factchecks/2020/may/22/blog-posting/italian-government-doesnt-want-arrest-bill-gates/

Reviewing CDC's suggestions for how protect students and educators from the coronavirus
","As school districts grapple with how to educate students in the next academic year amid the coronavirus, a list summarizing some of the federal government’s suggestions for how to safely return to the classroom is being shared on social media — but it’s missing some context. Some people reading the list on social media are misinterpreting these suggestions as mandates. But the language throughout the CDC’s actual advice comes with numerous caveats such as ""when possible,"" ""schools may consider,""and ""as feasible.""  ""Here we go,"" begins the text of the image being shared widely on Facebook. ""New CDC guidelines for reopening schools."" They’re written as follows:  ""This is off CDC website about school starting back in the fall,"" one account wrote about the image, linking to a web page about ""considerations for schools"" on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The inconsistent punctuation and casual language — ""here we go"" — were the first clues: this image of ""guidelines"" isn’t directly from the CDC website. But the CDC did update its ""considerations for schools"" on May 19, describing ""ways in which schools can help protect students, teachers, administrators, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.""  These are not mandates. Rather, the CDC says, schools can work with state and local health officials to decide ""whether and how to implement these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community."" Implementation ""should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community.""  The agency notes that online classes and activities are the least risky way to educate kids. Small, in-person classes with students social distancing are riskier, while full-sized, in-person classes where students aren’t spaced apart and share supplies pose the highest risk. The CDC also released on May 19 what the Washington Post described as a ""low-key guide to reopening,"" including ""a raft of social distancing policies"" schools. Let’s look at what the agency says compared to the list circulating on Facebook. We’ll break it down and show you what the CDC actually said:  ""Wear masks over the age of 2"" Yes, the CDC says children younger than 2 should not wear masks. As for kids over the age of 2, though, it suggests schools ""teach and reinforce use of cloth face coverings"" and notes that masks are most essential when physical distancing is difficult. ""No sharing of any items or supplies, all belongings in individual cubbies or labeled containers; no sharing electronic devices, toys, games, learning aids"" The CDC says ""schools may consider"" implementing strategies that include avoiding sharing electronic devices, toys, books and other games or learning aids, and limiting the use of shared gym or PE equipment, art supplies, toys and games. ""Discourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect,"" it says. ""Keep each child’s belongings separated from others’ and in individually labeled containers, cubbies or areas.""  ""Desks 6 feet apart, all facing the same way"" This is mostly right. The CDC does recommend desks and student seats be at least 6 feet apart ""when feasible."" And, it says, ""turn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, space apart."" ""Distance on school buses- one child per seat, skip rows"" Yes, ""when possible"" the CDC suggests creating distance between children on buses. It gives as an example the idea of seating only one child per row and skipping rows. ""Install sneeze guards and partitions wherever you cannot space 6ft apart"" It says to ""install physical barriers"" in areas where it is hard for people to keep at least 6 feet apart. Sneeze guards and partitions are examples of such barriers. ""One way routes in hallways; tape on sidewalks and walls to assure kids stay 6ft apart"" In areas where it’s hard for people to keep 6-feet apart, ""physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls,"" can be used to help make one-way hallway routes.  ""No communal shared spaces - cafeterias, playgrounds"" Yes, the CDC suggests closing communal spaces like dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment ""if possible."" ""Otherwise,"" it says, ""stagger use and clean and disinfect between use."" ""Physical barriers or screens between sinks in bathrooms"" Yes, the CDC suggests adding ""physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart."" ""Only pre-packaged boxes or bags of food instead of cafeteria food; kids eat in classrooms"" ""As feasible,"" kids should bring their own meals or else schools should ""serve individually plated meals in classrooms instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria."" At events, the CDC recommends food come in pre-packaged, single-serve boxes or bags instead of a buffet or family-style meal. ""No field trips, assemblies, or external organizations in schools. Limit volunteers and visitors.""  It does recommend that schools opt for ""virtual activities"" instead of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights."" Nonessential visitors and volunteers should also be limited ""as possible."" ""Same children stay with same staff all day, no switching groups or teachers.""  Essentially, yes, but without the hard line: ""Ensure that student and staff groupings are as static as possible by having the same group of children stay with the same staff (all day for young children, and as much as possible for older children). Limit mixing between groups, if possible."" ""Stagger arrival and departure times for students to limit exposure to crowds of kids.""  The CDC suggests staggering arrival and drop-off times or locations in groups of students, or putting protocols in place to limit contact between each group. ""If possible, daily health and temperature checks.""  ""If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff and students."" ""And several rules about cleaning and disinfecting throughout the day and hand washing frequently."" The CDC says to ""teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds"" and advises schools to provide hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t readily available. It also suggests cleaning and disinfecting touched surfaces like playground equipment, door handles, sink handles and water fountains at least daily or between use as much as possible.  Our ruling The image being shared on Facebook roughly summarizes some of the CDC’s suggestions for reopening schools amid the new coronavirus. But the guidelines listed are not mandated by the CDC, and they’re not comprehensive — the agency has other suggestions not mentioned in the image, such as offering options to protect staff and students who have a higher risk of severe illness.  We rate this post Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970F02C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/22/viral-image/cdc-has-new-suggestions-how-protect-students-and-s/
"['Legal Issues', 'Guns', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Taylor']","
Lawmaker correct that gun access is easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote in America
","Wisconsin state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, has a take on why gun control is badly needed:  ""Getting access to a gun in America is easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote."" The statement was made in a Dec. 13, 2019 news release, on the anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. But it mirrored many statements that came in the wake of the Feb. 26, 2020 shooting at the Miller brewery complex in Milwaukee.  And it remains somewhat of a timeless talking point.  In the release, Taylor said she vividly remembered the day the Sandy Hook shooting took place, as her son was in first grade at the time. She then said that Republican lawmakers are no closer to enacting legislation that would protect children from gun violence now than they were then.  We asked Taylor for backup, her staff sent back information on the laws and regulations surrounding gun ownership, dog ownership and voting in Wisconsin.  So we’ll start there.  Is it easier to get a gun than to adopt a four-legged friend or register to vote?  PolitiFact Wisconsin has previously written about gun sales in Wisconsin, and how purchases through a licensed dealer are different from purchases from a private seller.  If someone buys a gun from a licensed dealer, they must undergo a background check. For handguns, that check is run by the state Department of Justice. For long guns -- such as rifles or shotguns -- the check is through the National Criminal Background Check System.  Under state law, the buyer must show photo identification to the seller. Then he or she must fill out three copies of DOJ-issued documents, one for the seller, one for the buyer and one that is  sent to the DOJ after the purchase.  After the forms are completed, the seller contacts the DOJ, which charges $10 to run the check, or the National Criminal Check System. If the check turns up clear, the buyer can leave the store with the gun.  In 2019, some 294,999 guns were purchased from a licensed dealer in Wisconsin, according to Gillian Drummond, DOJ communications director. The department does not, however, track how many guns are sold in Wisconsin from non-licensed dealers, she said in an email.  Private gun sales work a bit differently.  They’re not regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to the agency’s website. Wisconsin doesn’t regulate private sales, either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates tighter restrictions on gun ownership.  Private sales can also be conducted through web sites such as Armslist or even Craigslist, taking out the process of a background check completely.  So, circling back to Taylors claim: While many gun sales require a background check, private purchases can be made with little or no scrutiny at all.  The process for adopting a dog in Wisconsin may vary from organization to organization, but for the Wisconsin Humane Society, dogs can be adopted in one day, said Angela Speed, vice president of communications.  Potential owners are required to fill out an adopter profile and then meet with a counselor, who will review the adopter’s history and needs to find a compatible four-legged match, she said. The wait to get in with a counselor can vary, from 30 minutes to three hours, depending on the day and how many others are waiting. Then of course, the meeting takes time, too.  ""We talk with each potential adopter about their lifestyle and needs of the animal, the process of meeting takes an additional hour,"" Speed said.  After an adopter is approved and picks a dog, they pay a fee that runs between $25 and $449.  Speed said that sometimes denials happen, though rare. Though the Wisconsin Humane Society doesn’t, some organizations also require home visits after a pet is adopted, Speed said.  After a dog is brought home, an owner must also purchase a dog license for any dog over 5 months old, as required by State Statute section 174.07, and the dog must be kept up-to-date on all immunizations.   So, in comparison to a gun purchase, adopting a dog can take longer and includes a counseling step. It also requires that a license be purchased. As for registering to vote, the process can be done online, in-person at a municipal clerk’s office or at the polling location the day of the election or via mail, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s website, myvote.wi.gov.  If a voter is registering by mail or online, the forms must be completed and sent back to clerks 20 days before the election. For in-person registration, forms can be completed up until the Friday before the election. Voters can also register on voting day at the polls. In order to register to vote, a person needs to have a valid Wisconsin drivers license or ID card that shows that they will be 18 by the day of the election, as well as a current address. If the address on the ID is not current, then the voter must also provide a proof of residence, such as a utility bill or bank statement. If the ID or license is expired, the last four digits of a person’s Social Security number are needed.  If registering online, a photo must be submitted of the ID. If submitting the form via the mail or fax, the ID must be copied, printed and included.  Though registering to vote requires an ID (or part of voter’s social security number or a utility bill), registering does not require a background check, as purchasing a gun from a licensed dealer does.  Taylor claimed that the process of obtaining a gun was easier than adopting a dog or registering to vote. When it comes to private sales, the claim is on target -- there are virtually no checks that happen, so any process with adopting a dog or voting requires more scrutiny. But the picture is muddier when it comes to gun sales through licensed dealers.  In those cases, purchasers face a criminal background check -- which is more than what happens when you adopt a dog or register to vote. That leaves us with a statement that’s accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Taylor’s claim Mostly True.

Did Joni Ernst flip her position on health care funding?
","The Iowa Democratic Party claims in its 2020 campaign against U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief plan 3.5, which offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing. The Iowa Democratic Party claimed in the headline of an April 21 statement that Ernst opposed funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing for weeks before $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing was included in an interim coronavirus relief bill passed by the Senate April 21 and signed by President Trump April 24. It’s a claim Democrats have continued to make against Ernst. Both Republicans and Democrats blocked interim economic relief packages proposed by the other party in April before the final half-a-trillion-dollar package cleared the Senate. The Republicans’ proposal would’ve solely funded the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and launched April 4 for businesses that keep employees on their payroll. Democrats pushed for a $500-billion-dollar-plus aid package with Paycheck Protection Program funds as well as $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local government, of which some of the hospital funds made it into the final deal. Iowa Democratic Party Communications Director Jeremy Busch referred in an interview with The Daily Iowan to a series of interviews and public statements Ernst made in April as proof her tune had changed on the expanded relief funding.  As negotiations on refilling the Paycheck Protection Program were ongoing, Ernst said in an April 16 Fox News interview she supported the program and disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress should wait. ""We have small businesses that desperately need this funding to keep their employees on payroll. If they can't do that, those employees will go unemployed and that is not the route. So, I do believe that what we had was a narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP, but the Democrats wanted to hijack it with unrelated items and additional changes. We have a program that's working, now we need to make sure that it's properly funded."" In an email to the Daily Iowan's PolitiFact Iowa, Ernst’s spokesperson, Brendan Conley, wrote that Ernst’s comment on ""unrelated items and additional changes"" referred to an early House version of what eventually became the CARES Act, the third relief bill. The version Conley referred to was noted in a March 23 article in the Hill; it didn’t clear the Senate but included funding to curb airline pollution. However, the Paycheck Protection Program launched after that article, on April 3, as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, making it unlikely that the narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP referred to the measure that created the loan program. The proposal that better fits what Ernst is describing in the Fox News interview would’ve bumped up funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asked senators on April 9 to approve with unanimous consent a measure that would have added $250 million in federal funds to the Paycheck Protection Program. He argued on the Senate floor that the small business loan program's funds were running out and that negotiations for hospital, local government, and test funding should be part of a separate congressional package at a later date. The reason: the extra funding wouldn’t pass unanimously, he said. However, McConnell’s measure did not receive unanimous consent, as two Democrats voiced opposition. No formal recorded vote was taken to gauge Senate support for the initial proposal, so there's no formal record of Ernst's support or opposition to that measure. Minutes after the two Democratic senators from Maryland rejected McConnell’s ask to fast-track the measure, the pair proposed their own amendment which was double the dollar figure of McConnell’s. It included $100 billion for hospitals dealing with COVID-19 and $150 billion for state and local governments.  A final proposal to McConnell’s original interim bill included $500 billion for hospitals, the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19 testing, but none for local government. The Senate approved that measure April 21 with unanimous consent, a procedural fast-tracking move that means no senators voiced opposition. Again, the Senate didn’t record a vote tally, but Conley wrote to the DI in an email that Ernst supported that half-a-trillion-dollar bill. A day before the final proposal was approved in the Senate, Ernst said in an April 20 town hall, that she supported the $3.5 coronavirus relief bill’s extra $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. ""We will also get the additional dollars we wanted for diagnostic testing an additional $25 billion there as well as another $75 billion for our hospitals. And again this is something that I’ve pushed for because we want to make sure that our rural hospitals are sustaining through this COVID-19 pandemic,"" Ernst said. Conley wrote in an April 24 email to the Daily Iowan: ""Sen. Ernst fully supports the additional funding for hospitals and testing — which are very much related to the COVID-19 pandemic — as she reiterated on Monday (April 20), and that's exactly why she supported the bill that passed the Senate this week. Her voting record shows, in no uncertain terms, that she supports those measures."" In other statements as well before the final interim package passed, Ernst reiterated her support for a narrower agreement. According to a RadioIowa report, Ernst said April 16 that discussions about extra funding for hospitals and local governments could wait until Congress passed the PPP funds.  ""No political gimmicks, just a simple ask to put more money in this program,"" RadioIowa reported Ernst saying. ""Unfortunately, politics got in the way."" In a statement from Ernst’s office April 9, the day Democrats and Republicans rejected each others’ interim relief plans, Ernst criticized Democrats for rejecting Republicans’ proposal, stating that passing small business loan relief funds was too urgent to delay.  ""After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, it’s clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We don’t have time for political games; we’re in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so let’s put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our state’s small businesses can stay afloat,"" Ernst said. Congress put $350 billion toward the PPP at it's creation. The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applications April 27. The interim package was one of several COVID-19 relief packages Congress has passed.  The Iowa Democratic Party claimed that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief in a recent bill that offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing. Due to a lack of concrete voting record, we reviewed Ernst's statements before and after the passage of the interim coronavirus-relief bill.  Ernst hasn't said she directly opposed hospital funding, but in public statements she was critical of putting a proposal on the floor with funding that was more broad than the Paycheck Protection Program. When Democrats brought their version of the interim relief proposal, which included extra dollars for hospitals and local government, to the senate floor April 9, McConnell objected. Ernst is the Vice Chair of the Senate GOP Conference, meaning she is part of Republican leadership. However, she didn’t vote down additional funds for hospitals or COVID-19 testing in the final half-a-trillion-dollar package. She said later she pushed for hospital funding included in the interim relief package. But, she never said she directly opposed that funding. Rather, she said it should be discussed at a later date.  The claim is partially accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Half True.

Under Donald Trump, key CDC US staff in China fell to 0
","Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, argues that President Donald Trump failed to protect the country from the coronavirus when he had the chance. In an interview on MSNBC, Biden said Trump ""absolutely missed any opportunity to get ahead of this.""  Biden underscored the loss of American staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Beijing. ""We had over 44, if I’m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on,"" Biden said May 14. ""The president brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place."" This is an intriguing claim. Biden is off on the exact numbers. But his point about stripped-down oversight is supported. According to the CDC, the program in China specifically charged with spotting new infectious diseases went from having four American staff in 2017 to none by 2019. It’s impossible to say with 100% certainty that if those Americans had been there, they would have been able to alert Washington earlier to an emerging threat. But not having them there eliminated that possibility. Biden indicated he was a bit unsure of the exact numbers, and what he offered was an inconsistent blend of American and Chinese staff figures. He said there were 44 people ""from the CDC in China."" The actual number was 47 in March 2019 and that included eight Americans and 39 Chinese. When he said the number fell to four, the actual number by December 2019 was three Americans, and 11 Chinese. Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said the reduction mattered regardless. ""Donald Trump dramatically reduced America's CDC footprint in China, removing vital positions that would have provided the U.S. with a critical early warning as the virus spread,"" Gwin said. Biden leveled this charge before in a slightly different way. In March, he said the U.S.  had one person in-country and Trump ""pulled him out."" At the time, the details were murky. An American epidemiologist had left, but some Americans remained. The CDC has now shared more specific information with PolitiFact that breaks down the staffing for each of the offices and programs in its China bureau.  The new details show that the single greatest staff decline was in the HIV/AIDS program, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It went from one American and 10 Chinese employees to none. But the Global Health Protection program saw the largest reduction in U.S. staff. That program went from four Americans and 10 Chinese staff down to no Americans and five Chinese. The CDC website touts that program as training ""new disease detectives, who are critical to countries’ abilities to quickly find and stop disease outbreaks."" The program emerged out of the Ebola crisis and sent American specialists around the world to work with infectious disease experts and build capacity in over 50 countries. That mission directly applied to the outbreak of what became known as COVID-19. And at the time of the outbreak, the United States had no American staffer in the CDC office in Beijing. There is no way to say for sure that if more Americans had been in the CDC office, Washington would have had critical information sooner than it did. Former CDC chief Tom Frieden, now CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an epidemic response training organization, told PolitiFact it might have. On the other hand, the timeline for the emergence of the new coronavirus was very compressed. It wasn’t until Dec. 30 that a doctor in Wuhan first flagged that he was seeing patients with a new respiratory disease. The doctor later documented how local officials quickly accused him of spreading rumors. By Jan. 10, he was infected and had to go to the hospital, where he later died. By Jan. 14, the World Health Organization was discussing the possibility of human-to-human transmission. On Jan. 20, the Chinese government declared that the outbreak was an emergency. Biden said Trump ""brought home"" the CDC specialists. They did leave on Trump’s watch, but it’s worth noting the budget factors that directly hit the Global Health Protection program. The effort emerged from the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Congress gave the CDC about $600 million to boost capacity worldwide to spot and contain new infectious diseases. That money ran out in 2019. The head of the CDC’s Center for Global Health told staff in January 2018 that the program would be reduced to 10 countries. China was not on the list. That more targeted approach was part of the White House’s 2019 global health strategy. The White House’s FY 2020 plan did not replenish the Ebola money that ran out in 2019. The total global health security budget, which included a range of activities beyond the sort of work in China, went from $504 million in 2019 to a White House request for $482 million in 2020. We reached out to the White House and got no comment. A group representing about 200 global health organizations appealed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in January 2018 for money to keep the program going. ""The ongoing danger that biological threats pose to American health, economic, and national security interests demands dedicated and steady funding for global health security,"" the group wrote. Biden said that Trump ""brought home"" the vast majority of CDC staff in China, taking manpower from 44 down to four. He garbled the numbers. The actual staffing went from eight Americans and 39 Chinese (47), to three Americans and 11 Chinese (14). But within that, the American staff working specifically on new threats like COVID-19 went from four to zero. It is unclear whether the presence of those Americans would have provided an early warning. But the former head of the CDC said it was possible, and many global health groups lobbied for the overall program to continue. The White House decided not to ask for funds to maintain that program in China. Biden was off on his numbers, but the specific staffing details we later found add weight to the thrust of his argument.

Facebook post comparing Obama allegations to Watergate gets facts, history wrong
","A widespread Facebook post is recycling the false claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped then-candidate Donald Trump — and comparing that unsubstantiated allegation to the scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon. ""Why was it a crime for Nixon to wiretap the Democrats at Watergate but OK for Obama to wiretap Republicans at Trump Tower?"" says the May 28, 2019, Facebook post. The post has been re-circulating as Trump accuses Obama of an unspecified crime. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But there has never been any evidence to support Trump’s assertions on Twitter and elsewhere that ""Obama had (Trump’s) ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower"" before the 2016 election, no matter how many times Trump, his allies and bloggers online have said so. There still isn’t.  Historians who have studied Nixon also told us that while Nixon tried to cover up the Watergate break-in, there isn’t conclusive evidence that he personally ordered the break-in. Trump first accused Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower, a skyscraper serving as the Trump Organization’s headquarters in New York City, in a pair of March 4, 2017, tweets.   Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Trump and the White House wrongly claimed the allegation was backed by news reports, including from the New York Times. Lawmakers from both parties said they had seen nothing to substantiate the allegations, and an Obama spokesperson said in a statement that ""neither Barack Obama nor any White House official under Obama ever ordered surveillance of any U.S. citizen."" Trump didn’t drop the issue, however. Similar claims soon popped up online. We debunked doctored photos of Obama in handcuffs and made-up articles claiming he had been indicted, arrested or caught fleeing the country. All were fabricated. The Republican chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a joint 2017 statement that they saw ""no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance."" Days later, former FBI Director James Comey and former National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers both testified that there was no information to support Trump’s original tweets. Then, the Justice Department said in a court filing retrieved through a Freedom of Information Request that they ""have no records related to wiretaps as described"" by Trump. Finally, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, testifying about his 2019 report on the origins of the Russia investigation later led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, said his review found no proof that Trump Tower or Trump’s phone had been wiretapped.  Did the FBI try & overthrow the presidency?—No Tap phones at Trump Tower?—NoPlant informants/spies?—NoThe IG report makes clear the Mueller investigation was NOT a “scam” conducted by “scum,” but an essential response to a serious attack on our democracy. pic.twitter.com/X6EMJ39whl Even Trump, speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity in 2019, said he made the allegation ""on a little bit of a hunch.""  The FBI did conduct legal, court-ordered surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page as part of the broader Russia investigation that Horowitz determined was justified. Horowitz found some errors in the FBI’s application for a FISA warrant to surveil Page.  But that’s different from the secret, warrantless wiretapping that was found at Watergate. The Facebook post also botched the history surrounding Nixon’s resignation, experts said. Nixon resigned in the face of a likely impeachment after he was caught working to cover up a 1972 break-in and wiretapping at the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters.  The arrest of five burglars at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., where the headquarters was located, kicked off a series of events that led to Nixon’s resignation.  But it’s not clear that Nixon directed the break-in himself, experts said. ""There is no good evidence that Nixon knew about the Watergate break-in before the burglars got caught, nor is there any good evidence that he knew that anyone from his reelection campaign was planning to bug Democratic headquarters,"" said Ken Hughes, a historian at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and an expert on Nixon’s recordings. There’s no tape or memo tying Nixon to the break-in, said David Greenberg, professor of history and journalism at Rutgers University and author of a book on Nixon. There's some evidence to suggest Nixon knew, but it’s inconclusive. For starters, Nixon acknowledged in a memoir that he was generally comfortable with burglary and wiretapping, Greenberg told us. And in a recording days after the break-in, Nixon said, ""My God, the committee isn’t worth bugging, in my opinion. That’s my public line."" Finally, Watergate-conspirator Jeb Magruder also said Nixon was aware of the plot, Greenberg said. Those comments came in an interview in 2003, decades after Magruder wrote in a memoir that he didn’t know if Nixon had advance knowledge. ""Whether he authorized the break-in and illegal wiretap is unknown,"" Greenberg said, adding that ""regardless of whether Nixon knew, no one disputes that it was an illegal wiretap."" So why did Nixon orchestrate a cover-up? Hughes said it was because the masterminds of the Watergate break-in — former CIA agent E. Howard Hunt and FBI agent G. Gordon Liddy — had been involved in ""other nefarious schemes that Nixon did order."" ""Nixon ordered the cover-up because an unobstructed investigation of Hunt and Liddy’s crimes would lead back to his own,"" Hughes said.  Among other things, those crimes would have included a never-implemented order to break into the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, Hughes said.  The ""plumbers,"" as Nixon’s team of former CIA and FBI agents were called, also broke into the office of the psychiatrist working for Daniel Ellsberg, the analyst who leaked the government’s secret history of the Vietnam War. President Gerald Ford eventually pardoned Nixon, so he was ""never formally charged with any crimes or brought to trial,"" Greenberg said. But he probably could have been prosecuted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy, Hughes said, noting that members of his inner circle were indicted on those charges. A Facebook post said: ""Why was it a crime for Nixon to wiretap the Democrats at Watergate but OK for Obama to wiretap Republicans at Trump Tower?"" There’s no evidence to support the allegation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Plus, historians told us that while Nixon tried to cover up the Watergate break-in, there’s no conclusive evidence that he actually ordered the wiretapping to take place.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F01280>],/factchecks/2020/may/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-comparing-obama-allegations-watergat/

Flu shots aren’t causing false positive COVID-19 tests
","A recent Facebook post is fanning the flames of a conspiracy theory that officials are overstating the number of COVID-19 cases.  ""I had a phone appointment with my Dr this afternoon, and I asked the question about testing,"" it says. ""He said, ‘If you have had a flu shot in the last 3-5 years, you will probably test positive. Coronavirus antibodies have been in the vaccines since H1N1.’ This would account for all of ‘tested positive (with no symptoms) results."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to medical experts about the post.  Davidson Hamer, a global health and medicine professor at Boston University as well as a faculty member of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory, called it ""nonsense.""   ""Coronaviruses have a completely different antigenic (surface protein and glycoprotein structure) from influenza viruses,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. ""They both cause similar syndromes but they are distinct classes of viruses and there is no evidence that I am aware of that would lead to cross reactions between immune responses to the two vaccines.""  Plus, he added, there’s ""definitely no trace of coronaviruses in influenza vaccines."" Richard Watanabe, a preventive medicine professor at the University of Southern California, told us that since there’s no evidence the novel coronavirus existed in humans before last year, ""there is no way antibodies existed before then and therefore could not have been identified and isolated.""  ""But more importantly,"" he said, ""this post seems to imply that vaccines work by directly giving you antibodies against whatever bug. That’s not how vaccines work. Vaccines give you an inactive form of the bug to allow your immune system to create antibodies."" (You can read more about how vaccines do work here.) Several other fact-checkers have also investigated whether a flu shot can result in false positives for COVID-19, and all came to the same conclusion: no.  Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, told FactCheck.org that there’s no cross reaction between influenza and the new coronavirus, meaning flu traces wouldn’t cause someone to test positive for COVID-19. A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration also told FactCheck.org that all FDA-approved COVID-19 tests are checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus and influenza antibodies and so far, no cross-reactivity has occurred.
