No, the Texas Democratic Party did not give Beto O'Rourke $4.5M
","The campaign of Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke said he raised more than $6.1 million during the first 24 hours of launching his presidential bid, more than any other candidate from his party claimed raising on their first day in the race. A tweet circulating from a Democratic activist in New York suggests that O’Rourke was able to report such a high number on his first day because of a sizable contribution made to his campaign by the Texas Democratic Party. The tweet was shared widely and was reposted many times on Facebook. The original tweet was posted by Xavier Perez, whose social media posts suggest he is backing Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. He said the alleged contribution from the Texas Democrats to O’Rourke was actually money O’Rourke had given the party after his unsuccessful challenge last year against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. ""Well this is awkward!,"" Perez said in his tweet. ""@BetoORourke gave the remaining $4.5+ mill from his Senate race to @TexasDemocrats a few months ago, & the Party sent the money back to him on the day of his announcement. So this is probably why he’s not releasing his individual contribution list."" Perez did not return an email requesting comment. O’Rourke’s campaign and officials with the Texas Democratic Party both deny his claim, and campaign finance laws prohibit political parties from making contributions of over $5,000 to a candidate during an election. Fundraising information not public yet O’Rourke spokesman Chris Evans said the $6.1 million came from individuals (O’Rourke does not accept money from political action committees) and did not include $4.5 million from the state’s Democratic party. ""Each and every single dollar of that came online from people, not from PACs, corporations, special interests or in the way described in this completely false tweet,"" Evans said in an emailed comment. O’Rourke told reporters on Wednesday that his haul from the first 24 hours in the race came from 128,000 unique contributions which averaged $48 each. Fundraising reports from the first quarter of the race are not due to the Federal Election Commission until April 15 and O’Rourke’s campaign has not released a list of donors who contributed during his first day in the race. Transferred money was spent O’Rourke’s Senate campaign, called Beto for Texas, transferred more than $4.5 million to the Texas Democratic Party over the course of his campaign against Sen. Ted Cruz, according to campaign finance filings. The bulk of the transfers were made in October of 2018, one month before the election. One $815,000 transfer happened in September and one $450 transfer happened in November 2017. The money transferred from O’Rourke’s Senate campaign to the party was not leftover from his race, as suggested by Perez’s tweet. No money was transferred from Beto for Texas to the Texas Democrats after Election Day. Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, laughed when asked about the tweet and said any money transferred to the committee from O’Rourke went immediately into ongoing races across the state. ""That money went straight to our field operations,"" he said. In fact, Garcia said the Texas Democrats did not make a contribution of any amount to O’Rourke’s presidential campaign durings its first 24 hours. He said it is rare for a party to give money directly to a candidate; instead it’s more likely to see a candidate contribute to the party. The Texas Democratic Party raised more than $13.6 million during the 2018 election cycle (including $4.5 million from O’Rourke) and spent more than $13.4 million over the same period, according to campaign finance filings. At the end of January, the Texas Democratic Party had just $294,774 on hand, according to campaign finance data.  O’Rourke launched his campaign for president on March 14. Our Ruling Perez wrote on Twitter that O’Rourke ""gave the remaining $4.5+ mill from his Senate race to (The Texas Democratic Party) a few months ago, & the Party sent the money back to him on the day of his announcement."" O’Rourke transferred $4.5 million to the state’s Democratic party during the last month of his Senate campaign and party officials said the money was spent immediately to mobilize volunteers and voters. Political parties are not allowed to give more than $5,000 to a political candidate during an election. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

"['Economy', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Texas', 'Julián Castro']","
Julian Castro claims Trump's budget cuts health care to pay for tax cuts. That's exaggerated
","Julian Castro, a Democratic contender for the White House, criticized President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for the next fiscal year, claiming it cut health care spending to make up for tax breaks for the wealthy. ""A President’s budget is a statement of values. The #TrumpBudget slashes investments in health care to pay for tax cuts to billionaires. We need new moral leadership,"" Castro tweeted March 12. A President’s budget is a statement of values. The #TrumpBudget slashes investments in health care to pay for tax cuts to billionaires. We need new moral leadership.https://t.co/W5du6iasKy Castro served as secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department in the final years of the Obama administration and was the mayor of San Antonio, Texas. Is he right about the budget proposal? Trump’s 2020 budget asks for less money for the health department compared to 2019. But there isn’t a direct connection between recently passed tax cuts and the proposed reductions. Castro’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for more details. Castro’s tweet linked to a March 11 Washington Post story that said Trump’s budget sought ""a sharp slowdown in Medicaid spending as part of a broad reduction in the government’s investment in health care."" The story said the budget proposed decreasing funding for the Health and Human Services Department; slowed spending on Medicare with cuts that ""could be construed as between $500 billion and $600 billion;"" ""a cut of nearly $1.5 trillion in Medicaid over 10 years;"" and the addition of $1.2 trillion for state block grants or per-person caps starting in 2021, after a restructuring of Medicaid. The story does not examine whether the proposal, as Castro tweeted, would ""pay for tax cuts to billionaires."" Trump’s fiscal year 2020 budget proposal asks for $87.1 billion in discretionary funding for the health department. That’s a 12 percent decrease from 2019. There is a notable change for Medicare, the program that provides health coverage for seniors age 65 and older and for certain younger people with disabilities. The proposal reduces Medicare spending over a 10-year period (2020-29), compared to projected spending under current law. Estimates on the reduction vary, from the lower end of $500 billion to nearly $600 billion. (The budget calls for $846 billion less in Medicare spending; but about a third of that $846 billion isn’t eliminated, it’s moved elsewhere in the overall budget.) The Medicare reduction mostly comes from cuts to health care providers, not to beneficiaries directly. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that is hawkish on the deficit, said in a blog post that cuts to providers ""could impact quality of and access to care on the margins,"" but would mainly make Medicare work more efficiently. The story is different for Medicaid because the proposed changes would directly impact beneficiaries. Medicaid provides health coverage to low-income Americans, and pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities who meet certain criteria. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults. States could choose whether to participate in the expansion. Trump wants to repeal that expansion and give states more control over the program. The budget proposes Medicaid funding through a per-capita cap or block grants to states. The budget would reduce Medicaid funding by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and eliminate $500 billion in subsidies that help lower-income people purchase coverage in the ACA marketplaces. It adds $1.2 trillion for grants to states over that 10-year period. In total, the proposed budget cuts to Medicaid and ACA coverage programs amount to about a $777 billion Medicaid reduction over 10 years, according to Aviva Aron-Dine, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The proposed Medicaid changes would likely result in coverage and benefit reductions, said Marc Goldwein, vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Our analysis of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act found that every income group is expected to pay less in taxes in 2019, but the benefits of the tax bill flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers. Some of the individual tax cuts phase out in 2025 for lower-earning income groups. By 2027, every income group below $75,000 sees a tax increase, our analysis said. While spending cuts can be seen as a way to compensate for tax cuts, there isn’t a direct link between the proposed health care cuts and the recently passed tax law, experts told us. ""The existence of tax cuts may put more pressure to cut Medicare and Medicaid,"" Goldwein said. ""But any relationship is indirect."" Castro said Trump’s fiscal year 2020 budget ""slashes investments in health care to pay for tax cuts to billionaires."" Castro’s choice of word, ""slashes,"" is subjective. There’s some truth to Castro’s about health care reductions, since Trump’s proposal decreases the health department’s budget. The plan calls for a restructuring of Medicaid that would likely lead to reduced coverage and benefits. The budget also reduces future Medicare spending, but that mainly affects health care providers, not beneficiaries. It’s misleading to say that the health care changes pay for tax cuts to billionaires, because there isn’t a direct link between them. It’s also worth noting that while in the long-run the tax cuts remain in place for higher earning individuals, every income group on average is expected to pay less in taxes in 2019 because of the tax law. Castro’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BC8D40>],/factchecks/2019/mar/20/julian-castro/fact-checking-julian-castros-claim-about-trump-202/
"['Drugs', 'Vermont', 'Matthew Birmingham']","
Vermont’s police chief said cops risk death from opioid exposure. He’s wrong.
","Vermont’s state police director seemed certain that he knew what caused one of his troopers to collapse this weekend in a parking lot following a traffic stop during which the officer seized a small baggie of heroin from the vehicle. Exposure to whatever was in the baggie. ""Testing is underway to determine the substance to which Sgt. Flansburg was exposed,"" Vermont State Police said on Saturday. Col. Birmingham said the officer, Acting Sgt. Brett Flansburg, could have died from an overdose if not for the speedy response by fellow troopers and medical professionals, who revived him with three doses of the opioid antidote Narcan. Being a state trooper is dangerous enough with duties like apprehending criminals, dealing with volatile individuals, and rushing toward emergencies, Birmingham said in the statement.   ""Now there is a new threat that we’re seeing up close: the risk of exposure to powerful drugs that can kill in even tiny amounts,"" Birmingham said. ""This is so troubling and disconcerting, and it places members of law enforcement at unnecessary risk of possibly losing their lives."" ""Were it not for the immediate availability of Narcan and the quick actions of his fellow troopers and medical personnel, we might be speaking today about the death of a trooper in the line of duty,"" he added. ""I’m angry at how close we came, and relieved that the situation was no worse than it was."" VTDigger was among a number of local news outlets who reported on the press release. Within hours of publishing, a number of readers told us Birmingham was mistaken. They said the scenario he was describing was simply not possible, even though similar stories have popped up in Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where a police officer reportedly overdosed after brushing fentanyl residue off his uniform. Vermont police have not yet released any test results. But we decided to go ahead and fact-check the underlying claim in Birmingham’s statement. Do police face a deadly risk from incidental exposure to small amounts of powerful opioids? We reached out to VSP spokesperson Adam Silverman to find out where Birmingham got his information. Silverman declined to comment further on the connection between Flansburg’s collapse and the drugs he seized. But he did send us guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including a video advising first responders on how to deal with fentanyl and its analogs. It’s certainly true that fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are highly dangerous. The customs agency cites statistics showing that 19,413 Americans lost their lives to synthetic opioids in 2016, up 639 percent from 2012. But those people were actively injecting or ingesting the drug, not having incidental contact. ""One myth is that just touching any amount of fentanyl is likely to cause severe illness, or injury or even death. And that’s just not true,"" Dr. David Tarantino, a senior medical advisor to the customs agency, says in the CBP video. Tarantino says that fentanyl can be washed off with soap and water (not hand sanitizer, which can increase absorption), and that first responders can protect themselves with protective equipment like gloves and a face mask.   ""Exposure can come in many ways,"" he adds, ""through skin contact; through the mucus membranes of your mouth, your eyes; or the most significant risk is from aerosolized, airborne powder."" Tarantino offers further advice on the agency’s website. ""Avoid exposure to cuts, scrapes, broken skin, or mucus membranes (eyes, nose, mouth),"" he is quoted as saying. ""Most important, avoid turning the opioid into an air-born danger and breathing it in, as inhalation increases the risk."" The other piece of evidence Silverman provided was from the CDC, which offers similar advice for first responders who come into contact with fentanyl. ""Potential exposure routes of greatest concern include inhalation, mucous membrane contact, ingestion, and percutaneous exposure (e.g., needlestick),"" the CDC says. ""Any of these exposure routes can potentially result in a variety of symptoms that can include the rapid onset of life-threatening respiratory depression."" However, medical toxicology organizations and emergency physicians across the country say law enforcement officers have it all wrong when it comes to the occupational risk of fentanyl. They say that something is happening to the officers, who report feeling dizzy or losing control of their body, but not signs of opioid toxicity such as respiratory depression. Emergency physicians Dr. Jeremy Faust, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Edward Boyer, an associate professor at Harvard, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times after Massachusetts banned fentanyl and carfentanil from being brought into courts as evidence. ""The policy is based in part on the idea that even minuscule amounts of skin exposure to these drugs can be life-threatening,"" they wrote. ""This is patently false — and we fear that it will worsen what is already a public health crisis."" The physicians wrote about two separate stories in Ohio, both widely disseminated in local and national media, about a police patrolman and three nurses coming into contact with potent opioids and needing to be revived with Narcan. ""Both stories are examples of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy:"" they wrote ""Just because somebody received naloxone and later recovered is not by itself proof that the medication had any more effect than that other tried-and-true antidote for what are likely to have been severe panic attacks: time."" The American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology came to a similar conclusion in a paper on the topic. ""Fentanyl and its analogs are potent opioid receptor agonists, but the risk of clinically significant exposure to emergency responders is extremely low,"" the groups wrote in July 2017. ""To date, we have not seen reports of emergency responders developing signs or symptoms consistent with opioid toxicity from incidental contact with opioids."" Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a physician at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and lead author of the paper, told STAT that many of the scenarios and symptoms described by law enforcement officers didn’t align with what would cause an overdose, and what an overdose would feel like. ""A lot of the symptoms are nondescript, such as vague dizziness, that don’t concern opioid poisoning,"" he said. ""And in a lot of the cases, the way that they were exposed doesn’t make sense, like brushing a small amount of powder off a uniform."" So touching fentanyl briefly won’t cause immediate medical problems. But can inhaling it cause an overdose? Probably not in the limited amounts that first responders are likely to encounter at a crime scene, the medical toxicologists say in their paper. Dr. Howie Mell, an emergency physician in the Chicago area and spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said it’s highly unlikely that someone would overdose by inhaling fentanyl, unless it had been weaponized (as happened in a raid on a Russian theater). Even for industrial workers who manufacture fentanyl, it would take nearly 200 minutes of exposure to reach a dose of 100 mcg, enough to have a therapeutic effect but not to cause an overdose, he said. And fentanyl factories are likely to have higher concentrations in the air than a crime scene. Mell said the reason that CDC guidance seemed to contradict other advice was because it was taking the most cautious position possible. It’s true that fentanyl can penetrate skin, if people are exposed to large amounts for hours. And it can be toxic in the air if it has been ""aerosolized"" in large amounts. Both are highly unlikely, but can’t be entirely ignored as a scientific possibility, he said.   ""We also know that none of the cases where law enforcement officers have been suspected of coming into contact in this fashion -- none of them have tested positive,"" he said. Having seen the rise in opioid deaths inside the hospital, Mell said he understood why law enforcement officers would be psychologically scarred by it all. ""It’s body after body, and that takes its toll, it just does, it’s scary, and even experienced, well intentioned law enforcement officers have to be going home the same way emergency physicians are, and saying ‘What’s happening?’"" he said. ""I get why people are afraid of this,"" he added, ""it’s not a fault of character, it’s not a wilful thing, it’s a mind protective response."" Mell said the belief that exposure to tiny amounts of fentanyl can lead to overdoses was dangerous for two reasons. The fear of incidental contact could cause first responders to slow down when responding to an overdose, when time is of the essence. And it could lead to false diagnoses. If a police officer collapses from a heart attack, for example, Narcan is not the right response. ""We’ve kind of convinced the public that any person who’s unconscious that’s less than a nursing home age needs Narcan,"" Mell said. Col. Matthew T. Birmingham said: ""Now there is a new threat that we’re seeing up close: the risk of exposure to powerful drugs that can kill in even tiny amounts."" It’s not clear what happened to Flansburg, the state trooper. But Birmingham went beyond the specific incident to make a broader statement about the mortal risk to law enforcement officers from exposure to tiny amounts of powerful opioids. Even without protective gear, the scientific and medical communities are clear: incidental contact with small amounts of fentanyl will not cause an overdose. We rate Birmingham’s claim false.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097009C40>],/factchecks/2019/mar/20/matthew-birmingham/vermonts-police-chief-said-cops-risk-death-opioid-/
"['Border Security', 'North Carolina', 'Thom Tillis']","
By supporting Trump, Tillis completely reverses course
","Sen. Thom Tillis recently made news for doing something especially taboo in politics: He changed his mind. On March 14, Tillis voted to support President Donald Trump’s national emergency declarationto circumvent Congress and fund a wall on the southern border. Tillis’ vote received attention across the country, because it came less than a month after he wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that criticized Trump’s decision. On Feb. 25, the Post published Tillis’ letter: ""I support Trump’s vision on border security. But I would vote against the emergency."" Afterward, people accused Tillis of flip-flopping. A Washington Post reporter called Tillis’ vote a ""remarkable flip-flop."" WRAL’s editorial staff referred to it as a ""flip-flop for the ages."" The Fayetteville Observer’s editorial writers said it was an ""Olympic gold flip-flop."" In a fundraising email, the North Carolina Democratic Party said Tillis ""says one thing, then does another."" Is it fair to describe Tillis’ vote as a flip-flop? Let’s see how Tillis’ statement before the vote compares with what he said after the vote. BEFORE THE VOTE Tillis said if he were in Trump’s shoes as president, he might also declare an emergency. ""But I am not. I am a member of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress’s power,"" he wrote in the Feb. 25 letter. Tillis foreshadowed the backlash he might receive from conservatives. ""Those on the left and the right who are making Trump’s emergency declaration a simple political litmus test of whether one supports or opposes the president and his policies are missing the mark,"" Tillis wrote. His prediction was right. Republicans in some North Carolina counties openly expressed disappointment in Tillis, and some said they welcomed a primary challenger. AFTER THE VOTE In a press release after the vote on March 14, Tillis said his concerns were ""never about what President Trump is trying to accomplish but rather with setting a precedent that a future Democratic president would exploit to bypass Congress to implement policies well outside the mainstream."" He offered an explanation of his change of heart on the Senate floor. ""My main concern with this executive action is future potential abuses. I have a concern with the executive action that the president took, the emergency order. That’s why I voiced it,"" Tillis said, adding: ""But I’m sympathetic to what he was trying to do … and I thought we could view this as an opportunity to where maybe we could have a discussion about the National Emergencies Act and potentially make a real difference here."" This statement gives the impression that Tillis wasn’t very critical of Trump and that his goal all along was to reform the National Emergencies Act, which grants presidents special powers during national crises. Tillis noted that he spoke with the White House, which he said agreed to help reform the National Emergencies Act. Tillis is a co-sponsor of the Article One Act, introduced two days before his vote. (Article One is the part of the Constitution that created Congress) The bill would automatically end future emergency declarations after 30 days unless Congress voted to extend the emergency. Bill sponsors noted that, under current laws, Congress can cancel an emergency declaration only by passing a resolution that can withstand a presidential veto. ""That this president is prepared to transfer power back to the Article 1 branch by his statements either publicly or through his administration is extraordinary,"" Tillis said. His op-ed did allude to future presidents. ""As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,"" Tillis wrote. ""As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms."" MISLEADING EXPLANATION However, Tillis’ op-ed didn’t mention the National Emergencies Act. And he was critical of this particular emergency declaration -- not just those that might happen in the future. Let’s look back at the op-ed. ""Although Trump certainly has legitimate grievances over congressional Democrats’ obstruction of border-security funding, his national emergency declaration on Feb. 15 was not the right answer,"" Tillis wrote. This particular line of the op-ed stands out: ""There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party,"" Tillis wrote. OUR RULING In an op-ed, Tillis said he opposed Trump’s emergency declaration and then, less than a month later, voted to support it. This a major reversal of his position, which is the definition of a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter.

"['Drugs', 'Crime', 'Marijuana', 'Wisconsin', 'David Crowley']","
Rep. David Crowley misfires with claim on African-American men and low-level drug offenses
","The issue of decriminalization of marijuana is on the front burner in many states, including Wisconsin, where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is backing a plan that would allow residents to smoke and sell small amounts of the drug. One of the goals of the proposal, Evers said, is to reduce the disproportionate rate at which the state's black residents are incarcerated. ""People shouldn't be treated like criminals for accessing medicine that could change or maybe even save their lives,"" Evers said at a Feb. 18, 2019, news conference announcing his plan. In supporting Evers’ plan, state Rep. David Crowley, D-Milwaukee, cited high incarceration rates for African-American males. ''Over 40 percent of African-American men in my county have been going to prison for low-level drug offenses, and I think a hundred times that in the city of Madison,"" Crowley said Feb. 24, 2019, on WKOW’s ""Capital City Sunday."" Is Crowley correct? Milwaukee County incarceration When asked for backup, Crowley’s staff cited a 2013 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study. The study  — ""Wisconsin’s mass incarceration of African American males: Workforce challenges for 2013"" — stated: ""Forty percent of the African American males from Milwaukee County incarcerated since 1990 were drug offenders."" But that covers all drug offenses, whereas Crowley used the figure to describe ""low-level drug offenses."" So, Crowley is clearly off — though it is difficult to say by how much. Molly Vidal, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections, said in an email that ""There is not a Wisconsin-specific or universally common definition of ‘low-level offense.’"" One point of reference is the level Evers uses for his decriminalization measure. Under Evers’ plan, which faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled Legislature, the state's agriculture and health departments would regulate medical marijuana and users, and manufacturers and distributors of medical marijuana would not be charged with crimes if they handled up to 25 grams of the drug. For perspective, 25 grams of marijuana could fit inside a plastic sandwich bag. According to NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, marijuana is a Schedule I hallucinogenic substance under the Wisconsin Uniform Controlled Substances Act. Penalties can vary, depending upon the amount or whether it is person’s is a first or multiple offender. For example, a first offense possession charge is a misdemeanor that can result in up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000, while possession of any amount (subsequent offense) is a felony and can result in up to 3.5 years incarceration and a maximum fine of $10,000. A November 2018 report on Dane County prison admissions notes ""in general, only criminal felony cases result in an order for a person to be admitted to the Wisconsin State Prisons."" Madison incarcerations As to the second part of the claim, that the rate in Madison is ""a hundred times"" that of Milwaukee County, Crowley aide Kyle Caudill said the lawmaker got it wrong ""The 100x comment was misspoken,"" Caudill said via email. ""It is referring to the figure in (a) CityLab article from 2016 stating that ‘in Dane County … black residents were admitted to prison for drug offenses at 97 times the rate of white residents."" The figure behind that quote is the African American drug prison admission rate is 433.76, while the white drug admission rate is 4.46. The numbers come from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. In any case, it is a massively jumbled comparison. The study in question compares the discrepancy between black and white incarceration within Dane County. It says nothing about how the African-American incarceration rate in Milwaukee County compares to that in Dane County. (What’s more, Crowley also erred in citing the city of Madison, not Dane County.) What about the gap? So, where do things stand when it comes to the incarceration gap? A Jan. 12, 2018, Pew Research Center article notes the gap is shrinking. Using numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it says ""a significant decline in the number of black prisoners in recent years has steadily narrowed the gap between blacks and whites in prison to the point where it is half as wide as it was in 2009, when America’s prison population peaked."" The article also says: At the end of 2016, federal and state prisons in the United States held about 486,900 inmates who were black and 439,800 who were white —a difference of 47,100, according to the BJS. In 2009, by comparison, there were 584,800 blacks and 490,000 whites — a difference of 94,800. (This analysis counts only inmates sentenced to more than a year.) Of course, since there are many more whites than blacks in the nation, the rate is a better measuring stick. The article notes: ""In 2016, there were 1,608 black prisoners for every 100,000 black adults – more than five times the imprisonment rate for whites (274 per 100,000) and nearly double the rate for Hispanics (856 per 100,000)."" It also notes that for the all three groups, the rate has declined since 2009. For blacks it has declined the sharpest (25 percent), compared to 19 percent for Hispanics and 11 percent for whites. A July 10, 2018, CNN report cited a number of theories about what's behind the closing gap, from tougher law enforcement in rural, mostly white areas, to the explosion of opioids and heroin, which have hit hardest in white communities. Those reports both relate to national numbers. Meanwhile, Wisconsin Department of Corrections data shows that the number of black offenders admitted to prison who were convicted in Milwaukee County, and whose most serious offense was a drug offense, has mostly been declining since 2009: 2009 — 510 offenders 2010 —  505 2011 — 361 2012 — 291 2013 — 251 2014 — 245 2015 — 219 2016 — 237 2017 — 235 2018 — 236 The number for 2018, the most recent year available, is about 54 percent lower than 2009. Our rating Crowley said ''Over 40 percent of African-American men in my county have been going to prison for low-level drug offenses, and I think a hundred times that in the city of Madison."" He was off on several levels -- from incorrectly applying the Milwaukee County number to only low-level offenses, to massively jumbling the Milwaukee County-to-Madison comparison. His own aide acknowledged Crowley ""misspoke."" For a statement that is not accurate, our rating is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F01440>],/factchecks/2019/mar/19/david-crowley/state-rep-david-crowley-misfires-claim-african-ame/
"['Education', 'Texas', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Beto O'Rourke claims nearly half of Texas public school teachers have second jobs. Is that true?
","On his first day in Iowa as a Democratic presidential candidate, Beta O’Rourke heard from a man at a coffee shop who said the teachers in his district need more money. The man said teachers are struggling and paying out-of-pocket for school supplies. Things aren’t much better in Texas, said O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman. ""Nearly half of public school teachers in Texas are working a second or a third job, not for kicks, not for extra spending cash, but just to make ends meet,"" O’Rourke said March 14 in Keokuk. ""To put food on the table, to buy that medication with a $444 co-pay, just to exist. And at the same time, and the gentlemen said this in his question, out of their own pocket, they are buying supplies for their classroom, supplies for the students in them."" Is O’Rourke right about the number of Texas public school teachers with other jobs? O’Rourke’s claim draws from a voluntary, online survey that’s close on the numbers. But he exaggerates when he suggests it’s certain why teachers take outside work. O’Rourke’s campaign said he relied on survey information from the Texas State Teachers Association. The Texas organization is an affiliate of the National Education Association, a labor union. (The Texas group recommended to the National Education Association that it endorse O’Rourke’s 2018 bid for the U.S. Senate. O’Rourke narrowly lost the election to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.) The Texas organization in August 2018 (at the start of the new school year) said that according to a survey, about four of every 10 teachers expected to take extra jobs outside the classroom ""to meet family expenses."" ""Some 39 percent of TSTA respondents said they needed second jobs during the school year to supplement their school salaries,"" the Texas organization said in August. Fifty-six percent of respondents said they had summer jobs when school was not in session, the group said. ""Teacher pay in Texas has been subpar for a long time, and the financial plight of teachers has worsened in recent years because of rising health insurance costs,"" Clay Robison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, told PolitiFact. The Texas teachers organization did not have a breakdown of how many teachers specifically had second or third jobs to offset financial needs. The average salary of public school teachers in Texas is below the national average. Texas teachers on average got paid $53,167 for the 2017-2018 school year. Nationwide, teachers that school year got paid an average of $60,483 There is no data on why specifically teachers took additional jobs, but it would seem that the overriding reason is to make ends meet, said Dr. Robert Maninger, an associate professor in the School of Teaching and Learning at Sam Houston State University. He’s one of the researchers who conducted the Texas survey. The majority of moonlighting jobs center around the teaching profession, such as tutoring, Maninger said. Dick Startz, an economics professor at the University of California-Santa Barbara, (not associated with the survey) also told us that he doesn’t think there is much data available on why teachers in general take extra jobs; whether it’s to make ends meet or for extras for the family. He also said he suspected that the Texas survey results might not be representative of all state teachers because those who responded were likely selective. Researchers sent a survey link to all members of the Texas teachers organization and members voluntarily responded. There are about 50,000 teachers in the organization; 974 answered the survey. Is the survey reflective of all public school teachers in Texas? Texas has about 350,000 public school teachers. ""‘​Reflective of all’ would be impossible, I would think,"" Maninger said. ""Could I generalize our results across the population of teachers in Texas? I think so."" Sam Houston State University has been surveying teachers about their pay since 1980, Maninger noted. ""Over the last decade the number of ‘yes’ answers to moonlighting has been 31 to 44 percent,"" he said. In his February State of the State address, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared school finance reform and increasing teacher pay as emergency items. Lawmakers are considering legislation that would give classroom teachers and school librarians an annual pay raise of $5,000. More broadly at a national level, 18 percent of regular, full-time public school teachers reported having a job outside the school system to supplement their income, the U.S. Department of Education said in a June 2018 report that draws from the 2015–16 National Teacher and Principal Survey. Regionally, 17 percent of teachers in the South had a job outside their school system. (The South region included Texas, the District of Columbia, and 15 other states.) The Department of Education said its data was based on a nationally representative sample survey of public K–12 schools, principals, and teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. O’Rourke said, ""Nearly half of public school teachers in Texas are working a second or a third job, not for kicks, not for extra spending cash, but just to make ends meet."" O’Rourke’s claim is based on responses to a voluntary, online survey sent to about 50,000 Texas public school teachers. Respondents were self-selected. Close to 1,000 responded. Thirty-nine percent said they needed second jobs during the school year, and 56 percent said they had summer jobs when school was not in session. On average, public school teachers get paid less in Texas than nationally. But researchers say there is limited information on why teachers take additional jobs. O’Rourke’s claim makes it sound as if paying for basic necessities is the only reason why teachers take extra jobs. That might be the case for some teachers, but we don’t know if it is the driving factor for all of them. O’Rourke’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096959980>],/factchecks/2019/mar/19/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-claims-nearly-half-texas-public-schoo/

Has Mayor Levar Stoney flip-flopped on raising taxes?
","Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney got an earful from City Councilwoman Reva Trammell moments after he proposed tax increases to improve public schools and infrastructure. ""Mayor, you said you were not going to raise taxes when you ran for mayor,"" Trammell said during a March 6 council meeting. ""How can you stand up here, and before all of us, do this to the people?"" Stoney didn’t reply. We put the mayor on our Flip-O-Meter to see if he has changed his position on tax hikes. Stoney is asking the council for a 9-cent increase in Richmond’s real estate tax rate that would set it at $1.29 per $100 of assessed value. He’s also wants to impose a 50-cent-per-pack cigarette tax. Richmond, home to global cigarette manufacturer Altria, is the only major city in Virginia without a cigarette tax. The real estate tax rate increase would generate $21.1 million for the budget year starting July 1, and the cigarette tax would raise $3 million. In addition to the combined $24.1 million tax hike, Stoney expects $22 million to come in from rising real estate assessments. With council approval, Stoney would spend $18 million of the new money on public school programs and $19 million on infrastructure. In 2018, Stoney persuaded the council to raise Richmond’s 6 percent meals tax at restaurants to 7.5 percent. That’s generating $9.1 million a year to finance renovation and replacement of decrepit school facilities. Stoney’s words We asked Trammell for proof of her claim that Stoney, during his 2016 campaign, said he wouldn’t raise taxes. She said she didn’t remember a specific occasion but, perhaps, he said it during an appearance in her home 8th District in Southside Richmond. We couldn’t find a recording or a news story on that event. A dive through recordings and newspaper stories from the campaign shows Stoney’s tax stance was, for the most part, consistent. His stock comment was, while the city needed money for schools, increasing taxes - other than for cigarettes - was a last resort. ""Before we get to that step, have we exhausted every avenue?"" he said in a July 10, 2016 Q&A with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""Have we fought for our fair share from state government? Have we teamed up with the federal government to bring dollars back to Richmond, and have we gone out and found those philanthropic dollars ... to help augment our current financial situation? I think we have not done that."" During a Sept. 20, 2016 interview on WTVR-TV, Stoney said, ""I have no plans on raising any taxes. Right now, we have a city hall that’s swollen, we have over 4,000 employees in City Hall. I think you’ve got to look at some cuts over there. You’ve got to look at making a tighter ship. But also, I think you’ve got to find ways to be a little more creative about our dollars."" During a Sept. 25, 2016 Q&A with the Times-Dispatch, Stoney said the city would have to improve its efficiency in collecting existing taxes ""before we start raising taxes, before we have that discussion…"" We came across one instance, however, when Stoney abandoned his usual caution and pledged not to raise taxes. It came during the ""lightning round"" of an Oct. 17, 2016 debate,  when Stoney and his mayoral rivals were asked to answer questions in five words or less. ""Would you raise taxes?"" the moderator asked. Stoney replied with one word: ""No."" After taking office on the last day of 2016, Stoney seemed increasingly open to tax increases, but not necessarily on real estate. The Times-Dispatch reported on March 1, 2017 that his political action committee was polling Richmond residents on whether they would support tax hikes. During a Dec. 24, 2017 Q&A with the Times-Dispatch, he said ""everything is on the table,"" for raising school funds, including a tax-increase plan that ""is well thought out."" While proposing the meals tax hike on Jan. 22, 2018, Stoney said, ""For the last year, I’ve said that when it comes to meeting the critical needs of school facilities, the only option that’s off the table is doing nothing."" But on Oct. 17, 2018, Stoney distanced himself from a call by Richmond School Superintendent Jason Kamras for a 10-cent increase in the real estate tax rate. According to the Times Dispatch, Jim Nolan - Stoney’s spokesman - said Kamras didn’t confer with the mayor before making the call and that Stoney ""has no current plans to propose a real estate tax increase."" Our ruling Has Stoney flip-flopped on not raising taxes? Stoney had a nuanced answer almost every time he was asked about increases when he ran for mayor and during his first year in office. While stressing Richmond needed more money for its schools, he said raising taxes - other than for cigarettes - was a last resort, to be taken only if government efficiency efforts came up short. For the most part, Stoney remained consistent. He took several steps to streamline services and improve revenue collections before proposing increases in the meals tax last year and the real estate tax this year. We found one time, however, when Stoney strayed for his script. During the ""lightning round"" of a mayoral debate three weeks before the 2016 election, candidates were asked to state in five words or less whether they would raise taxes. Stoney said ""No."" Stoney’s answer doesn’t rise to the ""Read my lips"" vow not to raise taxes made by former President George H.W. Bush in 1988 - only to be broken. To our knowledge, Stoney never repeated the no-new-tax pledge. And his promise came in response to a question that was asked in a way that didn’t allow his usual conditional response.   But Stoney did say ""No,"" in contrast to his many other statements keeping tax increases as a possibility. So, overall, we rate this a Half Flip.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0AEC40>],/factchecks/2019/mar/19/levar-stoney/has-mayor-levar-stoney-flip-flopped-raising-taxes/

No, Florida drivers who have a phone 'in hand' will not be ticketed $250 or sent to driving school
","Driving and talking on a cell phone (or simply holding a phone) is not illegal in Florida – yet. But a social media post being shared on Facebook claims the opposite, saying that a ""new law"" in the Sunshine State penalizes drivers caught with their phone in hand. The punishment:  a $250 ticket and a trip to driving school. The post, in full: ""They passed a new law in Florida that if the cops see you with your phone in hand while driving you will get a $250 ticket and you will be sent to driving school. This law passed Monday. Let everyone know. Be careful."" A URL at the bottom of the post appears to belong to the Florida DMV website but is a dead link and doesn’t lead to a working webpage. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is an old rumor that first surfaced in March 2018 when the Florida legislature was considering a bill that included stricter cell phone restrictions for drivers, but no such measure was ever signed into law. Moreover, the legislation was directed specifically at texting while driving or ""nonvocal"" communication on a device, and not talking on the phone or simply having a phone in your hand, as the post says. According to the actual DMV Florida website, cell phones are said to be a distraction and drivers are urged to refrain from talking on their phones while operating a vehicle, but doing so is still not illegal. ""Driving and talking on a cell phone is perfectly legal in Florida,"" the website says. ""But should you do it - NO? We've all seen drivers with cell phones glued to their ears changing lanes too close to you, rolling through stop signs, or just not driving well at all. One of the biggest causes of accidents in Florida is distracted drivers."" According to a study by the National Institutes of Health, talking on a cell phone impairs reaction time by 40 percent. Texting while driving, however, is illegal in Florida as a secondary offense. The bill we mentioned that failed in the Florida Senate, HB 33, would have made it a primary offense. A secondary violation means drivers cannot be pulled over for texting alone, but can be written tickets for texting if they are stopped for another offense, such as speeding or reckless driving. The bill doesn’t mention anything about driving school nor does it list how much the citation would cost drivers. Regardless, the piece of legislation was not signed into law and did not prohibit drivers from simply having a ""phone in hand."" This claim is False. Update, March 19, 2019: This story has updated to clarify that the National Institutes of Health found that using a cell phone impairs driver reaction time.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CC8300>],/factchecks/2019/mar/18/facebook-posts/no-florida-drivers-who-have-phone-hand-will-not-be/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Tulsi Gabbard']","
Yes, Americans spend a ton on health care, and the outcomes aren't so good
","Asked at a CNN town hall whether she supports Medicare for All, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said she does. Explaining why, the U.S. House member from Hawaii made this claim: ""We pay far more for health care than any other country in the world, yet we have far worse outcomes than any other country in the world."" The spending part of Gabbard’s claim doesn’t seem to be in dispute. In 2017, according to a December 2018 article by two health care experts from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, health care spending in the United States was $10,227 per person. That’s about twice as much, on average, as 11 other large, wealthy countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Measured another way, in 2016 the United States spent nearly twice as much on medical care as the average of the other 10 highest-income countries. More specifically, the United States spent 17.8 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, versus an average of 11.5 percent for the other countries. That’s according to a study by Harvard researchers published in 2018 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. As for why, the main reason is high health care prices  — including for drugs, doctor and nurse salaries, hospital administration costs and many medical services; it is not that Americans use more health care, according to a January 2019 study in the journal Health Affairs. The study was led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health researcher. Kaiser has reached a similar conclusion about prices being more important than ""utilization."" We also found evidence that the United States ranks poorly in health care outcomes. A 2017 report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, which does health care research, ranked the United States last among 11 high-income countries in health care outcomes — that is, outcomes attributable to the performance of health care delivery systems. (Australia ranked first, Sweden second.) Among the nine measures of outcomes, the U.S. rated poorly in infant mortality, life expectancy at age 60 and deaths under age 75 from specific causes ""that are considered preventable in the presence of timely and effective health care."" The 2018 Harvard study we mentioned, which is what Gabbard’s House office cited to back up her statement, found that among the 11 highest-income countries, the United States fared poorly on some measures, including having the lowest life expectancy (78.8 years), the worst maternal mortality rate (26.4 deaths per 100,000 live births) and the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese (70.1 percent). The Kaiser Family Foundation and Peterson Center on Healthcare also reported that the United States has a higher mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 people) and a higher ""disease burden"" (which refers to length and quality of life) than its peer countries. Experts did say there are some points to understand when it comes to the outcomes. Kaiser’s Cynthia Cox told us that the U.S. does have better health outcomes than some countries that are poorer and not typically compared to the U.S. She also said other factors play a significant role in both spending and outcomes. Kaiser research has found, she said, that the U.S. has more barriers to overcome in terms of ""social determinants of health that play a significant role in both spending and outcomes."" The high obesity rate in the U.S., for example, is ""not completely within the control of health providers and can make treating patients more expensive and higher risk,"" she said. Health economist Irene Papanicolas, lead author of the Harvard study, made similar points. Many outcomes are partly the product of factors outside the health care system, such as behaviors and genetics, she told us. Moreover, the United States scores high on many health service outcomes, such as relatively low hospital mortality rates for things like heart attack and stroke. Timothy Norbeck, chief executive officer of the Physicians Foundation, which describes itself as a nonprofit that empowers physicians, told us that while the United States does spend more than other countries, he has argued that there are a number of reasons for that. Writing in Forbes, he said ""it is far easier to manage health outcomes in smaller and more homogeneous countries,"" and that the United States having a higher poverty rate than the other developed countries also drives up health care costs. Gabbard says: ""We pay far more for health care than any other country in the world, yet we have far worse outcomes than any other country in the world."" The United States spends more on health care — per capita or as a percentage of gross national product — than similarly large and wealthy countries. And compared to other developed nations, the performance of the U.S. health care system ranked last in one study. In another study it ranked poorly on a number of health care outcomes. Experts said factors other than health care systems, such as poverty and personal behavior, can affect health outcomes. We rate Gabbard’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA8A40>],/factchecks/2019/mar/18/tulsi-gabbard/yes-americans-spend-ton-health-care-worst-outcomes/
"['Housing', 'Illinois', 'Toni Preckwinkle']","
Preckwinkle undersells affordable housing program’s track record
","In her campaign to become Chicago’s next mayor, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle stresses her experience pushing for more affordable housing when she served on the City Council years ago. At a recent debate with her rival, Lori Lightfoot, before the Chicago Tribune’s editorial board, both candidates were asked about the growing pressures of gentrification and the shrinking supply of affordable housing in Chicago. In explaining how she would attack the problem, Preckwinkle criticized a city-run program aimed in part at increasing the supply of affordable housing in better-off neighborhoods that have high rents. The program requires developers of new residential projects to either set aside a share of units at below-market rates or pay into a special fund to support less pricey housing elsewhere. ""The Affordable Requirements Ordinance — ARO — is really challenged because, my understanding is, in the last 12 years, despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created. Four hundred in 12 years,"" Preckwinkle said. ""Clearly, 400 family units in 12 years does not constitute success."" The ARO has faced no shortage of criticism from affordable housing advocates who question whether it’s too full of loopholes to be effective. That said, the 400-unit figure tossed out by Preckwinkle sounded exceedingly low. So we decided to check her math. The ARO has gone through several iterations over the years, but today it applies to developers of residential buildings with 10 or more units who want to build downtown or ask the city for zoning changes, land or financial support. Those developers must offer 10 percent of their project's total number of units at below-market rates or, in the alternative, offer fewer than 10 percent but then pay a per-unit fee to compensate for the shortfall. Daniel Hertz, a housing expert with the Chicago-based Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, said policies like the ARO can help address racial and economic segregation, but face inherent limitations in producing a large volume of affordable units. ""It’s a policy that has the particular advantage of putting affordable units potentially in higher income neighborhoods,"" Hertz said. ""But it’s not ever going to deliver on the scale of the (housing shortage) problem in Chicago or elsewhere."" That said, Preckwinkle’s claim significantly lowballs the modest number of units in new projects that the ARO has required developers to offer at lower rates. The city’s Department of Planning and Development reports that from 2008 through September 2018, developers agreed to include nearly 800 affordable units in projects that have been built or are still underway. When we asked the Preckwinkle campaign for the source of her number, a spokesman sent us a letter to the editor in the Chicago Sun-Times from the director of a local housing group who cited an online list of affordable housing developments the city offers as a tool for prospective renters. But Justin Root, the department’s project coordinator for inclusionary housing, told us that list is incomplete. ""It gives you a good idea of what’s available but it’s not necessarily in real time and it’s not necessarily the entire amount of projects that have come online and have had or continue to have units available,"" he said. Preckwinkle’s critique of the ARO’s performance misses the mark in another way as well. Department records show its affordable housing fund has received more than $158 million since the program’s inception in 2003, with much of it coming since 2007. Preckwinkle complained that large sum had created just a handful of units. What she didn’t explain is that those funds are dispersed to promote affordable housing in a variety of ways beyond what is spent by private developers themselves to offer a share of the units they build at affordable rates. For instance, ARO funds just last year were used to underwrite rental subsidies at more than 1,400 units for residents making less than 30 percent of the area median income, department records show. Experts said that while those funds aren’t being spent in ways that diversify housing in pricier parts of town, the other programs they do support are critical to helping the city’s low-income residents access affordable housing. ""This program is not the main way that the city creates affordable housing,"" said Rachel Johnston of the Chicago Rehab Network. Preckwinkle said that ""despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created"" in the last 12 years through Chicago’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance. City records show that developers have either promised or produced nearly 800 units under the ARO to date. That doesn’t go very far toward achieving the program’s aim to create more affordable housing in pricier areas of the city or closing the city’s affordable housing gap, so there’s some truth to Preckwinkle’s broader argument. But her figure of 400 units is far from credible. And her claim also ignores how the millions of dollars in fees collected from developers who opt out of building affordable units under the ordinance support rent subsidies and other affordable housing programs throughout the city. We rate it Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Hartzler's claim about MU's NCAA sanctions requires context
","The NCAA issues sanctions issued against MU athletics  on Jan. 31 and sent social media into hysteria. Missouri sports fans, MU students and Missouri politicians all had something to say.  U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri, was one of the politicians who spoke out about the NCAA's sanctions. While there must be consequences for individuals who go outside the rules, the NCAA extreme sanctions against Mizzou are unfair in light of Mizzou’s cooperation in addressing the issue,"" she wrote on Facebook and shared later on Twitter. ""It’s wrong to penalize today’s athletes for the actions of others and wrong to sanction a university which has been cleared of involvement. I am hopeful the sanctions will be reversed."" We decided to take a closer look at the idea that it’s ""wrong to sanction a university which has been cleared of involvement."" Was MU really cleared of all involvement? MU was handed a series of sanctions affecting the football, softball and baseball teams after former tutor Yolanda Kumar was found to have completed coursework for 12 student-athletes, violating the NCAA's ethical conduct, academic misconduct and academic extra benefits rules. We reached out to Hartzler's office about the statement, and her communications director, Anna Swick, responded on Hartzler's behalf. ""The NCAA report never indicates that MU administrators were involved or that this was a systemic problem,"" Swick said. Swick said Hartzler’s tweet was in reference to statements made in the NCAA’s initial report, which Swick said implied that MU administrators were cleared of direct involvement. ""The NCAA report points to MU’s 'prompt acknowledgement of the violation' by the MU administration once it was discovered,"" Swick said. The NCAA also made note of MU’s ""exemplary cooperation,"" she said. Two attorneys that have worked on NCAA cases said the fact that MU was hit with sanctions implies the university wasn’t without fault. ""They haven’t really done anything in terms of intentional conduct,"" said Justin Sievert, founding partner of Sievert Werly and head of the firm’s college sports law practice. ""But has Missouri been cleared of all involvement? Not in other senses, no. he violations themselves show that they had involvement even if it wasn’t intentional conduct."" Christian Dennie, an attorney who works with clients in the sports industry, said institutions can be sanctioned under the NCAA structure because they are responsible for their own employees.  Dennie points out that university policy means that Kumar would have been educated on the do’s and don’ts of her position as tutor and chose independently to violate them and NCAA policies. That responsibility could change if MU considers Kumar a ""rogue employee,"" said Roger Cossack, a former legal analyst for ESPN. But he said that might not make a difference if the NCAA maintains that MU should have known about the misconduct. ""Yes, Missouri certainly wasn’t asking her to do this, but they had continued responsibility to monitor her actions,"" he said. ""Once you find that she’s a rogue employee, or someone who was not following orders, that just doesn’t mean the university had no responsibility; they have an obligation to be the checks and balances on these things, which is why they have these sanctions."" Hartzler said MU was cleared of involvement in the NCAA case. The NCAA did not specifically say MU administrators were involved in the case, as Swick noted. However, experts pointed out that due to the sanctions MU faces, the university was still not given the ultimate all-clear as Hartzler said in her original statement. The NCAA still believed MU held the responsibility to monitor its staff, resulting in the sanctions. Because of the missing context, we rate Hartzler’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979DD900>],/factchecks/2019/mar/16/vicky-hartzler/hartzlers-claim-about-mus-ncaa-sanctions-requires-/
"['Elections', 'Vermont', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Did Sanders get more primary votes from young minorities than Clinton and Trump?
","During his first campaign stop in New Hampshire, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke for just under a hour, telling supporters in the crowded conference center that with their help, he is ready to finish what he started in 2016 and take the White House in 2020. The Sanders campaign has said this time around it needs to get more support in Southern states, and generally to reach more minority voters. But Sanders said last week that wasn’t true for all ages, during a visit to the state that gave him his first primary victory in 2016. ""That victory right here in New Hampshire led us to win victories in 21 other states around the country, 13 million votes, over 1,700 delegates at the Democratic convention and to me, mostly importantly, more votes from young people — black, white, Latino, Asian American and Native American — than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined,"" Sanders said. Sanders made a similar claim during a CNN town hall in late February when he said, ""We ended up winning among younger people. More votes from young African Americans, Latinos, Asian American, Native Americans than Clinton and Trump combined."" This seems to complicate a prevailing narrative that Sanders failed to connect with minority voters during the 2016 election. And it would mean a growing group of voters went for him in a big way. We decided to check if his claim holds water. VTDigger analyzed 2016 primary data and reached out to polling experts across the country. We found while Sanders did receive more votes from the under-30 set than Clinton and Trump combined, it’s impossible to know -- for us and for Sanders -- whether more minority youth voted for him than the other two candidates. While his quote in New Hampshire could be read as saying that young people of various ethnicities together voted for him in larger numbers than Trump and Clinton combined, it’s clear from the CNN quote that the claim also applies to each ethnicity on its own. Arianna Jones, a Sanders campaign spokesperson, told us the claim was based on an exit polling report from the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) and a survey by the University of Chicago’s Black Youth Project. The data compiled by CIRCLE estimates that in all the presidential primaries and caucuses, Sanders received more than 2 million total youth votes -- 400,000 more than the estimated combined 1.6 million votes for Clinton and Trump. However, these numbers are not broken down by race or ethnicity. In the University of Chicago study, which asked more than 1,750 people between the ages of 18 and 30 which of the three candidates they support, 60 percent of young African-Americans, 69 percent of young Asian-Americans, 68 percent of the young Latino vote, and 59 percent of young whites said they support Sanders. The survey, conducted in June 2016, also states that among young African-Americans who said they voted in the primaries, 54 percent reported voting for Sanders, but the study does not provide additional information explaining how many said they voted for Clinton or Trump. ""Our data indicate that in contrast to the overwhelming support Hillary Clinton received from older African American voters, the majority of African American young adult voters supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party primary,"" the study says. We reached out to the University of Chicago and a spokesperson told us the researchers did not validate that these young people actually voted in a primary. ""They suggest viewing this question as one of measuring support more than actual votes,"" the spokesperson said. We asked Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of CIRCLE at Tufts University, about the Sanders claim. She said CIRCLE also has no way of knowing whether or not his statement is true or false. ""The underlying data used to calculate the cumulative youth vote for the primaries in 2016 — exit poll and vote total — does not allow us to break out the youth vote estimates by race,"" Kawashima-Ginsberg said. ""So we have no way of confirming or rejecting the assertion made by Sen. Sanders."" Exit polls shed some light on the situation, particularly the youth black vote. An analysis of exit polls in 25 primary states conducted by NBC News shows that Sanders received a combined 52 percent of the votes of African-Americans under 30, compared with 47 percent for Clinton. Based on CNN exit polls from 27 states, 52 percent of black women under 30 voted for Sanders while 47 percent voted for Clinton. Among black men of the same age, 50 percent voted for Sanders and 48 percent for Clinton. The CNN data show 31 percent of Latino voters under 30 voted for Clinton, while 69 percent voted for Sanders. We could not find exit poll data breaking down Trump’s youth vote by race or ethnicity. CIRCLE reported that based on exit polls from GOP primaries in 21 states, Trump only won the youth vote in 11. CIRCLE estimates that Trump received over 800,000 of the total 2.3 million votes cast by young people in those Republican contests. So while there’s no data conclusively proving Sanders right, we also didn’t find anything proving him definitely wrong. But numbers on voter demographics from Super Tuesday gave us pause. The combined exit polls from Democratic primaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia found that 61 percent of young black voters cast a ballot for Clinton while 36 percent voted for Sanders. In those states, 60 percent of young Latino voters supported Sanders and 39 percent Clinton. Sanders did get a big boost on Super Tuesday with young white people: 62 percent of that demographic voted for him and 37 percent voted for Clinton. The Super Tuesday losses among young black voters could have been outweighed by large blocks of those voters elsewhere. In New York, for example, 81 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted for Sanders. So did Sanders specifically win the youth black vote? Gary Langer, the exit poll expert for ABC News, told us he does not have the data necessary to make a definitive ruling on whether or not more young black people voted for Sanders than for Clinton and Trump. However, on whether Sanders won more nonwhite young voters than both the other candidates, he said: ""Eyeballing it only, it looks possible."" Sanders said that he got ""more votes from young people — black, white, Latino, Asian-American and Native American — than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined."" It is true that Sanders received more votes from 18- to 30-year-old voters than Clinton and Trump combined, but the claim that more young people from minority groups voted for him is unclear based on current data. The campaign’s reliance on a survey showing young minorities’ support for the Vermont senator is not the same as voting data for those population segments. We rate this claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809672A2C0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/16/bernie-sanders/did-sanders-get-more-primary-votes-young-minoritie/

Airhorn-blasting congressman mostly right about seismic airgun intensity
","If a picture is worth a thousand words, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., may have proved that a one-second blast of sound is worth 2,000. At a March 7 U.S. House hearing about threats to whales posed by energy exploration, Cunningham pulled out an airhorn and, with permission, pulled the trigger. Cunningham's show-and-tell went viral. ""Was that disruptive?"" Cunningham asked Chris Oliver from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In November, the agency gave five companies permission to use high-powered acoustic seismic survey tools to scout for oil and gas pockets off the Atlantic coast from Delaware to Florida. Cunningham wanted to illustrate what high-powered means. ""It was irritating, but I didn't find it particularly disruptive,"" Oliver replied. Cunningham then pressed Oliver to compare the noise of the airhorn to the seismic airgun arrays used by the survey ships. Cunningham: ""How much louder do you think seismic airgun blasting sounds then this airhorn you just heard?"" Oliver: ""I honestly don't know."" Cunningham: ""Take a guess. Ten times?"" Oliver: ""At a distance of how far?"" Cunningham: ""Well, say say you're within a reasonable distance, say within a quarter-mile. Is it 10 times? 25 times?"" Oliver: ""I honestly don't know."" Cunningham: ""I mean, can you take a guess."" Oliver: ""No."" Cunningham: ""A hundred times? You think it's a thousand times times louder ? Oliver: ""I doubt it."" Cunningham: ""You doubt it. What if I were tell you it's 16,000 times louder than what you just heard here?"" Oliver wasn’t the only person surprised to hear that a seismic airgun array is 16,000 times louder than an airhorn. We decided to see if the number holds up. • In an apples-to-apples comparison of decibel levels, the seismic arrays emit sound waves that range from 19,000 to 10 million times more intense than Cunningham’s airhorn. • Short of the point where the force of sound waves blows out your eardrums or causes other physical harm, loudness is more a matter of human perception, rather than a measurable quantity that applies across species. • Comparing decibels, instead of loudness, is the approach marine biologists use. Oil and gas companies can get an idea of where to drill in the ocean by using ships that send sound waves toward the ocean floor and pick up the echoes to see what’s underneath. This government diagram shows the basic process:  Source: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management The airguns release a burst of high-pressure air into the water. The rippling bubble creates the sound waves. Notice that some of the sound waves head straight down and some head off at an angle. The way the arrays work, the more a sound wave deviates from straight down, the lower the decibel level. We factored that in when we ran the numbers below. Just before Donald Trump took office, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cancelled permit applications for seismic surveys in the mid and south Atlantic coastal waters. The agency wrote the value of the surveys ""does not outweigh the potential risks of those surveys’ acoustic pulse impacts on marine life."" When Donald Trump became president, the government reversed course. At the end of November 2018, the permit applications cleared a key hurdle. Many coastal communities oppose drilling for fear of harm to the environment and tourism industry. Seeing seismic surveys as the first step before any wells are sunk, South Carolina and 16 municipalities — Cunningham represents several of them  — have sued the federal government to block both the surveys and offshore rigs. One of the arguments against the surveys is that they threaten marine ecosystems and the animals that live in them. The North Atlantic right whale is particularly vulnerable. Only 411 survive, about a 15 percent decline in eight years. The factors driving their decline are numerous. They include being vulnerable to disease; sustaining wounds from passing ships; and dying as calves after losing the care of their mothers. The sounds from the seismic airguns have been linked to killing the krill the whales feed on and causing breakdowns in the whales’ ability to communicate. Scott Kraus, senior science advisor at the New England Aquarium, who testified at the House hearing, told us that the low frequency sounds used in the surveys are particularly troubling. ""Low frequencies travel far with little attenuation, so seismic noise goes for hundreds of kilometers,"" Kraus said. ""Nearly all baleen whale communication occurs in the lower frequency bands, hence the concerns over disturbance, displacement, and cow/calf separations at great distances."" The government imposes a number of restrictions to minimize the impact on marine life. Scientists such as Kraus say those restrictions are wholly insufficient, given the intensity of the seismic surveys and the way sound travels through the ocean. Cunningham said seismic airgun blasting was 16,000 times louder than his airhorn. For context, an ordinary conversation is about 60 decibels (dB). A garbage disposal working hard is 80 dB. A jet taking off is about 140 dB. Cunningham's airhorn comes in at 120 dB. Cunningham's big number basically checks out, but there are issues. First off, loudness is subjective. Humans process sound one way, and whales, well, ""actually, we do not know about large whale perceptions of loudness,"" said Christopher Clark, a Cornell research professor, who specializes in whale acoustics and testified against the seismic surveys at the hearing. ""As bioacousticians working with animals, in this case whales, we do not talk about loudness, we use sound level in decibels."" Second, Cunninham's staff took the 120 dB blast of the airhorn and the maximum level of 260 dB for a seismic airgun and subtracted to find the difference. The problem is, one was measured on land and the other in the ocean. ""Comparing a sound in air with one in water, although based on a genuine interest in getting this loudness difference idea across to the public, is misdirected,"" Clark said. ""The way sound intensity is measured in air is not the same as the way sound intensity is measured in water."" Rebecca Drago, Cunningham’s spokeswoman, said he wasn’t aiming for technical accuracy. ""He wanted to illustrate to the people there in the room what this really loud sound would feel like,"" Drago said. ""Using decibels isn’t really effective for people to understand."" Fortunately, there's a simple conversion (abut 62 dB) to compare air and water decibel readings. On an apples-to-apples basis, we calculated the decibel level difference between Cunningham’s airhorn and the seismic airgun arrays. We corrected for the air-water factor, and we used three decibel levels for the airgun arrays, based on numbers from the NOAA Fisheries environmental assessment report, discussions with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and an independent analysis of seismic surveys. There are more than three levels, but we selected a range from high to low. The bureau used 230 dB in its environmental impact statement. The table’s lowest decibel level for an array corresponds to the steepest angle away from straight down under the ship. How much difference that actually makes for the whales and other ocean animals is a matter of debate. For this fact-check, it is enough to say that at the low end, an airgun array can be 19,000 times more intense than an airhorn. That is a little bit more than the 16,000-fold difference Cunningham said. Given the way the decibel system works (it’s logarithmic), a 60 dB change is a million times more intense, and a 70 dB change is 10 million times greater. At those levels, Cunningham greatly understated the acoustic difference between his airhorn and seismic airgun arrays. To be sure, sound in water has many nuances and it’s possible that a level less than 225 dB could be recorded. But the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management told us this is ""approximately"" the range they use, and we found no lower figure. Cunningham said that seismic airgun blasting ""is 16,000 times louder"" than an airhorn. We don't know exactly how whales process sounds, so louder is not the right term. But decibel levels can be compared. Given the range of decibel levels from the seismic arrays, Cunningham is pretty much on the money at the low end of the readings. Above that, Cunningham greatly understated the difference. His statement is largely correct, but it needs some additional context. We rate this Mostly True. Correction:  A previous version of this fact-check said that the survey permits had been issued. The fact-check now reflects that the NOAA Fisheries agency approved the incidental taking of marine life, a key step before final approval.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF7F00>],/factchecks/2019/mar/15/joe-cunningham/yes-airguns-used-oil-gas-exploration-are-16000-tim/
"['Georgia', 'Charles Clark']","
Union leader says City Hall hasn't been fair to some Atlanta employees
","
We've all heard stories about employees who didn't get raises, but this claim from a union representative struck us.

Charles Clark, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 1644, said during the heat of debate among city of Atlanta leaders concerning whether to give only police officers raises that some employees had not received raises in eight years.

""We think it is an insult to single out a group, without giving others a raise, when those others have not had raises in eight years,"" Clark said.

Has it been that bad for some city employees?

Well, we checked with the city of Atlanta's Human Resources Department. They keep personnel records of city employees and should know when was the last time they've received raises.

According to their records, all city workers, except sworn police officers and firefighters, received a 2.6 percent cost-of-living increase on July 1, 2007. Those workers then received an additional 1 percent cost-of-living increase on New Year's Day 2008, HR officials said. Sworn police officers and firefighters received a 2 percent cost-of-living increase Jan. 1, 2008, the HR Department reported. Sworn police officers and firefighters received a performance-based salary increase of 3.5 percent in June 2008, a city HR official said.

Gina Pagnotta, a Public Works Department employee who leads a 300-member association of Atlanta employees, agrees that city workers have received raises in the past eight years, although she's fuzzy on the details.

""They did not get a substantial raise. They did get a cost-of-living increase,"" said Pagnotta, president of the Professional Association of City Employees. ""Not having any raises in eight years, that is not correct.""

Employee pay was a big issue at City Hall in recent months when Atlanta's new mayor, Kasim Reed, said he wanted to give police officers -- and only them -- salary increases. One of Reed's biggest campaign promises was to improve public safety. He has vowed to hire more police officers as mayor and make sure they are better paid. Several City Council members initially opposed the pay hikes, saying to exclude other city workers would hurt employee morale. Last month, the council approved Reed's proposal concerning police officers and boosted their salaries by 3.5 percent. The council gave a similar salary increase to firefighters and a $450 bonus to city workers making less than $75,000. Reed said he supported the moves.

Clark said he was initially told the workers had not received any raises in that time period. He said the cost-of-living adjustments are negligible if you consider that health insurance costs for Atlanta workers have risen in each of the past five years.

""If one wanted to get technical about it, one would say [the city is] correct,"" Clark told PolitiFact Georgia. ""But a deeper look would reveal that the cost to employees rose. The money went to offset the increase in insurance, so they did not receive any net gain.""

We followed up with the Human Resources Department to see if there was any merit to Clark's claim.

Atlanta, like most local governments, uses a 12-month budget cycle (fiscal year) that begins July 1 and ends June 30. The city used two health care providers (Kaiser and Blue Cross and Blue Shield) in July 2007, when the cost-of-living adjustments took effect. On July 1, the health care rates rose for all city workers. Atlanta workers with families that used Kaiser paid an additional $904.20 during that 12-month period, a review of city records show. Workers using Blue Cross and Blue Shield paid an additional $1,003.20, the records show. The increases for workers without families were one-third of that total, regardless of which insurance provider they used, the review showed.

The average salary for an Atlanta employee is about $47,000, according to city Human Resources officials.

Since the average city worker makes $47,000 a year, we multiplied that number times the 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment and the additional 1 percent cost-of-living increase they received on Jan. 1, 2008. That worker's annual salary became $48,704, a $1,704 increase. The $1,704 is more than the increase in health care costs for a city worker with a family by at least $700.

OK, but some Atlanta workers make much less. An employee with the salary of $30,000 watched his or her pay rise by about $1,100. That's still about $100 more than the health care increase if the employee had a family.

Health insurance rates rose again in July 2008, 2009 and 2010. Clark is correct that those increases eclipse the cost-of-living increases given to most city workers in July 2007 and January 2008. However, his initial claim was that some city workers ""have not had raises in eight years.""

Clark, who took the job about 3 1/2 months ago, said some city workers told him they hadn't received raises in eight years. In a subsequent interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Clark said the workers may have been comparing the 2.6 percent cost-of-living increase to what he said had been 3.5 percent salary increases in prior years.

""It's a teachable moment,"" Clark told PolitiFact Georgia. ""I stand clarified or corrected.""

PolitiFact Georgia appreciates his candor, but sorry, Charlie, we still find the claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097220F40>],/factchecks/2010/jul/18/charles-clark/union-leader-says-atlanta-hasnt-been-fair-some-emp/

White says Perry accepted more stimulus funds than every governor, except those of California and New York
","
Trying to portray his GOP opponent as more cozy with Washington than he lets on, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White highlighted the state's use of federal money during a speech to his party's state convention in Corpus Christi. 
Texas Gov. ""Rick Perry accepted more stimulus funds than any other governor except the governors of California and New York,"" White said June 25. 
Gee, the nation's three most-populous states took in the most stimulus aid? The only reason that's surprising is Perry made a point of not taking a chunk of available aid in 2009 -- a move in keeping with his anti-Washington posture. We decided White's statement needed a closer look. 
Some background: The $787 billion federal stimulus package, otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, became law in February 2009, with the goals of giving the struggling U.S. economy a lift, as well as creating and saving jobs. State governments have been the primary recipients, although federal money has also gone directly to entities such as schools, hospitals and contractors. 
The Recovery Act specified that governors had 45 days after the passage of the law to certify that their state would ""request and use funds provided by"" the law. On Feb. 18, 2009, Perry sent President Barack Obama the requisite letter of certification, assuring the president that the state would accept the funds and use them ""in the best interest of Texas taxpayers."" 
In his letter, Perry also wrote that he opposed using ""these funds to expand existing government programs"" because the state would be burdened ""with ongoing expenditures long after the funding has dried up."" The day before, Perry told a National Federation of Independent Business meeting in Austin that ""we need the freedom to pick and choose our obligations, so we can say 'no thanks' to items that stick us with the bill in the out years, when Washington goes flying after the next miracle cure,"" according to the governor's prepared remarks. 
In response to our inquiry about White's statement, Katy Bacon, his spokeswoman, pointed us to a section of Recovery.gov, the federal website that tracks stimulus spending, that gives a state-by-state breakdown of the value of contracts, grants, loans and entitlement funds being distributed by federal agencies. The figures, based on the agencies' reports, are updated weekly. 
As of June 30, 2010, the breakdown ranked Texas third behind California and New York in both ""funds available,"" meaning money to be released either immediately or in the future, and ""funds paid out."" 
Right away, we found a wrinkle. Cheryl Arvidson, assistant director of communications for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which maintains the website, said the totals include all stimulus funds flowing into each state, not just dollars that pass through state government. Thus neither Perry nor the state was involved in taking some of that money. 
We didn't find any statistics that gauged only the stimulus dollars flowing through state governments. The closest thing: A report released in April 2009 by the Federal Funds Information for States, a subscription service of the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures that tracks the financial impact of federal actions on states. It estimated how much Recovery Act money each state would receive under about 40 major grant programs. Texas ($16.3 billion) ranked third, behind California ($27.1 billion) and New York ($21.7 billion). 
Another count for Texas comes from the state comptroller's office, which tracks stimulus dollars coming into state agencies and public colleges and universities. As of July 11, 2010, $19.7 billion had been awarded, with $11.7 billion received. The Legislature appropriated $14.4 billion of the total for fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011, according to the comptroller's website. 
The story so far: Despite criticizing some aspects of the stimulus program, Perry has accepted billions of stimulus dollars on the state's behalf. 
In fact, Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, didn't quibble about Perry being among the three governors who have taken the most stimulus money. That's to be expected, she indicated, because the federal government doles out the funds based on ""many formulas"" -- population being ""one of the most predominant factors."" Said Cesinger: ""It's no surprise that Texas ... would be allocated significantly more stimulus dollars than most other states."" California is the most-populous state, with about 35 million people; Texas is second with 24 million; and New York is third, with about 20 million. 
Likewise, Mike Leachman, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said the size of the Texas economy and the needs of its large population played a role in the amount of money that the state received. For example, almost all of the $5.2 billion in stimulus funds awarded to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission is going to Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled. 
Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, said federal Medicaid funding is normally based on a formula that includes state economic factors such as per-capita income; the stimulus program added a component that increases federal aid in conjunction with rising unemployment. 
But Texas hasn't taken all the funding that was offered. Last year, Perry opposed about $550 million for the state's unemployment trust fund, aid that was contingent on Texas making it easier for workers to qualify for unemployment benefits. The governor said businesses would have had to pay higher unemployment taxes after the federal dollars ran out. An effort by some legislators to overrule Perry died in the state House. 
Perry also caused a stir this year when he opted not to apply for additional education stimulus funding in the competitive federal grant program known as Race to the Top. 
Summing up? 
In his convention speech, White said Perry has accepted more stimulus funding than the governors of any other states, except for California and New York. But his campaign failed to back up his claim with specific data on funds that passed through state governments -- perhaps because those breakdowns aren't available. 
On our own, we found information suggesting White's claim holds up -- though nothing entirely conclusive. We rate White's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F63EC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/18/bill-white/white-says-perry-accepted-more-stimulus-funds-ever/
"['Elections', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
Reid only clearly trailing in two-thirds of the polls
","
U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah, the Republican who lost his bid for re-election in May when he finished third at his party's nominating convention, warned last week that tea party ""mischief"" could cost Republicans in hotly contested Senate races this November. 
""The Utah senator said he fears tea party extremism could end up costing the GOP seats that they otherwise would have been able to win,"" the Associated Press reported July 9. 
Namely, Bennett said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., doesn't have to worry about Republican Sharron Angle, who was nominated to challenge Reid with the Tea Party's blessing. ""My sources in Nevada say with Sharron Angle there's no way Harry Reid loses in Nevada,"" he said. 
Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas later fired back, suggesting Bennett's suffering from sour grapes. ""I realize we're hot and heavy leading up to the election, but voters are going to make the right decision,"" Cornyn was quoted saying in an article posted July 13 by Talking Points Memo, an online political news organization. ""There have been 30 published polls in this election cycle and Harry Reid's been trailing in every single one."" 
Is Reid really down and out all over? 
Brian Walsh, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which Cornyn chairs, said there have been ""at least"" 30 polls taken in the ""last 18 months of this election cycle,"" or since January 2009. 
Walsh didn't share the senator's breakdown of polls, so we went surfing. We turned up several online compendia of poll results: Rasmussen Reports, Real Clear Politics, and Talking Points Memo, all looking at who voters would pick in a matchup between Reid and Angle, and Reid and Sue Lowden, who was a promising GOP primary candidate. Rasmussen, Real Clear Politics and Talking Points Memo yielded summaries of 27 polls and we scrounged up three more polls from the Talking Points Memo ""PollTracker."" 
For each poll, we checked to make sure that Reid was tested for re-election and that there was a clear-cut indication of who was ahead — Reid or an opponent. 
All told, we found, there have been polls testing Reid's chances against various possible challengers since at least August 2009. That's when the Mason-Dixon poll showed Lowden leading Reid by 5 points, though the margin of error was also 5 points. 
Of the 30 polls we reviewed — including five Democratic polls and one Republican poll — a Republican led Reid in all but two of them, both Democratic. We sought more information on the two exceptions, and this is what we found: In May, a poll by Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates reported that Reid had a seven point lead on Lowden; Angle wasn't included in the poll. Jonathan Brown, a senior researcher for the pollster, told us the result was unique because Lowden had just made some ""extremely ill-advised comments"" about her idea to have Americans barter with their doctors for health care. In June, Research 2000, working with the liberal-leaning Daily Kos, reported Reid had a six-point lead on Angle and a four-point lead on Lowden. (That month, Daily Kos severed ties with Research 2000, and has since sued the pollster for faulty polling.) 
Among the remaining 28 polls, 21 showed Republicans clearly leading Reid. Seven showed a GOP candidate ahead, but not by enough to exceed the poll's margin of error — meaning their race would have been too close to call at that time. In one of them, Reid led when voters were asked to choose between Reid and Lowden, but when asked to choose between Reid and Angle, Angle led. In another, Reid was leading Angle, but behind Lowden. 
On average, Talking Points Memo found Angle leading Reid an average of 45.9 percent to 41.7 percent from December 2009 to July 2010, and Lowden leading Reid by an average of 45.6 percent to 39.6 percent from August 2009 to June 2010. Looking solely at data from April to June, Real Clear Politics found the since-defeated Lowden 2.7 points ahead of Reid. From May to July it found Angle leading Reid by 1 percentage point, on average. 
The most recent Rasmussen survey of 750 likely Nevada voters taken July 12 showed Angle leading Reid by 3 points at 46 percent, with a 4 point margin of error. ""This is Reid's best showing all year and follows a visit by President Obama to the state to help his campaign,"" Rasmussen said. ""Angle's support continues to edge down following the bounce she got a month ago following her GOP primary win."" 
As we were wrapping up this item, Talking Points Memo posted a July 1 poll by the Democratic Patriot Majority PAC that showed Reid with a four-point lead over Angle, without revealing the poll's margin of error, and a July 14 Mason-Dixon poll that showed Reid with a seven point lead on Angle. We didn't include these polls in our count because they weren't available when Cornyn made his claim. 
In its July report, Rasmussen said Reid is ""creeping forward and now is nearly tied"" with Angle, and rated the Nevada Senate race as a ""toss-up."" 
Though the latest polling hints that Reid's numbers may be picking up, he clearly trailed Republican opponents in two-thirds of the 30 polls we reviewed; in those seven polls showing a closer race, Reid was behind in five. Had Cornyn said that Reid was behind in nearly every poll, we wouldn't quibble. But in two polls, Reid was the clear leader — and that means he didn't trail ""in every single one."" 
We rate Cornyn's statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A76D40>],/factchecks/2010/jul/17/john-cornyn/reid-only-clearly-trailing-two-thirds-polls/

Rick Scott group goes after 'Air McCollum' in new TV ad
","
Back a year ago when we read the stories about Attorney General Bill McCollum's use of state airplanes, we kind of figured it would pop up sometime during the campaign for governor.

Enter rich-guy Rick Scott and his 527 group ""Let's Get to Work.""

Scott, who not only is challenging McCollum for the Republican nomination but leading in polls, began airing two TV ads recently through Let's Get To Work slamming McCollum's use of state airplanes.

The first ad, called ""Politicians are like diapers -- They should be changed regularly,"" says McCollum spent $280,000 in taxpayer money on air travel on state planes, including trips for personal travel.

The second ad, which was released July 14, 2010, goes deeper into McCollum's use of the state airplane. Called ""Frequent Flyer,"" it makes three basic claims:

           1. That McCollum spent $280,000 using the state airplane, including for personal travel;

           2. That ""he diverted a state plane to his home 53 times;""

           3. And that a state auditor called those diversions likely a misuse of state resources.

The ad ends with the famous ding that sometimes precedes an announcement on an airplane, and the line, ""You are now free to remove career politicians.""

In this fact-check, we'll discuss all three of the plane claims. But we'll specifically be checking a combination of claims No. 2 and No. 3 -- that McCollum diverted his plane to the airports closest to his home (Sanford and Orlando) 53 times, and that an auditor labeled those diversions likely a misuse of state resources.

Using state planes

The use of state planes by McCollum and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink became an issue in June 2009 after an investigation by the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald found dozens of flights by the two Cabinet members that appeared to be, at least partially, for something other than official state business.

State law requires Cabinet members to maintain a legal residence in Tallahassee, and McCollum and Sink have second homes in the capital. But the law prohibits them from using a state plane to commute to get to their state jobs.

The Times/Herald reported that on several occasions, McCollum dispatched an empty plane from Tallahassee to his home near Sanford to take him to events around the state. Often the plane would return him to Central Florida and fly back to Tallahassee with no passengers.

Between January 2007, when he took office, and June 22, 2009, McCollum spent $280,189 on state air travel. Total air travel by Sink, agriculture commissioner Charles Bronson and Gov. Charlie Crist was even higher, the newspapers found. 
The Times/Herald articles match the first claim in the Scott-group ad -- that McCollum spent $280,000 using the state airplane. 
Now, onto the more serious allegations that McCollum diverted the plane to the airport nearest his Central Florida home, a practice an auditor called a misuse of state resources.

Diversions/audit findings

The record is clear: state airplanes flew 53 times to Sanford or Orlando for McCollum between January 2007 and July 2009, according to the state agency that oversees use of the plane, the Department of Management Services.

A few examples:

• Sept. 10, 2007, McCollum had a plane pick him up in Sanford. The plane then traveled to Naples before returning to Tallahassee. The cost of the Sanford diversion: $390;

• May 29, 2008, McCollum traveled from Tallahassee to Vero Beach. On the return trip, McCollum was dropped off in Orlando and the plane returned empty to Tallahassee. The cost of the Orlando diversion: $1,072;

• July 21, 2008, Two of McCollum's staffers traveled from Tallahassee to Sanford to pick him up. They then went to Fort Myers and St. Petersburg, before all three returned to Tallahassee. The cost of the Sanford diversion: $922. 
A Department of Management Services auditor, Sandra Lipner, wrote in a draft report on March 4, 2009, that those flights and the flights taken by the other officials appeared to be against state rules.

''The use of the state aircraft to transport the Governor, Attorney General, CFO and Commissioner of Agriculture between the seat of government and a residence located outside of Tallahassee would appear to be a misuse of state resources,'' Lipner wrote in the draft report.

So, to the ad's claim, 53 flights by McCollum to home ... check. An auditor calling it a likely misuse of state resources ... check.

If only the story ended there.

What Scott left out

The allegations prompted ethics complaints against McCollum and Sink. At issue was whether they misused state resources for personal gain.

The Florida Commission on Ethics hired Craig B. Willis, a former assistant attorney general, as a special advocate to investigate the claims.

On Dec. 4, 2009, Willis presented his findings.

On McCollum's travels, Willis found that ""in all instances where McCollum flew on state aircraft from Tallahassee to Sanford or Orlando, his calendar reflects a clear public purpose associated with the flight.""

However, Willis noted, that there were nine instances where flights were routed in a manner that did not have an apparent public purpose. For those flights, public business was conducted at another location prior to or after the stop in Sanford or Orlando.

""There was no occasion found by ethics investigators where McCollum traveled only to his home on state aircraft and the plane flew back to Tallahassee empty or vice versa,"" the commission said in a subsequent press release. Put another way, McCollum didn't use the plane solely for getting home. It was always part of some other work-related trip.

The commission unanimously dismissed the ethics complaint against McCollum -- it dismissed the complaints against Sink too.

The postscript here is critical for two reasons. First, Willis determined that McCollum's diversions had a public purpose. And second, he argued -- and the ethics commission agreed -- that they did not violate state laws.

That's omitted in the Let's Get to Work ad. So is the fact that the auditor's allegation that McCollum and the others appeared to misuse state resources was not included in the final report. It was only in a draft.

Our ruling

It's interesting to note that since the first Times/Herald story ran in summer 2009, McCollum has drastically reduced his use of the state plane. Between July and October 2008, before the stories ran, McCollum used the state plane 25 times. In the same four months in 2009, he used the plane only twice.

So far in 2010, according to the Department of Management Services, McCollum has used the plane on only four days, all for travel related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. One of the trips was with Crist.

The ad by the Scott-backed group Let's Get to Work claims that McCollum diverted his plane to the airports closest to his home (Sanford and Orlando) 53 times and that an auditor labeled those diversions likely a misuse of state resources. The ad is technically accurate on both marks, but leaves out critical information about the outcome of the investigation.

The 53 trips to Central Florida were found to have a public purpose by the Florida Commission on Ethics, and an ethics complaint against McCollum was dismissed. The auditor who labeled those trips a likely misuse of state resources did not include those findings in her final report.

Because of those omissions, we rate the Let's Get to Work ad Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A42F00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/16/lets-get-work/rick-scott-group-goes-after-air-mccollum-new-tv-ad/

John McCain campaign ad labels J.D. Hayworth an ""avid earmarker""
","
Sen. John McCain has long been known as a flag-carrier for earmark reform. And his hard line against pork projects has often put him at odds with fellow Arizona lawmakers trying to make sure that Arizona got its fair share.

But McCain's principled stance also makes for rich campaign ad material.

In a McCain attack ad on J.D. Hayworth, his Republican opponent in the Arizona primary, an announcer says that while McCain ""wages a determined battle against pork barrel spending,"" J.D. Hayworth as a U.S. Congressman from Arizona from 1995 to 2007 was ""described as an 'avid earmarker,' and supported thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars before we voted him out of office.""

The ad then runs a list of earmarks contained in bills that Hayworth voted for, and that McCain voted against.

We picked two of them to put this issue into some context:

* $220,000 to renovate Maine blueberry farm

* $5.8 million for Vermont snowmobile trail

The first earmark was part of a $375 billion Omnibus appropriations bill passed by Congress in 2004. According to a conference report attached to the bill, it did indeed include, ""$220,000 for the University of Maine (Jonesboro and Orono), Blueberry Hill Farm to renovate the blueberry research facility."" The shorthand in the McCain ad is perhaps one part hyperbole -- calling it money for a blueberry farm rather than money for a university-run blueberry research facility. But it's close enough.

The bill passed the House 242-176; and Hayworth voted for it. The bill passed the Senate comfortably as well, 65-28. McCain voted against it and was very clear that it was because of the hundreds of earmarks it contained.

""It appears that the big spenders in this body have all but stolen the credit card numbers of every hard-working taxpayer in America and have gone on a limitless spending spree for parochial pork-barrel projects, leaving Americans to pay and pay,"" McCain said from the floor of the Senate at the time.

The second project, for the snowmobile trail, was tucked into a $286 billion highway and mass transit bill that passed in 2006. In addition to paying for the interstate highway system and other federal highway programs, the bill included more than 6,000 earmarks (including the now infamous ""Bridge to Nowhere"" in Alaska) worth a total of about $24 billion. According to a committee report attached to the bill, it included $5.8 million for ""construction of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail for the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers.""

The bill passed overwhelmingly: 412 to 8 in the House (Hayworth voted for it); and 91 to 4 in the Senate.

McCain, who voted against it, called the bill a ""monstrosity"" and added, ""It would seem that this Congress can weather any storm thrown at it, as long as we have our pork lifesaver to cling to.""

So there's no question Hayworth voted for bills that included the two earmarks from McCain's campaign ad. But is it fair to call Hayworth an ""avid earmarker"" (a moniker given to Hayworth in a Feb. 21, 2010, opinion piece from the Arizona Republic's Robert Robb) and to say that he supported those particular projects?

Hayworth addressed the ad's claims via a video response on his campaign website.

Hayworth said the McCain campaign is ""playing a cynical Washington game.""

""They took an appropriations bill in a huge area, let's say for example in an area like transportation, and they highlighted controversial provisions in that appropriations bill,"" Hayworth said. ""Now understand, when you serve in the U.S. Congress or the Senate, you don't have the luxury of saying, 'Well, I like this particular provision but not the other one.' In other words, you vote for that transportation bill either up or down.""

Hayworth is right that those particular earmarks -- for the blueberry farm and snowmobile trail -- never came up for an up or down vote on their own merits. They were included in massive appropriations bills and represented a minuscule fraction of the overall bills.

While it's impossible to say whether Hayworth supported the particular earmarks cited in the McCain ad, it is fair to say he was okay with the process. A July 29, 2005, press release issued by his congressional office boasts that ""Rep. Hayworth was able to earmark millions of dollars in the (transportation) bill for specific projects in his district, as requested by local elected officials and state transportation officials.""

A March 31, 2004, story in the Arizona Republic detailed $52.5 million worth of earmarks for Arizona folded into a $275 billion transportation bill. And Hayworth defended them.

""Call it earmarks, call it authorized projects, call it pork or whatever,"" Hayworth told the Arizona Republic. ""The fact is, these projects reflect the priorities of local and state officials to help our transportation infrastructure keep pace with the extraordinary growth we are experiencing in the East Valley.""

Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington advocacy group that tracks earmarks, said voting for the appropriations bills was an endorsement of the process, and therefore all the earmarks in them.

""At the end of the day, if you have to hold your nose and vote for a bill, then you have to deal with the fallout,"" Ellis said.

""If everybody just goes along to get along, the status quo remains,"" Ellis said. ""If enough people stand up and fight, that's how you effect change.""

We think it is misleading to suggest that Hayworth specifically supported the blueberry farm and snowmobile trail projects in those massive appropriations bills. In fact, we doubt he even knew those particular projects were even in the bill. But Hayworth knew the bills contained billions in earmarks, and he even boasted in a press release about some of the earmarks he included for Arizona. From where we sit, if you boast to constituents about the earmarks you brought to your home state, then you've got to live with the earmarks other legislators brought to theirs. And those projects listed in the McCain ad were among them. We rate the ad's claims Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C38400>],/factchecks/2010/jul/16/john-mccain/john-mccain-labels-jd-hayworth-avid-earmarker/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'States', 'National Right to Life Committee']","
Abortions in Pennsylvania paid for with federal dollars? Not so.
","
Anti-abortion groups have long been warning that Democrats would sneak federal abortion funding through the back door into the health reform law passed earlier this year. Now they say in blogs and news reports around the Web that they're being proved right.

A typical statement: ""The Obama Administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million in federal tax funds, which we've discovered will pay for insurance plans that cover any legal abortion,"" said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee in a statement on the group's website.

We fact-checked abortion many times during the health care debate. It's a complicated subject due to the many different parts of the health care law. So yes, this latest controversy takes some time to explain.

As you may recall, the major provisions of the new health care plan -- health insurance for everyone and exchanges for buying health plans -- don't kick in for several years. To help people who are uninsured right now, the federal law is encouraging states to create temporary health plans for people who have trouble finding affordable insurance. The government is calling the plans Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plans, or PCIPs, though sometimes they're referred to as high risk insurance pools. The plans would typically be for people who can't get insurance through work but have pre-existing conditions that make it impossible to buy insurance on their own. Policy makers say they're particularly concerned with older people who aren't yet eligible for Medicare.

Pennsylvania was among the first states to put together a plan, submitting it to the federal government on June 2. It was approved a few weeks later on June 28. Pennsylvania quickly issued guidelines asking insurance companies to submit bids to run the state plan. On July 12, the National Right to Life Committee sounded the alarm, saying those guidelines for insurance companies revealed the plan to fund abortion.

The 60-page proposal from Pennsylvania outlines what looks like a pretty standard health care plan: It says the plan should include preventive care, physician services, diagnostic testing, hospitalization, mental health services, and prescription medications. It will charge people $283.20 a month for coverage and accept people without access to other coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions.

On abortion, the proposal says this: ""Includes only abortions and contraceptives that satisfy the requirements of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3204-3206 and 35 P.S. §§10101, 10103-10105. ... Elective abortions are not covered.""

Those statute numbers refer to Pennsylvania's abortion laws, where abortion is, for the most part, legal. We looked up the code and it says that abortions may be performed if a doctor determines that ""in his best clinical judgment, the abortion is necessary."" The only mention the statute makes of forbidding an abortion is when it is ""sought solely because of the sex of the unborn child.""

Those statute numbers mean that the proposal intended to include any legal abortion, said Johnson, the legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. ""We know how this stuff works,"" Johnson told us. ""He'll say 'It's not elective, it's necessary.'""

After the anti-abortion groups made the charge, the Obama administration was quick to say that it had not yet put forward formal regulations for the state plans, and that it would include restrictions so that abortion would only be covered if it met the tests of a well-known restriction known as the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment, which traditionally applies to federal dollars used in the Medicaid health plan for the poor, forbids abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.

Pennsylvania officials said their plan never intended to cover elective abortion -- hence the ""elective abortions are not covered"" language. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department released a sharp statement after getting questions from PolitiFact and other news outlets:

""This program will provide much-needed assistance for the sickest of the sick. The likelihood that any of those covered will seek abortion services is remote, but if they do need such services, they will have to pay for them out their own pocket. ... Pennsylvania's position is not a statement about the broader abortion debate. It simply recognizes that health care reform, particularly extending health coverage to those with preexisting conditions, is too important a priority to be hijacked by those who seek to turn common-sense health reforms into a rancorous debate about whether the federal ban on abortion funding is too broad or too narrow. These efforts failed to derail health reform this spring and they will fail to stop much-needed coverage for thousands of Pennsylvanians now.""

The controversy over the Pre-existing Condition Health Insurance Plan has kicked off a larger debate about how abortion is handled for in lower-profile parts of the health care bill that did not get a full airing during the health care debate. President Obama signed an executive order on abortion, which he had promised to do soon after the law passed, to secure support from anti-abortion Democrats. The executive order says that it should be government-wide policy that federal funds ""are not used for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment."" The executive order then goes into specifics about health care exchanges and community health centers, which were the most talked about provisions before the bill was passed.

The lesser known provisions of bill are all up for debate now. Johnson said the executive order is essentially meaningless, and is silent on a host of other provisions in the health bill. ""Each of these things will have its own timeline and its own administrative trajectory,"" Johnson said. ""We're going to have to watch each and every one of them.""

We asked Johnson on July 15 if he thought, given the Obama administration's statement, that the Pennsylvania plan would cover any legal abortion. ""If the federal (Health and Human Services Department) does what they now say they're going to do, or at least what they said they would do late yesterday, then I think that Pennsylvania will conform to the directive."" But, he added, ""We will see this episode as part of a pattern where they try to get away with what they can on abortion, and then when a light shines on them they blow smoke and scurry for cover.""

Meanwhile, those who favor abortion rights are unhappy that the administration is accepting restrictions on abortion. ""Based on the Obama administration's statement, we are deeply disappointed that the administration has voluntarily and unnecessarily decided to impose limits on private funds used to purchase health insurance coverage for abortion care in the new high-risk insurance pools,"" said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards in a statement. ""This decision has no basis in the law and flies in the face of the intent of the high-risk pools that were meant to meet the medical needs of some of the most vulnerable women in this country.""

Finally, we should also point out that the Department of Health and Human Services is indeed still developing regulations for many aspects of health care, and they're trying to do it with some haste. New Mexico, for example, submitted a plan for the Pre-existing Condition Health Insurance Plan that explicitly included abortion services, but then withdrew it quickly when it learned that the federal government would forbid the services, according to July 14 story from the Associated Press.

Getting back to our rating: The National Right to Life Committee said the Obama administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover ""any legal abortion."" If we had looked at this case before the Obama administration issued its statements, we might have been a little torn. While the Pennsylvania proposal referred to statutes about legal abortion, it also said that ""elective abortions are not covered,"" and that is potentially contradictory. But it's important to keep in mind that this plan is intended to cover older people who have health problems, not young, healthy women who might seek abortions, and that the regulations are being created quickly. In short, we don't see pre-meditated intent to cover elective abortion. And as soon as the issue of abortion was raised, the Obama administration stated that the plans would not be allowed to cover elective abortions and that forthcoming regulations would reflect that. Given those assurances, we rate the National Right to Life Committee's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809782F500>],/factchecks/2010/jul/16/national-right-life-committee/abortions-pennsylvania-paid-federal-dollars-not-so/
"['Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio's favorite statistic
","
Conservative champion Marco Rubio has declared war on President Barack Obama's spending habits.

He blasts the growing deficit, vulnerable entitlement programs and congressional earmarks on network interviews and at whistle stops across the state. He unveiled a spending plan that calls for making President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ending the inheritance tax and nixing a value-added tax. And, in one of his most reliable lines, Rubio links the federal budget to his offspring's economic future.

""Forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children,"" he told Fox News on June 28, 2010. ""I think that's outrageous. We have to stop doing that.""

Rubio repeated the claim at an event just outside of St. Petersburg on July 13: ""Forty cents of every dollar the federal government spends is borrowed from my children's and your children's and grandchildren's generation. No Americans before have ever done that — not at this perverse level, not at this sustained rate.""

Given that Rubio's budget beef has become the heart of his Tea Party-esque stump speech, we wondered whether the father of four was using hard numbers or pushing some kind of GOP fairy tale.

The Rubio campaign directed us to an Associated Press article published in the New York Times on Feb. 4, 2010: ""The House voted Thursday to allow the government to go $1.9 trillion deeper in debt, an increase of about $6,000 for every United States resident. The accumulated debt already amounts to roughly $40,000 per person. The debt increase, approved 217 to 212, is only enough to keep the government afloat for about another year as it borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends.""

""This was a widely reported stat,"" said campaign spokesman Alex Burgos.

The Associated Press report doesn't cite a source, but a quick review of the White House's budget summaries shows Rubio's 40 percent claim is as authentic as a 24-pack of Silly Bandz.

The White House spent $3.5 trillion during the 2009-2010 fiscal year, of which $1.4 trillion could not be paid for, creating a deficit of exactly 40 percent. 
Policy and economic experts confirmed that the numbers in the White House's budget summary are a credible source.

""They may have actually got that figure from me,"" said Brian Riedl, the Heritage Foundation's lead budget analyst who has discussed the 40 percent figure in various media reports. ""It's solid, basic math. It just calculates the deficit as a percentage of total spending.""

Everyone we spoke with said the deficit will eventually need to be trimmed -- and soon. But, Rubio's larger point -- that the deficit is bad policy -- was largely debated.

""The reason the deficit is so big right now is because we have a massive economic meltdown and deficit spending is appropriate,"" said Elliott Parker, a University of Nevada Reno economics professor

Parker opposes Rubio's spending plan.

""This is politics at its silliest,"" Parker said. ""You cannot simultaneously make Bush’s tax cuts permanent and deal with the federal deficit, unless you are willing to severely cut Social Security and Medicare.""

Leonard Burman, a Syracuse University public affairs professor and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Department of the Treasury, also cautioned against using current deficit figures as a rallying call.

The White House's budget predicts the deficit will fall to 33 percent in 2011, 22 percent in 2012 and 17 percent by 2015 under current policy.

However, Burman, like Rubio, expressed concern that Obama has not taken more forceful actions to decrease the deficit. One of Obama's high-profile solutions was to form a debt commission, which is due to make recommendations to Congress by December.

""I hope the commission is successful, but I also hope to see the Tooth Fairy some day,"" Burman deadpanned.

In short, we can't predict whether the Rubio children will be stuck with our tab. That is up to future policy decisions. What we do know is in this instance, when it comes to the hard numbers, father still knows best: The United States government spent 40 percent more than what it collected during the most recent fiscal year. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A363880>],/factchecks/2010/jul/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-favorite-statistic/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Nathan Deal']","
Nathan Deal says immigration costs Georgians more than $1 billion
","
In a recent campaign commercial, candidate for governor Nathan Deal said he's concerned about ""you.""

And for your sake, he worries about illegal immigration.

In the ad, the former U.S. congressman walks along a lush meadow hemmed by a wooden fence, promising to get tough on illegal immigrants because they cost you far too much.

""Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year,"" said Deal, who has long pushed for more restrictions on citizenship and aggressive enforcement of current immigration laws.

More than $1 billion? Is that possible?

The Deal campaign said the actual cost is even higher: $1.6 billion.

They cited a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that shares Deal's ideas on immigration.

In its October 2008 report, ""The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Georgians,"" FAIR estimated state and local costs related to the education, health care and incarceration of illegal immigrants.

Deal actually understated FAIR's figure. The group put the total cost at more than $1.6 billion.

We decided to take a closer look. Illegal immigration is a complex subject, and its fiscal impacts can be especially murky. Researchers have tried to estimate costs for two decades, but it's hard because important data is not available.

Few nonpartisan sources issue alternative fiscal estimates that focus on Georgia, in part because it's hard to get enough state-level data to do the subject justice.

Another problem is these studies are issued by groups with agendas, said Jeff Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center, which tries to ""improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation."" It does not take positions on policy issues.

""I can tell you what the result is based on who's doing the study,"" Passel said.

There is some consensus on the subject, according to a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office. The agency reviewed 29 studies on the issue and determined some areas where they agree.

For instance, if you lump legal and illegal immigrants together, they as a group bring in more in taxes than they use up over the long term, according to the CBO review. Also, the federal government doesn't give state and local governments enough to cover the cost of illegal immigration.

FAIR's estimate of $1.6 billion was based on assumptions that are well outside such areas of consensus, PolitiFact Georgia found. And that's a problem.

Education was the biggest cost in FAIR's estimate, and one factor in their calculation is especially controversial to advocates on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum: FAIR included the cost of educating U.S.-born children whose parents came here illegally.

FAIR argues that it's important to count them. Those kids wouldn't be here if their parents hadn't entered the country, and they would likely leave if their parents did.

That's correct, but it's reasonable to ask whether it's right to include the price of educating these children as part of the cost of ""illegal aliens,"" as Deal put it. The Constitution's 14th Amendment says any child born in the U.S. is a citizen.

If you exclude these kids, FAIR's estimate plummets by hundreds of millions of dollars.

Another criticism concerns how the group adds up the price of educating a child of an illegal immigrant for a year. They said it is $8,450, based on figures from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics.

This cost is debatable. The price of adding a student or two, legal or otherwise, to an already-existing classroom might be much lower than FAIR's figure, experts said. That's because those students won't necessarily prompt a school district to hire an additional teacher or build a new school.

It also might be greater. For instance, a small town dealing with a major influx of children of illegal immigrants might have to build more schools and pay for other things they didn't need before, Passel said.

There are other reasonable criticisms of FAIR's approach.

FAIR derived a portion of its health care costs from what may be a billion-dollar overestimate. The think tank RAND Corp. estimated that nationally, the government pays about $1.1 billion to give health care to illegal immigrants ages 18 to 64.

FAIR assumed the actual cost is closer to $2 billion, nearly double the RAND figure. They reasoned that one of the study's authors publicly acknowledged health care costs could be twice as much. But in a PolitiFact Georgia e-mail exchange, that researcher wrote FAIR got what he said wrong, and the estimate shouldn't be doubled.

It's also worthwhile to note how FAIR counted the tax contributions of illegal immigrants.

It's standard practice for economists to give individuals credit for paying business taxes, said Matt Gardner, executive director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has progressive or liberal leanings. Every consumer routinely pays business taxes when they make purchases, because businesses boost their sales prices to cover them.

FAIR did not include the business taxes paid by illegal immigrants, saying that including them ""posits that companies do not exist as economic entities,"" said Jack Martin, FAIR's special projects director.

These are only a few criticisms of FAIR's numbers. But taking even one of them into account can lower or raise the cost by $800 million or more.

For instance, FAIR calculated the net fiscal effect of illegal immigration on Georgia as $1.34 billion, taking into account $273 million they said the undocumented pay in taxes. But if you subtract the cost of educating the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, the estimate plummets to about $550 million.

And here's another example: Even FAIR thinks its 2008 figures are too low. A report issued last week increased their cost estimate to about $2.4 billion, based on new population figures and changes in how they incorporate criminal justice, health care and infrastructure costs.

Whether you think FAIR's estimates are high or low, correct or erroneous, you run up against the same problem. A little more information or context and the estimate swings by a billion dollars, literally.

The variation is so wide and the assumptions are so contentious that it's misleading for Deal to flatly state that the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Georgians is more than $1 billion.

It is correct that Georgia foots the bill for illegal immigration. It could be substantial, depending on how you add it up. And while Deal's cost figure is rooted in data, there's an excellent chance that it's much higher than it should be.

It's not possible for PolitiFact Georgia to calculate a specific cost. Too little information exists on the subject for that calculation. Deal has a point, but his conclusion leaves out important details, which could lead to a different conclusion.

For this reason, Deal's statement earns a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970E8080>],/factchecks/2010/jul/16/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-immigration-costs-georgians-more-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Candidate Biography', 'Economy', 'David Cicilline']","
Cicilline says he ushered in $3 billion in Providence development
","
Rome wasn't built in a day. But Providence was built in just a few short years. By one man. Or so Mayor David Cicilline would like you to think.

Since he launched his campaign for Congress, the Providence Democrat, who took office in 2003, has repeatedly taken credit for billions in economic development throughout the city, making it a centerpiece of his election bid.

His claim is specific: ""By restoring trust in city government, Cicilline has ushered in $3 billion in new investment and restored vibrancy to downtown and the 25 neighborhoods of the city.""

He's been saying it for nearly five years and it has become a central part of his campaign message. But that's a lot of investment for a city whose entire annual budget was less than $620 million last year.

Our interest sufficiently piqued, we called the Cicilline team for a breakdown.

A Rose-Colored History

After multiple requests, the mayor's administration finally provided us with a list. It was so exhaustive it suggested that Cicilline was responsible for nearly every major piece of Capital City development in the seven years since he took office -- and in a few cases, projects that began before he got near City Hall.

Frequented the Auto Zone on Manton Avenue or the expanded fitness center at Brown University? Thank Cicilline.

How about the parking garage at Rhode Island Hospital or the Walmart on Charles Street?

Or what about the storage units on Reservoir Avenue, or the West River endoscopy offices?

The mayor also takes credit for the construction of new condos, retail stores and several not-yet-built office buildings, as well as public projects including work on schools and roads. The list goes on. Over 100 projects in total.

The biggest item that he says he ""ushered in"" is the $610-million I-Way project, the relocation of a portion of Route 195 in downtown Providence. But the I-Way planning began more than a decade ago; the federal environmental impact statement was completed in 1996. The earliest phases of construction began in 1999, three years before Cicilline took office, and the financing came mostly from the federal government.

When we asked the Cicilline administration to defend the I-Way claim, they agreed it was an overstatement. Cicilline spokeswoman Karen Watts said in an email that the mayor ""agrees with you that including the whole of the highway project in this list isn't correct.""

But the administration insisted the rest of the list is accurate.

What about the combined sewer overflow project, a two-decade effort to build a three-mile long underground tunnel to contain sewage overflow during storms? He takes credit for $275 million of the $359 million development. According to the Narragansett Bay Commission's website, the planning for this project dates to 1993. Construction began in June 2001, more than 18 months before Cicilline took office.

The sewer project and the I-Way alone make up almost 30 percent of Cicilline's claim. So even if the rest of the list is valid -- which we don't think it is -- the accuracy of the statement has slipped significantly.

""The bigger projects, the 195 and the combined sewer, those were things that were going to happen, but the mayor pushed and got the changes needed [for them],"" Providence Planning Director Thomas Deller said in an interview. ""....Can we take credit for it? No, it was something that was going to happen. But it may have happened a little faster [with Cicilline as mayor] or a little slower"" without him.

The problem is that the mayor did take credit for it. He said he ""ushered"" it in, remember?

The Cicilline team argues that while they may not have actually brought in every dollar for every project themselves, they created a predictable, trustworthy environment that made small business owners and developers want to invest there.

""The fact of the matter is that [the person] who is in office and who works for them has a lot to do with decisions about how projects move forward,"" Deller said. ""The point the mayor was trying to make is how we work aggressively to make things happen.""

We don't fault the mayor for claiming credit for hotels or developments such as the new Blue Cross headquarters. In several instances, it's clear his administration played an active role in making those developments happen. But he doesn't deserve credit for every permit issued.

It was not a one-time slip of the tongue either.

$3 Billion Claim Repeated

Cicilline has been using the $3-billion figure at least since January 2006, when he cited it in his State of the City address. In the years since, he has been quoted saying it more than a dozen times in The Providence Journal.

The claim came out of the ""A Vision For Providence"" study, a 2005 report that highlighted economic development, neighborhood by neighborhood.

What's interesting is how the claim evolved. In those early mentions, Cicilline said that economic development in the city hit $3 billion. Over the years, the statement morphed into one in which Cicilline took credit for bringing those projects in.

And when projects such as the One Ten Westminster condos fell through, the Cicilline administration just replaced that item with another, so the final $3 billion figure never changed.

Again, it's fair for a mayor to take credit for some of the economic development that occurred during his tenure. But not to exaggerate his role in those projects.

On his campaign website, Cicilline clearly implies that he had a hand in making the developments happen. Not only that, he takes credit for ventures that predate his term in office, and he repeats the claim in public.

We presented our research to Deller, a Providence City Hall veteran. At the end of a long conversation, his response: ""If this were 2005 and I thought there would be a Truth-O-Meter sometime in the future, I might not have put it that way.""

That's really all you need to know. False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A31C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/16/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-he-ushered-3-billion-providence-dev/

David Axelrod says U.S. will have 40 percent of global market for advanced batteries by 2015
","
President Barack Obama has repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. to get out front in the production of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. One of the main obstacles has been that few American manufacturers were producing advanced batteries to power those vehicles. 
The economic stimulus championed by Obama included $2.4 billion to spur the creation of electric vehicle battery and component manufacturing plants. And this week, the White House repeatedly boasted that those investments are starting to pay off.

Nine new battery plants have opened with the help of stimulus money, and the White House says four will be operational by the end of the year. The White House says higher-volume domestic manufacturing of advanced batteries will greatly reduce the cost of batteries -- which is crucial if electric vehicles are to become a viable option for car-buyers.

On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, White House adviser David Axelrod said the stimulus has made the U.S. a global player in the advanced battery market.

""He (Obama) is going on Thursday to Michigan to a plant that produces advanced batteries for electric cars,"" Axelrod said. ""We had 2 percent of the global market when he started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015, because we helped spur and leverage private investment, and that's what we want to do.""

That's quite a leap, and so we decided to check it out.

The first part of Axelrod's equation -- that the U.S. had 2 percent of the global market at the start of the Obama presidency -- is defensible. There wasn't much advanced battery production being done then, except for hybrid electric vehicles. And, at that time, according to a 2008 report from the Department of Energy, only one company was assembling batteries in the U.S. for mass-produced vehicles. They were making batteries for the Saturn Vue. The Ford Escape Hybrid was being assembled in the U.S., but the batteries came from Asia. In any case, that one company, Cobasys, commanded a 2 percent share of the batteries supplied in 2008, according to the report.

As for where Axelrod got the other figures -- that ""we now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015"" -- the White House press office pointed us toward a Deutsche Bank study of announced capacity to produce lithium ion batteries. The study projected the U.S. would have 20 percent by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015.

Unlike Axelrod, the White House press office noted that these estimates are about capacity, not actual production.

The projection of capacity by Deutsche Bank ""pretty well matches with the other projections of announced capacity,"" said Mike Millikin, editor of the Green Car Congress.

""The Administration has certainly put its money toward boosting U.S. capacity,"" Millikin said. ""However, what ultimately matters is production and purchases.""

In fact, many industry experts say capacity will far exceed demand for, and production of, advanced batteries.

In April, 2010, Menahem Anderman, founder and chief executive of Total Battery Consulting, issued a report on plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) based on-site interviews with top technologists and executives at 20 major automakers and 15 current and prospective battery suppliers on three continents.

""The government’s stimulus money will create severe overcapacity from 2013 on,"" Anderman told PolitiFact. ""There is no market for the capacity planned.""

That's because demand for the cars is limited by high up-front cost and still-evolving battery technology.

""Unfortunately the mass EV and PHEV market at current gasoline pricing and battery technology status (cost, performance and life) will require unaffordable heavy subsidies to carmakers, battery makers and the consumer,"" Anderman said.

And because the market is so dependent on government subsidies, he said, it is risky.

""Our projections are that the combined EV/PHEV world new vehicle market will be on the order of 200,000 vehicles in 2015 and 1 million in 2020,"" Anderman said. ""The government-paid battery plants that are supposed to be operational by 2013 will be heavily underutilized for years; they will have enough capacity to support the 2020 U.S. market.""

""Indeed the U.S. will have many unutilized plants,"" Anderman predicted. ""The major Japanese players (Sanyo, Panasonic, Hitachi) hesitate to invest in EV batteries since they are skeptical about the EV market.""

Any suggestion that sales of actual batteries will follow announced planned capacity is naive, he said. Many companies that received stimulus money don't have a proven battery ready for mass production and are at least several years away from being qualified by major car companies. And with no experience running a high-volume automated Lithium Ion battery plant, Anderman said, most of the companies will face a slow and costly learning curve.

""Nobody can predict market share for 2015, but I will be surprised if U.S. will get much more than 10 percent,"" Anderman said. ""There are 5 major Japanese suppliers and two Korean that are 10 years ahead in manufacturing experience.""

The Freedonia Group, a Cleveland-based industry market research firm, estimated that in 2017, the U.S. will command 9 percent of the world market (dollar-wise) for lithium-based rechargeable batteries, including those for electric vehicles.

Our biggest issue with Axelrod's claim is that he mixes two different statistics. The 2 percent figure represents actual production; the 16 percent, going to 40 percent by 2015, figures are for capacity. Those are two different things.

In a July 15, 2010, speech at a new advanced battery factory in Holland, Mich., which was seeded with stimulus cash, Obama worded the statistic more carefully.

""Just a few years ago, American businesses manufactured only 2 percent of the world’s advanced batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles -- 2 percent,"" Obama said. ""But because of what’s happening in places like this, in just five years we’ll have up to 40 percent of the world’s capacity -- 40 percent.""

It takes a careful ear to discern that he's talking about two different statistics. And presented back-to-back, as they were, we think it's misleading.

In fact, here's how a White House press release about advanced battery investments in the stimulus stated the statistic this week:

""Pre-Recovery Act, the U.S. produced just 2 percent of the world’s batteries for advanced vehicles, but due to Recovery Act investments, the U.S. will have the capacity to produce 20 percent of these batteries by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015 - that’s a jump from 2 percent to 40 percent in a span of just five years.""

No, it's not a jump from 2 to 40. The 2 percent was a production number. The 40 percent is a capacity number. It remains to be seen how much of that capacity will be utilized. But most market analysts predict that the U.S. share of the advanced battery market -- actual sales of advanced batteries -- will be much lower than 40 percent. We rate Axelrod's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BFD680>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-us-will-have-40-percent-global-/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Legal Issues', 'Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Dave Aronberg']","
Dan Gelber and his ties to BP questioned by opponent
","
If Florida winds up suing BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a newly elected Attorney General Dan Gelber may have to sit the case out, according to his rival for the Democratic nomination.

Dave Aronberg says that Gelber could be disqualified from representing the state in a case against BP because the private law firm he worked for until recently, Akerman Senterfitt, signed BP as a client in oil spill matters.

The relationship between BP, Akerman Senterfitt and Gelber could create a conflict of interest too big for a judge to ignore, Aronberg says.

""As one of the leading critics of BP, you will never have to worry which side I'm on,"" Aronberg, a state senator from Greenacres, wrote in an e-mail to supporters. ""Our next Attorney General needs to be the people's attorney -- and not the polluter's attorney.

""I'm not angry at my opponent. He and I served in the legislature together. The fact remains, however, that his employment by BP's law firm could disqualify him from representing Florida against BP as Attorney General.""

The accusation is significant, especially in a down-ballot state primary featuring candidates who have few policy disagreements. But is it true?

First, the germane facts.

Gelber was indeed an ""of counsel"" lawyer for Akerman Senterfitt, working in the Litigation Practice Group in the firm's Miami office (Akerman also has Florida offices in Fort Lauderdale, Tallahassee, Tampa and West Palm Beach, and is Florida's largest law firm).

And Akerman Senterfitt was hired to represent BP in all of its Florida civil litigation.

The two events -- Gelber's work for Akerman, and Akerman's relationship with BP -- overlapped for at least about a month. We don't know exactly when BP hired Akerman, and an Akerman spokesman didn't return our call for comment, but it happened before May 24. We'll explain how we know that in a second.

Gelber, meanwhile, announced he was resigning from the firm in an e-mail on June 24. (Read it here). The e-mail says Gelber planned on leaving the firm in early July, but Gelber said his resignation became official by June 28.

So Gelber was a lawyer for a firm representing BP for about a month. Now the question is would that by itself disqualify him from handling a case against BP as attorney general?

Florida Bar rules

The Florida Bar sets quite specific rules for determining conflicts of interest.

The bar, in rule 4-1.9, says that a lawyer who has formerly represented a client cannot ""represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent.""

Another rule deals more specifically with public officers, which Gelber would be if elected attorney general. Bar rule 4-1.11 says that a lawyer currently serving as a public officer or employee cannot ""participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice or nongovernmental employment, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent.""

Aronberg pointed us to additional bar regulations (4-1.10) that say that a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer for purposes of the rules governing loyalty to the client.

There are all kinds of buzz words there for us to ferret out. In one sense, the key is whether Gelber represented BP, in another it's whether he participated personally and substantially. Looking at it another way, it's crucial perhaps to know what work Akerman did for BP in the month that Gelber was still employed at the firm.

We asked Gelber, a state Senator from Miami Beach, to explain his role in any litigation related to BP.

""Everything I heard about it, I read through the newspaper,"" Gelber said.

Q: Were you part of any privileged conversations? 
A: No.

Q: Did you see any privileged or confidential material? 
A: No.

""I can list all the things I didn't know, but the easiest thing to say is that I knew nothing,"" Gelber said.

To his point, Gelber said he didn't even have a conversation with his supervisors after learning that BP retained Akerman. He didn't want to ask when BP hired Akerman. He didn't want to ask why no one told him. He just didn't want to ask.

There's also the matter of a letter written by another state legislator and Akerman lawyer, Alex Villalobos, specifically requesting Villalobos, Gelber and other Akerman lawyers who are also members of the state Legislature not be part of the BP litigation or privy to any BP information.

That letter was written on May 24, the first record of BP being represented by Akerman Senterfitt.

""We specifically request that we remain walled off and isolated from any discussions, documents or activities of any kind between the firm and BP,"" Villalobos wrote in a letter that was copied to Gelber. (Gelber says that he actually didn't see a copy of the Villalobos letter until weeks after it was written).

Legal opinions

With all that in mind, we turned to a cadre of legal experts to see if there is or could be a conflict.

Most thought it would be difficult to have Gelber removed.

""It seems to be quite unlikely,"" said John Steele, who runs the Legal Ethics Forum and has taught legal ethics classes at Stanford, University of California-Berkeley, Santa Clara, and Indiana University. ""The devil is in details we probably don't have access to and never will.""

It's not enough, in most cases, for a judge to declare a conflict simply because Gelber worked for a firm for one month that simultaneously did work on BP's behalf. The question, Steele said, is did Gelber hear something in the halls of Akerman Senterfitt, or see an e-mail that might make BP uncomfortable should he sit as an opposing counsel.

Also, Steele said, BP would have to raise the objection to have Gelber disqualified. Trying to get Florida's attorney general tossed off the case could have damaging political impacts for BP, Steele notes. 
Three other law professors we spoke with -- W. Bradley Wendell, a professor at Cornell Law School, Stephen Gillers, the Crystal Eastman Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law and Roberta K. Flowers, Wm. Reece Smith, Jr. Distinguished Professor at the Stetson College of Law -- agreed with Steele's assessment. 
""The claim is false,"" said Gillers. ""If Gelber did not do work for BP on the spill while at the firm, Florida conflict rules, and those in all U.S. jurisdictions, permit him to represent the state against BP as Attorney General."" 
Added Wendell: ""Lawyers, ironically, are sometimes not very knowledgeable about the law governing lawyers."" 
Yet other lawyers we talked to focused on Aronberg's use of the word ""could"" in describing Gelber's potential conflict.

""I do feel comfortable saying that his statement is potentially true, depending on the existence of certain facts,"" said Andrew Perlman, a professor at Suffolk University Law School. (We should note that Perlman is an acquaintance of Aronberg's from law school. PolitiFact Florida contacted him through the Legal Ethics Forum, however, and without knowing of his relationship with Aronberg.)

Richard W. Painter, the S. Walter Richey Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, said ""the ball is in Gelber's court to establish that he would not be disqualified under the Florida rule, for example because he had no access to confidential information from BP about the oil spill.""

""I didn't just willy-nilly make this up,"" said Aronberg, who said he spoke with Antonacci and former state Attorney General Richard Doran about Gelber's potential conflict. ""And there's a reason I said 'could.' We don't know, this is a complicated thing and only a judge can make the final decision.""

Our ruling

Legal experts and law professors are clear that for Gelber to ever be removed in a case against BP, he needs to have had access to confidential information while working at Akerman Senterfitt. Put another way, it's not enough that he worked at Akerman for a month or so while the firm represented BP to disqualify him from pursuing a case against the oil giant.

What evidence is there that Gelber received confidential or privileged information? None.

We couldn't find it. Neither could Aronberg. Nor has it been reported somewhere else.

That brings us to Aronberg's use of the word ""could"" in his claim -- Dan Gelber's employment by BP’s law firm ""could disqualify him from representing Florida against BP as Attorney General.""

We have to acknowledge that anything is possible. New information could come to light significantly tying Gelber to the BP case, and that indeed could lead to his disqualification.

But it isn't here yet, and in the absence of that information, Aronberg's claim sounds more like a scare tactic than rooted in some finding of fact. We rate his statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A63C40>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/dave-aronberg/dan-gelber-and-his-ties-bp-questioned-opponent/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says Obama has presided over private job losses, increase in federal jobs
","
As the House Republican leader, Ohio’s John Boehner seizes every opportunity to counter any message that President Barack Obama attempts to convey. When Obama touted his efforts to resuscitate the economy during a July 8, 2010, appearance in Kansas City, Missouri, Boehner posted his counterpoint titled ""Where are the Jobs, Mr. President?"" in a column on the conservative TownHall website.

And, on the day Obama was scheduled to speak at an electric battery plant in Holland, Mich., he hit back again with an op-ed in the Detroit News July 15.

""Since February 2009 (when the economic stimulus bill was passed) our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs,"" Boehner wrote.

With the administration simultaneously putting a more favorable spin on its record of job creation, we thought it would be worth checking each side's facts.

Boehner’s office said his column was based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases monthly figures on nationwide employment and unemployment.

We'll take Boehner's two claims in order.

• Has the economy lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs since February 2009? Yes.

First we should note that Boehner was specific about the statistic he was using -- private-sector jobs, not total jobs. So we’ve used that statistic to judge his claim.

According to BLS, 110,961,000 Americans were employed in the private sector in January 2009. By June 2010 -- the most recent month available -- that number had fallen to 107,700,000. That's a drop of 3.26 million jobs -- or ""roughly 3 million"" in Boehner’s words.

By beginning his count in January 2009 -- even though the bill was passed in February 2009 -- Boehner’s number takes into account all the job losses from February. You could instead start counting in February 2009; in that case, the number of jobs lost would be somewhat further from Boehner’s claim -- 2.55 million jobs.

It’s worth noting that the biggest job hemorrhages came in February and March of 2009, when 726,000 and 753,000 jobs disappeared. The losses slowed down into last summer and fall, and gains were recorded for the first five months of 2010.

• Has the federal government payroll grown by more than 400,000 jobs since February 2009? Yes -- but with a major asterisk.

In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By June 2010, there were 3,208,000 -- an increase of 405,000.

Here's the asterisk: The June numbers are inflated by temporary Census workers whose jobs are slated to end in a  matter of months.

By way of comparison, we used BLS estimates of the temporary Census work force to adjust the monthly employment figures. Doing so drops the January 2009 federal employment level by 5,000 to 2,798,000, while the June 2010 level drops by 339,000 to 2,869,000. That reduces the federal employment increase to 71,000 -- far less than the 400,000 Boehner cited.

While technically accurate, Boehner's statistics are misleading because the government workforce is inflated by the temporary census workers. For this reason, we rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3E1FC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-has-presided-over-private-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden lauds Obama's job creation record
","
On July 14, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden and Christina Romer, who chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, held a news conference to discuss the latest quarterly report on the impact of the economic stimulus bill enacted in February 2009.

At one point, Biden said, ""We went from losing 3 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush Administration and 3.6 million, or 3.7 million in the first six months we took office -- inheriting the policy we could not possibly turn around before we could pass anything -- to the first six months of this year, actually adding almost 600,000 private sector jobs.""

With Republicans simultaneously putting a less favorable spin on the administration's record of job creation, we thought it would be worth checking each side's facts. (We also analyze a statement by House Minority Leader John Boehner.)

We'll take the claims in order.

• Did the economy shed 3 million jobs during the last six months of President George W. Bush's administration? Actually, that understates the losses.

In July 2008, the general employment level was 137,075,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2009, it was 133,549,000 -- a decline of about 3.5 million jobs.

• Did the economy shed 3.6 million or 3.7 million jobs in the first six months under Obama? That modestly overstates the losses.

In January 2009, the general employment level was 133,549,000. In July 2009, it was 130,294,000. That's a decline of 3.26 million jobs.

• Did the economy add almost 600,000 private sector jobs during the first six months of this year? Very, very close.

In December 2009, the number of private-sector jobs stood at 107,107,000. By June 2010, the number was 107,700,000. That's a difference of 593,000 jobs -- ""almost 600,000"" in our book.

In all, Biden's numbers understated the losses under Bush and overstated the losses under Obama, but both of these errors work against the administration's own interests. And in the third case, Biden's number easily qualifies as ""almost 600,000."" All in all, we rate Biden's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F63B00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/joe-biden/joe-biden-lauds-obamas-job-creation-record/

Bogdanoff said she was against taxes but omits votes
","
In one of the biggest Republican primary battles in South Florida, two state legislators -- Ellyn Bogdanoff of Fort Lauderdale and Carl Domino of Jupiter -- will face off Aug. 24 to replace Sen. Jeff Atwater, who is running for CFO. To appeal to conservative primary voters, Bogdanoff tries to portray herself in a TV ad as protecting Floridians from higher taxes.

Her ad, set against the backdrop of orchestral music and showing images of people struggling to pay bills, emphasizes her role as chair of the Finance and Tax Council -- a position she held for the 2009 and 2010 sessions. Bogdanoff and her husband Steve are seated at what looks like a kitchen table in the ad (it's in a neighbor's home).

""The economic downturn has been tough on a lot of people. We've had record job losses and a budget shortfall for state government. As chair of the Finance and Tax Council, the insiders and special interests pushed me to raises taxes. But higher taxes would only make it harder for the people of Florida to sit around their kitchen table and figure out how to make ends meet. I don't represent special interests. I represent the people of Florida so I said no to higher taxes and fees and I will continue that fight in the state Senate.""

In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether Bogdanoff ""said no to higher taxes and fees.""

The ad is not the first time she has made a similar claim. On her website, Bogdanoff writes: ""As Chair of Finance & Tax in the Florida House I have stood against every proposed tax increase. During these challenging economic times, increasing taxes on millions of hard-working Floridians is just simply wrong and is counter–productive to the positive steps we are taking to get the economic engine of Florida moving again.""

The Truth-O-Meter previously ruled as True a claim by Sen. Charlie Justice, who is running for Congress, that the 2009 Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion.

A  handy spreadsheet  from the state Office of Economic and Demographic Research details the laws passed in 2009 that affected state revenue. They include:

• $935 million from a $1-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes.
• $797 million from sharp fee increases to get a driver's license or new car tags.
• $304 million in higher business taxes to replenish Florida's bankrupt unemployment compensation trust fund.
• $195 million from fee increases for filing various types of court motions.

The bottom-line projection added up to about $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees. We looked at a few of those bills to determine how Bogdanoff voted.

• She voted in favor of the conference report for Senate Bill 1778 -- a transportation bill that increased fees for certain title certificates. A bill analysis listed several fees that would increase under the bill related to obtaining crash reports, driver licenses and registrations.

• She voted against Bill 1840, the cigarette surcharge tax.

• She voted in favor of bill 1718, which raised court fees.

• She voted in favor of Bill 810, which made employers subject to higher rates of taxation for unemployment compensation benefits. (The Legislature delayed the increase the next year.)

Bogdanoff also voted for the overall budget bill in 2009, which reflected the overall $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees.

We sent our findings to Bogdanoff's campaign and asked for an explanation. Bogdanoff called us back directly. She says we can't interpret her ad to mean she never voted for a tax or fee increase -- she doesn't use the word ""vote"" in her ad.

By ""I said no,"" Bogdanoff said, ""I mean advocate, said no, stated my position, tried to sway everybody. I'm the one who says no to higher taxes and fees. ... I did not win the battle in 2009. Ultimately I made the decision to vote for a responsible balanced budget.""

Bogdanoff has made a name for herself as a legislator who fights tax increases, as several news articles show. It's clear that she resisted raising taxes early in the 2009 session. She also made moves to try to prohibit tax increases -- for example, refusing to move forward a bill that would have allowed Miami-Dade residents to vote on a sales tax for Miami-Dade College in 2009.

In a Feb. 25, 2009, Miami Herald article about House Republicans being against tax increases, Bogdanoff said:

""The average citizen is going to say, 'Don't take money from me, go find it in the budget,' "" she said. ""I don't care if it's a cigarette tax or a liquor tax, it's still a tax.""

While the Senate was exploring a range of options including taxes on cigarettes and beer distributors and raising fees to resolve a $3 billion deficit, Bogdanoff resisted, according to a March 26, 2009, Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article.

""The quick thing to do is just simply raise revenue,"" Bogdanoff was quoted in that article -- and was paraphrased as saying she would resist as long as it takes, even if that led to an overtime session.

""If you come to me and say, 'Do you want to have a longer session or do you want to raise taxes?' I'll take the longer session, "" she said.

In a May 3, 2009, Miami Herald article, she suggested eliminating property taxes altogether:

""What we need to do is . . . start all over again,"" she said. ""If we could figure out how to get rid of property taxes altogether, our economy would be incredibly built."" During that session, she repeatedly fought against a cigarette tax and then voted against it.

A Dec. 18, 2009, Sun-Sentinel Florida Politics blog stated that Bogdanoff said eliminating the corporate income tax was her top priority because it would make Florida attractive for corporations looking to relocate.

A May 2, 2010, profile of her in the Miami Herald stated that during this year's session she successfully negotiated more than $218 million in tax breaks and economic incentives designed to stimulate the Florida economy.

In response to the ad, the Sun-Sentinel Florida Politics blog wrote July 13 that Bogdanoff ""did send public signals to House leadership in 2009 not to send any of the $2.2 billion in higher taxes and fees through her committee. But she did vote for them on the House floor.""

That blog best sums up Bogdanoff's actions: She spoke loudly and clearly that she was against making Floridians pay more -- but ultimately she wanted to be a team player and voted for the budget. Bogdanoff defends her ad because she says it doesn't refer to her votes -- it refers to what she ""said"" in her role as chair of the Finance and Tax Council. We agree that she spoke against tax increases -- but ultimately politicians are judged by their votes. Many observers of her ad could interpret ""I said no to higher taxes and fees"" to mean that she she voted against them. That critical detail, that she voted for some of them, is left out and leaves a different impression. We rate this claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096732C00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/ellyn-bogdanoff/bogdanoff-said-she-was-against-taxes-omits-votes/

Helen Glover says Phoenix is kidnapping capital of Western Hemisphere
","
After Republican congressional candidate John Loughlin returned from a trip to Arizona to get a firsthand look at the illegal immigration problem there, he was a guest on WHJJ's Helen Glover show.

Loughlin told the story of a couple who live in Casa Grande, near Phoenix, who told him that they had stopped going biking because they were afraid of being kidnapped.

""Phoenix is now the kidnapping capital of America,"" Loughlin declared.

Glover agreed, but then insisted that the distinction extended beyond the United States. ""Exactly. Of the Western Hemisphere. Yes. It includes the Western Hemisphere,"" she said.

If you listen to the program you can hear Loughlin hesitate, showing some uncertainty over Glover's emphatic statement.

With good reason.

PolitiFact Texas addressed this issue in detail on June 18 when it examined a claim that Phoenix ""is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world, right behind Mexico City."" It looked at it again when John McCain repeated that claim.

It appears to originate from a Feb. 11, 2009, report from ABC News, which has not responded to a request from PolitiFact to document its assertion. PolitiFact Texas made its own inquiries to determine how Phoenix ranks on a worldwide scale. They were unable to find any hard numbers to back up the claim.

It's clear that Phoenix has a serious kidnapping problem, which the police say is mostly related to illegal border crossings and the drug trade. There were 358 cases reported to the police in 2008, 318 in 2009 and 105 between January and May of this year. To put those numbers in some context, Philadelphia, which is comparable in population, reported just 9 kidnappings in 2009 -- 309 fewer than Phoenix.

There is no easy source for comparable figures from other U.S. cities; kidnapping numbers are not routinely listed on annual FBI crime reports. There is also no reliable source of kidnapping data from foreign countries. But experts from international private security firms said cities in several Western Hemisphere countries, including Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala, have more kidnappings than Phoenix.

Glover took an apparently made up statistic and took it a step further from the facts, making Phoenix the hemisphere's worst for kidnapping.

We emailed Glover late Friday, July 9, and asked for her source. She responded by email the next day, saying she would look for the source and invited us to do a Google search as well. Monday morning, July 12, at 6:22 a.m. she sent another email. ""You are right, I was wrong,"" she responded, and said she was ""remembering wrongly what I had read. According to an ABCNews report from '09, Phoenix is #1 in the U.S. for kidnappings, with Mexico City being #1 in the Western Hem.  Shame on me for remembering wrongly."" (The ABC News article makes no mention of the Western Hemisphere.)

So did Glover take a few seconds to set the record straight for her listeners later that morning? We listened to all three hours of her Monday show, available as a podcast on the WHJJ website. She touched on immigration, but never corrected the record.

So we'll do it for her and give her a False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0D5CC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/helen-glover/helen-glover-says-phoenix-kidnap-capital-western-h/

Ron Paul says U.S. spends $1 trillion on foreign policy
","
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked a political frenzy recently when he alleged that President Obama is responsible for the war in Afghanistan and questioned the prospects of a U.S. victory in the region.

""Keep in mind again, federal candidates, this was a war of Obama's choosing. This was not something that the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in, but it was the president who was trying to be cute by half by building a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be in Afghanistan. Well, if he is such a student of history, has he not understood that you know that's the one thing you don't do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?"" said Steele.

The comments prompted several calls for Steele's resignation among Republicans and conservative pundits.

Steele does, however, have at least one defender: Ron Paul, an outspoken Republican representative from Texas and a former presidential candidate. Asked about the comments in a July 5, 2010, CNN interview, Paul talked about what he sees as widespread public disapproval of the war, including its detrimental financial impact on the U.S. ""We're spending $1 trillion a year on our foreign policy,"" Paul commented.

That caught our attention, so we decided to look into it.

Paul's office sent us an article written by Robert Higgs, a scholar at The Independent Institute, a libertarian-leaning economic research organization.

Higgs argues that looking at how much money goes to the Department of Defense is insufficient. One also has to include the appropriations for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program, the Department of State, the Department of Veterans affairs, and the interest payments attributable to past debt-financed defense spending, among other expenses. Crunching the numbers for 2009, Higgs came up with a total that's slightly over $1 trillion.

We consulted numerous defense budget experts on the issue. They all agreed that it depends largely on how one defines ""foreign policy."" Changing the definition means changing the programs that one includes in the calculation, which impacts the total amount.

Winslow Wheeler from the Center for Defense Information sent us a table which details the ""U.S. security"" expenses for 2010. The total comes out to $1021.3 billion, slightly over $1 trillion. The calculation includes the interest on the Department of Defense Retiree Health Care Fund and on debt-financed defense spending.

Cindy Williams, a principal research scientist at the MIT Security Studies Program told us to check out her presentation on historical U.S. defense and foreign affairs spending trends. Looking at projected spending for the year 2010, summing up national defense programs, homeland security programs, and international affairs initiatives totals $841 billion. Add in the VA budget of $125 billion and we get $966 billion. Williams said that she wouldn't include the interest payments attributable to past debt-financed defense spending in her own analysis, ""since there is no good way to judge whether debt accumulated because we spent too much on security, or because we raised too little in taxes."" 
We also checked with Stephen Donahoe from the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an anti-war lobby. Donahoe told us that their own calculations do not include the entire State Department budget. Still, taking into account Pentagon spending and money that goes into nuclear defense programs, Veterans Affairs, interest payments on defense-related debt, and other related expenses that are scattered throughout the budget, the group arrives at about $1 trillion. The committee acknowledges on its website that the number varies across groups that track defense spending. 
Finally, the folks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget crunched the numbers for us. They came up with a total of $935 billion for the year 2010 and $950 billion for 2011 based on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Those totals include the Department of Defense, overseas contingency operations, the State Department and other international programs, and ""a few other agencies and programs typically included in a 'security' budget.""

Ron Paul claims that the U.S. spends $1 trillion a year on foreign policy. Our experts acknowledged that the figure largely depends on one's definition of ""foreign policy."" Changing the definition means altering the expenses that one includes in the calculation. There was disagreement, for example, on whether to include the interest payments on debt-financed military spending and how to calculate that debt.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096891580>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-spends-1-trillion-foreign-policy/
"['Georgia', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Rob Teilhet']","
Candidate says opponent ""botched"" prosecution of fatal shooting
","
It is certainly the most emotional political ad of this election season. And, perhaps, its most controversial.

A mother claims a prosecutor botched a case in which her unarmed son, Kenneth Walker, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy on a cold roadway in Columbus. The prosecutor was Ken Hodges, now a Democratic candidate for Georgia attorney general. The ad was put together by Rob Teilhet, a Democrat running against Hodges in a bruising campaign for the party's nomination.

""The officer got off because the prosecutor, Ken Hodges, forgot to swear him in; tried to hide the video and refused to reopen the case,"" the victim's mother, Emily Walker of Columbus, said during the 30-second spot.

The ad ends with a final comment from the dead man's mother: ""Mr. Hodges should not be our next attorney general.""

Tough words. But are the claims correct?

Teilhet, a Marietta-based attorney who predominantly deals in workers' compensation cases, thought so. ""Ken Hodges badly botched this investigation and, as a result, justice wasn't done in this case,"" Teilhet said in a telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Teilhet did not speak in the ad.

PolitiFact Georgia received a few e-mails and requests to take a look into whether the Teilhet ad is right.

Let's begin by going back to the night of the shooting, Dec. 10, 2003. Walker and three friends left an apartment complex in Columbus and were riding in a sport utility vehicle on I-185 when it was pulled over by two sets of law enforcement officers. The officials received a tip the men in the vehicle were carrying illegal guns. All four men were pulled from the vehicle. Muscogee County Sheriff's Deputy David Glisson shot Walker twice. No guns or drugs were found in the vehicle. Walker, 39, later died from the gunshot wounds. Glisson said the shooting was an accident.

The shooting drew headlines for many reasons. The victim was unarmed. Glisson is white. Walker was black.

Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker appointed Hodges, then the Dougherty County district attorney, as special prosecutor of the case. Hodges presented his findings before a grand jury of nearly two dozen citizens. The grand jury, which followed standard practice by meeting behind closed doors, voted not to indict anyone in the case.

The NAACP demanded further investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice decided in July 2007 there was insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Glisson, who had been fired after the shooting.

Three years later, the case is back in the news as Hodges and Teilhet duel in a raucous battle to become the state's top prosecutor. The sparring includes who has the endorsement of Andrew Young, the civil rights icon, former U.N. ambassador and Atlanta mayor. (Young has endorsed both candidates.) Teilhet, a former state representative from Cobb County, said he wanted the campaign ad done to examine Hodges' record as a prosecutor.

So let's start with the first claim, ""the officer got off because the prosecutor, Ken Hodges, forgot to swear him in."" Hodges did not swear in Glisson, who gave a statement to the grand jury. Hodges has said he's ""sorry"" he didn't swear in Glisson, but added that it wasn't necessary to validate the shooter's statement. Teilhet argues not swearing in Glisson hurt the public's confidence in the prosecution. The Georgia Legislature passed a bill earlier this year that requires prosecutors to swear in all witnesses.

The second point, Hodges tried to ""hide"" the video of the shooting. Hodges argued in an Oct. 15, 2004, legal brief with the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia and the District Attorneys Association of Georgia against releasing video of the shooting to the news media before any criminal proceedings took place, court records show. The grand jury saw the video several times before the November 2004 decision not to indict Glisson.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A2BC80>],/factchecks/2010/jul/15/rob-teilhet/candidate-says-opponent-botched-prosecution-fatal-/
