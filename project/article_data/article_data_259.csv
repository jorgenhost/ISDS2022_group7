Trump campaign used Cambridge Analytica in final months of campaign
","Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining consultancy, has quickly become the albatross around the necks of Republican political operatives. It is under investigation in the United States and Great Britain for, among other things, allegedly harvesting the personal profiles of 50 million Facebook users. The firm got a national reputation for its work during the 2016 elections with a client list that included the Donald J. Trump for President campaign. A popular promoter of the ""Make America Great Again"" brand on Twitter, Jack Posobiec came to Trump’s defense. ""How many outlets are reporting the fact that (Brad) Parscale and Trump decided to *not* work with Cambridge Analytica during the election,"" Posobiec tweeted March 20. How many outlets are reporting the fact that @Parscale and Trump decided to *not* work with Cambridge Analytica during the election? Parscale is now the head of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. In 2016, he led the Trump campaign’s digital strategy. Cambridge Analytica boasted that it had 5,000 data points on every American, information that allowed hyper-accurate online targeting of voters likely to line up behind Trump. Plenty of skeptics doubt that the company could actually deliver on that promise, but that’s neither here nor there for this fact-check. For us, the key question is whether Cambridge Analytica did no work for the Trump during the election. Posobiec told us he based his tweet on a CBS News article that said the Trump campaign relied on voter files from the Republican National Committee to target voters. The CBS article said: ""The crucial decision was made in late September or early October when Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's digital guru on the 2016 campaign, decided to utilize just the RNC data for the general election and used nothing from that point from Cambridge Analytica or any other data vendor."" So according to the CBS article, the key data used to identify supporters and run the election ground game came from the RNC about a month before Election Day. CBS did not name its source for this point. Posobiec said he was referring to the voter data. But his tweet was more sweeping. It said the campaign did not work with Cambridge Analytica at all. The CBS News report does not go that far. It notes, ""Cambridge Analytica data was used for some targeted digital advertising and a large TV buy, but the main source of ‘get out the vote’ and matching digital outreach data came from the RNC."" Further, Federal Election Commission filings show that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica in September, October and December. Here’s the FEC data:  The final payment in December 2016 for $312,500 is second only to the campaign’s $5 million payment on Sept. 1, 2016. Now, the filings only show when the firm was paid, not when it provided its services. However, well before the current controversy, former Cambridge Analytica staffer Matt Oczkowski and Parscale described for Wired magazine the work the firm did in the final months of the campaign. Oczkowski told Wired, ""The RNC was the voter file of record for the campaign, but we were the intelligence on top of the voter file."" ""Matt Oczkowski and his team created a daily tracker of polling, so that I could see how Trump was doing in key swing states,"" Parscale said. ""They provided that to me daily."" Plus, Parscale said Cambridge Analytica helped with ""persuasion online media buying,"" and ""they created a visualization tool that showed in each state which areas were most persuadable and what those voters care about."" It bears noting that while the Trump campaign didn’t rely on Cambridge Analytica’s voter data for core voter outreach, the firm stayed busy attacking Trump’s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. In the final months of the election, the firm was paid about $850,000 by the Make America Number 1 Super PAC. The group’s self-declared aim was ""to make clear to the American voter the full extent of the untrustworthiness of Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC) by focusing on the corruption of the Clinton Machine and especially the corruption of the Clinton Foundation."" Robert Mercer, a conservative billionaire, was the PAC’s primary financial backer. So, while Cambridge Analytica played a lesser role in its direct work for the Trump campaign, it actively aided Trump’s candidacy in other ways. Posobiec tweeted that ""Trump decided to *not* work with Cambridge Analytica during the election."" There is an element of truth in that the campaign reportedly relied on the RNC’s voter files, and not Cambridge Analytica’s data, to identify likely supporters. However, even the news report behind Posobiec’s tweet said that the firm continued to provide some services to the campaign. FEC filings show the Trump campaign continued to pay Cambridge Analytica through the final months of the campaign, and key operatives from Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign described the firm’s ongoing work.

No, Joe Biden is not running for president with Barack Obama as his vice president
","Rumors have spread suggesting that Joe Biden is not only running for a 2020 presidential bid, but he is planning to do so alongside former president Barack Obama as vice president. ""Biden preparing 2020 presidential bid - with Obama as vice president,"" read the headline on March 15, 2018, on Your News Wire, a hoax website claiming to ""cover the headlines the mainstream outlets shy away from"" on its Facebook page. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Earlier this month, PolitiFact debunked that Biden has confirmed that he is running for president in 2020. The latest story begins by citing a real Politico story regarding Biden’s proposals on how to defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Despite the fact that the Politico article stated, ""Biden hasn’t been actively exploring the presidential options himself, and is far from making any decision about whether he’ll run,"" the Your News Wire article writes that it says that Biden is preparing for his campaign announcement. There is no evidence that is happening. The hoax goes on to say that Biden has chosen Obama -- whom he used to serve under as vice president -- to be his running mate. The story claims that it would be legal under constitutional law for the two to run together, but two-term presidents have traditionally taken an unspoken vow to retire from public life. The 22nd Amendment prohibits a president from being elected for more than two terms, but it does not explicitly mention a former president being elected as vice president. However, the 12th Amendment states that ""no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."" The unspoken vow two-term presidents take is also exaggerated. There is no obligation for a two-term president to stay out of public life. Since he left office, Obama has given public speeches at universities and is working on new books. The article goes on to quote two different real stories from the Hill newspaper, but it only provides a link to one changing the context of the quotes given in different stories regarding speculation of Biden’s bid. Quotes from Biden’s aides about Biden and Obama reclaiming the White House were also made up. When searching for these quotes, the only results we found came from the Your News Wire story.

TRUE: California ranks 49th in per capita housing supply
","Runaway rents and out-of-reach home prices typify California’s housing landscape.   To ease extreme costs, there are politicians who say they’re increasingly focused on boosting supply. Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is one. At a forum on March 8, 2018 in Sacramento, Newsom said California must break down barriers to building because it ranks ""49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production."" We know building homes in California can be a long, expensive process. But does the state really have the second lowest per capita housing supply in the nation? We opened the door on a fact check. Our research Newsom is the frontrunner in a crowded race for California governor. His campaign spokesman told us the statement is supported by an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute: ""A Tool Kit to Close California’s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025."" We found the report — which Newsom cited later in his discussion at the forum — confirms the lieutenant governor’s claim. ""California ranks 49th among the 50 US states for housing units per capita,"" the report said. ""Benchmarked against other states on a housing units per capita basis, California is short about two million units. To satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025."" Johnathan Woetzel, a director at the McKinsey Global Institute, said researchers used 2014 data from the U.S. Census Bureau in their analysis. He said the ranking cited by Newsom compares the ratio of people to housing units in each state. That specific ranking does not measure the pace of housing production over time, as the second part of Newsom’s statement might imply. Woetzel noted, however, that California’s pace of home building has significantly lagged behind other states. The institute is the business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, a worldwide consulting firm. Its report found California had 358 housing units per 1,000 people, much lower than the U.S. average of 419 but slightly ahead of Utah’s 347.  SOURCE: McKinsey Global Institute, ""A Tool Kit to Close California’s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025""  Not a new phenomenon California has long failed to meet its housing needs, according to the report. ""Since the 1970s, the state has added 6.7 million households and 19 million people, but only 6.2 million homes. This means that over a 40-year period, the state added only 325 homes for every 1,000 additional people."" Two outside experts told us the McKinsey report is credible. Carol Galante, professor of affordable housing and urban policy at UC Berkeley, said California’s low ranking ""doesn’t surprise me."" She said California’s housing production is stymied by the state’s complex regulatory system, including the land-use discretion of local governments, combined with the high fees developers must pay and then pass on to buyers. ""The cost of building new housing in California is very expensive,"" Galante said. ""New development has to pay for all of its new infrastructure. That didn’t use to be the case. In the 50s and the 60s and even through the 70s, we had a state system and a federal system that paid for the suburbs to be built through a public infrastructure."" There’s also a problem on the demand side, Galante said, noting that wages aren’t keeping up with the ability to buy new homes. Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, added that Newsom’s statement ""sounds accurate,"" and that the McKinsey report is credible. Michael cited California’s regulatory climate as the biggest factor is slowing housing production. More recent data?  The McKinsey report examined figures from 2014. We couldn’t find more recent data comparing per capita housing units by state. But we did find the total number of housing units produced in California in each year from 2014 through 2016. And based on the totals, it appears California’s rank near the bottom of per capita housing supply is accurate given the relatively slow building pace, at least compared with pre-Great Recession levels. For example, California added 69,000 units in 2014; 68,000 in 2015; and 89,000 in 2016, according to the most recent data available from the California Department of Finance, all while the state’s population increased by roughly 300,000 per year. Those numbers are far less than California’s home building peak of 2005, when 205,000 units were added. ""Before the housing bust, the lowest year on record was 1995, during which just shy of 75,000 units were built,"" notes a report from the California State Association of Counties. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed California ranks ""49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production."" Findings from an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute, using census data from 2014, support Newsom’s statement. Two independent policy experts affirmed the report and its findings showing the wide gap between California’s housing demand and supply.   There’s nothing significant missing from Newsom’s statement.

Has Rebecca Dallet, candidate backed by liberals in Supreme Court race, advocated for policies?
","In a televised debate from Milwaukee between the two remaining Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates, Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is backed by conservatives, attacked Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals. In the March 2, 2018 debate, a month ahead of the April 3, 2018 election, Screnock charged that Dallet ""has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives."" We found in a previous fact check that Dallet had not been as partisan as Madison attorney Tim Burns, who was eliminated in the primary election. But while Dallet generally sticks to stating her ""values"" on key issues, there have been instances where she’s gone further. Values vs positions For this fact check, we’re reviewing eight statements made by Dallet. Regarding the first six, Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy told us Dallet ""has not shied away from talking about her common Wisconsin values of equality, fairness, clean air and water, and good schools. She does not advocate for specific policies to advance these values."" As we’ll see, in the first three statements, Dallet singled out mass incarceration, the environment and fighting ""right-wing special interests"" as issues that she said need to be addressed, though she didn’t advocate for specific policies. 1. I’m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration. 2. Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment. 3. I believe we (Burns and her) share many of the same values, and I hope that we can unite Wisconsinites to fight against right-wing special interests and make our state Supreme Court work for the people again. But in the next three statements in which Dallet talked about her values, she went further. Dallet talked about not making it more difficult to vote, alluding to the debate over whether Wisconsin’s photo ID law makes it more difficult to vote; she attacked the National Rifle Association, which is known for its activism to protect gun-owner rights; and she flatly stated that sales of a particular gun should be outlawed. 4. I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug. 5. That’s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won’t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money? nonramoney.org/voter-pledge #NRABoycott 6. Why do you need that rifle that was used in that (Parkland, Fla.) school shooting? What was it, an AR-15? Who ever needs to fire off that many rounds in a minute? There is no reason for that gun. There is no basis for it. It’s not a gun that should be sold in the United States. I mean, let’s talk about reasonable gun control …. I’m not going to write that law, that’s going to be our legislatures. But we should all -- I mean, I’m a citizen just like everyone else -- we should all write our legislatures, tell them how we think and let them write those laws. Recusal rule On the remaining two statements, Lovejoy told us that when Dallet speaks about changing policy, ""she's referencing the need to update the Supreme Court recusal policy that currently allows sitting justices,"" such as retiring Justice Michael Gableman, ""to remain on cases where a party spent significantly on their behalf in their election."" Here are those Dallet statements: 7. It is the time for women. It’s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights. That statement was made during the concluding remarks of a campaign appearance. Dallet had begun her remarks talking about her experience as a prosecutor and judge, then she talked at length about the importance of the recusal rule, and then she spoke about the experience Screnock and Burns have, before concluding. It could be argued that in making the ""policies we want"" statement, Dallet was echoing her remarks about recusals rather than making a general statement about the need ""get the policies we want."" But in the final statement, from a radio interview, it’s harder to see the argument that Dallet was referring to recusals. 8. All of the values that I talked about -- clean air and water, and equal protection, and women -- are under attack.  And, this is something we all feel and we all relate to. And I'm the candidate that is going to be able to protect those values at this critical time, and there is just too much at stake right now to have someone without the experience needed to advocate for the policies that need to be changed and to make sure to protect those values. Dallet had been asked earlier in the interview about recusals. But she made the statement we cite when asked about about why she featured criticism of President Donald Trump in her first TV campaign ad. Our rating Screnock says Dallet ""has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives."" Dallet frequently says she is merely stating her values, such as equal rights or clean air and water, and often she singles out those issues without advocating for a particular policy position. But on some occasions she has gone beyond that. For example, after citing clean air and water, and equal protection as her values, she pledged to ""advocate for the policies that need to be changed."" And she has advocated for addressing ""mass"" incarceration; increasing voter participation and not allowing the sale of AR-15 guns.

No, it was not an all-female company that built the bridge that collapsed in Florida
","Internet conspiracy theorists have claimed the deadly pedestrian bridge collapse at Florida International University, which killed six, was a consequence of having women lead its construction. A video blogger with the handle Wife With A Purpose titled her 30-minute YouTube video ""Florida Bridge Collapse, All Female Company."" The video is based on an article from the website Squawker that suggests a high number of female employees doomed the construction project to failure. The two companies involved in the construction were FIGG Bridge Group and Munilla Construction Management, though bloggers have focused on MCM as the key culprit. (But as our friends at Snopes point out, this choice is a somewhat ironic considering FIGG’s CEO is a woman.) A visit to MCM’s homepage clearly shows the company is not staffed exclusively by women — not by a long shot. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman. According to MCM’s website, the company is fully owned and managed by five brothers: Raul Munilla, Juan Munilla, Jorge Munilla, Lou Munilla, Fernando Munilla and Pedro Munilla (seen below, from left to right).  As for MCM’s vice president? Its manager of general construction? Or its regional operations director for Texas? All men, too. ""Although the company has several women in very responsible roles, the ownership is made up of the Munilla brothers and their families,"" said Donald Silver, a spokesman for MCM. ""It is so unfortunate that some junk news sites chose to carry unsubstantiated stories that were false and hurtful."" To bolster the flimsy case against women construction workers, the Squawker article places great weight on an interview between an MCM employee and her alma mater, Florida International University. Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM and a 1998 graduation of FIU, was interviewed for an article that would appear on FIU’s website about the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge. ""It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter, because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build, too,"" Flores told FIU in an article that ran March 3, less than two weeks before the March 15 bridge collapse. The Squawker article pointed to Flores’ quote as proof that MCM had allowed senior-ranking female employees to prioritize aesthetics over safety. The Squawker article characterizes Flores’ quote as follows: ""Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters."" But let’s set to one side this rather extreme reading of Flores’ quote. An update to the FIU article issued a day after the bridge collapse clarified that ""Leonor Flores did not work on the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge project in any capacity."" Silver, the MCM spokesman, confirmed Flores was not the project manager on the FIU pedestrian bridge construction project. A video blogger said an all-female construction company built the Florida bridge that collapsed. One of the two companies responsible for building the bridge — and the focus of the conspiracy theory — is MCM, which is owned and managed by five brothers. MCM’s vice president, manager of general construction and its Texas operations director are all men. In fact, the MCM website page that features key personnel does not include a single woman. Furthermore, Leonor Flores, a project executive at MCM, who has figured into the conspiracy theory as something of a scapegoat, had no involvement in FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge, according to her alma mater FIU.

Is the Senate banking bill a big win for Wall Street? Yes and no
","The Senate just passed what may become the first rewrite of the financial reform law that followed the 2008 financial crisis, and lawmakers are sending mixed messages about its contents. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the bill’s biggest critic, described it as a gift to big banks. ""Give me a break,"" Warren said in a floor speech. ""This bill is about goosing the bottom line and executive bonuses at the banks that make up the top one half of 1 percent of banks in this country by size. The very tippy-top."" Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., countered in an interview, ""There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers."" So who’s right? There are a few provisions that affect the big banks, but Heitkamp has a point in saying they’re not as substantial as they may seem. Warren has a point that regulations on big banks could be relaxed, but she downplays the fact that the Federal Reserve will still have substantial powers to rein them in. The financial reform law, called Dodd-Frank after its congressional sponsors, didn’t directly define Wall Street, but it did create regulations for banks of different asset sizes. The largest banks, those deemed ""systemically important,"" were defined as those with assets above $50 billion. Some banks made the case, though, that even though they have more than $50 billion in assets, they’re not really ""big banks."" In an effort to lift the regulatory burden of those credit unions and community banks, the bill raises the threshold to $250 billion in assets. Banks like Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo have well above $250 billion in assets, but experts fear that the little banks exempt from tough regulations aren’t so little anymore. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an architect of the original law, told us that $50 billion had been too low, but $250 billion went overboard. ""My personal view was that it should have been $125 (billion),"" Frank said. ""But the importance of this bill is that it makes no changes to the most important pieces of Dodd-Frank. As far as the larger banks are concerned, they got none of what they were looking for."" Jeremy Kress, a finance professor at the Ross School of Business and a former attorney at the Federal Reserve, agreed that some of the small banks aren’t so small. ""While the affected regional banks, like SunTrust and Fifth Third, may not technically be ‘Wall Street,’ history suggests that banks of this size may be systemically important and should therefore be subject to heightened regulation,"" Kress said. There are provisions in the bill that directly affect banks with over $250 billion in assets. Heitkamp suggests these provisions aren’t substantial. Let’s take a look. Dodd-Frank mandated that banks hold a minimum amount of ready-to-sell assets, like cash or something easily redeemed for cash, which would provide a buffer in the case of a financial meltdown. This bill allows certain municipal bonds to count toward this stockpile. Experts fear these thinly traded, not very liquid bonds will make it easier for the bigger banks to satisfy liquidity requirements while taking on greater risk. The Wall Street Journal reported that provision was championed by Citigroup and other large banks. Dodd-Frank also mandated a ratio of bank asset size to capital (assets minus liabilities), as a safeguard against a financial crisis. This rewrite allows banks that are ""predominantly engaged"" in safeguarding a firm or a person’s financial assets (as opposed to lending) to exclude central bank deposits and be categorized as smaller banks. The definition fits three banks particularly well: the Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust. While not considered Wall Street banks, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street both qualify as global systemically important banks. And interpretation of the language may allow Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, which also perform custodial activities and have combined assets worth $4.4 trillion, to qualify for this exemption. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a 50 percent chance of such an interpretation. Stress tests measure a bank’s ability to weather a potential economic crisis. Under this bill, banks with asset sizes between $50 billion and $100 billion will be exempt from these tests, while banks between $100 billion and $250 billion will be subject to ""periodic,"" as opposed to annual, tests. Critics argue the language will allow the frequency of tests to decrease, although Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it would be the Fed’s intent to have ""meaningful, strong, regular, periodic stress tests"" for this asset size range. The two stress tests mandated by Dodd-Frank and the Federal Reserve carried out by the Fed would remain annual for banks with asset sizes above $250 billion, although stress tests carried out by banks on themselves would change from annual to periodic. One of the more subtle aspects of the bill is that big banks could ask for special consideration called ""tailoring."" The bill language says that the Federal Reserve ""shall,"" rather than ""may,"" tailor its rules based on the size, complexity and ""other risk-related factors"" of the banks. This won’t actually change much, as the Federal Reserve already tailors regulations to different banks. But critics fear mandating tailoring opens a door for Wall Street banks to challenge regulations. ""While tailoring is a laudable goal, ‘risk-related factors’ is a legal landmine,"" Kress said. ""It's the exact statutory language that MetLife cited last year when it won a court order overturning its designation as a systemically important firm."" Heitkamp said, ""There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers."" The bill raises the bar of what is considered a big bank five-fold, which effectively relaxes the standards for large regional banks. Experts warn this also could open a door for bigger Wall Street bank giveaways. The bill also has a few provisions affecting banks above $250 billion in assets. However, the effects would largely depend on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the law. The biggest banks might be able to get relaxed regulations, but then again, they might not. Heitkamp is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2018/mar/20/heidi-heitkamp/senate-banking-bill-win-advantage-wall-street/

No evidence Charleston shooter Dylann Roof raped, beaten in prison
","A fake news item claims Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was sexually and physically assaulted by a prison inmate. The article — with the headline ""Dylann Roof, killer of 14 Charleston church members raped and beaten by inmate"" — quotes the Charleston County sheriff describing the assault in detail. ""According to Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, the assault happened shortly before 8 a.m. as Roof was being escorted to the showers in Housing Unit 1B,"" the article states. But among the many problems with this item: Roof is no longer housed in Charleston. The Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate locator shows that Roof is imprisoned in a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. He was transferred there in April 2017 following his federal death sentence, according to news reports.  Other issues abound in this fake item. The fake post purports to link a to a video — but no such video exists on the site. The headline also misstates the number of victims. (Roof killed nine parishioners, not 14.) A similar fake news item was debunked by our friends at Snopes in 2016. Snopes reported that the phony conspiracy theory about Roof being raped in prison originated in July 2015 on the fake news website NYMeta, and has continued in various forms and outlets since then. There are a couple possible reasons why this hoax persists. For starters, the idea of retribution against Roof may appeal to readers’ desire for justice for one of the deadliest hate crimes in U.S. history. The story’s staying power may also have something to do with the fact it shares some similarities to an actual news story, albeit one with important differences. In August 2016, Roof was reportedly beaten while being held at the Charleston County jail. The assault ""left Roof with minor bruises,"" but there is no evidence that the mass shooter was the victim of sexual assault. The fake news item also claims Roof was assaulted while being escorted to the shower unit. However, the assault against him in August 2016 occurred after an unlocked cell door allowed an inmate to approach Roof. Bloggers said Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison. There are a number of factual errors with this story. Roof has not been housed in Charleston — where the purported assault happened — since April 2017. The item also misstates the number of parishoners Roof killed.

The made-up story said that Ronan died following an on-set accident where she fell 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor while filming her new movie Mary Queen of Scots in the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. But we found that the film was actually filmed in the United Kingdom, across various parts of England and Scotland, and not in St. Lucia.

In Ohio governor's race, Dennis Kucinich misleads about student debt numbers
","Former Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich says that young people look with trepidation toward the future because they can’t afford college. He has promised if elected governor he will make it possible for every young Ohioan to attend a two-year college tuition free. ""The default rate for students 10 years ago was about 40 percent,"" he wrote on his campaign website. But now, the ""default rate approaches 50 percent."" His website also stated ""perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans."" Kucinich is competing in the May 8 Democratic primary for governor. We fact-checked his statistics and found he has a point that student debt is a big problem, but he flubbed some of the numbers about the default rate and then used those to estimate the numbers of Ohioans facing debt. Kucinich’s claim that ""the default rate for students 10 years ago was about 40 percent"" is  based on a credible report, but Kucinich presented the number as a default rate in the past while the report cites that figure as a prediction for the future. A January report by Columbia professor Judith Scott-Clayton for the Brookings Institution analyzed national data on student debt and repayment, released by the U.S. Education Department in October 2017. Scott-Clayton projected that about 40 percent of the students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023, based on patterns of defaults from earlier cohorts. While Kucinich wrote about student debt as a broad problem, the Brookings report said default rates are higher for students who attend for-profit colleges and for students of color. ""The results suggest that diffuse concern with rising levels of average debt is misplaced,"" Scott-Clayton wrote wrote. Scott-Clayton, the author of the Brookings report, told PolitiFact that her projections do not adjust for changes in student composition, institutional choices, or loan characteristics that might relate to the likelihood of default. It is possible the actual rates will be higher or lower. Sandy Baum, who wrote a report for the College Board, sent PolitiFact data showing that the two-year cohort default rate was nowhere near 40 percent in the past couple of decades. The high point in the two-year cohort default rate between 1987 and 2010 was 22.4 percent in 1990. (Default rates are now measured in three-year cohorts.) We found no data to support Kucinich’s claim that the student default rate approaches 50 percent today. The U.S. Education Department released data in 2017 which showed the national default rate for the 2014 cohort was 11.5 percent. (It was 13.6 percent in Ohio.) The Kucinich campaign arrived at the estimated prediction of 800,000 in default based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, which are not borne out by actual data. A Kucinich campaign spokesman said that 14 percent of the national population are federal student loan borrowers, or 44 million. If that same percentage holds true for Ohio, then 1.6 million Ohio residents have federal student loans. Using their estimate that half will default (which we found no data to support) would bring the number to 800,000. We went in search of actual numbers of Ohioans who defaulted. U.S. Education Department state data for the FY 2014 cohort showed that 28,955 Ohio borrowers defaulted, or 13.6 percent Mark Kantrowitz, a national expert on student debt, said that while the 800,000 number isn’t justified, Kucinich has a point about the problem of student debt. ""Generally, the burden of paying for college has shifted from the federal and state government to families because of a failure of government support to keep pace with increases in college costs on a per-student, inflation-adjusted basis,"" he said. ""Since family income has been flat and loans are the only form of aid that has any degree of elasticity, this has driven annual increases in borrowing to pay for college."" Kucinich’s campaign website said the default rate for college students has grown from 40 percent 10 years ago to about 50 percent today, and that ""perhaps as many as 800,000 young Ohioans are facing default on their student loans."" That’s based on a report that predicted that 40 percent of students who entered college in 2004 will default by 2023. So that’s a prediction about the future -- not a default rate for 10 years ago. We found no data to support Kucinich’s claim that about 50 percent of students default today. U.S. Education Department data showed that the default rate nationally for the 2014 cohort was 11.5 percent. Using the 50 percent figure and extrapolating from population numbers, the Kucinich campaign concluded that 800,000 face default on their loans. That figure is not supported by actual data.

No, Barack Obama does not owe $400 million in restitution fees
","Rumors have spread that a fake court ordered former President Barack Obama to pay $400 million in restitution fees back to the American people. ""Court orders Obama to pay $400 million in restitution,"" reads the headline on Daily World Update, a blog site claiming to produce fictitious material and conservative satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article cites the nonexistent West Texas Federal Appeals Court as ordering Obama to repay the $400 million. While there is a federal court serving the Western district of Texas, it is not an appeals court, and there is no official court that matches the name of the one mentioned in the story. The judges named in the fake news article are also made up. They listed Gary Jones, Amanda Perry and Kris Weinshenker as the primary judges who handled the case. When searching for them, we found no results of anyone by these names who serve in legal or judicial practices. The story attributed quotes to the fake judges accusing Obama of having done incomparable economic damage to the United States and evaluating the outcome of the restitution fees. The story claims the $400 million fees come from money that was ""lost"" in an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. We suspect the reference comes from a $400 million payment made to Iran in 2016 for that amount which was part of a $1.7 billion settlement. PolitiFact fact-checked claims that this payment was a ""ransom"" deal when Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States on the same day that the payment was transferred by cash to Iran. The initial $400 million has been owed to Iran since 1979 when Iran purchased American fighter jets which the U.S. didn’t deliver following the Islamic Revolution. The payment is actually part of a $1.7 billion payment, in which an additional $1.3 billion serves as interest. A fake news article claimed that a court ordered Obama to pay the American public $400 million in repayment fees due to an illegal transaction with Iran. The court and its judges were fictitious and the payment was a reference to a legitimate transaction given to Iran that the United States owed in 2016.

Ryan Zinke wrong that Trump proposal would be biggest ever for public lands
","  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said President Donald Trump’s administration has record-setting plans to invest in federal government landholdings. ""The president is a builder and the son of a plumber, as I am,"" Zinke told the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee. ""I look forward to working with the president on restoring America's greatness through a historic investment of our public lands infrastructure. This is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history. Let me repeat that, this is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in the history of this country."" Zinke specified that he was referring to the president's budget proposal, which would create a fund to provide ""up to $18 billion over 10 years for maintenance and improvements in our national parks, our national wildlife refuges, and Bureau of Indian Education funds."" When we took a closer look, we found Zinke’s assertion to be dubious. There is little chance that the Civilian Conservation Corps, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal-era program, will lose its place atop the list of federal programs that have supported public-lands infrastructure. The president’s budget for fiscal year 2019 proposes ""a new Public Lands Infrastructure Fund"" for repairs and improvements at places such as national parks and wildlife refuges. The administration estimates that increased energy development on federal lands and in federal waters ""has the potential to generate up to $18 billion over 10 years for parks and other public lands infrastructure."" However, there is no certainty that the idea will win the necessary congressional approval. It’s common for presidential budget proposals to wither on the vine, even when the president has a Congress controlled by his own party. Also, Zinke said ""up to $18 billion,"" meaning that the final amount could be well below that. Generating any money at all to fill the fund’s coffers would require additional energy development from federal lands and waters. New development seems possible in the Trump era. But the number of new projects will depend heavily on international market conditions for oil and gas, which are currently modest by historical standards. Finally, this doesn’t take into account any cuts to public lands infrastructure that emerge from elsewhere in the administration’s budget. Overall, the proposal would cut the Interior Department by 15 percent. For the sake of this fact-check, let’s assume that the federal government is able to come up with enough new drilling projects to spend the full $18 billion on public lands infrastructure and that it avoids any offsetting maintenance cuts from other parts of the budget. Even in that scenario, Zinke’s proposal pales compared to the investments made under the Civilian Conservation Corps. Members of the Civilian Conservation Corps circa 1933. (National Archives) Roosevelt established the Civilian Conservation Corps in the midst of the Great Depression and just over a month after he was inaugurated in 1933. The program paid unmarried men (and only men) between 18 and 25 years of age to do unskilled labor to conserve and develop natural resources on public lands. Workers received room, board and $30 a month, most of which had to be sent back home to the worker’s family. Some received educational services in the camps, with tens of thousands learning to read for the first time. Among the corps’ achievements were the planting of more than 2 billion trees, the construction of more than 125,000 miles of roads and trails, the creation of more than 6 million erosion control structures, the stringing of 89,000 miles of telephone lines, and 6 million work days fighting forest fires. All told, 3.5 million men took part during the program’s nine years of existence, spread over more than 1,000 constantly shifting camps at any given time. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the CCC was the most groundbreaking program to ever influence our park system at the local, state, and national levels,"" said Neil M. Maher, author of the book Nature’s New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement. The corps ""basically built the infrastructure of our National Park system."" The most frequent estimate of the program’s cost is a cumulative $3 billion in outlays during its nine-year life. From our research, this figure appears to be credible. The CCC’s director wrote in 1939 that it had cost $2 billion; that was two-thirds of the way through the program’s life. And according to a Park Service study, the annual annual cost per CCC enrollee was $1,004 per year. If you assume that the average tenure of the CCC’s 3.5 million workers was about a year, that would produce a cumulative cost around $3 billion. Such calculations ""sound right — millions of young men, camps to house them, food and uniforms, and they were paid,"" said Steven Stoll, an environmental historian at Fordham University. Once you factor in inflation, $3 billion spent in the 1930s would be the equivalent of about $53 billion today — about three times bigger than even the fully funded Trump proposal. The CCC’s investment appears even more massive when viewed as a percentage of federal spending. During the 1930s, when federal outlays were more modest, the CCC’s $3 billion investment accounted for just over 4 percent of all federal outlays that were made over the program’s nine-year period. By contrast, the fully funded Trump proposal would account for somewhere around four ten-thousandths of 1 percent of federal outlays during its 10-year life. Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift pointed out that the CCC ""also incorporated state and local land."" It’s true that the CCC created more than 700 state parks and upgraded many others, in addition to its efforts on federally owned land. Ultimately, though, the point is moot: Zinke didn’t say the proposal is the largest investment in federal lands infrastructure. He said ""public lands infrastructure,"" and state and local parks count as ""public lands."" Zinke said that a Trump administration proposal for the Interior Department ""is the largest investment in our public lands infrastructure in our nation's history."" It’s far from assured that the maximum figure of $18 billion in the proposal will ever be reached if enacted. Beyond that, though, Roosevelt’s $3 billion investment in the Civilian Conservation Corps would amount to $53 billion today, and it accounted for vastly more than the Trump proposal as a percentage of federal spending at the time.

Conor Lamb's rejection of corporate PAC money needs context
","When Democrat Conor Lamb took the stage inside a Canonsburg ballroom brimming with supporters and news media on election night, he claimed victory in what amounted to one of the massive political upsets of the Trump Era. And he was clear that they’d managed this feat not with the financial backing of corporations, but with a grassroots network and a slew of small-money contributions.   ""I'm proud that you helped me refuse corporate PAC money,"" he said to applause.   Lamb ran to fill Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district seat, which was vacated by former U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican, late last year. The New York Times and Democrats have called the race for Lamb, though absentee and provisional ballots were still being counted as of Friday, with Lamb leading his Republican opponent, state Rep. Rick Saccone, by hundreds of votes. The darkhorse Democratic candidate raised millions in mostly small, online donations during the campaign — up to 62 percent of them from not just outside of the 18th district, but from outside of the state.    But is it true that corporate PAC money played no role in his campaign? According to the Federal Election Commission, Lamb received 99 ""discrete PAC contributions"" from a total of 81 different PACs. Some of those PACs contributed multiple times. No corporate PAC contributions were reported by his campaign committee, per the FEC. Instead, many of these PACs belong to unions; veterans groups; advocacy groups, such as the JStreet PAC, a self-described ""political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans""; and a host of Democratic leadership groups.   ""He mainly received money from labor PACs and Democratic leadership PACs,"" said Andrew Mayersohn, a committees researcher with the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Labor PACs, obviously, don’t receive money from corporate PACs. Leadership PACs do (usually) take corporate PAC contributions, but I doubt that Lamb will feel indebted to Comcast just because Comcast's PAC gave to [U.S. Rep] Mike Doyle’s leadership PAC last year, and Doyle gave to Lamb’s campaign this year. More likely, he’ll feel indebted to Mike Doyle,"" Mayersohn said. Adam Bonin, a Philadelphia lawyer specializing in political law compliance and advocacy, said the difference between accepting money from a corporate PAC and a PAC that has received corporate funds — or funds from corporate executives and employees — is significant. ""When people refer to corporate PACs, what they mean are PACs established by corporations and funded by their employees with officers and directors who decide where the funds are directed,"" Bonin said. In Lamb’s case, donations of $200 or less accounted for half of the money — millions of dollars in total — raised by his campaign, according to Anne Feldman, press secretary for End Citizens United, a prominent backer of his campaign.   But there were also donations from PACs reliant on support from executives and employees — and their relatives — at some of America’s largest companies and conglomerates.   This includes Massachusetts Sen. Joe Kennedy III’s 4MA leadership PAC, which counts individuals with ties to Goldman Sachs, Ford Motor Company, Home Depot and a slew of pharmaceutical companies among its Top 20 contributors, per OpenSecrets.org and the Center for Responsive Politics, the group behind the site.   The Keystone Fund PAC, U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle’s political action committee, also donated to Lamb and has top donors with connections to T-Mobile, Comcast, Exelon and Google. Sen. Bob Casey’s Keystone America PAC, another Lamb contributor, has Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, Johnson & Johnson and Ernst & Young in its Top 20. There’s also AmeriPAC: The Fund for a Greater America, a Lamb donor with contributors tied to Coca-Cola and Boeing, OpenSecrets.org reports. Each of these PACs donated the maximum of $5,000 to Lamb’s campaign. ""We group those [individual] contributions with corporate PACs when we talk about industry giving. For example, PNC Bank's PAC and PNC executives are ultimately part of the financial industry's political influence,"" Mayersohn said of OpenSecret.org’s lists of top PAC donors. ""Since most people work for a corporation of some kind, it's pretty hard for a campaign to avoid taking contributions from ‘corporate employees or owners.’ Lamb received some contributions from PNC employees, but would not have accepted money from their PAC (if asked)."" Feldman added: ""When you're accepting money from a non-corporate PAC, it comes from hundreds, often thousands, of people who are concerned about issues that affect their day-to-day lives. This is very different from accepting money from corporate PACs which have a singular agenda, the corporation’s bottom line."" (Of course there is the potential for overlap between corporate interests and the interests of non-corporate PACs.)   Corporate executives and employees are also capable of donating — with legal limits — to Lamb directly, which some certainly did. Bruce Ledewitz, a constitutional law professor at Duquesne University, said this is neither unusual nor improper. ""The question is if a rich person gives money to Donald Trump knowing Trump favors lower taxes, is that undue influence? And I say no, it is not,"" Ledewitz explained. ""I don’t think there’s the slightest indication that campaign contributions have any influence at all. Lobbying has influence.""   Mayersohn said there were also no corporate PAC expenditures on mailers or ads in support of Lamb’s candidacy. ""Corporate PACs almost never make independent expenditures,"" he said. ""Sometimes trade association or industry PACs (like the American Chemistry Council or the National Association of Realtors) make independent expenditures, but not in this race."" While some argue that the shunning of corporate PACs by political candidates is largely an empty gesture, groups like End Citizens United tout the Lamb campaign’s lack of corporate PAC donors as a breath of fresh air. Lamb campaign manager Abby Murphy also said Lamb will again refuse corporate PAC money when he runs in November, this time in the what would be the new 17th Congressional District under a statewide redistricting plan. U.S. Congressional candidate Conor Lamb said, ""I'm proud that you helped me refuse corporate PAC money."" FEC records do not list corporate PACs as having donated to his campaign or having directly spent money in support of his candidacy. While it’s possible corporate PAC money donated to other PACs reached him indirectly, experts say that’s not the same thing.   Lamb’s claim is literally accurate, but campaign finances are complicated and voters need additional information.",/factchecks/2018/mar/17/conor-lamb/conor-lambs-rejection-corporate-pac-money-needs-co/

Facebook post incorrectly says 7,182 students were killed in U.S. schools since 2012
","Thousands of pairs of shoes dotted the lawn of the U.S. Capitol this week, prompting photos and media coverage about what it meant. Global activist group Avaaz set up the demonstration of 7,000 pairs of shoes on March 13 to represent child deaths from gun violence since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Many major news outlets including CNN and USA Today shared striking images of the shoes, but some Internet bloggers were confused about what the shoes really symbolized. Take, for example, Equality House, one of many blogs that shared this post on their Facebook page: The image says that shoes on the Capitol lawn represent 7,182 students ""killed in U.S. schools since 2012."" (The image offers a comparison to deaths from overseas wars since 2001, which is a safer estimate.) But that’s the wrong interpretation. It’s been more than five years since Sandy Hook, so the display featured 7,000 pairs of shoes. That total includes children who are killed at home, in neighborhoods, and by suicide. Far fewer children have been killed in schools. The estimate for 7,000 child gun deaths traces back to a June 2017 study by Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed journal. It found that 1,300 children die from gunshot wounds every year. The study looked at children from birth to 17 years of age. The Avaaz news release stated that the shoes symbolize the children who have been killed by all gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting, not children killed in U.S. schools. There isn’t one uniform way of tracking school shootings and deaths, but no matter which what you look at it, the 7,000-figure isn't accurate. The New York Times published an analysis of the number of people who have been shot in school shootings on Feb. 15, the day after the Parkland school shootings. Using data from the Gun Violence Archive, the Times found that 138 people have been killed in school shootings since Sandy Hook. That total includes school personnel who are not students, so the number of students would be even smaller. The Gun Violence Archive defines a school shooting as an incident that occurs on the property of an elementary, secondary or college campus and only included incidents in which people were injured or killed. So, even if you count all of the other instances of a student being killed on a school campus (for which there is no official count) it’s likely it would not come anywhere near 7,182.  Equality House, for its part, noted the difference between the image and the way Avaaz described it in the caption of its post. But the group still circulated the flawed information and did not delete it.  Bloggers said shoes on the Capitol lawn this week represented 7,182 students killed in U.S. schools since 2012. That’s not accurate. The pairs of shoes symbolized more than 7,000 children who had been killed by gun violence since the Sandy Hook school shooting. The number of children killed in school violence, while fluid, is certainly smaller than that total.

Hillary Clinton says by 2006, Americans 'were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War'
","In her recently published memoir Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton acknowledges that ""she got it wrong"" when she voted to authorize the Iraq War in 2003. As Iraq once again becomes a big news story, as Islamic militants take over large portions of the country’s north and threaten the capital in Baghdad, we thought it would be worth checking one of Clinton’s claims about the American public’s perceptions of the Iraq War. In the seventh chapter of her memoir, Clinton writes that, ""by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war."" Is that correct? We looked at polling data about the war between 2003 and 2006, archived at PollingReport.com. (Here are the ones that fit the criteria for this fact-check.) Initially, Americans felt favorably about the war. While the wording changes somewhat from poll to poll, the level of support for the war was usually at or above two-thirds in mid- March 2003, right before the war began. That month, support hit 70 percent in a Newsweek poll, 64 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and 71 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. In the first few weeks after the attack was launched, support levels went as high as 77 percent in CBS News and Los Angeles Times polls, 78 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll and 81 percent in a Fox News poll. However, as the war continued, support began to soften. Eventually, support turned negative in some polls. By mid-May 2004 -- a little over a year after the start of the war -- Time and CNN asked, ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling the situation in Iraq?"" and found 44 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval. The numbers were similar when the pollsters asked, ""In general, do you approve or disapprove of current military policy in Iraq?"" Even the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll -- which as late as June 2004 found support at 60 percent -- found by February 2005 that a plurality of respondents, 49 percent, said going to war was the ""wrong thing"" to have done, compared to 46 percent who said it was the ""right thing."" Disapproval of Bush’s handling of the war reached 58 percent in August 2005 in an Associated Press/Ipsos poll, and it remained roughly the same in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in February 2006 and a CNN poll in May 2006. Finally, in the second half of 2006, opposition the war began to hit 2-to-1 margins over support for the war. In July 2006, when CBS and the New York Times asked, ""Do you think the result of the war with Iraq was worth the loss of American life and other costs of attacking Iraq, or not?"" 63 percent said it was not worth it, compared to just 30 percent who said it was worth it. Then, in November 2006, Time asked about approval of Bush’s handling of Iraq and found 65 percent disapproval and only 31 percent approval. Disapproval continued to rise slightly into 2007. AP found 68 percent disapproval of Bush’s handling of Iraq in January 2007, and CNN/Opinion Research Corporation found 69 percent. So the polling generally tracks with time timeline Clinton offered. The only question is whether disapproval rates in the low-to-mid 60 percent range qualifies as ""overwhelming."" We were a little skeptical, so we asked some polling experts. ""That is an awfully subjective call,"" said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll and co-founder of Pollster.com. ""I’d be surprised if there were any consensus where that line falls."" Mark Blumenthal, the senior polling editor of the Huffington Post and the founding editor of Pollster.com, said the use of ""overwhelming"" strikes him as subjective, and depends on the context. ""What seems like an 'overwhelming' victory margin in a competitive electoral contest might not seem quite as 'overwhelming' in the context of attitudes about a particular policy issue,"" he said. ""I’d guess I’d be OK with 2-to-1 for the former, but 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 for the latter."" Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Clinton, emailed us to say, ""In public opinion, if you’re talking about 50-percent-plus opposition on an issue, I think most people would call that ‘overwhelming.’"" Vietor added that ""the 2006 elections, which went massively in the Democrats’ favor, were viewed as a response to the war."" Our ruling  Clinton said that, ""by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war."" Polling data shows that roughly 65 percent of the public opposed the war by the second half of 2006, but while that qualifies as strong opposition, the definition of ""overwhelming"" within the polling profession is more uncertain. On balance, we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True. UPDATE, June 20, 2014, 11:45 am: This article has been updated to include a response from Clinton's staff received after the story was published.",/factchecks/2014/jun/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2006-americans-were-overwhelm/

Dan Patrick has called illegal immigration an invasion and said immigrants bring 'Third-World diseases'
","A claim about Dan Patrick by an organizer for Battleground Texas, the pro-Democratic group, rang a bell. In a June 10, 2014, interview on Bloomberg TV, Jeremy Bird said Patrick, the Houston state senator who dusted incumbent David Dewhurst in the May 2014 primary runoff for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination, has ""called immigration into Texas an invasion"" and ""said immigrants coming into Texas bring ‘third-world diseases.’ "" We looked into whether Patrick made these statements and, if so, whether facts backed them up. Patrick: ‘Stop the invasion’ Patrick, championing his desire to secure the Texas-Mexico border, has often called to stop ""the invasion,"" referring to individuals who cross the border without legal documentation. Spokeswoman Lynda Tran of Battleground Texas noted by email, Patrick has an undated online post in which he asks supporters to donate ""if you agree we must stop the illegal invasion!"" According to a January 2014 news story in the Dallas Morning News, Patrick and another GOP aspirant blasted Dewhurst in a Jan. 27 debate for not doing more to secure the Texas border from illegal immigration. ""The first question is to stop the invasion,"" Patrick said. ""Until you secure the border, you cannot address any other issues."" It wasn’t a new cry. A Feb. 24, 2006, Texas Observer story described Patrick, then waging his first Senate campaign, as blaming illegal immigrants for a rising crime rate, overcrowded schools, an overburdened health-care system and runaway growth in the state budget.  ""The number one problem we are facing,"" the Observer quoted Patrick as saying, ""is the silent invasion of the border. We are being overrun. It is imperiling our safety."" More recently, Patrick shelved such language. A June 7, 2014, Texas Tribune news story said Patrick didn’t use the ""invasion"" term at that week’s Republican Party of Texas convention. Instead, the story said, he called on Republicans to reach out to Hispanic voters by telling them ""that we stand with them for the future of their family"" and that only the GOP would work to secure their communities. U.S. Border Patrol figures show its apprehensions of individuals crossing the country’s southern border declined 69 percent from a little over 1 million in the fiscal year running through September 2006 to nearly 328,000 five years later. But such apprehensions bumped up 27 percent, to 414,397,as of  two years later, in fiscal 2013, the agency says. Since 2011, there’s been a surge in people from countries other than Mexico, including many minors from Central America. ‘They are bringing Third World diseases’ The Observer story revealed Patrick’s claims about disease along the border, saying Patrick characterized illegal immigrants as walking pathogens. ""They are bringing Third World diseases with them,"" Patrick said, citing ""tuberculosis, malaria, polio and leprosy."" But the story quoted a physician, identified as Tim Metz, the top epidemiologist at the Texas Department of State Health Services, as saying there wasn’t a known case of polio in the Western Hemisphere when Patrick spoke ""and we haven't seen it in decades."" According to the Observer, Metz said malaria, a tropical disease spread by the anopheline mosquito, is easily treated and remains ""a rare disease in Texas and not a huge problem."" Leprosy, he said, is known today as Hansen's disease and ""we have no more than 50 cases a year that are reported, but it's not on the rise."" As for TB, the physician told the Observer, ""we'll have 1,500 or so cases in Texas this year, which might be a slight increase, but we've got very effective TB-control programs in every local health department in the state."" For our part, we didn’t identify anyone by the name of Tim Metz. When we asked the Texas Department of State Health Services for guidance, spokesman Chris Van Deusen said by email that Tom Betz (not Tim Metz) was at one time the manager of the agency’s Infectious Disease Surveillance and Epidemiology branch. Van Deusen didn’t directly speak to what Patrick reportedly said in 2006, but he indicated immigrants aren’t showing up as bringing most of the diseases listed by Patrick. Polio, Van Deusen said,  has been eradicated from the Western hemisphere and ""we don’t generally see cases in Texas. Van Deusen said about 100 cases of malaria are annually reported in the state. All are imported, he said, and it’s not spread person to person in Texas. ""It’s generally related to travel, either people from here visiting parts of the world where malaria is endemic or people from abroad visiting the U.S., rather than immigration,"" he said. Cases of Hansen’s disease -- or what has been called leprosy -- are reported, Van Deusen said, with one third related to armadillos; one third tied to ""old European families that have a genetic susceptibility;"" and one third ""related to immigration from areas of the world where the disease is more common, irrespective of the type of immigration."" In April 2014, Patrick suggested critics distort what he said in 2006. Patrick bridled after San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro said to him in an immigration debate aired by Univision and posted online by the Texas Tribune: ""You have talked about undocumented immigrants bringing third-world diseases including leprosy and polio to Texas. You have said that we’re seeing an illegal invasion from Mexico."" Patrick shot back that his comment about disease in 2006 was based on information distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control indicating tuberculosis cases were up nationally and in Texas, ""particularly along the Texas-Mexico border--and those cases were coming from Latin America,"" Patrick said. A 2012 CDC tuberculosis fact sheet states the disease had decreased in prevalence nationally. Some 9,945 TB cases (an average of 3.2 cases per 100,000 persons) were reported, the sheet says, and the 2012 count was the lowest since national reporting of TB commenced in 1953. Still, Texas, California and Florida were among a few states with an average number of cases exceeding the national average, according to a map with the fact sheet. Van Deusen said about half the state’s decreasing number of TB cases show up in residents born abroad. ""TB often crops up in immigrant populations because of the nature of the disease where a person can be exposed to the bacteria but not develop active disease for many, many years,"" he wrote. ""In fact, the vast majority of people who get the tuberculosis bacteria in their body will never go on to develop active TB disease because their immune systems will keep the bacteria in check."" In the Univision debate, Patrick said he’d previously mentioned leprosy because the World Health Organization reported that from 2010 to 2012, cases increased in Mexico and the U.S. An online search led us to a WHO chart indicating U.S. cases of leprosy increased from 169 in 2010 to 168 in 2011 to 173 in 2012 with cases in Mexico going from 211 in 2010 up to 216 in 2011 and down to 215 in 2012. We asked Patrick’s campaign about Battleground Texas’s claim and the reports that Patrick described and didn’t hear back. Our ruling The Battleground Texas activist said Patrick has ""called immigration into Texas an invasion"" and Patrick has ""said immigrants coming into Texas bring ‘third-world diseases.’"" This year and earlier, Patrick referred to illegal immigration as an invasion that he wants to stopper. In 2006, he was quoted as saying illegal immigrants bring third-world diseases to the state. Both claims have weaknesses, but we're not judging Patrick's veracity here. The Democratic group's statement is True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Sen. Erin Lynch says 35 is the average age for people earning the minimum wage
","On Wednesday, the General Assembly passed legislation that would raise the state's minimum wage from $8 per hour to $9 per hour beginning next year. It now awaits the governor's signature. During the debate in the Senate June 11, the chief sponsor, Sen. Erin Lynch, a Warwick Democrat, said, ""One of the other pieces of opposition that's always raised relative to minimum wage is that it's mostly teenagers working part time that are making the minimum wage."" Critics say ""we're putting an onerous policy on small business owners or other business owners,"" she said. ""The reality is that the average age of the minimum wage worker is 35 years old."" We wondered: Is the typical minimum wage worker really 35? It turns out that Lynch isn't the first to make that claim. President Obama made the statement during a April 26, 2014, radio address that called for hiking the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. When PolitiFact National checked the statement in April, it concluded that it was Mostly False. Here's why. The source of Mr. Obama's statistic was a study from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that promotes policies to help low- and middle-income workers. But the statistic didn't apply to the current minimum wage, which is $8 in Rhode Island and $7.25 nationally. It applied to people earning less than $11.10 per hour. In other words, the average age of workers making up to $11.10 is 35. After we left a message asking Lynch if she was using additional information, Senate spokesman Greg Pare sent us a three-page infographic from the Rhode Island AFL-CIO that makes the same claim. It cites the misquoted Economic Policy Institute paper as one source. John F. Killoy III, director of communications, mobilization, and research for the union organization, also referred us to a report from the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research. It also found the average age to be 35, but it looked at people earning as much as $10 per hour which is, once again, well above the state and federal minimums. Those two reports were used, Killoy said, ""because there is very little data on minimum wage workers in Rhode Island and national data on minimum wage workers does not give the best picture because the Rhode Island minimum wage has consistently been higher than the federal minimum."" In fact, the average age can be a misleading statistic, and choosing it skews the average age of the group receiving the minimum wage. For example, when a bad economy sends more 70- and 80-year-olds to jobs at WalMart, the average age increases dramatically.  You can see the skewing in the Center for Economic Policy report, where the average age of a low-wage earner is 34.9 years but 57.8 percent of them are younger than 35. So what's the median age of a worker earning the minimum wage? To quote PolitiFact National, ""In reality, the statistics on this specific point are murky. A different study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 71 percent of minimum-wage workers are YOUNGER than 30 -- a starkly different picture of low-wage workers."" According to the data on Table 7 of the BLS report, 50 percent of the 3.3 million workers earning minimum wage were age 24 and younger. That would put the median age for people receiving the minimum at or near 24 years old. ""But the BLS study has an important limitation,"" as PolitiFact National noted. ""It looked only at workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below, so it doesn’t include workers from any of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that have enacted higher state minimum wages."" In the end, Lynch was relying on an AFL-CIO fact sheet that took data on low-wage workers and mischaracterized it as data on minimum wage workers. That distinction is important. The evidence, including data from the two reports cited by the AFL-CIO, suggests that the actual age of the typical person now earning minimum wage is significantly lower than 35. Clearly a lot of people earning the minimum wage are not teenagers. That's the kernel of truth in Lynch's statement. But she seems so far off, we rate her assertion Mostly False.

GOP overreaches with claim on Deal and education
","Education has become a key battleground issue in Georgia’s race for governor. Republicans are touting what they see as Gov. Nathan Deal’s accomplishments. Democrats are hammering what they see as Deal’s shortcomings. State GOP leaders weighed in June 4 in a  press release when they said this: ""Even when all other state agencies took cuts, Gov. Nathan Deal increased education spending."" Deal’s rival, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter, has kept up his attacks on the issue. ""The single biggest failure of Georgia’s current leadership -- and the biggest drain on our economy -- is the dismantling of our education system,"" his campaign website says. A recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau ranks Georgia 40th in the nation in state revenue dedicated to education. It’s also a hot topic with voters and is the state’s single largest investment (54 percent of Deal’s proposed 2015 state budget was dedicated to education). That’s why the Truth-O-Meter has looked at claims about state education funding and continues to do so. In January, the governor received a Half True for stating that education funding had increased by more than $930 million during his administration. He was counting in that $930 million a $547 million increase that he was proposing but that lawmakers had not approved. His staff acknowledged the misstep. Now we’ll look at the state GOP’s claim, which we’ll tackle in two parts: 1). Did education spending increase every year during Deal’s administration, which began in January 2011? 2). At the same time, did all other state agencies see their budgets cut? A quick look at the numbers, which we obtained from state records and confirmed with the state’s budget chief, Teresa MacCartney, shows the answer to Question 1 is Yes.   Fiscal year State education funds No. of students State spending per student 2012 $7,075,837,688 1,656,992 $4,270 2013 $7,326,807,956 1,679,589 $4,362 2014 $7,545,391,349 1,700,688 $4,436 2015 $7,944,481,675 1,700,688 $4,671 *2012, 2013, 2014 are from budgets that were amended at midyear. The 2015 budget year starts July 1 and ends June 30, 2015. That’s an increase of $868,643,987 -- or $402 per student. The biggest chunk -- about $399 million -- is effective for fiscal 2015, which begins July 1. (When the governor says that he’s added more than $930 million in funding for education, he’s now looking at pre-kindergarten through post-secondary, excluding capital education projects, MacCartney said. Collectively, that spending rose from $10,395,466,168 to $11,326,106,772, or 8.95 percent, she said.) To get the whole picture, though, there’s a couple of things to take into consideration. Enrollment growth, rising health care costs and pension expenses were the biggest drivers in the education budget increases. (Since 2012, public school enrollment grew by 43,696 students.) Secondly, school systems are still living with austerity cuts that began in 2003 and have persisted. As a result, many school systems have been forced to furlough teachers and staff, increase class sizes and compress their school years into fewer days. (About 80 percent of school districts were furloughing teachers in the 2013-2014 school year, many for five or more days, according to a 2013 survey by the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.) Deal is reducing the austerity cut to education for the first time for the coming school year to about $746 million after five years in which the cut topped $1 billion a year. On Question 2: We asked Ryan Mahoney, spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party, for evidence of the accuracy of the claim that all other state agencies had budget cuts each year in Deal’s tenure. He referred us to MacCartney. MacCartney confirmed what our research showed: It’s an overreach to say all other departments had budget cuts each year. ""Most state agencies did receive cuts in their budgets,"" MacCartney said. ""Of course, we had a few exceptions due to federal entitlement programs that we could not go below a federal MOE (memorandum of understanding or agreement)."" She went on to explain that there were other reasons why some agencies’ budgets weren’t cut. For example, the state has a constitutional requirement to fund debt service and always funds its pensions. The state also required fewer cuts of the state Department of Corrections, MacCartney said. In our research, we found more than two dozen state agencies that saw budget increases in one or more years in Deal’s tenure, including the Department of Corrections, which saw its budget grow by $186 million. In summary, the state Republican Party is correct to say Deal increased spending for education every year since taking office. But it’s also important to know that while austerity cuts to schools are being reduced in the coming year by Deal, they still persist. It was a huge overreach to say that the state Department of Education was uniquely spared from budget cuts in Deal’s tenure. Other agencies also saw increases, so that part of the statement is incorrect. Overall, there is some truth to the statement, but it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate the GOP statement as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/20/GaGOP/gop-overstating-deals-record-education/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Sports', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Are there immigrants on the 2014 U.S. Men's World Cup team?
","The United States is officially overcome with World Cup fever, and its inhabitants are showing support for the red, white and blue in many ways. Of course, for congressmen and women it means backing America with their thumbs by tweeting pro-U.S.A. rally cries to their followers and constituents. While the quadrennial event has generally united Democrats and Republicans, not all the social media cheering was free of politics. After the United States’ thrilling 2-1 victory on June 16, 2014, over Ghana, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an immigration reform push by invoking the U.S. Men’s National Team. She tweeted: ""Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them. #TimeIsNow."" By Thursday evening, it had been retweeted and favorited almost 1,000 times. The below picture was included:  As you can see, the graphic shows 11 U.S. players with minuses next to their pictures and names. Pelosi’s tweet reads that those 11 players are immigrants who would likely not be on the roster if they weren’t allowed in the country. Much has been made about the number of United States players who have dual citizenships, but is the U.S. World Cup team powered by immigrants? We went through the roster and researched the backgrounds of the 11 players highlighted in the graphic. Six of the players were actually born in America. So even though they may have parents who are from other countries, they are very much considered citizens, not immigrants. Jozy Altidore: Born in Livingston, N.J., to two Haitian-born parents. Alejandro Bedoya: Born in Englewood, N.J., to two Colombian-born parents Julian Green: Born in Tampa, Fla., to an American serviceman father and a German mother; moved to Germany with his mother as a young child. Tim Howard: Born in New Brunswick, N.J., to an African-American father and his Hungarian mother. Aron Johannsson: Born in Mobile, Ala., to Icelandic parents. Omar Gonzalez: Born in Dallas, Texas, to Mexican parents. The other five were not born in the United States but have at least one parent who is an American. (In four of the cases, their fathers were in the United States military serving abroad.) That entitles them to all to U.S. citizenship, meaning they did not have to go through the immigration process noncitizens do. John Brooks: Born in Berlin, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother. Timmy Chandler: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother. Mix Diskerud: Born in Oslo, Norway, to a Norwegian father and an American mother. Fabian Johnson: Born in Munich, Germany, to an American serviceman father a German-born mother who had an American father. Jermaine Jones: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and German mother. So not only are none of these 11 individuals considered immigrants by the United States, they're all actually natural born citizens. Pelosi’s office told us the source of the graphic is a story posted on Business Insider from Global Post. The story noted that a number of far-right nationalist parties with anti-foreigner sentiments seem to be on the rise in Europe. Some countries are also considering anti-immigration legislation that would put stricter quotas on new inhabitants. Therefore, the author wanted to imagine what these teams would look like without immigrants. To do this, he singled out players with at least one foreign-born parent. As Vox’s Dara Lind points out, ""That might make sense for other countries, where parentage is more important to citizenship. But it doesn't make any sense for the U.S., where nearly everyone has some sort of immigrant heritage, and where everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth."" Basically, in some countries, it doesn’t matter if you were born there; citizenship is more closely tied to lineage. That’s not the case in America, one of a small number of countries that grants citizenship at birth. We took all of this to Pelosi’s office. Spokesman Drew Hammill said they weren’t claiming these players were immigrants, rather, ""We’re merely echoing the point made by the creators of the graphic about the contributions of these sons of immigrants."" But not even all of the foreign-born parents are actually immigrants. Timmy Chandler, for example, stayed in Germany with his German mother after he was born. So by no definition is the United States represented by immigrants at the World Cup in Brazil. That’s not to say immigrants or immigration aren’t important to the makeup and heritage of the team. The United States is a country built on immigrants, and every player on the team can trace back at least half their lineage to another country (there is one half Native American on the team, forward Chris Wondolowski). But that’s not the message Pelosi was trying to give with her tweet. If it was, you could have whited out the entire team. Our ruling In a tweet pushing immigration reform, Pelosi posted a picture of the U.S. Men’s National Team missing 11 of its players and tweeted ""Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them."" In this instance ""them"" means immigrants. But none of those 11 players are immigrants. Some aren’t even the children of immigrants.

Fox's Pirro: Obama set ISIS leader free in 2009
","The march of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, across a swath of Iraq has fractured a nation and spurred Republican attacks that the Obama administration is on the verge of ""snatching defeat from the jaws of victory."" Fox News host Jeanine Pirro tied President Barack Obama to the roots of the current assault. On June 14, Pirro offered listeners this insight into the ISIS leader. (ISIS is also called ISIL, for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.) ""The head of this band of savages is a man named Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the new Osama Bin Laden,"" Pirro said. ""A man released by Obama in 2009, who started ISIS a year later. And when Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers saying, ‘I’ll see you in New York.’ "" A reader wanted to know if Obama actually released Baghdadi, and we decided to look into it. Whatever the truth, the assertion has gained traction. For the president’s critics this fits with their disdain for the recent prisoner swap that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders who had been kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Red State, a conservative blog, used the Baghdadi connection to talk about Obama’s ""catch-and-release"" policy. We have two elements to verify. Was Baghdadi in U.S. custody in 2009 and did Obama have a direct connection to his release? We’ll deal with them in order. Will the real Abu Bakr al Baghdadi please stand up There have been several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others --  that place Baghdadi at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn’t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. ""I’m not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I’m a little surprised it was him,"" King said. ""He was a bad dude, but he wasn’t the worst of the worst."" In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. However, when PunditFact asked the Defense Department to confirm the story, officials there said Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. ""Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as ‘Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’ was held as a ‘civilian internee’ by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. ""He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended ‘unconditional release’ of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time."" In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads ISIS was released in 2004, long before Obama took office, and was not recaptured. ABC News also has questioned King’s recollection, citing a ""a U.S. official"" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. ""I could be mistaken,"" King told ABC News, ""but I’m 99 percent. He’s a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with … His face is very familiar."" King declined to comment to PunditFact. A troubled detention policy If Baghdadi wasn’t in American custody in 2009 as Defense Department officials say, then there’s no way Obama could be to blame. But even if he was, the link between the ISIS leader and the American president are flimsy because the framework was set in in 2008 while George W. Bush was president. A little backstory. By July 2005, the United States had four detention facilities -- two near Baghdad, one in the northeastern corner of the country, and Camp Bucca in the far southeastern corner near the Kuwait border. The entire operation was known as Task Force 134. In the course of the war, some 80,000 people passed through these centers, according to the Defense Department. A Pentagon-commissioned study by RAND, a private policy analysis group, described a system that struggled with competing expectations. The incoming population was a mix of captured Sunni and Shiite militants, people rounded up in military raids and ordinary criminals. At times, a blend of overcrowding and sectarian animosities led to riots. The RAND study also said the 2007 ""surge"" -- the addition of 20,000 new troops into Iraq to quell spreading unrest -- pushed detainee levels to over 25,000 people. From 2007-08, Navy Captain Brian J. Bill served as the legal adviser to Detainee Operations for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. Bill described the process of vetting inmates in the U.S. Naval War College journal, International Law Studies. The military established nine review boards, working six days a week, to hear 20 cases each day. Bill reported that when the boards first began they released about 25 percent of the individuals who came before them. Later, that rose to 40 percent. The end of the detention policy At the end Bush’s second term in 2008, American and Iraqi negotiators moved toward getting the United States out of the business of holding large numbers of Iraqis. Robert Chesney, professor of international security law at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither side wanted to see the network of detention centers continue. ""Its demise reflected a deliberate policy choice by the United States and Iraq to phase out that system and to rely instead on the Iraqi criminal justice system as the sole mechanism for detention going forward,"" Chesney wrote in 2011. That goal became part of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, signed in November 2008. Under that agreement the United States agreed to ""turn over custody of such wanted detainees to Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all the remaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner."" The United States continued to hold about 200 prisoners judged to pose the greatest risk. They were what remained from a group that numbered about 14,000 at the start of 2009. ""Aside from the so-called ‘Deck of Cards’ detainees held at Camp Cropper (the top leaders in Saddam Hussein’s government), it’s hard to imagine how anyone in Washington would have any interest in who we held or released,"" Bill told PunditFact. ""By the end of 2009, it’s hard to imagine how we could have continued to hold anyone if the Iraqis themselves didn’t decide to detain them."" Our ruling Pirro said that Obama released the current head of ISIS from government custody in 2009. The Defense Department said that the man now known as Baghdadi was released in 2004. The evidence that Baghdadi was still in custody in 2009 appears to be the recollection of an Army colonel who said Baghdadi’s ""face is very familiar."" Even if the colonel is right, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis who released him some time later. But more important, the legal contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee was signed during the Bush administration. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi and there is no evidence that he was on anyone’s radar screen, assuming that he was in custody at all in 2009. The U.S.-Iraq agreement drove the release of thousands of detainees in 2009, but Obama had nothing to do with that. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/19/jeanine-pirro/foxs-pirro-obama-set-isis-leader-free-2009/

Rush Limbaugh reaches with claim that Obama canceled Washington Redskins' name
","The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the trademark registration of the Washington Redskins June 18 because it disparages American Indians, marking the latest but not the last development in a decades-old battle over the NFL team’s name. Should supporters of the team’s name blame Obama? That’s who conservative radio pundit Rush Limbaugh singled out on his popular radio show. Limbaugh says President Barack Obama audaciously, whimsically canceled the trademark in a show of political power and out of hyperpolitical correctness. ""This is not the Patent and Trademark Office. This is Barack Obama,"" Limbaugh said, according to a transcript of his June 18 show. ""... All this stuff is coming out of the executive branch. All of this, well, tyranny. It's all coming from the executive branch, and Obama owns the executive branch."" At best, that’s an unproven conspiracy theory. We’ll walk you through it. Background about the ruling The ruling does not mean the team has to change its name. The team will keep its trademark registrations throughout the appeals process. If the ruling is upheld and the team loses, the team can still use the name ""Redskins"" but it could lose the legal rights of having a trademark, such as the federal government blocking counterfeit goods with its logo. There's also a possibility it could retain its ""common law"" rights without the federal trademark based on how long it has been used. Team attorneys played down the significance of the June 18 decision by highlighting the same trademark board’s 1999 ruling that also ""canceled"" the team’s name after an earlier challenge. The team won on appeal. Meanwhile, the trademark agency has not allowed trademarks with the term ""Redskins"" about a dozen times since 1992, when the earlier case was filed, because it ""may"" disparage American Indians, the Associated Press reported. Obama’s fingerprints The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is an independent administrative tribunal -- an identity it stressed in media materials announcing the decision. It operates within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which is a division of the Department of Commerce. The Commerce secretary, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office director and deputy director are presidential appointees that serve at his pleasure. From there, the Commerce secretary chooses the board’s 21 judges with input from the Patent and Trademark Office director. The chief judge, currently Judge Gerard F. Rogers, picks judges to preside over specific cases. In the Redskins matter, Rogers picked veteran judges because the case was viewed as setting a binding precedent for the board in similar cases, said Patrick Ross, Patent and Trademark Office deputy chief communications officer. The judges do not get terms or lifetime appointments. But they can’t be fired willy-nilly. They work like other civil service employees, not political appointees, and must be fired for cause. Like umbrella agencies for thousands of administrative judges around the country, the director and deputy director cannot tell the judges how to rule in a certain case. So, as in all things in Washington, politics plays some role. But the administrative law system is set up to try to remove politics as much as possible by creating barriers between the work of the judges and the politics of the bosses serving layers above them. Obama did wade into the debate last year, saying he would ""think about changing"" the team’s name if he were the owner in an October Associated Press interview ""I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things,"" Obama said. About the judges and their role Obama’s comments, plus the letter to team owner Dan Snyder signed by 50 U.S. Democratic senators, did draw politics into the fracas. But did that pressure interfere with an otherwise impartial decision? ""There’s no evidence for that,"" said Elizabeth Rowe, University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. ""There is no room for that in the way the system is set up."" The office makes hundreds of decisions a year and operates independently of the White House, she said. The decisions are made based on specific rules from Congress and legal interpretations from various courts’ decisions and precedents in intellectual property cases. And importantly, none of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed while Obama was in office. All three took their seat during the terms of President George W. Bush. Judge Karen Kuhlke was appointed May 1, 2005. Judge Peter Cataldo was appointed May 14, 2006. And Judge Marc Bergsman was appointed Nov. 13, 2006. Bergsman dissented with Kuhlke and Cataldo in this case, arguing the trademark should not be canceled because the plaintiffs failed to show that a ""substantial composite"" of American Indians find the team’s name offensive and that its evidence was essentially a ""database dump"" that proved little. Kuhlke and Cataldo, on the other hand, found the trademarks were disparaging to Native Americans at the time they were registered, and the five people who brought it forth had standing because they were members of Native American tribes. As we noted earlier, judges in the same administrative court issued the same finding in 1999, before it was overturned on appeal.

Vouchers take $3 billion out of public schools, Nan Rich says
","While Gov. Rick Scott has portrayed himself as a champion of public education spending, he has overseen an expansion of a voucher program that hurts public schools, says former state Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston. And she also hurls some blame at Scott’s predecessors, including her Democratic rival Charlie Crist. ""The education reform that started under Jeb Bush, it continued under Charlie Crist and now has gone to a new level with Rick Scott. That includes a bill that just passed the last day of this session -- a bad day for public education, folks -- $3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers,"" Rich said on May 10 in remarks to the Orange County Voters League. (Rejoice Magazine posted video of her remarks online.) We decided to fact-check Rich’s claim that $3 billion from public schools will go to vouchers during the next five years. Bill expanded eligibility for tax credits this session Rich called it a voucher progam; it actually works through a tax credit. Regardless of the specifics, opponents say it sends funding to private -- mostly religious -- schools and undermines the public school system. Supporters say that the money provides poor children, including many minorities, a deserved escape from underperforming public schools. Here’s how it works: In 2001 under Gov. Jeb Bush, the state established the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program to give scholarships to poor children to attend private schools. The program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax credits for corporations that give money to organizations that give the scholarships. (Both Scott and Crist, the Democratic primary frontrunner, are supporters of the program.) About 60,000 students have scholarships for the 2013-14 school year, and the maximum amount per student is $4,880. During the session, Republican lawmakers proposed allowing more children to get the scholarships. A watered-down version of the bill, Senate 850, passed on May 2, the last day of session. (It passed the Senate 29-11 and the House 70-44, largely along party lines with many Democrats voting against it.) Lawmakers expanded eligibility by allowing a family of four earning up to $62,010 a year to receive a partial scholarship. The previous limit was about $44,000. Scott has until June 28, 2014, to sign the law. A spokesman for Scott wouldn’t indicate if he will sign it, but Scott has generally been supportive of school choice. Do tax credits take money out of public schools? Rich arrived at the $3 billion figure by pointing to a chart from Fund Education Now, a group that opposes the tax credits. The chart shows that before this session, the tax credit program was on a path to add up to about $2.9 billion over the next five years. Though the chart doesn’t reflect the bill that ultimately passed, the program could add up to that amount over five years. But does that money get taken out of our public schools, as Rich suggests? Rich and other tax credit opponents argue that if Florida had no such tax credit program, those revenues would go into the state’s general fund, which pays for education and other services. ""It’s money that could be, should be, by all rights put into the general fund and could be used to invest in public schools,"" said Kathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now. ""They are diverting it."" Not so, say supporters of tax credits -- for two reasons: • If the tax credit program didn’t exist, the money would go toward state general revenues. There is no evidence that the Legislature would then decide to direct those dollars to public schools. (State economist Amy Baker backs up that point in an email to PolitiFact Florida: ""These numbers refer only to the revenue side of the state’s fiscal picture and don’t reflect what the Legislature may or may not spend"" for public schools.) • Tax credits can save the state money because a single voucher is less expensive than what the state spends per child in public schools. ""State education spending for students who receive scholarships is reduced by more than the amount of revenue lost,"" states a 2008 study by Florida’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. The study noted that it is difficult to pinpoint the precise savings but estimated that in 2007-08, for every dollar lost in corporate income tax revenue, taxpayers saved $1.49 in state education funding. A later update estimated that the state saved about $36 million in 2008-09. We sent a summary of the arguments to two education professors who are experts on tax credits: David Figlio at Northwestern University and Kevin Welner at the University of Colorado. Both said it’s not as simple as Rich declared. ""The answer to this is a little bit complicated. It is definitely true that, overall, taxpayers save money with this program, at least under the scenario that has been operating to date. The tax credits that the state provides are considerably smaller per student than the public obligation would be to these students were they attending public schools,"" Figlio told PolitiFact Florida. However, it’s hard to pinpoint the amount of savings because some students would have attended private schools anyway. Now that the raised the income eligibility limits opens up the program to more families, it’s likely that more will get scholarships that would have found a way to pay for private school regardless. Welner told PolitiFact Florida that ""there clearly is an attempt here to shift resources from public to private schools."" However, the $3 billion figure is just half the ledger. Our ruling Rich said that ""$3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers."" There's not $3 billion in funding that's being removed from a public schools budget and put into a voucher program budget. Instead, Rich was referring to the state’s Tax Credit Scholarship Program, which gives corporations tax credits when they give money to allow poor students to attend private schools. Based on the program’s size, it’s possible that it could fund a voucher program in the ballpark of $3 billion over the next five years. But there’s no guarantee that money would otherwise have gone to public schools. And, private school vouchers tend to cost less than what it costs to educate a child in public schools, which complicates how much money taxpayers would pay if the children in private schools instead went to public schools. That’s even more true now that the state raised the income eligibility requirements this year. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/19/nan-rich/vouchers-take-3-billion-out-public-schools-nan-ric/

Did Republican Senate candidate Tillis cut $500 million from the North Carolina education budget?
","North Carolina ranks near the bottom of the list when it comes to education spending per pupil. Democrats have seized on state education funding as a way to attack Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis. A recent television ad sponsored by Women Vote directs blame for education cuts at Tillis, current speaker of the house in the Republican-controlled North Carolina House of Representatives. Women Vote is an arm of EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports Democratic women who are in favor of abortion rights. ""Speaker Thom Tillis cut almost $500 million from education, causing crowded classrooms and forcing teachers to pay out-of-pocket for school supplies, while Tillis protected tax breaks for yachts and jets,"" the ad said. Tillis is running against incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan, whose campaign has also used the $500 million figure -- as have numerous media reports. We wondered if Tillis is responsible for such cuts. Where did the cuts come from? When we looked at North Carolina's education budget year to year, it has increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011. According to a document prepared by the General Assembly, the state education budget was $10.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year and $11.5 billion for 2014-15. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation and include both K-12 and higher education spending.) Additionally, state expenditure per pupil for K-12 has increased since 2011 -- from $5,156 in 2011 to $5,395 in 2013. Education spending in North Carolina comes from a combination of federal, state and local dollars. State funding accounts for more than 62 percent of expenditures. So did Women Vote pull that $500 million cut out of thin air? No, but it's complicated. Each year, the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management creates a continuation budget, which is a tool that outlines how much should be spent to maintain the current service level, without cutting or adding services. The projection might be larger or smaller than previous years because it takes into account factors such as inflation, population growth and operating new facilities. Lawmakers are not obliged to match the continuation budget. For the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of about $23.6 billion for those two years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget that state lawmakers passed came up to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $481 million less than the the continuation budget suggested. (EMILY's List and Hagan's campaign pointed us to this when we asked about the ad.) That shortfall ended up dividing the political parties in North Carolina: Last year, Tillis took to the floor to push lawmakers to pass the budget, while Democrats bashed the bill primarily because they believed the education allocations weren't adequate. The bill passed 65-53 in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, with no Democratic votes in favor. It’s important to note that the Legislature’s choosing to fund at levels lower than the continuation budget is not a literal budget cut. In raw dollars, the state is spending more money than in previous years. However, Tillis’ critics say it has the same effect as a cut. ""If you’re not doing what it takes to maintain the status quo, it’s a cut,"" said Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner. Some other critics of Tillis’ education record have noted that state funding for K-12 education in North Carolina is about $500 million less than pre-recession levels. In the 2013-14 school year, public school spending was about $7.9 billion. In 2008-2009, it was $8.4, when adjusted for inflation. The budget affecting the 2014-15 school year eliminated 5,200 teachers, 3,800 teacher assistants and about $115 million for textbooks and instructional supplies, among other services, said Philip Price, CFO for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. It also increases student-teacher ratios. The budget added a small number of new programs, but the vast majority of state education spending growth over the years comes down to rising healthcare and retirement costs. ""That doesn’t help the students,"" Price said. ""It doesn’t mean you get more teachers. It doesn’t change what is available to that classroom."" Reductions in federal and local education spending -- as well as funding shifts due to rising charter school popularity -- could also be a major reason why schools feel as if their funds have shrunk, despite a steadily increasing state budget, said Terry Stoops, director of research and education policy at the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina think tank that promotes limited government. He added that between 2010 and 2013, federal funding to North Carolina schools dropped by $337.6 million. But when the federal government stopped giving North Carolina schools stimulus funding, the state did not pick up the slack, Price said. The state's shrinking spending on classroom services is part of a trend that has been going on since the recession -- back to when Democrats controlled the General Assembly -- and can't be solely blamed on one speaker of the house, he added. A final note: The ad also claims that Tillis preserved tax breaks for yachts and jets. That refers to a Republican-backed tax bill passed in 2013, under Tillis' leadership. The bill preserved a $1,500 cap on sales tax for yachts and jets. Our ruling An ad attacking Tillis said he ""cut almost $500 million from education."" Literally, the ad is wrong. As North Carolina's Speaker of the House, Tillis helped pass a budget in 2013 that increased actual spending on education in comparison to previous years. But the budget spent almost $500 million less than what was requested to maintain the status quo, accounting for inflation and increased costs of various services. Additionally, the actual budget increase had a lot to do with rising costs of employee benefits, and not a lot to do with money that ends up in the classroom.

Only 3 of NATO's 28 members spend what they promised on defense, Rep. Paul Ryan says
","Two days before President Barack Obama announced he would consider military options for halting a violent Islamic insurgency in Iraq, former vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan gave a speech on foreign policy. The Wisconsin Republican and House Budget Committee chairman, known primarily for his work on domestic issues, argued for a buildup of the U.S. military. And he suggested that America’s allies need to do more. Speaking June 11, 2014 at a Center for a New American Security conference in Washington, D.C., Ryan said that ""the fight against terrorism is global in scope.  And we can’t fight it alone. We need partners."" He added: ""We have to work better with all of our allies, all around the world. In Western Europe, we have to strike a balance. Our friends can’t depend on us for all of their defense needs and we can’t dictate to them all of their defense policies. Every member of NATO has pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us."" NATO has 28 members. With tensions rising in Iraq, the Ukraine and elsewhere, is it true that only three NATO countries spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense? NATO's evolution The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949, largely to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. There were 12 founding members, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The new allies agreed that ""an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all"" and that following such an attack, each would take ""such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."" From 2004 through 2011, NATO provided training in Iraq, helping the country develop its armed forces. More recently there has been a focus on the Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. About a week before Ryan gave his speech, NATO's top official said the alliance would finalize a package to modernize Ukraine's armed forces following Russia's annexation of the ex-Soviet republic's Crimea territory. The alliance is heavily dependent on the United States. According to NATO’s latest annual report, for 2013, U.S. defense expenditures accounted for nearly three-fourths of all NATO member defense expenditures: United States -- 73 percent United Kingdom -- 6.6 percent France -- 4.9 percent Germany -- 4.7 percent Since 2007, the U.S. share has increased, from 68 percent, while the overall share from European members has decreased. Ryan’s claim To back Ryan’s claim, his office cited the 2013 annual report. It notes that NATO members ""have collectively agreed to two guidelines to help encourage an equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities."" One of the guidelines, or goals, as the report also calls it, is that members ""should devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense."" Only the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece met the 2 percent goal in 2013, the report says. But newer NATO figures, released in February 2014, show that a fourth member -- Estonia -- also met the 2 percent benchmark: NATO member Amount spent on defense Percentage of gross domestic product spent on defense United States $735.2 billion 4.4 United Kingdom $60.3 billion 2.4 Greece $5.67 billion 2.3 Estonia $479 million 2 The day before Ryan gave his speech, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called for European allies to increase their defense spending, noting that since Estonia had met the 2 percent goal, he expected other nations could also do so. The fact that only four NATO members had met that mark had also been noted previously by news media including the New York Times and Reuters. Our rating Ryan said all 28 members of NATO have ""pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us."" Ryan neglected to count a fourth member, Estonia. But that oversight doesn’t negate his larger point, which is that few NATO countries meet the 2 percent benchmark. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Rick Perry correct that record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at border
","Questioning the flow of unaccompanied Central American children across the Texas-Mexico border, Gov. Rick Perry declared he has yet to hear from President Barack Obama or his administration to a 2012 letter urging attention to the matter. Perry went on to say on ""Fox & Friends"" June 17, 2014: ""We have record-high numbers of ‘other than Mexicans’ being apprehended at the border. These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations."" Both of those claims drew our interest, though for this story, we’re tackling only Perry’s statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are being apprehended at the border. We’ll check his reference to people coming from ""states like Syria"" in another article. The increased flow of children from Central American nations has attracted attention, in part, Douglas Massey, a Princeton University professor, suggested this month, because fewer Mexicans are being detained near the border than any year since 1971. An online U.S. Border Patrol chart shows about 265,000 Mexicans were caught near the border in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That was up 3,000 from the year before, according to the chart, but down at least 15,000 compared to any of the previous dozen years. News reports suggest multiple factors in this surge including a contrast: The Border Patrol routinely and quickly returns immigrants from Mexico across the Rio Grande; that's not an option for handling individuals from distant countries like El Salvador and Honduras. So, have non-Mexican detentions at the border reached a record level? To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry drew his conclusion about a record being set from information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety. We turned to the Border Patrol for numbers. The federal agency posted an online chart indicating its officers apprehended 153,055 people from countries ""other than Mexico"" in the fiscal year that ran through September 2013. That’s more than in any of the seven previous years. That chart shows, though, that 165,170 ""other than Mexicans"" were apprehended in fiscal 2005. The numbers include all Border Patrol regions, including the northern border with Canada and coastal boundaries. Every year, though, the vast majority of such apprehensions occur in the agency’s Southwest Border region, running from San Diego to the tip of Texas. And what about the South Texas portions of the border that have received attention recently? The chart shows nearly 115,000 apprehensions from countries other than Mexico in the agency’s Laredo and Rio Grande Valley sectors in fiscal 2013, which outpaced the previous high of 100,647 in fiscal 2005. Tighter focus: The 96,829 ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector in 2013 was 21 percent greater than the sector’s previous high (at least since fiscal 2000) of 79,854 such apprehensions in 2005. By telephone, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, brought us up to speed on ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions from October 2013 through May 2014, or the first eight months of fiscal 2014. In that period, he said, there were 165,729 such apprehensions nationally, including 162,749 in the Southwest region, counting what would be a 15-year high of 122,071 (and counting) in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Separately, analyst Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank focused on reduced immigration, emailed us its chart demonstrating a surge since early 2011 in ""other than Mexico"" apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley sector:    We asked Smith if for history’s sake, we should try to gauge apprehensions before 2000, the earliest year on the Border Patrol’s chart. Smith said there weren’t more such apprehensions any year before 2000. Our own brief look for older data led us to a Sept. 22, 2005, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service indicating fewer people from countries other than Mexico were apprehended in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Finally: The number of unaccompanied children being picked up also has been record-setting, according to a June 4, 2014, New York Times news story. ""Since Oct. 1, a record 47,017 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwest United States border,"" the story said, ""most traveling from Central America, part of a larger wave that includes some youngsters accompanied by their parents and some traveling alone."" The story said that according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that 47,017 total is ""nearly twice as high as all of the last fiscal year (24,493 apprehensions), with four months yet to go in the current fiscal year."" And, a June 5, 2014, Times news story said, an internal draft Homeland Security document projects unaccompanied-minor apprehensions rising to 90,000 in the current fiscal year, running through September 2014. Peter Boogaard, a Homeland Security spokesman, told the paper the draft document was not official policy and had not been finalized or circulated. Our ruling Perry said a record number of immigrants not from Mexico are ""being apprehended at the border."" We didn’t come up with apprehension figures for every year through history. But available figures show the Border Patrol apprehended more people from countries other than Mexico along the border through the first eight months of fiscal 2014 than it apprehended in any of the preceding 17 years.

Do Oregon school districts spend more on local food than any other state in the country?
","Several themes have converged in recent years to increase attention on local food production: a desire to reduce carbon footprints, to combat childhood obesity and to increase ""food security,"" among others. Flourishing farmers markets around the state -- they’ve grown from a dozen in 1988 to more than 160 -- indicate that Oregon embraces eating food produced close to home. And so does the amount individual districts are spending on local food for school lunches, according to the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The claim: A first-ever national ""census"" tracking farm-to-school food results revealed a surprising statistic, according to a department news release: ""The assessment shows that Oregon school districts are directing 24 percent of their food budgets to purchase local foods,"" the release said. ""That’s the highest percentage in the country. We decided to check. The analysis: We emailed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm-to-School program to get a complete copy of the census, then fielded a call from Deborah Kane, the program’s national director. Kane said she was tapped two years ago to implement a newly created farm-to-school program. The effort, she said, stemmed from the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which provided a congressional mandate to encourage schools to buy food from local producers and processors. To establish baseline information, questionnaires were sent last spring to the nation’s more than 13,000 public school districts, said Kane, a Portland resident who most recently worked as vice president of food and farms at Ecotrust. About 10,000 districts responded. Kane directed us to Page 20 of the USDA Farm to School Census. Oregon, at 24 percent, ranks first in the ""average percent of school food budget spent on local food."" Just behind is Utah at 23 percent. Nevada is last, having apparently spent so little that it fell somewhere between zero and 0.9 percent. ""Local,"" by the way, is defined in Oregon as foods grown and/or processed anywhere within the state. Other states have their own definitions, which range from foods grown within 25 miles of a school to foods produced in the region. Additional figures from the census are interesting, as well. In terms of dollars spent on local food by schools, California’s $51.2 million is at the top. Oregon’s $9.5 million is 13th, with Nevada again bringing up the rear. In checking Oregon’s 24 percent figure, however, we spotted a couple of snags. One, of the 197 public school districts in the state, only 123, or about 62.4 percent, chose to respond to the survey. Of those 123 respondents, 82, or about two-thirds, reporting having active farm-to-school programs. The 82 participating districts in Oregon represent about 714 individual schools with an estimated 366,066 students, according to the census. So the information about the amount Oregon districts spend for local food comes from slightly less than 42 percent of the state’s public school districts. Second, all of the data are self-reported. Neither the state Education Department nor the Agriculture Department tracks statewide figures for the amount of money individual districts spend on locally sourced food. The other states also self-reported their data, but with widely varying definitions of what constitutes ""local.""  As a result, what appears in the state Agriculture Department’s news release as an indisputable fact appears far less reliable than stated. Oregon has spent time and money to make the program successful. It’s the only state to create farm-to-school coordinators in both the agriculture and education departments. A pilot program launched in 2011 grants about $1.2 million in every two-year budget cycle to schools to buy local food, and the program provides money to bring farmers into classrooms and to pay for school field trips to farms. But that sheds little light on the total amount Oregon schools spend on local food. The ruling: The Oregon Department of Agriculture, in underscoring the benefits of local food production, put out a news release saying Oregon school districts devote 24 percent of their food budgets to buying local food, the best rate in the nation. The release based its claim on the first USDA Farm to School Census, a collection of self-reported data from 10,000 of the country’s 13,000 public school districts. Among the many pages of information was one showing Oregon at the top in terms of percentages. All of the data, however, are self-reported, and state officials acknowledged that they have no way to verify the numbers. Districts also defined ""local"" in widely different ways, making comparisons difficult. Further, fewer than half of Oregon public school districts responded to the census, leaving the numbers incomplete. The claim contains elements of accuracy but leaves out important details that could lead to a different conclusion.

Does Obama have a 'dog-trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense'?
","Readers recently forwarded us an email that’s been making the rounds for several years. Because it appears to have returned to heavy rotation, we decided to do a few fact checks from among its dozens of claims, all of which are critical of President Barack Obama. Here, we’ll check the claim that Obama is paying a pretty penny in taxpayer money -- specifically $102,000 a year -- to keep a dog trainer on retainer. The White House didn't respond to our inquiry, but we were able to piece the story together on our own. Presidents have a long history of family pets, dating all the way back to George Washington, who kept dogs, horses and even a parrot. During his presidency, Theodore Roosevelt housed enough animals to run a small petting zoo on the south lawn, including 13 horses, six dogs, several cats, and even such exotic animals as a zebra. The Obama White House is certainly pet-friendly, but a little more tame: The Obamas have two Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., gave Bo as a gift to the Obamas in 2009 (fulfilling one of the newly inaugurated president’s campaign promises), and Sunny joined in August 2013. It’s obvious that the family adores Bo, but do they spend more than $100,000 per year to have a dog handler at their beck and call? Suggestions that the Obamas were spending lavishly on Bo circulated at least as far back as 2010. That’s when bloggers claimed that Bo had flown solo to Maine in a private jet when the family took a trip there, based on an article in a local newspaper, the Morning Sentinel, which had reported that Bo had arrived ""in a small jet before the Obamas"" along with ""the president's personal aide, Reggie Love."" We and others debunked the claim that Bo flew on his own airplane. In reality, the airport in Waterville, Maine, could not accommodate Obama’s usual airplane, so Obama and his staff flew into a different airport on separate jets, one of which carried several members of Obama’s presidential staff and Bo. The Sentinel later issued a correction: ""Today's story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas' dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers."" But this wasn’t enough to stop pieces of the rumor from morphing into another outrageous claim about Bo. Some of these rumors focused on Love, who holds a job known informally as the presidential ""body man"" -- a position that combines aspects of scheduler, valet, and conversational partner. Love began to work for Obama in 2006 and served as the president’s personal aide from 2009 until 2011. That meant that he was at Obama’s side almost constantly. Because the Morning Sentinel listed Love as Bo’s one and only traveling companion, some bloggers incorrectly assumed (or willfully spread the fiction) that his job was ""dog trainer."" Meanwhile, a 2011 report to Congress confirmed that Love was paid $102,000 a year. Love’s salary matches that listed in the chain email. But Love was far from a dog trainer. His job was to provide any necessary personal assistance and arrangements for the leader of the Free World. The notion that Obama was keeping a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year is nonsense. In tracking Bo’s history, we did find references to one trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, who trained the dog before his introduction to the presidential lifestyle. Sylvia-Stasiewicz was known for training dogs who lived among Washington’s politicians, including Kennedy’s family, who took Bo to her before giving the dog to the Obamas. According to the Washington Post, the Kennedy’s worked with Sylvia-Stasiewicz to determine ""whether the dog would be suitable for a very busy family with two young daughters."" By her own admission, Sylvia-Stasiewicz was unaware that the dogs’ final destination would be the White House. However, according to the ""Annual Reports to Congress on White House Staff,"" she was never paid by the Obama administration. Our Ruling The chain email said that ""Obama is the first president to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense."" The claim stitches together a few pieces of accurate information in a way that makes them inaccurate. A dog trainer, Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz, has been associated with Bo, but she was used briefly and was never paid by the administration. Meanwhile, Reggie Love was an Obama aide who earned $102,000, but to the extent that dog handling took any of his time, it was a small fraction of his total duties, and ""dog handler"" certainly wasn’t his title.

","As turmoil breaks out in Iraq two and a half years after U.S. troops left the country, are Westerners — including Americans — flocking there to help extremists in the fight? That’s a case made by Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Committee on Intelligence, during a June 15, 2014 appearance On Fox News Sunday. Rogers had this exchange with host Chris Wallace. Rogers: ""This is as dangerous as it gets. Why? We have thousands of Westerners and Americans in both the eastern Syria and Iraq who have Western passports. This is like —"" Wallace: ""You're talking about members of ISIS?"" Rogers: ""Well, they're showing up to fight extremists, and so some are —"" Wallace: ""With the extremists?"" Rogers: ""Exactly."" Wallace: ""Yes."" Rogers: ""They're fighting with Al-Nusra in Syria or ISIS, and they will go with winners. So, this is what's so dangerous."" Rogers went on to note that the first case of an American suicide bomber in Syria occured in May. It sounded to us like Rogers claimed there are thousands of Westerners and Americans in Syria and Iraq fighting with extremists. His office confirmed that’s what he meant. It’s an alarming statistic, and one we decided to verify. The movement of thousands of foreign fighters into Syria to join the fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime was listed as a ""Key Terrorism Trend of 2013"" on the State Department’s annual terrorism report. Many of them in recent weeks have since moved into Iraq, where groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, have now taken a large swath of the country.  Experts told us that conflicts in Muslim and Arab countries have often drawn fighters from across the world, including the Afghan-Soviet War and the Bosnian War. But the conflict in Syria has seen an infusion of foreign fighters to a much greater degree than past conflicts, said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution. ""We’ve never seen anything on the scale or magnitude like this,"" Riedel said. ""In the 1980s, a lot of the foreign volunteers went for relatively short period of time and it was more a photo-op than anything else. This time, they’re all fighting."" Those not familiar with the ongoing civil war in Syria might wonder why the United States would care that Westerners are joining the fight against Assad. Assad is a brutal dictator, and President Barack Obama has called on him to step down. While there are some moderate forces in Syria fighting to oust Assad, there are also other militant groups like ISIS, which have more extreme jihadist and anti-American views, as well as links to terrorist groups like al-Qaida.  Is it possible some of these foreign fighters are there to help more moderate forces defeat Assad? Some are, Riedel said, but ""the majority of foreign volunteers are ending up joining or working with extremist groups like ISIS. They’re gravitating to the most extreme groups."" Rogers’ office could not elaborate further on the number of Westerners fighting in those conflicts. Similarly, a spokesman for Rogers’ counterpart on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., confirmed that the committee was briefed that there were a large number of Westerners, and some Americans, fighting in Syria, but he could not provide exact figures. Instead, we were directed to the U.S. government’s National Counterterrorism Center. In March, Director Matthew Olsen warned that a growing force of foreign fighters in Syria was becoming a major concern. ""European governments estimate that more than 1,000 Westerners have traveled to join the fight against the Assad regime,"" Olsen said. ""Dozens of Americans from a variety of backgrounds and locations in the United States have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria but to date we have not identified an organized recruitment effort targeting Americans."" So, 1,000 is not ""thousands."" But perhaps other estimates are higher. The International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King’s College London has studied this issue extensively, collecting information from 1,500 sources to put together a tally. As of December 2013, the center estimated there were upto 11,000 individuals from 74 countries in Syria — nearly double its April 2013 estimate. Between 600 and 1,900 of those are from Western Europe. Additionally, about 32 to 305 fighters hail from Australia and Canada. Foreign fighters from the United States made up a small piece, between 17 and 60. The number has grown since December, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, the Director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, so the high-end estimates are well past 2,000 at this point. For example, French officials recently said they believe more than 700 of their residents have joined the conflict. The December estimate from King’s College London said 412 was the high figure. So it is quite possible between 2,000 and 3,000 foreign fighters from Western countries have entered Syria and Iraq, said Riedel, who has also studied these figures. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University, took issue with Rogers’ statement because even high end estimates make ""thousands"" a stretch. It’s also worth noting that the estimates don’t factor in whether foreign fighters left the fight, returned or died, only that they were there at some point in the last three years. That’s not clear from Rogers’ statement. ""I would say that most convincing analyses hold that there are indeed thousands of foreign fighters in Syria of whom about 2,000 are thought to be from Western countries,"" said Hoffman, who was an adviser to the Iraq Study Group. National security officials in the United States and with its allies are especially concerned about this trend. In January, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress, ""We’re seeing now the appearance of training complexes in Syria to train people to go back to their countries and, of course, conduct more terrorist acts."" This scenario has apparently already been realized in Brussels, Belgium, the site of a deadly shooting at a Jewish museum. French authorities have arrested a suspect, a 29-year-old Frenchman who allegedly carried out the shooting after fighting with Islamist rebels in Syria. So the threat is certainly real, particularly in Europe, Gartenstein-Ross said, where travel to and from the Middle East is logistically easier. Our ruling Rogers said there are ""thousands of Westerners and Americans in both the eastern Syria and Iraq who have Western passports"" fighting with extremists. The highest estimates put the figure between 2,000 and 3,000, which would make it technically accurate, but somewhat exaggerated, to say ""thousands."" A March estimate from the U.S. government said there were about 1,000 Westerners in Syria. Only a few dozen of them are from the United States, though, and you might not get that impression from Rogers’ comment. So Rogers may have amplified the numbers a bit, but he did not overstate the threat. Experts we spoke with, along with U.S. and Western governments, have expressed legitimate concerns about this issue. Therefore, we rate Rogers’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/18/mike-rogers/are-thousands-westerners-and-americans-fighting-ex/
"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'States', 'Chain email']","
Chain email falsely says Barack Obama is 'first president to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect'
","Readers recently forwarded us an email that’s been making the rounds for several years. We initially checked one of its long list of claims in 2011 -- that President Barack Obama is the ""first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space."" But after rating the space claim Pants on Fire, we got distracted and never took a close look at any of the other three dozen claims in the email. With this same email now seemingly circulating in heavy rotation again (here’s a version the reader sent us from a conservative blog post) we decided to check a few more. In this item, we’ll check the claim that Obama is the ""first president to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect."" As examples of Obama’s purportedly overstepping past practices in suing states, the email specifically alludes to a suit filed by his administration against Arizona’s controversial immigration law, one filed by his campaign against voting-law changes in Ohio, and a case in which his administration filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a suit filed by Planned Parenthood against Indiana. But there are several problems with the claim. What does the president swear to protect? The presidential oath of office says, ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" There’s nothing in there about protecting the states. Rather, the president is charged with protecting the Constitution of the United States. Sometimes states act in ways that contradict the U.S. Constitution (or federal laws), and when they do, the president’s administration is expected to challenge those states in court. It’s up to the judicial branch to decide whether the states or the federal government is right in that case. ""The federal government does sue states, either to enforce federal law or to enforce the Constitution, and it’s not that uncommon,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Who files the lawsuits? When the federal government sues a state (or anyone), the lawsuit is almost always filed by a federal department or agency, rather than by the president personally. While it’s true that the president’s policy preferences may have an impact on what types of suits are put at the top of the pile, it’s not correct to say Obama is the ""first president to file lawsuits against the states."" Much of the decision about whether to sue states is up to lower-level officials, with significant input by nonpartisan, career public officials, and with close attention paid to the plain language of the law in question, rather than simply because of ideological pique. Is Obama really the first president to sue states? This is the laughable part of the claim. Simply by Googling, we found at least 40 examples of Supreme Court cases titled, ""United States vs. (name of state)"" that fit the email’s definition, going back more than a century. Many of them are fairly mundane -- a lot involve competing land claims between the federal government and states -- but others are more wide-ranging, and a few were quite important. For instance, United States vs. Arizona (1935) involved a fight over construction of the Parker Dam, in which Arizona threatened the use of military force to stop the work; United States vs. Georgia (2006), which involved a state prison’s alleged failure to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act; United States vs. Commonwealth of Kentucky (2001), which addressed whether state or federal law has the final say on radioactive waste rules at a federal Energy Department landfill; and United States vs. Minnesota (1926), in which the federal government, as the guardian of Indians, sued the state for proceeds of land sales that were due the Indians but not received by them. Several of the most important cases involved civil rights, including United States vs. Alabama (1960) and United States vs. Mississippi (1965), both of which dealt with African-American voting rights, and United States vs. Virginia (1996), which involved the all-male, state-supported Virginia Military Institute. We also found more than 50 pre-Obama examples of Justice Department civil rights settlements with states based on lawsuits going back to 1988. But the Justice Department isn’t the only federal agency to sue states -- lots of other federal agencies also bring enforcement actions against states through lawsuits. In some cases, the targets are states or state-run entities. Consider the docket at the Environmental Protection Agency. Between 2004 and 2006, the administration of George W. Bush settled lawsuits with the South Carolina Public Service Authority, the Virginia Department of Corrections, the Hawaii Department of Transportation, and the Idaho Transportation Department. A different claim than the one made in the email might have some validity -- that the Obama administration may be suing states more frequently, or on different and ""bigger"" issues. But even here, numerical proof is elusive. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said it’s logical to assume that Democratic administrations may be more likely to file lawsuits to enforce federal laws than Republican administrations do, since a core tenet of Republican philosophy is a distaste for ""big government."" ""It sure seems like this administration does it a lot, and that Democrats would do it more than Republicans,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He added, however, that on the email’s specific claim, ""it doesn't strike me as unusual for the federal government to sue states to enforce federal law, particularly voting rights and environmental regulations."" Our ruling The chain email said Obama is the ""first president to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect."" But no president swears to protect the states -- they swear to protect the Constitution, which sometimes leads to clashes with states and the president is then obligated to challenge them through lawsuits. Our quick search produced dozens of examples of the federal government suing states going back a century. So we rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jun/18/chain-email/chain-email-falsely-says-barack-obama-first-presid/

Bill Maher says without Eric Cantor, the Republicans in Congress are all white and all Christian
","Dave Brat’s surprise primary win over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor didn’t just knock out a potential successor to Speaker John Boehner. Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP’s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO’s Real Time. ""Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact,"" Maher said June 13. ""There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party."" Does Cantor’s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian? Republicans ‘all Christian’ The 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii’s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as ""none"" (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the religious affiliation of members for a 2012 report. They joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat). When it comes to Republicans, 192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic. The only possible hang-up to Maher’s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism. Some Christians do not recognize Mormons, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians. Mormons do consider themselves Christians. Republicans ‘all white’ Maher also said the GOP’s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That’s Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013. To say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of ""all white,"" which isn’t always so easy to define. There are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats).  There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats). But there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the Congressional Research Service. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the categories white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguistic similarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all. Pew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected  ""some other race"" in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor. ""To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent,"" Dougherty said. ""It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress."" It’s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher’s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. The timeline of all this One more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are ""now"" all white and all Christian, that’s not accurate -- Cantor isn’t going anywhere yet. The GOP’s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections. And as he leaves office, it’s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress. There are several possibilities: Mia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, is a far-and-away favorite to win a seat in the U.S. House come November. Will Hurd, an African-American Republican, secured the GOP nomination in Texas’ most-competitive House district (which backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012). T.W. Shannon, an African-American Republican, has the support of Texas’ Cruz in Shannon’s bid for an Oklahoma Senate seat. (His primary is June 24.) A Jewish Republican and state lawmaker, Adam Kwasman, is running in the Republican primary in Arizona’s 1st Congressional District. Our ruling Without Cantor, Maher said, the GOP in Congress is ""now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed."" Maher’s show did not respond to a request for comment. If we learned anything from this fact-check, it is that straightforward sounding claims about religion and race are rarely that straightforward. Still, Maher’s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP’s ranks. On religion, Maher's claim comes down to how you view Mormonism. On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white, Hispanic or something else. Also, Cantor isn’t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It’s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves. Maher’s statement is partially accurare but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/18/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-without-eric-cantor-republicans-co/

Scott Brown says Jeanne Shaheen voted for a new national energy tax
","As he traveled across New Hampshire in early June 2014, Republican candidate Scott Brown sounded an alarm on U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s views on energy policy. Brown warned that Shaheen, a Democrat who faces re-election in the fall, is pushing for a ""national energy tax."" The claim was repeated on Brown’s website and in a series of press releases from his campaign, and was reiterated in an op-ed published during his ""making energy affordable"" tour. Brown said he supports a variety of measures to make energy more affordable without passing ""Sen. Shaheen’s national energy tax."" With the New Hampshire Senate race drawing national attention, it wasn’t long before Brown’s comments were scrutinized. Judy Reardon, Shaheen’s chief counsel, issued a challenge to Brown’s campaign on Twitter, asking the former Massachusetts senator to provide evidence that Shaheen supports a ""national energy tax."" ""Please cite the vote,"" she wrote in a June 9 message. Brown’s campaign manager, Colin Reed, shot back in a press release that he found it troubling Shaheen’s staff didn’t remember Shaheen’s votes in Congress. ""The simple fact is that one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax which would have a disastrous impact on New Hampshire’s economy,"" Reed said. With Brown and Shaheen sparring on energy policy, we decided to delve deeper into the issue. We were curious about whether Shaheen’s record indeed showed support for an energy tax or carbon tax, as taxes on oil, gas and coal usage are sometimes called. The logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. We began by asking Brown’s campaign to explain his statements. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen’s vote on a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. The resolution stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form. Shaheen voted in favor of the budget resolution, though nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use. ""I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,"" Whitehouse told reporters in September. ""So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds."" Although she was allying herself with a carbon tax supporter’s amendment, Shaheen’s vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax. The second piece of evidence offered by Brown’s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate. In 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against Blunt’s measure, Shaheen wasn’t directly expressing support for a carbon tax. Shripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen’s Senate office, said that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. In an email, Shah wrote that Shaheen supports ""market-driven solutions"" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it’s ""easier to sell to the population"" and ""puts the onus"" on the polluters. When it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen’s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency. Shaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. The bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote. Shaheen took to the Senate floor after it became clear the measure would not pass to remind her colleagues that energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest and cleanest way to address the country's energy demand. ""One of the things that I like about energy efficiency is that it doesn’t matter whether you support fossil fuels or whether you support alternative sources of energy,"" she said. ""Everyone benefits from energy efficiency."" Our ruling Brown’s campaign said that Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax. The campaign cited Shaheen’s support for a 2013 amendment that would have established guidelines for any future carbon tax. They also pointed to Shaheen’s vote against legislation that would have made it harder to pass a carbon tax framework. Shaheen’s campaign told us Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax, and we didn’t find any evidence to contradict that. One of her major legislative efforts, the Shaheen-Portman bill, focused on energy efficiency. Brown has a point that Shaheen voted for a revenue plan offered by a carbon tax supporter and shrugged off a proposal from a carbon tax opponent. Still, neither of those positions is the same as voting for a new energy tax. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-new-national/
