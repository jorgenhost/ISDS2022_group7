Kamala Harris quote calling young people ‘stupid’ is missing context
","Did vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris call young Americans stupid, as a post on social media claims? In an image posted by a Facebook page called ""Students for Trump,"" we see a photo of Harris next to a quote that reads, ""What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid!"" The post’s caption says: ""This is what Kamala thinks about young Americans?!"" The quote is part of something Harris said six years ago, but rather than insulting young voters, Harris  made the comment during a speech about the need to forgive mistakes made by young, low-level criminal offenders. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Harris made the remark during an address on criminal justice policy at a symposium hosted by the Ford Foundation in May 2014, when she was California’s attorney general. The quote on its own is missing the context of the larger point that Harris was trying to make, which was how the criminal justice system shouldn’t penalize young adults for making certain mistakes.  The full video of her remarks (her comment comes around the 16:45-mark) shows that Harris is talking about forgiving young people’s low-level crimes, and how the system treats offenders in the age group during what she referred to as their most developmental stage in life. ""When I was at Howard University and we were in college, we were 18 through 24, and you know what we were called? College kids. But when you turn 18 and you’re in the system, you are considered an adult, period. Without any regard to the fact that, that is the very phase of life in which we have invested billions of dollars in colleges and universities knowing that is the prime phase of life during which we mold and shape and direct someone to become a productive adult.  ""What’s the other thing we know about this population? And it’s a specific phase of life, remember, age is more than a chronological fact. What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid (audience laughs). That is why we put them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions. So we focused on that age population."" Harris was describing a recidivism reduction program for first-time, low-level offenders in Los Angeles. The initiative, modeled after the ""Back on Track"" program that Harris launched in 2005 in San Francisco, would provide services to young Americans who were convicted of nonviolent felonies. If they met certain education and career goals, they would have their cases dismissed. A post on Facebook says Harris called young Americans ""stupid."" It’s a partial quote of something Harris said. Harris was speaking about initiatives to reduce recidivism rates for young, low-level offenders and wryly made a comment about how young adults often make bad decisions in order to illustrate the broader point that more empathy is needed for them within the criminal justice system. Harris made the comment, but the post leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

No, McDonald’s didn’t remove American flags to support Antifa and Black Lives Matter
","In some corners of the internet, there are regular cage fights between patriotism and protests, with social media posts egging them on from the sidelines.

 No, James Comey and John Brennan haven’t been charged with multiple counts of treason
","Are the former head of the CIA and former FBI director both charged with treason? That’s what a recent Facebook post alleges without any evidence: ""I’m hearing that James Comey has 50 counts of TREASON,"" the post says. ""And John Brennan has 48 counts of TREASON."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This isn’t the first time we’ve heard something like this — President Donald Trump has set his sights on the former agency heads, and so have his advisers. In June 2019, Roger Stone, one of Trump’s longtime confidants, called for former CIA director John Brennan to be ""hung for treason."" Stone was later found guilty of witness tampering and lying to Congress in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But he’s not the only Republican who has criticized both Brennan and former FBI director James Comey for the inquiry.  But neither Comey nor Brennan have been charged with treason. Here’s what we know. In December, the New York Times reported that federal prosecutor John Durham was investigating the role Brennan played in the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered with the 2016 election.  Durham had requested Brennan’s emails, call logs and other documents because he wanted to learn what Brennan told other officials, including Comey, about his and the CIA’s views on a dossier of claims about Trump associates and Russia, according to the New York Times. Neither Brennan nor Comey have been indicted. News that the men were facing multiple counts of treason charges would draw wide media coverage, but there are no news stories to corroborate the Facebook post’s claims.  In August, Durham questioned Brennan for eight hours. Afterward, an aide for Brennan said Durham told Brennan during that interview that Brennan isn’t the target of any criminal inquiry as part of the justice department’s examination of the Russia investigation, according to the Times.  Finally, there is a high bar for charging someone with treason. The Constitution — which mentions very few crimes specifically — defines treason very narrowly. It says that treason can only consist in ""levying war"" against the country or giving ""aid and comfort"" to enemies. ""No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court,"" according to the Constitution. On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government. We rate this Facebook post False.

Joe Biden says under Donald Trump, Iran’s uranium stockpile has grown tenfold. It has.
","In an op-ed on CNN’s website, Democratic nominee Joe Biden said the threat of Iran’s nuclear capability has worsened under President Donald Trump. During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to renegotiate the 2015 agreement that rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. He pulled the United States out of the multinational pact in 2018. With no headway since, we found he had broken his campaign promise. ""This past month has proven that Trump's Iran policy is a dangerous failure,"" Biden wrote Sept. 13. ""Trump tried to unilaterally reimpose U.N. sanctions on Iran, only to have virtually all the U.N. Security Council members unite to reject his gambit. Now there are reports that Iran has stockpiled 10 times as much enriched uranium as it had when President Barack Obama and I left office."" Biden’s stat on Iran’s enriched uranium is accurate. Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran was limited to 202.8 kilograms of uranium enriched to 3.67%. (Attentive readers will see that the agreement specified 300 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride, but that’s equivalent to 202.8 kilograms of U-235.) The 2015 deal opened Iran to regular international inspections, and until the U.S. withdrew — and for many months afterwards — Iran stuck to the terms. Biden compared today to where things stood when he left office. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported November 2016 that Iran had not exceeded the capped amount.  But last year, Iran announced it would start breaching the limit on enriched uranium. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported in September that Iran now has a bit over 2,105 kilograms of enriched uranium. That’s more than 10 times the limit in the agreement. Not only does Iran have more uranium than it should under the agreement, the uranium is more concentrated than what was allowed. About 90% of the total uranium is enriched beyond the 3.67% limit to 4.5%. The numbers speak for themselves. Less clear is their meaning. Weapon-grade uranium has to be concentrated to about 90% purity. In June, weapons experts estimated that if Iran wanted, it could produce enough material for a bomb in three to six months. Kelsey Davenport with the Arms Control Association said Iran would need additional time before it could turn that uranium into a viable weapon. ""Iran would still need to convert the material and weaponize it, a process that would likely take more than a year,"" Davenport said. She also noted that Iran has not sped up the pace of enriching uranium, or pushed enrichment to the 20% level it had before the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. That suggests, she said, that Iran is using its stockpile as leverage in future negotiations. The situation is serious, Davenport said, but still manageable. Biden said that Iran has 10 times as much enriched uranium as when he left office in 2016.  Iran went from having no more than 202.8 kilograms of enriched uranium to 2,105 kilograms, which is more than a tenfold increase.

Fact-checking Trump health aide’s unproven ‘hit squads’ claim from controversial Facebook video
","The top communications official at the Department of Health and Human Services ran through a series of baseless conspiracy theories in a Facebook Live video, accusing government health officials of ""sedition"" and warning of a post-election insurrection by left-wing ""hit squads."" The broadcast from Michael Caputo, who President Donald Trump appointed in April as the department’s assistant secretary of public affairs, was first reported by the New York Times.  Caputo, a former Trump campaign official, warned without evidence that ""there are hit squads being trained all over this country"" to violently oppose a second Trump term, according to the New York Times. He predicted that Trump would win a contested election, sparking chaos. ""And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,"" he said, according to the report. ""The drills that you’ve seen are nothing."" Caputo told gun owners to ""buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get."" He also leveled unsubstantiated accusations against scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and said his own ""mental health has definitely failed.""    Caputo has since shut down his personal Facebook account, but he related what he said in the video to several news outlets, and Yahoo News released snippets of the livestream. Caputo apologized to colleagues for his remarks in an emergency staff meeting, according to reports. On Sept. 16, HHS announced he would be taking a 60-day leave of absence.   Caputo already was facing criticism after Politico and others reported that he and an aide had pressured the CDC to let them review and revise weekly scientific reports in order to portray the Trump administration’s coronavirus response more positively. As for his comment about left-wing hit squads? Experts who closely follow domestic terrorism and extremist groups said there’s no evidence that left-wing groups are ""being trained"" or organizing underground to stage the type of armed revolt that Caputo described. ""I would just file this under the latest outlandish, unproven argument about left-wing violence that is ultimately aimed to serve the Trump 2020 campaign,"" said Mark Bray, a historian and part-time lecturer at Rutgers University. Caputo and HHS did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the FBI or the office of the director of national intelligence. It’s not clear which left-wing groups he was referring to. Trump and his allies have lumped wide swaths of people protesting police brutality and racial injustice in with antifa. Antifa stands for ""anti-fascist"" and refers to a broad movement — including communists, anarchists and socialists — that has been around for decades. In his Facebook monologue, Caputo said the suspected killing in August of a Trump supporter by a self-described anti-fascist in Portland, Ore., was a ""drill"" foreshadowing more violence. Antifa activists have sometimes turned to violence to push back against right-wing activists, although much of their organizing is peaceful, as PolitiFact has reported.  RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: What is antifa, and why is it all over my timeline? Anti-fascist groups typically aren’t large in number, and their focus is often on counterprotesting, said Bray, who wrote a book on antifa. ""Most of the time when you see counter-demonstrations against far-right events, it’s the anti-racist, anti-fascist crowd that usually doesn’t have guns,"" Bray said. Other left-wing groups such as Redneck Revolt, the Socialist Rifle Association and the Not F------ Around Coalition, have also been violent, experts said. Redneck Revolt, for example, will openly carry firearms while opposing far-right events and is known to conduct target practice. A recent report from the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit organization, found that Redneck Revolt and other left-wing groups were growing their networks online and on some occasions circulating memes and messages with depictions of violence.  Members of Redneck Revolt and the John Brown Gun Club protest outside the Phoenix Convention Center on Aug. 22, 2017, in Phoenix. (AP) Still, experts told PolitiFact that they have seen no evidence in their tracking of domestic terrorist and extremist groups that left-wing ""hit squads"" are getting ready to mount an armed insurrection after the election. Here’s a sampling of how they responded to Caputo’s claim: ""We have not seen in our review of online activity of the far-left the existence at this time of anything matching Mr. Caputo's reference of ‘hit squads,’ though there certainly is an intensity to the rhetoric,"" said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. ""I haven’t heard anything that would suggest there are organized groups that are plotting this type of violence,"" said Mary McCord, legal director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law and a former Justice Department attorney. ""I have not seen any evidence of hit squads being trained to violently oppose a second Trump term. What I have seen is the politicization of extremist threats,"" said Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""Regardless of which side is declared the winner, there is absolutely no evidence to support Mr. Caputo’s claims,"" said Michael Jensen, senior researcher at the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. That doesn’t discount the possibility that some extremists could act on their own or in very small circles through the use of encrypted messages or private online forums, experts said. McCord noted that mass shootings have often been carried out by a single gunman.  ""Now, if you were talking about coordinated attacks across the country all on the same day or something, then obviously that takes a big infrastructure,"" McCord said. McCord also noted that Caputo’s HHS role wouldn’t necessarily make him privy to the same insight as intelligence, national security or law enforcement officials. ""He really wouldn’t have access to the information that would support those claims,"" McCord said. How various groups might react to a Trump election victory is an open question, although academics have run simulations to game out the possibilities, and experts PolitiFact consulted said some street-level violence could happen depending on the result.  But the type of coordinated political assassinations that Caputo evoked with his reference to ""hit squads"" are largely inconsistent with the way left-wing groups have operated, experts said. ""According to the propaganda that I’ve seen, they’re not advocating that type of hit-squad, offensive paramilitary tactics,"" McCord said. ""It doesn’t in my experience fit with what they have done, which is usually just essentially target practice and show up to oppose far-right events,"" Bray added. Neil Shortland, director of the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, said that while groups such as Redneck Revolt could pose a threat of violence if Trump wins, there’s no open-source evidence to prove they’re currently organizing as hit squads. The reference to hit squads is ""overly dramatic and alarmist,"" said Jeffrey Bale, professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, because ""it suggests that operational teams are being organized throughout the country to carry out political assassinations."" A June report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said the election ""will likely be a significant source of anger and polarization that increases the possibility of terrorism"" from either the right or the left.  The report noted that ""far-right terrorism has significantly outpaced terrorism from other types of perpetrators,"" which aligns with what experts told PolitiFact.  ""While there is a smattering of left-wing militias and there is an upswing in extreme left-wing online and violent activity, including the movement's first homicide in years, the most mass casualty violence has emanated from the far-right,"" said Levin, the expert from California State University, San Bernardino. Caputo said ""there are hit squads being trained all over this country"" to violently oppose a second term for Trump. Post-election protests featuring violence are a real possibility, experts said, and there are some left-wing groups that believe in openly carrying firearms. But experts who track domestic terrorism and extremist groups said there’s no basis to Caputo’s claim that these groups are organizing nationwide as ""hit squads"" and ""being trained"" to carry out widespread political assassinations should Trump win on Election Day.

Mun Choi’s numbers are off when it comes to ICU beds around Mizzou and UNC
","At the end of the first week of classes, the University of Missouri chancellor said it wasn’t shutting down campus and used available hospital bed capacity as one of the reasons.  Mizzou Chancellor Mun Choi compared available ICU beds between his county and the county that’s home to the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. UNC sent its students home after a week of classes.  A week after its start date, UNC had at least 177 positive cases of COVID-19. MU, on the other hand, had 415 students identified after its first week. (Note: The schools opened a week apart.)  ""We are prepared,"" Choi said at the Aug. 28 press conference. ""We have more hospital beds that are staffed and the number of ICU beds is larger in Boone County by a factor of three.""  UNC-Chapel Hill is located in Orange County, in what is commonly referred to as the Research Triangle. Its campus is about 12 miles from Duke University Hospital, so it surprised us that Missouri would compare so favorably.  As it turns out, our suspicions were affirmed.   Christian Basi, director of the MU News Bureau, cited data from Johns Hopkins University that listed Boone County as having 150 ICU beds and Orange County as having 47 ICU beds. Or, in other words, just about three times as many at Mizzou.  Johns Hopkins defines ICU beds as an ""adult bed, pediatric bed, birthing room, or newborn ICU bed"" in addition to psychiatric ICU beds and detox ICU beds. Another database, from The Leapfrog Group, a non-profit organization that advocates transparency in healthcare, lists UNC Medical Center as having 82 ICU beds, many more than the Johns Hopkins data. MU hospitals were not reported to this database. So we looked for other, more direct sources:  Boone County: 144 adult ICU beds  Boone Hospital Center has 32 ICU beds, according to Aug. 3 data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. University of Missouri Health Care had 98 adult ICU beds, according to an April press release.  Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital has 14 ICU beds. Only students who are serving or served in the military qualify to be seen there.   Orange County: 136 adult ICU beds UNC Medical Center in Chapel Hill has 138 ICU beds and UNC Hospitals Hillsborough Campus has 18 ICU beds, according to Phil Bridges, executive director of integrated communications for UNC Health. But 20 of the beds are pediatric ICU, making the total 136 for adults. In other words, there is only an eight-bed difference between counties.   MU lies pretty much in the center of Boone County. While UNC is in Orange County, the town of Chapel Hill actually dips into three counties, including Durham and Chatham.  So what does the picture look like when you go by proximity?  In MU’s 30-mile radius, Jefferson City’s Capital Region Medical Center and SSM St. Mary’s Hospital offer 24 ICU beds total, which brings the mid-Missouri total to 168.  In the Chapel Hill area, there are 209 ICU beds available. These hospitals are Duke University Medical Center, Duke Regional Center, Duke Raleigh Center, UNC Rex Hospital and Wake Med Cary. When you expand the lens, it’s apparent that there are regionally more beds in the Orange County area than in Boone County, although the Research Triangle population is also about eight times larger. At a press conference, Choi said, ""the number of ICU beds is larger in Boone County by a factor of three."" His math matches data from Johns Hopkins University. But a closer look shows the number of adult ICU beds to be close to the same in Boone and Orange counties.   With all things considered, we give this claim a rating of False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/16/mun-choi/mun-chois-numbers-are-when-it-comes-icu-beds-aroun/

There is no evidence Trump created a ""child protective force,"" or that his administration found more than 300 missing children in less than 30 days.  Such an event would have likely prompted attention from news outlets, but PolitiFact searched news archives and found nothing to suggest that more than 300 missing children had been found recently.  Social media platforms are seeing a wave of misinformation related to child abuse and trafficking. Followers of a baseless conspiracy theory called QAnon have been promoting the belief that Trump is working behind the scenes to bring down a child trafficking ring led by prominent Democrats and celebrities. The FBI considers QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 gave the U.S. Marshals Service, a unit of the Justice Department, more authority to help local officials find missing children. The bill passed in Congress with bipartisan support, and President Barack Obama signed it into law in May 2015.  By 2016, according to the agency’s annual report and a fact sheet, the Marshals Service had created a Missing Child Unit to help federal, state and local law enforcement locate ""missing, endangered or abducted children, regardless of whether a fugitive or sex offender was involved."" That was before Trump took office. In August 2020, the Missing Child Unit, along with state and local agencies, conducted a two-week operation known as ""Operation Not Forgotten"" that found 39 missing children in Georgia.  According to a press release, 26 children were rescued, 13 were safely located and nine arrests were made.  ""The message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you,"" Donald Washington, the director of the Marshals Service, said in the statement. In October 2018, U.S. Marshals reported that a one-day sting operation in Michigan resulted in the recovery of more than 100 missing children. The operation ""sought to identify and recover 301 missing children, with an emphasis on locating victims of sex trafficking,"" according to news reports. Local officials reported that 107 children were found, and 103 of those children were ""either at home or where they belonged."" Other news outlets reported that the Marshals’ Oct. 3 press release, which has since been taken down, exaggerated the success of the Michigan operation. The Marshals’ press release said 123 children had been recovered — it included 16 children the Marshals recovered in a separate operation.  The press release also said three children were potentially linked to sex trafficking and one teenager was found homeless, but the release didn’t ""elaborate on where the remaining 119 children were found,"" HuffPost reported.  The Detroit News reported: ""Only four of the children in that group were actually missing; the rest were merely listed as missing in police computers, Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw said. Shaw said most of the kids had been reported as missing in the past, but their parents never alerted police they'd returned home.""  Whether the Michigan operation located 107 or 123 missing children, neither number supports the post’s claim that Trump administration officials ""found over 300 missing kids in less than 30 days.""   A Facebook post says Trump established a ""child protective force that found over 300 missing kids in less than 30 days."" The U.S. Marshals Missing Child Unit conducted operations in 2018 and 2020 to locate children listed as missing.

U.S. Postal Service has the most cash on hand, though debt still looms
","2020 has brought an unlikely federal service into the spotlight. The United States Postal Service has been at center stage due to President Donald Trump’s outspoken mistrust of mail-in ballot voting and his reluctance to approve $25 billion in Postal Service funding.  After facing losses from the beginning months of COVID-19, its ongoing debt, and an increase in mail-in ballots for the election, some legislators say the Postal Service needs the funds. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) disagrees. In an Aug. 23 Facebook post, he said the Postal Service has the manpower and the money to function just fine in November. Hawley called the Democrats’ push for more money ""hysteria."" He added, ""USPS currently has the most cash on hand in its history, approx $15 billion."" That’s a lot of cash on hand — and a bold claim —  so we decided to follow the money. To understand the claim, we need to know what  ""cash on hand"" means: cash and cash equivalents. It’s like how much cash is in the register at a store. It’s money that can be used immediately.  Businesses can still have a considerable amount of cash on hand, even when they are in debt. Being in debt means a company still owes money that they’ve borrowed or taken out in loans. Now back to Hawley.  His information comes from a virtual Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on U.S. Postal Service on Aug. 21. At the hearing, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said there was ""somewhere between $14-15 billion"" in cash on hand. The most recent information is from two separate documents, and we get two answers. According to the latest financial statement from the Postal Service in June, the agency had over $13 billion in cash and restricted cash. In a more recent fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Treasury, the service had $14.2 billion in cash on hand as of Aug. 12.  Hawley’s approximation is close. This is the most cash on hand that the Postal Service has had — at least in the past 16 years. According to an email from spokesperson David Coleman, the data available to his team goes back only to 2004. 2020’s cash on hand is the highest: at least $13 billion, compared to around $9 billion in 2019. So it’s hard to verify whether that’s the most in history. The modern Postal Service dates back to 1970 legislation that reorganized it from a Cabinet position to an independent agency. According to an Aug. 21 statement from the Postal Service, the agency has been experiencing losses for years.  ""Since 2007,"" the statement reads, ""the Postal Service has experienced nearly $80 billion in cumulative losses."" It says that the financial year of 2019 had losses near $9 billion, and 2020 will be close to $11 billion.  The Service says they can manage the influx of mail-in ballots this year.  Election mail is predicted to ""amount to less than 2% of total mail volume from mid-September to Election Day,"" according to the statement. Hawley agrees that the Postal Service can handle this unprecedented election.  ""The Postmaster testified before Congress that USPS has the money, the manpower, and the resources to deliver the mail safely and on time through the election,"" Hawley said in an email from his team. ""He said he is committed to not implementing any measure that could possibly slow down the mail between now and November.""  Still, the Postmaster General says sending in your ballots early is best. As of Aug. 12, The Postal Service has about $14.2 billion in cash on hand. Hawley claimed: ""USPS currently has the most cash on hand in its history, approx $15 billion."" The Postal Service finance department could only confirm that this is the most cash on hand since 2004, according to a Postal Service spokesman. All of history is a lot longer than 16 years ago though, so it is hard to confirm this part of the claim completely. With the losses the Postal Service has experienced, the cash on hand may not be as helpful as it may sound.  The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Hawley’s claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/sep/16/josh-hawley/us-postal-service-has-most-cash-hand-though-debt-s/

Wisconsin is trending poorly on COVID-19 cases, but Evers’ stat isn’t quite right
","In a Sept. 15, 2020, daily briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Tony Evers made his case that Wisconsin needs to take the coronavirus more seriously. ""We need to take every precaution, perhaps more than ever to keep our families, neighbors and communities safe,"" Evers said. ""On Sunday, we had another record-setting day for the number of positive cases."" That’s correct — the 1,582 tally on Sept. 13 was the highest yet. Then the governor addressed where Wisconsin stood relative to other states. ""According to a nationwide analysis, Wisconsin is one of the nine states with the highest rate of infection per capita,"" Evers said. ""We cannot continue on this path. At one point, Wisconsin was in a pretty good place, but that is no longer the case."" Is Wisconsin really among the nine worst states in the nation? Evers is right about trending in the wrong direction, but his description of the stat isn’t quite right. Let’s take a closer look. Asked for evidence of the nine-worst-states claim, Evers’ staff pointed to a New York Times breakdown of cases by state. The analysis, updated daily, shows Wisconsin as of Sept. 15 had the fifth-highest number of new cases per capita over the last seven days — 147 per 100,000 residents. Only North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri and Oklahoma were worse in that span. The Times used that data to identify Wisconsin as one of nine states ""where new cases are higher and staying high."" Indeed, since the start of September, the number of new cases and the percentage of positive tests in Wisconsin have both marched steadily upwards, regularly hitting highs not seen before  during the pandemic. But that’s not exactly how Evers described the situation. He said Wisconsin was among those with the ""highest rate of infection per capita,"" with no mention that he was only referring to the preceding week. And in the longer view, Wisconsin stacks up differently. The Times data showed Wisconsin is 30th in cases per capita overall. That’s in line with similar data maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others.  In other words, Wisconsin was in much better shape relative to other states earlier in the pandemic, but not anymore — which was Evers’ underlying point. Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Evers, said his statement should be understood as referring to only recent cases by implication, since it was during a discussion of recent trends. In a media briefing on COVID-19, Evers said, ""Wisconsin is one of the nine states with the highest rate of infection per capita."" Evers was discussing how the Wisconsin situation used to be better than most states, but now it’s among the worst. That general point is correct, but his reference isn’t quite right. Wisconsin is among the states with the highest rates of new cases, a crucial descriptor that Evers left out of his stat. Without that, Evers’ statement could refer to total cases in Wisconsin, where the state ranks 30th. We define Mostly True as a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/sep/16/tony-evers/wisconsin-trending-poorly-covid-19-cases-evers-sta/

Lacking evidence, posts falsely tie ambushed deputy to previous shooting
","On Sept. 12, a gunman walked up to a parked police car in Compton, Calif., opened fire on two Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies, a man and a woman. The shooter ran away, and the deputies were taken to the hospital to treat their injuries. The department has not released the deputies’ names. But users on social media went ahead anyway and connected one of the deputies to another deputy-involved shooting in June, without evidence.

About 66% of U.S. public thinks Joe Biden is the legitimate president, not 30%
","A Facebook post that’s been circulating recently says that only 30% of Americans think Joe Biden actually won the 2020 presidential election. ""Please keep in mind,"" the post says, ""that 70% of Americans don't believe a word the mainstream media puts out, except for maybe a few faces on Fox News. That means everyone you’re seeing and everyone who thinks Biden won are only 30% of the population."" The post is off-base on both statistics — and in assuming that there’s a direct connection between the two ideas. Trust in the mainstream media has been declining for years. The polling firm Gallup has asked this question consistently since 1997, and the overall level of trust among all adults surveyed has fallen during that period from 53% to 40%. These figures combine the responses for ""a great deal"" of trust and ""a fair amount"" of trust. For 2020, Gallup found that 33% of respondents had no trust in the media and another 27% had very little trust.   It’s worth noting that the percentage of respondents reporting trust in the mass media — which is defined in the polling question as ""newspapers, TV and radio"" — varies widely depending on the respondent’s partisan identification. In 2020, Gallup found that 73% of Democrats trusted the media ""a great deal"" or ""a fair amount,"" compared with 36% for independents and just 10% for Republicans.   The Facebook post uses pretty strong language, referring to 70% as the share of people who ""don't believe a word the mainstream media puts out."" But according to Gallup, only about half that — just 33% — say they have no trust in the media.  Where the post’s message goes off the rails is its conclusion that as a result of the distrust of the media, ""everyone who thinks Biden won are only 30% of the population."" The most recent survey to address this was the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center, which was conducted between Jan. 28 and Feb. 1. It asked, ""Do you think Joe Biden was legitimately elected president, or not?"" The answers broke down to 66% yes, 33% no, and 1% other.  That’s more than double what the Facebook post said. As was the case with trust in the media, there was a significant difference by party affiliation. Only 33% of Republicans said that Biden was legitimately elected, compared with virtually all Democrats who said yes. Earlier polls — those taken in November, shortly after Biden was declared the winner — showed 60% to almost 80% of Americans agreed with Biden’s legitimacy. In any case, regardless of whether the media is trusted, Biden is the duly elected president, having been certified as the victor by state election officials, the Electoral College and Congress. The Facebook post said, ""70% of Americans don't believe a word the mainstream media puts out,"" so ""everyone who thinks Biden won are only 30% of the population."" The level of people who have a complete distrust of the media is about half as high as the post says, according to the most recent Gallup poll, and the most recent poll asking about Biden’s legitimacy found 66% support, which is more than twice as high as what the post said.

Why it’s hard to link school reopenings to Biden’s efforts
","President Joe Biden took some credit for school reopenings, tying increases in in-person learning to his administration’s efforts to vaccinate educators and send money to schools. ""Back in February, when many of our schools were fully or partially closed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC — issued guidelines to help reopen our schools safely,"" Biden said April 21. ""Then, in March, Congress approved the American Rescue Plan to fund the safe reopening of our schools."" But educators were anxious about going back to the classroom without being vaccinated and many parents were nervous about sending their children, Biden said.  ""So, on March the 2nd, I launched a program directing all states to make educators, school staff, school bus drivers, child care workers eligible for vaccination in every state so that schools and child care centers could open with a peace of mind,"" Biden said. ""Within a month, 80% had received at least one shot, and schools and child care centers all over the country are reopening.""  It’s true that more schools have reopened from COVID-19-era closures in Biden’s first 100 days. But it’s hard to pinpoint how big a role the Biden administration played, as school communities were also influenced by other factors such as increased vaccinations, declines in cases, parent pressure and changes in state or local guidance.  The Biden administration prioritized increasing vaccine supply to the states, which led more adults, including teachers, to be vaccinated. But with 13,000 school districts nationwide, there was no overarching explanation for why or when local and state officials decided to reopen schools. Early on, Biden and his administration gave conflicting messages about his school reopening goals. In December, he said he wanted to reopen the majority of schools during his first 100 days. But in January he narrowed that goal to apply to the majority of K-8 schools.  The CDC issued recommendations on Feb. 12 that called for reopened schools to employ universal masking, keep everyone 6 feet apart, clean regularly, and require quarantining and contract tracing for new cases.  The CDC also released a color-coded tool to guide reopening decisions based on weekly transmission levels. The controversial tool landed about 90% of the communities in the red zone due to high rates of transmission. By the guidelines, many middle and high schools would have had to close. Two public health experts concluded that the color-coded guidance would unnecessarily keep millions out of school. Some states such as Florida, which had been offering in person instruction since the fall, shrugged at the CDC’s guidance.  And one month later, the CDC generally shrank the 6-foot rule to 3 feet, except in some middle and high schools where transmission is high.  ""The move from 6 feet to 3 feet was absolutely an accelerator for school reopenings,"" said Dennis Roche, president of Burbio, a firm that is tracking data on school reopenings. Just before the CDC issued the 3-foot guidance, Burbio found that school districts in multiple states were spacing desks by 3 feet as they converted to traditional in-person instruction from hybrid systems in which children attended school both online and in person. That trend continued in March and April with some districts citing the 3-foot rule in their decisions to fully reopen in person. On March 2, Biden said he was directing states to prioritize vaccinating teachers. But by that point, more than 30 states had already done so — and some states that hadn’t prioritized teachers had reopened schools anyway. The CDC found through federal data and surveys that nearly 80% of pre-K through 12th grade school staff and childcare workers received at least their first shot by the end of March. Biden also said the American Rescue Plan — which he signed into law in March — funded school reopening. While figures show almost $129 billion will go toward the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, Biden’s statement seems to ignore that most of that money is directed to be spent after 2021.  Schools have moved toward in-person learning throughout 2021 There are two main ways to track weekly K-12 school openings: by school district or by students. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, publishes a tracker that monitors over 8,500 public school districts on whether they’re operating with fully remote, hybrid or fully in-person learning. According to its metrics, about 5% of districts were fully remote as of mid-April, compared with about 20% a couple days before Biden took office.  Burbio, which tracks about 1,200 school districts, found that about 6% of students were in fully remote schools as of late April, compared with about half of students a couple days before Biden took office. The trackers show that schools have steadily moved toward in-person instruction in 2021. But we couldn’t find any evidence of a significant shift to in-person learning that was specifically tied to the CDC’s February guidance, Biden’s announcement that all teachers were eligible for vaccines, or the promise of American Rescue Plan money.  ""The real answer is there was a lot of things pushing schools to reopen during this period and all sort of tailwinds for reopening, making it pretty hard to figure out which one is the one to look at,"" said Nat Malkus, an expert on K-12 education at the American Enterprise Institute. COVID-19 cases were declining in areas. Vaccinations were increasing. Parents were pressing schools to open. Pediatricians and health experts were urging a return to school. And some governors were advocating for more in-person instruction. Biden’s efforts probably helped some districts move toward reopening, Malkus said, but ""as far as the overall trend, I don’t think you can give the Biden administration a lot of credit for driving it.""  Sean R. Gill, a research analyst at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, said he believes the actions of states and governors had more of an impact than Biden’s moves. ""Even in California, they made some new state funds contingent on being open for in-person or hybrid learning,"" he said. Linda Darling-Hammond, president of the state board of education in California, credited both Biden and state action with fueling reopenings there. The dramatic increase in vaccine supply under Biden’s watch ""made a big difference because many many districts were waiting on vaccines to get to teachers to reopen schools,"" she said. Similarly, school leaders were able to start counting on money that would be coming. Biden says his administration’s efforts have led to more school reopenings. Biden cited guidelines issued by the CDC, his announcement to prioritize vaccinating educators and the passage of the American Rescue Plan. We found it’s difficult to pinpoint the factors that drove more schools to reopen in 2021. While some of the Biden administration’s actions helped, many states and schools were already moving toward more in-person learning when those initiatives were announced. Other factors also played a role, including COVID-19 infection rates, overall vaccination rates, pressure from parents and decisions by local and state officials.  We rate this statement Half True.

Mariah Carey didn’t fake getting her COVID-19 vaccine. A retractable needle was used

No proof for Trump’s claim of surge in trafficking, drugs at border under Biden
","With border crossings from Mexico rising sharply, fueled by a surge in unaccompanied children, former President Donald Trump painted a picture of doom in an interview with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity.

Trump responded more generally, saying his own policies left things well enough at the border, and all Biden had to do ""was leave it alone."" (We rated a similar claim Mostly False.)

""That’s doubled, tripled and quadrupled coming in, because that’s pouring in right now."" The claim was contained in an excerpt of Trump’s interview shared on Facebook by his son Don Trump Jr., who has 4.78 million followers on Facebook.  The younger Trump’s April 21 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Human trafficking involves compelling a person into any form of labor through the threat of violence, fraud or coercion, and for the purpose of exploitation. Transporting people over a border is not the same as human trafficking. Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, director of the Arizona State University Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research, said that from what she has observed, law enforcement agencies are not reporting increases in sex or labor trafficking victims and social service programs, are not reporting huge surges since Biden took office.  ""Perhaps he is talking about smuggling,"" she said of Trump. ""It is much flashier to say human trafficking, but it is incorrect."" Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a George Mason University professor whose research expertise includes Mexico-U.S. relations, organized crime, immigration, border security and human trafficking, and Caren Benjamin, a spokesperson for the Polaris Project, which fights sex and labor trafficking, said data to back Trump’s claim do not exist. ""To make claims like this fundamentally misunderstands how human trafficking actually works,"" Benjamin said. ""Trafficking is not something that happens in a single moment, like driving over a border. It is a process, almost like a narrative, that plays out over time. So, the idea that we could — a few months into a new administration — count trafficking cases related to border crossings, is nonsensical."" On drugs, the latest statistics available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection for seizures at the southwest border, posted April 8, show that the total amount of illegal drugs seized, in pounds, was 23% lower in the first three months of 2021 than it was in the first three months of 2020, when Trump was president.  
February’s number was higher than a year earlier, by about 12%.  The number of drug seizure events is up 11% for the first three months of 2021 — not double, triple or quadruple. Trump said ""human trafficking and drugs"" at the Mexico border have ""doubled, tripled and quadrupled"" since Biden became president. Experts on trafficking said they have not seen such an increase and that there is no data to back Trump’s claim.  Federal figures show the amount of drugs seized at the southwest border is lower during the first three months of 2021 than in the first quarter of 2020, while the number of drug seizures is up about 11%.

In October 2020, for example, then-president Donald Trump wrongly said that COVID-19 is ""far less lethal"" than the flu for most people.  We reached out to Bell to find out the source of her claim, but we didn’t hear back.  However, according to Johns Hopkins University, about 3.1 million people around the world had died of COVID-19 as of April 26, 2021. The flu, meanwhile, kills between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.  Even if 650,000 people died of the flu annually over the past four years, that’s still fewer than the number of people who died of COVID-19 in the less than two years since the first case was reported in December 2019.  In the United States, about 572,549 people have so far died of COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins.  The average number of flu deaths per year here over the past decade has been about 36,000. The worst flu season was in 2017-18, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates between 46,000 and 95,000 people died. It’s still a fraction of the number of people who died of COVID-19. It’s also worth noting that the number of people who tested positive for the flu this most recent season dropped dramatically compared with years past. Experts suspect that’s thanks to measures taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing and masking. Of course, COVID-19 is a relatively new disease, so over time the flu has caused more deaths than the coronavirus. But that’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Since it was discovered, COVID-19 has killed far more people. In 2020, COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the United States, according to the CDC, after heart disease and cancer. About 345,000 Americans died of COVID-19 during that calendar year, or more than nine times as many Americans who die of the flu on average every year.

Ted Cruz’s dubious claim that GOP didn’t “rig” SCOTUS confirmations
","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined his Republican colleagues last week in criticizing Democratic measures that would expand the nine seats of the U.S. Supreme Court to 13. ""You didn't see Republicans when we had control of the Senate try to rig the game. You didn't see us try to pack the court,"" Cruz told reporters outside the Supreme Court building on April 22. Cruz was referring to the political combat that took place in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s sudden death in 2016. During his presidential bid, Cruz highlighted the importance of having a Republican president whose appointments could give the Supreme Court a conservative lean.  Following Scalia’s death, Cruz declared the 2016 presidential election a ""referendum on the Supreme Court"" and joined Senate Republicans in blocking any nomination put forth by President Barack Obama. They blocked Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, for more than a year, arguing that the American public had a right to weigh in first via the election. (Garland is now serving as Biden’s attorney general.) Four years later, Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, raced to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the court after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just weeks before the 2020 election. In other words, McConnell used divergent approaches to the Garland and Barrett nominations to benefit the Republicans.  When asked why the GOP's actions don't qualify as partisan gamesmanship, Cruz's spokesperson Steve Guest doubled down on Cruz's statement. ""Absolutely nothing was rigged by Republicans. Presidents nominate judges. The Senate gives or withholds advice and consent. Those are the rules and Republicans followed them,"" Guest said. As the Barrett nomination was under consideration, PolitiFact wrote Republicans did have the power to do what he did, but we gave McConnell a Full Flop for changing his position between 2016 and 2020. In both cases, McConnell offered a justification that confirmations have proceeded when the presidency and the Senate are in unified control and have stalled when the two are under divided control. However, this isn’t a higher principle that led McConnell to his decision; it’s a cherry-picked, after-the-fact justification for the raw exercise of power he undoubtedly has. Legal experts were unimpressed with Cruz’s assertion that Republicans didn’t ""rig the game"" with the Garland and Barrett nominations. Paul M. Collins Jr., a professor of legal studies and political science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, said that the refusal to hold an up-or-down vote on Garland’s appointment in the hope that a Republican would win the 2016 presidential election ""involved an effort to temporarily alter the size of the court to advance the agenda of the Republican Party,"" Collins said. Paul Finkelman, a legal historian who is currently president of Gratz College, agreed, saying it was ""a political manipulation of the system,"" he said. ""And that is not how it’s supposed to work."" Emily Berman, an associate professor of law at the University of Houston, said it's hard to not classify Republicans’ 2016 maneuvering as ""rigging the game."" Deciding that there's an arbitrary deadline for judicial nominations during the Obama presidency, then ignoring that rule under the Trump presidency is, to Berman, a clear attempt to bring partisan preferences into the court. ""I don't know what else you call it. When you use your majority to make up the rules as you go along in ways that benefit your party, that's kind of the definition of rigging the game. You make the rules that lead to the outcome that you desire,"" Berman said. Cruz was a major proponent of Republicans’ 2016 blockade to Garland’s confirmation. With less than a month before Election Day in 2016, Cruz went as far as to say that he was in favor of blocking a liberal nominee under Hillary Clinton indefinitely.  While campaigning in Colorado for a Senate candidate, Cruz said that there is a ""long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices,"" Politico reported. ""I would note, just recently, that Justice (Stephen) Breyer observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job. That’s a debate that we are going to have,"" Cruz said. Cruz said, ""You didn't see Republicans when we had control of the Senate try to rig the game."" Republicans treated Garland’s nomination and Barrett’s nomination differently because they held the Senate majority and were able to exercise their power in ways that benefited their party’s goals. But  that doesn’t mean they weren’t rigging the game. There was no consistency to the way they handled the two nominations — the approaches were exactly opposite.

Yes, Foxconn is the largest taxpayer in Racine County
","Foxconn made headlines again after Gov. Tony Evers brokered a new deal with the technology giant that will create fewer jobs in Wisconsin but involves far less in taxpayer incentives. Under the new agreement, approved April 20, 2021 by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board, the company would create 1,454 jobs and invest $672 million by 2026 in exchange for a maximum of $80 million in tax credits. State officials expect to pay Foxconn up to $37 million over the next two years.  The plan dramatically scales back promises of 13,000 jobs and $10 billion in investment negotiated under former Gov. Scott Walker, A Republican, that would have cost the state nearly $3 billion. But the proposed LCD manufacturing facility in Mount Pleasant never came to fruition, and the company now seems to be shifting its focus to create a wider range of products on that campus.  Ahead of the announcement, state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, touted Foxconn’s relationship with Racine County and Mount Pleasant. ""It is the largest taxpayer in Racine County, and employs hundreds of people,"" he said in an April 19, 2021 statement. ""It remains a nucleus for our area and economic development."" That first point caught our eye — is Foxconn the largest taxpayer in Racine County? Let’s dig in. When asked for evidence to support Wanggaard’s claim, his chief of staff, Scott Kelly, pointed to lists that rank the highest property taxpayers in Racine County and noted the statement should have specified property taxes.  That said, the county does not collect other taxes such as a sales or corporate tax, according to county spokesman Mark Schaaf. So, by default, property taxes are the only ones in play. Foxconn did indeed top that list in 2020, with a $5 million property tax bill for land with an assessed value of over $260 million. The next highest taxpayer, SC Johnson, paid the county $2.2 million in 2020, while BCore Corridor and All Saints Medical Center paid roughly $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Foxconn ranked third in 2019 when it paid nearly $1.1 million in property taxes, but Schaaf said more development had occurred on the land since the previous assessment. Meanwhile, the company will continue funneling money to local governments through a tax-increment financing district in Mount Pleasant.  Foxconn must make TID payments starting in 2023 based on a minimum valuation of $1.4 billion — even if the actual dollar value ends up being lower. Schaaf said that will amount to about $30 million a year. The company also pays a $7.3 million special assessment each year.  In a statement, Wanggaard said Foxconn is the highest taxpayer in Racine County. The company did have the highest property tax bill in 2020 and cracked the top three in 2019, before some recent construction occurred. Wanggaard did not specify property taxes in his statement, but those are the only taxes that the county collects.  We rate this claim True. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/27/van-wanggaard/yes-foxconn-largest-taxpayer-racine-county/

Joe Biden banning burgers? Fox News, GOP politicians fuel false narrative
","One day after President Joe Biden pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half, Fox News and Fox Business Network personalities repeatedly and baselessly claimed that the move would also force Americans to say goodbye to hamburgers and steaks. ""To meet the Biden Green New Deal targets, America has to, get this, America has to stop eating meat,"" said Fox Business Network host Larry Kudlow, a former economic adviser to President Donald Trump, on April 23. ""No burger on July 4. No steaks on the barbecue."" Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption, a White House official confirmed to PolitiFact. Biden never mentioned red meat when he announced his plan to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030, a move that would double the U.S.’s commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But across several Fox News and Fox Business Network programs, the story told was different. Hosts such as Kudlow and Fox News’s Jesse Watters wrongly claimed that Americans would have to take steaks off their grills in order for the U.S. to hit Biden’s target, while the networks’ chyrons and graphics gave the same false claims a visual flair. One Fox News graphic, for example, said ""Biden’s climate requirements"" would ""cut 90% of red meat from diet"" by holding Americans to ""max 4 lbs per year"" and ""one burger per month.""  A screenshot of an inaccurate Fox News graphic about Joe Biden's climate plans. The graphic aired April 23 on ""America Reports."" The false claims about Biden restricting access to meat originated with a Daily Mail article that linked Biden’s goals to an unrelated January 2020 study on meat consumption. The article speculated that ""Americans may have to cut their red meat consumption by a whopping 90%,"" citing a University of Michigan study that had no link to Biden’s plan. ""The study was published in January 2020, when Trump was still president, so it had nothing to do with Biden or his climate change plan,"" said Tulane University professor Diego Rose, one of the study’s three co-authors. ""It's all just sensational goo from ‘Fox & Friends.’"" ""The study shows that if we eat less meat, especially beef, we could substantially reduce our dietary carbon footprint. But that change in behavior is a choice that individuals will make."" In a separate statement, co-authors Martin Heller and Gregory Keoleian of the University of Michigan explained that one hypothetical scenario the study considered was a 90% reduction in beef combined with a 50% reduction in other meats. They found that such a change would reduce ""diet-related greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural production"" by 50%. ""But this is not a specific recommended policy for achieving a 50% reduction in U.S. carbon emissions,"" Heller and Keoleian said. The false claims about Biden’s climate policies cropped up on social media after the Daily Mail story went live, but they got an assist from Fox News and Fox Business Network, with the first claims on those networks coming during the ""Fox & Friends"" morning talk show. ""Here’s an example of how it’s going to affect your lifestyle,"" host Brian Kilmeade said April 23. ""It’s going to cut 90% of red meat out of a diet. That’s four pounds a year."" ""Part of his climate or green targets are to cut our red meat,"" host Ainsley Earhardt repeated minutes later. ""He wants to cut out 90% of the red meat that you all eat."" Other Fox journalists followed suit, including Kudlow, Charles Payne and Jesse Watters. Watters said on ""The Five"" that to make Biden’s climate plan happen, ""Americans would have to cut red meat consumption by a whopping 90%. That means only one burger a month."" He repeated the same claim the following night on ""Watters’ World."" In the primetime hour, Fox News host Sean Hannity said April 23 that Biden’s plans ""will impact how you eat, including red meat."" On April 24, Jeanine Pirro asked, ""Do you like red meat? … Not so fast. The left with their Green New Deal wants to make sure you don’t."" The false claims were not limited to the talk show hosts, however. Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts opened his April 23 news segment on ""America Reports,"" a daytime news program, by telling viewers, ""Say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up for the climate agenda. That’s the finding of one study."" Later that night, anchor Shannon Bream asked her viewers, ""Could new climate impact plans limit you to just one burger a month?""  Correspondent Kevin Corke told Bream that under Biden’s plan, ""all Americans would have to limit their consumption of burgers by about one a month.""  Screenshots of Fox News and Fox Business Network graphics and chyrons about Joe Biden's climate plans. After fact-checkers and news outlets pointed out that the claims about Biden limiting meat were inaccurate, Roberts walked back the claims. ""That research from 2020 found that cutting back how much red meat people eat would have a drastic impact on harmful greenhouse gas emissions,"" Roberts said of the study. ""The data was accurate, but a graphic and the script incorrectly implied that it was part of Biden’s plan for dealing with climate change. That is not the case."" But the false narrative about Biden banning burgers had already taken hold. On social media, Republicans used the claims to attack Biden. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., branded him as the ""Hamburglar,"" while Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., told him to ""stay out of my kitchen."" ""Joe Biden’s climate plan includes cutting 90% of red meat from our diets by 2030,"" Boebert said, falsely, in her tweet. The since-corrected Fox News graphic was also shared widely, including in tweets by Donald Trump Jr. and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas. On Facebook, posts sharing it got tens of thousands of engagements and were flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In a graphic, Fox News claimed that ""Biden's climate requirements"" will ""cut 90% of red meat from diet"" to a ""max 4 lbs per year"" and ""one burger per month."" The graphic echoed other chyrons and statements made by the network’s personalities the day after Biden pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. But the graphic is wrong, and Roberts issued a correction days later. Biden’s climate plans do not include restrictions on red meat consumption, a White House official confirmed.

No, home mortgages don’t prove climate change is a scam.
","For Earth Day 2021, an Instagram account resurfaced a video of former oil executive Dan Peña claiming global climate change is the ""greatest fraud that’s been perpetrated on mankind this century."" The video was from an event in 2017 that Peña hosted with London Real, an online platform that’s been accused in the past of sharing COVID-19 misinformation. The Instagram post includes the video with the headline ""Global warming is the biggest scam of this century"" in large, white letters.  Peña’s bio from his official website identifies him as founder and former CEO of Great Western Resources Inc. In the video, Peña claims climate change isn’t real, and the proof is that financial institutions don’t allude to it in any of their investment and lending documents. He said banks wouldn’t offer multi-decade mortgages in places like Florida knowing the sea level would rise and destroy a home.  ""Because the financial institutions, the banks of this world, know it’s not going to happen,"" Peña said. ""You know those 30-, 40-year mortgages? The world will be over by then."" Instagram is owned by Facebook, and the post was flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Scientists and governments around the world have concluded that climate change is a real threat and that halting it will require immediate mitigation steps to reduce carbon emissions.  Scientists say there is a more than 95% chance that changes to the climate stem from more than a half century of human activity, according to NASA. Industrialization and the use of fossil fuels in vehicles and power plants have released large amounts of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere more than 250 times faster than from natural sources. Changes to the Earth’s climate have resulted in warmer temperatures, a rising sea level and more extreme weather events like flooding and wildfires. Financial intuitions have also acknowledged this risk, contrary to Peña’s claim. As far back as 2016, Sean Becketti, who was the president and chief economist of federally chartered mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, warned that the potential damage that climate change and rising sea levels will have on the housing market is ""likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession."" Climate change would increase the likelihood certain homes would be located in a flood-risk area, making lending more risky, he wrote, and lenders would have to weigh the financial risks and benefits of providing a 30-year mortgage to a home at risk of flooding if the chances of it happening continue to increase over time. ""In the housing crisis, a significant share of borrowers continued to make their mortgage payments even though the values of their homes were less than the balances of their mortgages,"" he wrote. ""It is less likely that borrowers will continue to make mortgage payments if their homes are literally underwater."" The New York Times has also reported local banks are starting to face the reality of providing mortgages for homes in flood-prone areas, since climate change has made severe weather events more likely. In coastal areas, some banks are requiring buyers to pay a 40% down payment for a home rather than the traditional 20%.  Local lenders have also begun offloading mortgages onto government-sponsored financial institutions like Fannie Mae to avoid losing money if a home is destroyed because of climate change, The New York Times reported.  Homes in high flood risk areas with mortgages from government-backed lenders are required to have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Administration. To combat climate change, and protect their investments, several major banks including Citi, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have made net-zero carbon emissions pledges. Each bank has committed to making its supply chain, operations and financing activities carbon neutral by 2050.  To achieve this, the banks have said they will transition to low-carbon and renewable energy sources for their buildings and finance more environmentally sustainable projects. ""Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time,"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement in March. ""The risks of not taking action are too great to ignore, and collective action is needed to avoid the significant impact on our most vulnerable communities."" JPMorgan Chase, which environmentalists have labeled one of the  the largest investors in fossil fuels, called climate change a ""global challenge"" that will take a collaborative effort between the private and public sectors to combat.  ""Research shows that climate impacts are occurring much sooner than anticipated and with increasing frequency,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement in 2019. ""The private sector has the opportunity to play a role in creating solutions that grow the economy, thereby supporting governments in their efforts to minimize long-term impacts to the planet and enable a more sustainable future for all people."" An Instagram post shows a video of Peña in which he claims that climate change is not real, and cites as evidence the fact that lenders still offer 30-year mortgages in flood-risk areas like Florida. An overwhelming majority of the world’s scientists have concluded climate change is real and puts humans at risk.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Pfizer — the vaccine Tenpenny singled out by name in the video — said there ""are no data to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine causes infertility."" The statement continued: ""It has been incorrectly suggested that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of a very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is partly shared with the placental protein, syncytin-1. The sequence, however, is so short, not even 4 amino acids in a row, but rather 4 shared amino acids in a sequence of 5, that it is very unlikely that it could lead to the body generating an immune response that would result in the body attacking itself or the placenta.""

A representative of the Democratic Caucus told us they used data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. He also said that they used data from Nov. 7 to Dec. 5, but since the text of the tweet said ""in November,"" we looked at Nov. 1 to 30. We looked at the data in a few ways. We began with data from Nov. 1 to 30, because that’s the period the tweet actually described. First, we looked at the seven-day rolling average of new daily cases. In other words, we took the number of new cases for each day, added that to the sum of new cases for the preceding six days and divided that number by seven. Looking at the rolling average helps smooth out fluctuations due to uneven reporting from day to day, such as weekends and holidays. In November, there were four days when that rolling average was above 4,500. For the first 10 days, this number was in the 2,000s and 3,000s. It reached 4,500 about halfway through the month, on Nov. 16. It peaked Nov. 19 at 4,753. We also took the daily average for the entire month — by adding up all the new cases from each day and dividing that by 30. That came out to 3,879 new cases a day. There were two days where the number of new cases topped 5,000: Nov. 13 with 5,870 new cases and Nov. 25 with 5,108. There are multiple agencies tracking this data, and sometimes the numbers can vary a little bit due to minor differences in reporting methods. So, we also took a look at data from the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. There, we found higher numbers, but still not quite what Democrats were claiming. For the seven-day rolling average, the CDC data shows 13 days in November where it surpassed 4,500. For the first week, the number sat in the 2,000s and 3,000s. It surpassed 4,500 on Nov. 13, when it was 4,647. Two days had averages above 5,000: Nov. 17 at 5,055 and Nov. 19 at 5,054. The daily average for the month was 4,251 new cases. What about Nov. 7 to Dec. 5? Although the text of the tweet said November, we figured we’d also check data from Nov. 7 to Dec. 5, which is what the Democratic caucus said it used. Here, we used DHSS data again, and the results were similar. In this 30-day period, there were also four days where the seven-day rolling average was above 4,500. None of the five days in December had a seven-day rolling average above 3,800. The six days in November that this time period excludes all have seven-day rolling averages below 3,200. The daily average of this 30-day period is 4,007 new cases a day. The Missouri House Democratic Caucus said that ""an average of nearly 5,000 Missourians were contracting COVID every day in November.""  This is an exaggeration. November was Missouri’s peak in COVID-19 cases, and daily new-case numbers were in the thousands, but to say that the average was near 5,000 every day is inaccurate. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/24/missouri-house-democratic-caucus/democrats-exaggerated-missouris-november-covid-19-/
