Democratic wag Paul Begala says Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell has been in office about as long as Sarah Palin was Alaska's governor
","Democratic banterer Paul Begala, a former Bill Clinton adviser who was once student-body president at the University of Texas, tried a Texas tack on CNN's ""Situation Room"" Dec. 6 to poke at Sarah Palin possibly being the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.

Palin governed Alaska, Begala said, which he described as home to fewer people than the Texas capital of Austin. An Austin American-Statesman editorial columnist, Ken Herman, later noted that Alaska has about 700,000 people, while Austin has about 786,000.

Begala continued: ""Now, quick: Who's the mayor of Austin? Turns out it's Lee Leffingwell. And Lee Leffingwell's been the mayor of Austin for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska, but nobody is saying that Lee Leffingwell ought to be president.""

We're not getting into the population contrast or Leffingwell's designs on the White House. But has he been hizzoner about as long as Palin was governor?

According to a city of Austin web page, Leffingwell's term as mayor started June 22, 2009. So he's held that post for nearly 18 months of his three-year term. Palin was sworn into office as Alaska's governor Dec. 4, 2006, according to the Associated Press. She resigned effective July 26, 2009, according to another AP news article, having served about 32 months of her four-year term.

We asked Begala about his calculation. He replied by e-mail that while he checked the populations of Austin and Alaska, he also ""should have checked the mayor's duration in office versus Palin's. I stand corrected.""

In the spirit of his broadcasted Palin dig, Begala added: ""So in another year and a half let's run the mayor for prez.""

No comment. His statement is False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC74B080>],/factchecks/2010/dec/15/paul-begala/democratic-wag-paul-begala-says-austin-mayor-lee-l/

Party switchers anger leaders but don't have to refund contributions
","
The 2010 election didn’t put an end to the growth of the Georgia Republican Party, which now dominates state government. 
After the ballots were counted, six members of the state House of Representatives and one state senator who raised money, ran for office and were elected as Democrats jumped to the GOP. 
""Foul!"" cried Democrats. And when state Rep. Doug McKillip of District 115 in Athens bolted for the Republicans earlier this month, party officials ramped up the rhetoric. McKillip switched parties after he was elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Party officials were outwardly angry with McKillip, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. 
Democrats openly called McKillip a ""turncoat"" and ended one press release about the defection with the formal definition of a ""Traitor: One who betrays another's trust or is false to an obligation or duty."" 
""His donors deserve a refund; his voters deserve a recall,"" state Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kidd pronounced in the Dec. 7 press release, a day after McKillip's party change. 
But do they? We at PolitiFact Georgia specifically wondered if there is anything that mandates a party-switcher to reimburse the folks who gave the candidate money. After all, most of those donors probably assumed McKillip would serve the party whose banner he carried during the election. 
McKillip said he has no immediate plans to make refunds. 
""No one has asked me to refund any money,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""I would certainly discuss it with anyone who asked for a refund. 
 ""I’m getting five-to-one positive reaction."" 
Kidd was not among the positive. 
""I used the word ‘deserve’ because I believe it,"" Kidd told PolitiFact Georgia. ""I think it’s a dishonest act to run in one party and then switch after you win."" 
But Kidd admitted she knew of nothing that would mandate a refund to donors. 
Michael Jablonski, general counsel for the state Democratic Party, said he was unaware of anyone who has refunded donor money after a party switch. 
""He has a moral obligation to return money to donors who thought he was a Democrat,"" Jablonski said. ""He should also resign so there can be a special election so people can determine if they want a Democrat or Republican in that office."" 
Jablonski pointed PolitiFact to the Democratic Party’s bylaws, which address any money given to a candidate by the party. 
Section BL1.8.2 states: ""The State Party shall seek reimbursement of any contribution, whether real or in-kind, made to a candidate who qualifies for office as a Democrat and, after qualification, switches to another party."" 
A review of McKillip’s campaign contribution reports on file with the State Ethics Commission, however, do not show any direct contributions by the state party to his campaign. 
Kerwin Swint, political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said he was unaware of anything that would force a party-switcher to return campaign cash. 
""There have been instances of officials returning money,"" he said, ""but it’s totally voluntarily."" 
Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray predicted McKillip’s donors will seek revenge during the next election cycle. 
""There will be political repercussions for Doug as the people in his district vote him out in two years,"" Gray said. ""It’s a liberal Democratic district."" 
Perhaps. But the state Legislature also will be redrawing its new political boundaries as part of the 10-year redistricting cycle before the next election. And McKillip’s newfound party will be in charge of that effort. 
Democratic officials are entitled to the belief that party defectors should refund donors' campaign contributions.  But the idea that a party-switcher actually owes refunds to his donors has no grounding in party rules or in state law. We rule the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF19C00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/15/jane-kidd/party-switchers-anger-leaders-dont-have-refund-con/

Sen. Sherrod Brown overstates amount that 'millionaires and billionaires' would get in tax deal
","
The rich are different from you and me.

With apologies to F. Scott Fitzgerald, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown has been prone recently to talk about the rich. They tend to want tax breaks. To be more precise, Republicans want lavish tax breaks for their rich constituents, says Brown, an Ohio Democrat.

And some of these breaks go too far, says Brown, citing the recent deal to extend all Bush-era tax breaks, which President Barack Obama and congressional Republican leaders announced on Dec. 6. Three days after that announcement, Brown told Kathleen Parker and Eliot Spitzer on CNN, ""You know basically what we're doing here is we're borrowing $700 billion from the Chinese. We're charging it to our kids’ and grandkids' credit cards for them to pay off later and then we're giving that $700 billion to millionaires and billionaires.""

That’s a lot of money, even for billionaires, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

We’re not here to ask whether whether it’s fair or  whether it will trickle down and help the economy. We’re asking something more basic: Will there really be $700 billion worth of tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires?

A short answer: No. That’s because Brown’s figure is loaded with an assumption and a rhetorical flourish.  

The assumption is that the top income tax bracket for people with high incomes will remain at 35 percent for 10 more years. That’s roughly what it would take for the tax cuts for the nation’s top 2 percent of earners to reach a cost of $700 billion, according to projections in August by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Republicans at the time were pushing for a permanent extension of all the cuts that Congress passed in 2001 and 2003, and tax writers in the House of Representatives asked the joint committee to run a cost projection.

The problem with using that figure now is that the Obama-GOP deal, and the resulting tax package that Congress could approve this week, calls for extending the tax breaks for only two more years. A 10-year extension is not on the table.

It is true, as Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak notes, that Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other economic advisers used the $700 billion figure as recently as September. They sounded a lot like Brown. But that was before the White House cut the two-year extension deal.

What figure should Brown have used? The answer depends on the rhetorical flourish we mentioned, which is this: That $700 billion figure for ten years includes a whole lot of people who are neither millionaires nor billionaires.

The figure, in fact, includes all single filers earning more than $200,000 a year and joint filers earning more than $250,000.

If you added up all the tax filers expected to report incomes of more than $200,000 in 2012, you’d get 7.5 million people, according to a rough calculation using figures from the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. But out of that 7.5 million people, only 531,000 would be from people with incomes of $1 million or more.

So the figure used by Brown -- and previously used by others -- includes ""millionaires, billionaires and a whole bunch of people with incomes below that,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

Using a slightly different technical perspective, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that out of 161 million tax filers nationwide, 315,000 earn at least $1 million.

People earning less than that can be considered millionaires, of course, because of their  home values, investments and net worth. But to call a two-earner couple making $251,000 ""millionaires and billionaires"" exaggerates matters, and the $700 billion projection that Brown used never included such an assumption.

So if the cost is not $700 billion for millionaires and billionaires, what is it?

The Joint Committee projections earlier this year showed that a single year of extensions for just the $1 million-and-above filers would cost $32.7 billion. Run out over 10 years, that would come to $327 billion, although this is a rough estimate because the number of filers and their incomes and deductions can vary year to year.

The best estimate available comes from Joint Committee projections released on Dec. 10, a day after Brown spoke on CNN. They show the cost of retaining both the 33 percent tax bracket and the 35 percent bracket for two more years would come to $60.7 billion. This, too, covers a lot more people than millionaires and billionaires.

There is a chance that the two-year deal will be extended again in 2012. Obama, who is up for re-election that year, has not said as much, but Spitzer suggested it to Brown on CNN, and Brown agreed.

""Nobody really believes this is only a two-year extension of middle class tax cuts or the payroll tax holiday or the income tax cut or frankly the estate tax cut,"" Brown said. ""I don't think anybody thinks that's only a two-year extension. I think it's well into the future. Who knows how to predict, five or 10 years out?""

But he did know how to project, and he chose 10 years.

How to rate Brown’s statement, then? 
Those are two key points on which Brown’s statement simply is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF0E340>],/factchecks/2010/dec/15/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-overstates-amount-millionaires-a/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Income', 'Mt. Hood Community College']","
MHCC says it can't afford salaries ""far above the average of community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.”
","
Administrators and faculty at Mount Hood Community College are negotiating a new contract in a tight budget year. The 2010-11 budget is expected to fall $5 million short of projected needs. Administrators want to curb salaries and benefits, arguing that faculty at the two-year school in Gresham are the most generously compensated in the Northwest.

Mt. Hood enrolls about 33,000 students and is in the top five of Oregon's 17 community colleges. It lacks the profile given its larger sisters -- Portland and Clackamas community colleges -- yet, here are two surprising claims from Mt. Hood’s website and press release: 
In a Nov. 22 statement, the college says: ""We can no longer pay salaries to our most experienced faculty that are far above the average of community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.""

PolitiFact Oregon never realized community college pay could be so rewarding to paychecks, and so crushing to a school’s budget. The numbers, we figured, would be easy to vet.

In the faculty negotiations section of Mt. Hood’s website is a link to the National Education Association’s higher education salary study, released this spring. The average salary for faculty at Mt. Hood was $69,200 in 2008-09 -- indeed the highest of 17 community colleges in Oregon, 34 community colleges in Washington, and three schools in Idaho. The average benefit at Mt. Hood for the year was $27,800, again the highest of 54 colleges. Total average pay and benefits came to $97,000.

For context, average faculty pay at Portland Community College, the state’s largest two-year, was $62,100 with benefits at $23,800 for a total $85,900 in 2008-09. Faculty at Clackamas Community College averaged $66,000 in salary and $24,600 in benefits, for a total $90,600.  

(It looks as if Mt. Hood and Clackamas were more in line in 2007-08. Average compensation at Mt. Hood was $94,400, and $93,900 at Clackamas. Salaries are based on nine- or 10-month  contracts.) So you can check the first claim as True.

The second claim is that base salary for full-time faculty at top scale at Mt. Hood was more than 8 percent higher than average top pay of community colleges closest in size to Mt. Hood, in 2009-10. The numbers pencil out, based on Mt. Hood’s figures. The average of top salaries at Clackamas, Chemeketa, Linn-Benton, Lane and Portland community colleges is $74,735, compared with $80,864 at Mt. Hood, or a difference of 8.2 percent.

We checked with contracts for the individual schools and confirmed that Mt. Hood’s figures are pretty much correct, with the exception of Lane Community College, which was off by roughly $1,000 so the difference is actually 7.3 percent. In any case, it’s a similar sized gap.

But Shannon Valdivia, a speech instructor at Mt. Hood, raises an excellent question of calendar years. Colleges differ in how many days to expect of faculty. So faculty at Mt. Hood and at Portland worked 180-day calendars in 2009-10; Linn-Benton faculty worked 164 days; Chemeketa, Clackamas and Lane had 175 days. Calculate by day, and top earners at Linn-Benton earned the most at $475 a day. Mt. Hood came in second with $449 earned a day.

The average of the five schools was $431.24 a day -- or 4 percent less than Mt. Hood’s $449.
Now, we’re skipping comparisons based on health benefits because faculty choose different types of plans. But know that Mt. Hood is on the nicer side with faculty kicking in a maximum of $75 a month for family coverage. On a per-day basis, top base pay at Mt. Hood and Linn-Benton are comparable. So we’ll rate claim No. 2 Half True.

So, why is pay at Mt. Hood so high? Well, more than half of the 156 faculty at the college are at top scale. That’s a large percentage. Eighty people are in step 1 of a 14-step pay scale; 76 are in steps 2 to 14. The faculty union says some people were hired at too high a step; college administrators say the increase between steps is too big. (Faculty climb from one ""step"" to the next once a year; people who are at the top step will get cost-of-living adjustments if bargained for.) But that’s neither here nor there.  

If you combine the two claims together, we rate the overall claim on pay as Mostly True. It’s accurate -- average pay is high in large part because top tier pay is high, and so many people are in that top tier -- but it needs just a tiny bit of additional information on pay broken down by day.

Florida congressman says DREAM Act means lower tuition for illegal immigrants
","
A controversial plan to provide a path to permanent legal residency for children brought to the United States illegally continues to rise toward the top of the agenda in the final days of the 111th Congress.

The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States illegally to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or in the military and meet other obligations. But opponents have been raising several objections about the proposed legislation, saying it could create a path for family members to citizenship, that the measure means amnesty for more than 2 million illegal immigrants and that the costs of illegal immigration already are ginormous.

PolitiFact already has dealt with several of these claims, which you can read about here, but we found another one from Florida Republican U.S. Rep. John Mica that we wanted to consider.

Back on Nov. 18, 2010, Mica appeared on the MSNBC show The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell to talk about several of the Democrats top end-of-the-year priorities, including the DREAM Act. At one point, Mica, O'Donnell and Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York, debated whether the DREAM Act would grant lower state university tuition to illegal immigrants who qualified.

""Well first of all, on the question on the DREAM Act, no -- no to granting lower tuition to illegals,"" Mica said, who was first elected to the U.S. House in 1993 and is the incoming Transportation Committee chairman.

""It does not do that, Congressman. It does not do that,"" O'Donnell jumped back in. ""You can vote against it for another reason, but not that one.""

We wanted to see who's right?

The DREAM Act explained

One of the problems when talking about the ""DREAM Act"" has been that there have in fact been several different versions of the legislation floating around Congress. The versions all have the same general goal -- providing a path to legal residency for illegal immigrants brought here by their parents or someone else -- but the terms of each piece of legislation were different.

Congress finally set the boundaries of the legislation on Dec. 7, when the House passed a version of the DREAM Act 216-198. The legislation actually was tucked in as an amendment to an innocuous bill already approved by the U.S. Senate. But the bill must still return to the Senate for a second vote.

Under the bill, H.R. 5281, illegal immigrants would be able to apply for conditional nonimmigrant status for an initial period of five years if:

1.) They are under 30;
2.) Arrived in the United States before the age of 16;
3.) Have lived here at least the last five years;
4.) Received a U.S. high school diploma or GED;
5.) And have largely avoided run-ins with the law (you can get all the details by reading the bill text).

Those immigrants could then apply for a second five-year period if they serve in the U.S. military or complete at least two years of a community college or undergraduate program. And after 10 years, immigrants could then become legal permanent residents.

As part of the program, immigrants could receive certain federal student loans, but not federal Pell grants, food stamps or Medicaid. They must also pay application fees totaling up to $2,525.

How many people are we talking about?

In July, a nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analysis of the DREAM Act concluded there are about 2.1 million people who would be potentially eligible under the DREAM Act. But the number crunching arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that only about 700,000 people would have conditional nonimmigrant status in 2020 -- the year before anyone could become a permanent legal resident. CBO estimated that less than half of the individuals who would initially apply for conditional nonimmigrant status would qualify to apply for a five-year extension.

Tuition breaks for illegals

Mica isn't saying there's some type of DREAM Act tuition discount for people taking advantage of the legislation (there isn't).

He's talking about DREAM Act participants being able to qualify for in-state tuition, because they would be legal residents of a state just like other U.S. citizens. So, they'd be paying less in tuition than someone who attends an out-of-state university or a foreign national attending a U.S. university with a student visa, Mica claims.

Answering whether Mica is right or not is not as simple as saying ""Yes"" or ""No."" Let's take it a step at a time.

First, 11 states already allow for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The policies in those states -- California, Texas, New York, Utah, Washington, Oklahoma, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Wisconsin -- won't be affected by the DREAM Act. (The California Supreme Court ruled unanimously last month that illegal immigrant students may pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities).

Second, the legislation that passed the House on Dec. 7 does not mention in-state tuition, and no version ever considered would mandate or force states to offer DREAM Act participants in-state rates. That's an opinion shared by Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, and by Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes the DREAM Act.

So where's the rub?

One version of the bill -- a version that never came to a vote -- sought to repeal a section of a 1996 immigration law that seemingly pertains to the issue at hand. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act included language attempting to prevent state universities from giving benefits to in-state illegal immigrants that they didn't offer to out-of-state U.S. citizens.

But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said there is disagreement about the meaning of the provision, whether it applies to tuition and whether Congress exceeded its powers in crafting the language. Also, states have effectively ignored the rule, or at least have agreed to interpret it differently. The repeal of the 1996 language is not included in the version of the DREAM Act that passed the House.

More importantly, and more germane to this fact check, however, is debate over the impact of enacting the DREAM Act. While granting DREAM Act participants in-state tuition is not part of the federal legislation, it may happen as a result of the legislation, Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies argues.

The scenario, he said, is clear.

An illegal immigrant in Florida, say, applies for and is granted a conditional nonimmigrant status for five years. That person then is a legal resident of Florida. If so, why would he or she not be able to receive in-state tuition, Camarota asks. And if somehow denied in-state tuition, wouldn't the applicant have a valid legal challenge?

""The law isn't intended per se to do it, but it can't help but happen,"" he says.

Others argue that universities could simply ask prospective students if they are DREAM Act participants to separate the two sets of state residents.

""The House-passed legislation is silent on in-state tuition, leaving in place existing rules and approaches undertaken by different states with respect to allowing in-state tuition for unauthorized students,"" Mittelstadt said.

Our rating

Appearing on MSNBC, Mica said that passing the DREAM Act would mean ""granting lower tuition to illegals."" But we think he's really stretching to get there.

The version of the DREAM Act that passed in the House -- as well as prior versions that were debated -- did not include language requiring states to offer DREAM Act participants in-state tuition. The closest a version of the DREAM Act came was to propose repealing a federal rule that some have interpreted as preventing states from offering in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. But that version never came to a vote. 
Moreover, 11 states already offer in-state tuition, so rates in those places -- including California and Texas -- couldn't go lower. 
As for the other states, the only real argument is that passing the DREAM Act could have the consequence of forcing them to offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants as well. And we guess it could. But there's no definitive evidence that it would, just conjecture and speculation.  And it certainly isn't expressed in the bill language. 
So we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE1BE80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/14/john-mica/florida-congressman-says-dream-act-means-lower-tui/

Tom Coburn says one of every 19 Americans gets SSDI or SSI payments
","
At a Dec. 1, 2010, meeting of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- the Simpson-Bowles commission that was tasked with finding a solution for soaring deficits -- one of the panel's members, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., cited disability payments as an example how government spending has gotten ""out of control.""

""We've created dependency,"" Coburn said. ""And one great example is one in 19 Americans today get SSDI or SSI. That's one in 19 Americans (who) are disabled, and when the law says you're only disabled if there's no job in the economy you can perform, and we don't address that issue in this plan.""

We won't take sides on the question of whether SSDI and SSI should be cut or modified -- as Coburn and other critics have suggested, citing both cost and allegations of fraud by applicants -- but we were intrigued by the idea that more than 5 percent of Americans receive payments from one program or the other. We'd bet that most Americans who don't receive SSDI or SSI benefits are only dimly aware of these programs. Yet, if Coburn is right, these programs cover  more than the percentage of Americans who are of Asian-American heritage (4.5 percent), more than double the number of American Jews (approximately 2 percent) and five times the number of American Indians (1 percent). So we decided to see if Coburn was right.

First, some background on the two programs, both of which are run by the Social Security Administration.

Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is funded by Social Security taxes paid by workers, employers and the self-employed. To be eligible for SSDI, a worker must have earned sufficient credits as a worker paying into the Social Security system. Typically, a worker will receive disability benefits if he or she becomes blind or disabled, or if a now-deceased spouse earned SSDI. Payments are based on the insured worker's Social Security earnings record. The program is set to pay out almost $124 billion in benefits this year.

By contrast, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is financed through general revenues rather than by taxes specifically paid into the Social Security system. SSI disability benefits are payable to adults or children who are disabled or blind, have limited income and resources and meet certain requirements on living arrangements. The monthly payment varies up to the maximum federal benefit rate, and it may be supplemented by state payments or decreased by other income. The federal government appropriated almost $46 billion for its share of benefits this year.

Supporters say the programs provide needed support to the most vulnerable members of American society. But the programs have their share of critics, many of whom point to the steady increase in the programs' cost and the risk of abuse by people who are not truly too disabled to work.

For purposes of consistency, we looked at the 2009 annual reports for each program, because both offered statistics for the same month -- December 2009.

For that month, SSDI benefits were paid to 8.9 million recipients. SSI paid benefits that same month to 7.7 million people. Combined, that works out to 16.6 million people receiving benefits from one of the two programs in December 2009.

If you divide that figure by the total United States population in 2009 of 307 million people, it works out to be 5.4 percent, or just slightly more than one out of every 19 Americans.

But before we declare Coburn completely correct, let's look at how many people collect both SSDI and SSI. We couldn't find those numbers for December 2009, but for November 2010, the overlap was about 1.8 million people. If you assume that the number was roughly similar for December 2009, then 4.8 percent of the U.S. population receives either SSDI or SSI -- or one out of every 20.7 people.

That makes Coburn very close, so we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE9E340>],/factchecks/2010/dec/14/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-says-one-every-19-americans-gets-ssdi-o/

Sen. Bernie Sanders says 99.7% of American families would be exempt from estate tax
","
While the debate over the compromise tax agreement proposed by President Barack Obama has focused mostly on Bush's income tax cuts and whether they ought to be extended to wealthy Americans, the issue of estate taxes has also become a sticking point for some legislators.

Under the plan, the estate tax rate would be set at 35 percent, with an effective exemption of $5 million.

Many Republicans had hoped to do away with the estate tax altogether, and Democrats last year had proposed a higher rate: 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million.

The compromise has ruffled feathers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., for example, said he would not support the plan because he considered the estate tax compromise a tax increase. We ruled that claim Barely True.

Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and a self-described democratic socialist, sent out a message via Twitter on Dec. 13, 2010, saying that under the estate tax plan, ""99.7% of American families will not pay 1 nickel in an estate tax. This is not a tax on the rich, this is a tax on the very, very, very rich.""

According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Sanders is correct.

The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 99.7 percent of estates were exempt from the estate tax in 2009 when the first $3.5 million of an estate was exempt. Even fewer people would be subject to the tax if the threshold is increased to $5 million, as proposed in the compromise tax plan.

Under the compromise plan, less than 2/10 of 1 percent of estates would be subject to the estate tax next year, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. That means more than 99.8 percent would be completely exempt.
 
The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3,600 estates would be subject to the tax under the $5 million threshold. Those 3,600 estates would have to pay an estimated $11.4 billion in estate taxes under the compromise tax plan.

Estate tax rates have fluctuated through modern history. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same time increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax disappeared altogether in 2010.

But the Bush plan only had a 10-year window because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. Barring a new tax agreement, the rate was set to revert next year to a 55 percent rate with an effective exemption of $1 million.

Last year, Democrats proposed a plan to permanently set the estate tax rate at 2009 levels -- 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Had that plan gone through, the Tax Policy Center estimates it would have subjected 6,460 estates to a tax (bring in an estimated $18.2 billion). If no tax plan passes, and the rate goes back to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million, an 43,540 estates would have to pay (bringing in an estimated $34.4 billion next year).

Sanders was correct that in 2009, when the effective exemption was $3.5 million, about 99.7 percent of all estates were exempt and didn't pay anything. The compromise plan -- which would set effective exemption at $5 million -- would push the number of exempted estates even higher, so that more than 99.8 percent of estates would not pay anything.

Democratic Party says Scott Walker killed 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin by opposing high-speed rail
","
A barrage of invective hit Wisconsin Governor-elect Scott Walker after the federal government announced it would give nearly all of Wisconsin’s $810 million in high-speed rail funds to other states.

Half a dozen local, state and national Democrats issued statements Dec. 9, 2010 condemning the Republican for his staunch opposition to the Milwaukee-to-Madison train, all focusing on the loss of jobs that would result.

The Democratic Party of Wisconsin joined in with the highest figure, declaring that Walker had ""killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs.""

Walker, who takes office Jan. 3, could rightly be credited -- or blamed, depending on your point of view -- with killing the rail line. Indeed, so vehement was his vow to stop its construction that, in our view, he prematurely declared the proposal dead even when it still had some locomotion.

There is no doubt that jobs tied to the train will be lost; Walker has acknowledged as much.

But what about the 13,000 figure used by the state Democrats?

If the scenery on this ride looks familiar, it’s because we’ve been down this track  before.

We rated as Barely True a November claim by the Sierra Club that refusing the federal rail money would cost Wisconsin nearly 10,000 permanent jobs -- that is, jobs aside from the construction-related ones. The claim relied on an analysis based on a host of assumptions, including the impact of an entirely built network connecting Midwest cities.

Given the more recent outcry over the rail money, we decided to start our count anew.

The Democratic Party told us it pegged the loss at 13,000 jobs based on a report on the high-speed rail project by the WISPIRG Foundation, which supported the project. WISPIRG is a nonprofit group that says it ""works to protect consumers and promote good government.""

Bruce Speight, WISPIRG’s state director, said WISPIRG used Wisconsin’s federal grant application for the rail money to arrive at the 13,000 jobs.  

Here are the number of full-time-equivalent jobs the state’s application projected would be created during construction of the Milwaukee-to-Madison line: 
Think about the figures this way:

The state projected that in Year 1, the rail line construction itself, plus economic activity generated by the construction, would create 1,281 jobs’ worth of work; in Year 2, there would be 4,060 jobs’ worth of work; and so on.

The figures represent ""job-years,"" not actual jobs, said Jon Dyck, a fiscal analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. A job-year, he said, is one person being employed for one year as a result of the rail line construction.

In a memo Dyck wrote on the project, he cited the number of jobs per year that the state had projected in its grant application. He did not add the figures for the six years together to arrive at a total jobs figure.

But that is what the Democratic Party did -- just as WISPIRG did in its report -- to get its total of 13,000 jobs.

That approach can lead to double counting. Clearly, some of the people hired in Year 1 will also be working in Year 2.

What’s more, the state’s numbers show a rise of employment, as construction peaks, and then a fall as it tails off.

In Year 3, for example, the amount of work was projected to produce 5,535 jobs, but that number drops to 1,847 in Year 4.

But under the math used to get to 13,000, they’re actually added together, for a total of 7,382 jobs in years 3 and 4.  

Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was the first to use that approach.

After the state filed its grant application in October 2009, Doyle’s office issued a news release saying the rail line would create ""nearly 13,000 jobs by 2013.""

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel later reported, however, that the only way to reach that figure (12,723) would be to add the jobs from years 1 through 4.

If you carried out Doyle’s job counting over the full six years that were covered in the state’s application, you would exceed 13,000 jobs -- the number the Democratic Party seized on.

Doyle’s administration defended its method of counting to the newspaper, saying the grant application simply followed a formula requested by the federal government.

But Doyle’s job counting led the WISPIRG Foundation to issue a correction of its report, Speight told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Since then, WISPIRG, like some other rail supporters, estimates only that ""thousands"" of jobs would have been created by the Milwaukee-to-Madison line.

Indeed, in the statement Doyle issued after loss of the federal funds, he referred only to ""thousands of jobs"" that the money could have created in Wisconsin.

The Democratic Party, however, stayed with 13,000 -- not only in its news release, but in a billboard it put up in Milwaukee four days later.

That brings us to the end of the line.

The state Democratic Party claimed that Walker’s opposition to high-speed rail not only cost Wisconsin nearly $810 million in federal funds, but it ""killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs."" The party relied on a report by an organization that two months earlier had disavowed the number after it was discredited by the Journal Sentinel.  

Perhaps thousands of jobs were at stake, but there is no evidence that 13,000 jobs were lost. What’s more, that has been clear for some time -- and most everyone else has stopped using the figure.

State Sen. Teresa Fedor laments seriousness of human trafficking in Toledo
","
Ohio lawmakers were notorious this legislative session for not being able to agree on much.

The state’s budget required several weeks of overtime before passage and both chambers combined to set a new modern-day collective low in the number of bills passed.
That makes Senate Bill 235 — the state’s stab at cracking down on human trafficking — all the more noteworthy as it sailed through both the Ohio House and Senate by unanimous votes this December.

And Gov. Ted Strickland is expected to sign it.

The driving force behind passage of the bill was state Sen. Teresa Fedor, a Toledo Democrat, who began working on the legislation in 2005. During the Ohio Senate’s floor debate on Dec. 1, Fedor gave a passionate speech comparing human trafficking, which often is a feature of prostitution rings involving juveniles, to the slavery trade.

As Fedor made her case for the legislation, she mentioned the frequent crackdowns on human trafficking that have taken place in recent years in her hometown of Toledo before uttering a startling statistic.

""Sadly, in Ohio, Toledo, in my district is fourth in the nation behind much bigger cities — Miami, Las Vegas, Portland (Ore.) — in number of human trafficking arrests and rescues,"" Fedor said.

Undoubtedly, human trafficking is a problem in Ohio. We certainly are home to our share of teenage runaways, pimps and the problems that come with it. But could Toledo, the 60th largest city in the country with about 316,000 residents, really be fourth worst in the whole country?

Sounded like a case for PolitiFact Ohio.

Asked for research to back up the ranking, Fedor’s office punted to Celia Williamson, a University of Toledo professor who chaired a special Research and Analysis Subcommittee of the Ohio Trafficking in Persons Study Commission formed by the Ohio Attorney General’s Office.

Williamson said Toledo’s No. 4 status comes from statistics compiled by the Northwest Ohio Innocence Lost Task Force, an FBI task force that was one of 39 created in 2004 across the country to crack down on human trafficking. The commission’s report listed Miami, Portland and Las Vegas as Nos. 1, 2 and 3.

However, the Northwest Ohio task force’s statistics actually show that Toledo is fourth in the nation in the number of human trafficking arrests, investigations and rescues that involve minors, Williamson clarified.

But she said she thinks the ranking is more of a reflection of heightened awareness of the problem in Toledo — rather than the problem truly being worse in Toledo than most other places in America.

""My personal opinion is that Cleveland is worse,"" she said. ""Cincinnati, Columbus and Youngstown all have a problem that is equal to Toledo, but they don’t have the resources in place to respond. Toledo is not unique at all, and soon we will not have that title. We just have a better response.""

While the Toledo FBI office didn’t return calls, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson said that the No. 4 ranking attributed to the Northwest Ohio Innocence Lost Task Force ranking comes from comparing the statistics from a pair of intense three-day sweeps made simultaneously in 2009 by all 39 task forces.

The results of those sweeps showed Toledo as having the fourth-highest number of juveniles arrested, investigated and rescued over a pair of three-day periods in 2009 among the 39 cities in the United States where these FBI task forces exist.

And while Wilson called Toledo ""a city of origin"" with ""generational pimps,"" he also said he didn’t think the problem in Toledo was any worse than any other major metropolitan city.

""Was Toledo way up there statistically in kids we recovered? Absolutely,"" Wilson said. ""Is there more child prostitution in Toledo than in other major metropolitan areas? Maybe not.""

Wilson said more than 80 children had been rescued away from Toledo prostitution rings since 2004, but that the No. 4 ranking is still probably misleading.

""I don’t know if that’s (number four ranking) completely accurate,"" said Wilson. ""We do know that we had a problem in Toledo, we know that it’s a city of origin and we know we’re making progress there.""

So let’s review what we found out: 
There is a small element of truth behind Fedor’s statement; the 2009 report did have Toledo at No. 4 among 39 cities across the country that had arrest sweeps. But Fedor mischaracterized the statistic, omitting the word ""minor"" in her speech on the Senate floor.  And both the state’s top expert and the FBI suspect the statistic is misleading.

That’s why we rate her claim as Barely True -- but just barely.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7C1F80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/14/teresa-fedor/state-sen-teresa-foder-laments-seriousness-human-t/

Beaverton tries to take the mantle of Oregon’s most diverse city
","
We like very specific claims here at PolitiFact Oregon. It makes our work easier -- less room for waffling by the person making the statement, you know?

Well, a recent press release by the city of Beaverton that innocuously promoted an upcoming guest speaker, made one such very specific claim. At the tail end of the release, in a small blurb about the city’s bona fides, was this sentence: ""Beaverton also enjoys the most diverse population (by percentage of population) among Oregon cities.""

Now, no offense to Beaverton, but that just didn’t seem remotely possible. That alone made it a good candidate for a fact check. Add to that the very specific measurement of ""by percentage of population,"" and we just couldn’t help ourselves.

We decided to check in on three cities and go from there should Beaverton come out on top in terms of diversity. So, we started by pulling demographic information, as reported by the 2009 American Community Survey, for Beaverton, Portland and Hillsboro. (To get the most recent data, go here and do ""Principal City"" search for the Portland-Beaverton-Vancouver metro area.)

Here’s what we found: In the ""race"" category -- which includes designations like ""Black or African American,"" ""Asian,"" and ""American Indian and Alaska Native"" -- Portland is by far the least diverse with 82 percent of respondents reporting their ""race"" as white and about 23 percent reporting as some other designation. Beaverton comes in at a 76 percent and 28.5 percent respectively. Hillsboro is the most diverse of the three, with 73 percent and 32.1 percent respectively.

(Yes, we realize these numbers don’t add up to 100 percent. That’s the result of double reporting by some respondents. Luckily, all cities have about the same instance of overreporting -- about 5 percent.)

There’s one other category to look at before we wrap this up. The census asks respondents whether they identify as ""hispanic or latino"" separately from the race category. If you look at that category alone, Hillsboro comes out on top again with 23 percent identifying as either hispanic or latino. Beaverton comes in second with 18 percent and Portland comes in a distant third with 9 percent.

We called up the city of Beaverton to tell them what we’d found. Jordan Imlah, a spokesman for the mayor’s office, looked into it and sent us this response: ""You are indeed correct with your current census figures. We got our stats from older census figures and an Oregonian article published in 2007 by Dave Anderson.""

Imlah said the city will now start billing itself as ""one of the most diverse populations in Oregon.""

The ruling is pretty easy here. The city of Beaverton said it had ""the most diverse population (by percentage of population) among Oregon cities."" The American Community Survey shows that’s just not the case. And the city now admits its numbers are old. We rate this claim False. 
Note: A colleague of ours asked why it was that we had focused on Hillsboro and Portland as possible cities with higher minority presence and offered Woodburn as one city that would probably surpass all three in that regard. The reason we chose those two cities was simply that 2009 numbers -- the most recent -- are available only for larger communities. Since we published this PolitiFact, however, the Census Bureau released a 2005-2009 data set. It's not quite as current as the one we used, but it does offer new numbers for smaller cities, like Woodburn. So, we decided to take a look at the demographic breakdown for Woodburn. Our colleague was on to something. About 40 percent of respondents there identified as a race other than ""white"" and 56 percent identified as Hispanic or Latino. Woodburn far outpaces Hillsboro, Beaverton and Portland insofar as diversity by percentage of population is concerned.

"['Georgia', 'Atlanta Braves']","
Braves go back, back, back
","
Most baseball fans, particularly in Atlanta, know about the Atlanta Braves' streak of 14 consecutive division championships between 1991 and 2005.

We here at AJC PolitiFact Georgia won't talk about the fact that the Braves won just one World Series during that time.

But few baseball fans are aware of another streak the Braves proudly claim: that they've stayed in business longer than any team in the country. The Braves make the claim on their website, saying they are ""the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America.""

Really?

The Braves came to Atlanta from Milwaukee, but their roots go back even further, to Boston. The Braves are one of the original National League franchises, which began in the late 19th century.

A claim that they are the longest-running sports franchise in America is obviously a source of civic pride for the Braves and Atlanta, if true.

So, is it true?

We were told two other teams, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds, could dispute the Braves' claim. A Cubs official in their media relations office told us he used to work for the Reds and that they're the oldest franchise. He suggested we call the Reds Hall of Fame.

Many believe the Reds are baseball's first franchise, and it appears that they are. In 1869, a former cricket player named Harry Wright organized a band of nine players that barnstormed the country playing a new game we now call baseball. The players dressed in white knickerbockers and wore flashy red hosiery. They were really good, or their opponents were really bad. The team, which became known as the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was 57-0. Wright played center field and managed the team and likely didn't take himself out of many games. He was eventually enshrined into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

The Red Stockings didn't play in 1871, but four of those players relocated to Boston that year and played in the National Association, winning the pennant from 1872 through 1875, according to Baseball Hall of Fame Library research director Tim Wiles. The team was known as the Boston Red Stockings.

In 1876, a new league formed called the National League. The Red Stockings, or the Red Caps, as some called them, were part of the eight-team league. Wright was on the team. The team, the Braves say, eventually became known as the Beaneaters to connect with their Boston fan base -- and to avoid any confusion with the Cincinnati Reds. The Cincinnati team was expelled from the league in 1880 for, among other things, serving beer during their games.

Meanwhile, the Beaneaters became a force in the National League, signing Mike ""King"" Kelly, the Babe Ruth of his day, for what was then a stunning $10,000. That salary, accounting for inflation, is about $250,000 today. In 1912, the Beaneaters changed their name to the Boston Braves. The franchise stayed in Beantown for another 40 years before moving to Milwaukee in 1953. The Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966.

But let's go back to the Cubs for a second. The franchise's origins began in 1871 as the Chicago White Stockings. Wiles noted that the team didn't play in 1872 and 1873 because of the great fire of 1871, which killed about 300 people. One third of the city's 300,000 residents lost their homes in the blaze, according to the Encyclopedia of Chicago.

The two years the Cubs lost to the fire gives the Braves the advantage to the claim of the oldest continuous franchise, says Wiles.

""(The fire) makes Boston a strong historical organization,"" Wiles, a Cubs fan, conceded.

The Boston Red Stockings were one of three teams to play all five seasons in the National Association, according to Baseball-Reference.com, a website that's used by many baseball writers. The others were the New York Mutuals and the Philadelphia Athletics. The Mutuals did not continue after 1876, according to the website. The Athletics stopped playing after 1876 and, after a couple of restarts, have been in business since 1901 and are playing in Oakland.

The matter gets confusing when you look at Baseball-Reference.com's list of when each of today's 30 teams in Major League Baseball. It lists the first year for the Braves and Cubs as 1876. Sean Forman, president of Sports Reference LLC, the parent company of Baseball-Reference.com, said he does agree that the Braves franchise began in 1871.

""It's pretty clear that they were a franchise,"" Forman said.

MLB, Forman said, doesn't officially recognize the National Association.

Why? ""I'm not sure,"" Forman said.

Wiles said he considers the National Association a professional sports league because the players were paid and the teams were organized.

Bob Epling, a sports historian based in Cherokee County, also sides with the Braves, for many of the same reasons that Wiles stated.

Epling doesn't believe there's a team in the three other major sports leagues in America that can make a claim. Football, he said, was semi-professional until the 1920s. The team now known as the Arizona Cardinals is believed to be the first pro football team. It began in Chicago in 1898 as the Morgan Athletic Club.

Pro basketball first began in Trenton, N.J. in 1896, but the oldest continuously running teams in that sport didn't get their start until the 1940s. The Harlem Globetrotters, if you're curious, started in 1923.

The National Hockey League began in 1917.

""I might rate (the Braves' claim) pretty high on the Truth-o-Meter,"" said Epling, an associate professor of physical education and sport studies at Reinhardt University.

The Cincinnati Red Stockings, which many people view as a predecessor of the Reds, are apparently baseball's first professional sports franchise. But that is not what the Braves claim. Regarding their claim to the title of ""oldest continuous sports franchise in America,"" it does appear that the team's origins began with the Boston Red Stockings, who then joined what became the National League of Major League Baseball. The key word here is ""continuous."" We believe the Braves slid home safely on this one and rate their claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6600C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/14/atlanta-braves/braves-go-back-back-back/

Sen. Jim DeMint says proposed tax compromise includes estate tax hike
","
The compromise agreement on taxes proposed by President Barack Obama -- after negotiating with Republican leaders -- has critics on both ends of the political spectrum. The plan would extend all Bush-era income tax cuts for two years and extend unemployment benefits for another 13 months.

Some Democrats have criticized Obama for caving on tax cuts to the wealthy, while some Republicans have complained that the tax cuts were not made permanent. Other Republicans have criticized the lengthy extension of unemployment benefits. 

On Dec. 7, 2010, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., voiced his opposition to the compromise bill on Hugh Hewitt's nationally syndicated radio show, and the plan's proposal for the estate tax was one of his biggest gripes.

""Most of us who ran this election said we were not going to vote for anything that increased the deficit,"" DeMint said. ""This does. It raises taxes, it raises the death tax. I don’t think we needed to negotiate that aspect of this thing away.""

DeMint's quote was later widely discussed by political pundits such as Keith Olbermann and Sean Hannity.

While most of the national debate has focused on the payroll tax provisions, the compromise plan also sets new policy on the estate tax (often called the ""death tax"" by opponents like DeMint). Specifically, the plan would impose a 35 percent estate tax rate, with an effective exemption of $5 million.

DeMint's comment that the compromise ""raises the death tax"" might seem like a pretty straightforward claim. It either does or it doesn't, right?

It all depends on what you use as the baseline. This year, there was no estate tax. But 2010 was an anomaly. In 2009, the rate was 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. In the years prior to that, the rate was even higher. And barring new legislation, the rate was set to revert back to 55 percent on the value of estates greater than $1 million in 2011.

A little history on the estate tax puts things into better perspective. First enacted in 1916, the estate tax rates and thresholds have fluctuated over the years. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009.

In 2010, the Bush plan had the estate tax disappear completely. That allowed more than five billionaires this year to pass their fortunes on to heirs tax-free. The most famous beneficiary was the estate of New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who died in July. Also benefiting was the estate of Texas pipeline tycoon Dan L. Duncan, who died in March and was worth an estimated $9 billion.

The Bush plan had a 10-year window, though, because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. So the plan reached the Republicans' ultimate goal of getting rid of the estate tax -- but only in its last year. At the time, Republicans hoped that in ensuing years they would get enough votes to do away with the estate tax permanently. In fact, they tried in 2005, but failed.

Last year, Democrats controlling Congress tried to make the 2009 estate tax rates (45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million) permanent. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate.

Again, the compromise proposed by Obama last week would set the rate at 35 percent on the value of estates over $5 million.

Is that an increase in the estate tax?

""It depends on what you're comparing against,"" said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

If you are comparing it to the rate this year, then yes, it would be a tax increase. But if you compare it to where the rate was set to go next year, it's actually a tax cut.

""Given that there was never any law passed to permanently make the tax disappear entirely,"" Williams said, ""it's hard to argue that it's a tax increase relative to what otherwise would have happened.""

 People often weigh a tax change relative to today's reality. So in that sense, it could be considered a tax increase compared to the anomaly of 2010. But the compromise tax plan is actually considered by many a win for Republicans, because the estate tax would have automatically jumped much higher -- to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million -- if no deal were reached. And it's less than the 45 percent rate on the value of estates over $3.5 million in effect in 2009 and which House Democrats proposed to make permanent last year. So we rate DeMint's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD43F80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/13/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-proposed-tax-compromise-includ/

Matthew Dowd says economy has ""only worsened"" under Obama
","During the Dec. 12, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Matthew Dowd, a former strategist for President George W. Bush who lives south of Austin, said that ""Barack Obama is in an economy that's only worsened since he's been president of the United States.""

With a wealth of economic statistics available, we thought Dowd's comment offered a good opportunity to take stock of how well the economy has actually performed since the start of Obama's presidency.

We'll acknowledge that there is no perfect mix of economic statistics. That said, here are a few that some economists we spoke to believed were good measures of the economy under Obama.

First, we'll look at the factors that have shown improvement.

•  Gross Domestic Product. There have been seven quarters since Obama was inaugurated. During his first two quarters, GDP shrank -- by 4.9 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. (GDP also shrank during three of the previous four quarters, when George W. Bush was in office.) But during the ensuing five quarters under Obama, it's risen -- by 1.6 percent, 5.0 percent, 3.7 percent, 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent. Most of these are fairly meager rates of growth, but it's hard to argue that they show the economy getting worse.

•  Earnings and income. Personal income was more than 4 percent higher in the third quarter of 2010 than it was in the first quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings and average weekly earnings for private workers are almost 8 percent higher and three-tenths of 1 percent higher, respectively, than they were when Obama was sworn in. Some of these gains are modest, but they are gains nonetheless.

•  Industrial production. Industrial production has increased by a little over 4 percent since Obama's inauguration, though today's level is still lower than it was in 2007.

•  The stock market. The stock market is one step removed from basic economic indicators, but it does show what investors think about the prospects for the broader economy. And since Obama was inaugurated, it's been going like gangbusters. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by a whopping 44 percent between Jan. 20, 2009, and Dec. 12, 2010. And the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index -- a broader indicator of the domestic stock market -- rose by more than 61 percent over the same period.

This all sounds promising, but it would be premature to call Dowd incorrect. Here are some factors that have gotten worse on the president's watch:

•  The housing market. If you compare existing home sales for the first 10 months of 2009 with the first 10 months of 2010, the number of sales was about 3 percent lower in 2010. In the meantime, the foreclosure situation is getting worse. The number of foreclosure filings in October 2010 was 21 percent higher than the level in January 2009.

•  Personal bankruptcies. The level of personal bankruptcies was 26 percent higher in the third quarter of 2010 than it was in the first quarter of 2009. (However, business bankruptcies did decline by about 2.5 percent over the same period.)

And finally, the biggie:

• The jobs picture. The unemployment rate has risen from 7.7 percent in January 2009 to 9.8 percent in October 2010. If you drill deeper into the statistics, these woes are reflected in almost every subsample of the population. White? Up from 7.0 percent to 8.9 percent. Black? Up from 12.8 percent to 16 percent. Hispanic? Up from 9.9 percent to 13.2 percent.

The same goes for Americans with varying levels of educational attainment. Those without a high school degree saw unemployment rise from 12.4 percent to 15.7 percent. High school grads saw it increase from 8.1 percent to 10 percent. Those with some college training rose from 6.4 percent to 8.7 percent. And college graduates saw their unemployment rise from 3.9 percent to 5.1 percent.

The trends for long-term unemployment have been especially dispiriting. The median duration of unemployment has doubled from 10.6 weeks to 21.6 weeks, while the number of ""discouraged workers"" -- those no longer actively seeking employment -- has risen by almost 75 percent.

The sole bright spot in the labor market affects those Americans who already have a job. Earnings have increased, as indicated above, and the ""separations rate"" -- that is, the number of voluntary and involuntary departures from a job as a percentage of the work force -- has fallen from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent. That means that if you already have a job, you're less likely to lose it than you were in early 2009. But if you don't have a job, it's become no easier to get one under Obama.

Put it all together and you have an economy that has both improved and gotten worse since Obama's inauguration.

""Almost certainly the economy is still growing, meaning that it has expanded, though at a disappointing rate,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the liberal-to-centrist Brookings Institution. ""Only in upside-down world could this be described as 'an economy that's only worsened' after January 2009. Since the summer of 2009 the economy has certainly improved, but at a disappointingly slow rate.""

Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said the statement is false based on statistics. But he added that Dowd is on safer ground if one compares the ""Obama recovery"" to past recoveries, which have been characterized by stronger rebounds.

When we asked Dowd for his thoughts, he said that some weight had to be given to the views of the American people. And to take just one example, a recent Bloomberg poll found that 35 percent of respondents thought they were better off than they were two years ago, 51 percent thought they were worse off and 14 percent were unsure.

J.D.

Rep. Tom Cole: Half of Oklahoma homes have a gun
","One of the least-studied pieces of the gun violence puzzle is how many households own a firearm in each state. There are reasonable estimates at the national and regional levels, but not beyond that. In a recent interview, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., took a stab at putting a number on ownership in his state. He was talking about being at ease among people with conceal carry permits. ""Probably one out of every two households in Oklahoma has a gun,"" Cole said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe Feb. 28. ""I move in that world every day."" We asked Cole’s staff where he got that ballpark figure and didn’t hear back. There is a federal government survey from 2004 that asked people, ""Are any firearms now kept in or around your home?"" In Oklahoma, 42.9 percent said yes. Nationally, the figure was 31.7 percent. A 2015 article in a peer-reviewed journal, based on a 2013 poll, said that 31.2 percent of Oklahomans reported that they owned a firearm. However, the lead author of the study distanced herself from such a precise estimate. ""Considering that our sample size was modest, please exercise caution,"" said Bindu Kalesan, assistant professor of Medicine and Community Health Science at Boston University. The study was about social gun culture nationally, and ""everything else is secondary or exploratory,"" Kalesan said. Kalesan said so far as she knows, no study has looked at household gun ownership at the state level. The General Social Survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago found that in 2014, 43 percent of people in the West South Central region, which includes Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, said there was some sort of firearm in their home. Nationally, 31 percent reported the presence of a gun in the home. Cole said half the households in Oklahoma have a gun. In reality, there’s no fresh and reliable data for household gun ownership in the state. A survey from nearly 15 years ago reported that 42 percent of Oklahomans said there was a firearm in their house. A 2014 survey gave an ownership rate of 43 percent of households within a cluster of four states that included Oklahoma. Both the old and the more recent surveys estimated a national ownership rate of about 31 percent. While we can’t say for sure that the older study still holds true for Oklahoma proper, based on its national numbers, it is at least in the same neighborhood as the more recent regional and national estimates. Cole’s figure seems a bit high, but there’s a reasonable chance that the actual number is close to 40 percent. Better data is always a good thing, but we’ll give Cole the benefit of the doubt and rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE29500>],/factchecks/2018/mar/02/tom-cole/tom-cole-half-oklahoma-homes-have-gun/

Taking a closer look at Florida's school resource officer count
","State Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, wants additional school resource officers to be part of any school safety package from the Legislature after the Parkland, Fla., shooting. ""We have gaps in our school resource officers. We need more school resource officers,"" Galvano said during a Senate Rules Committee meeting Feb. 26. ""Right now, we have roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools."" The committee approved SB 7026, which would increase the number of officers, raise the age to purchase any firearm to 21, and establish a three-day waiting period for gun purchases.  School resource officers have been a major topic of discussion since the shooting, despite the fact that there was an officer on campus when the attack happened. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel suspended the only armed school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Scot R. Peterson, after Israel said he took cover outside of the building instead of confronting the gunman. Peterson resigned. Still, Galvano and others want more officers in schools. And Gov. Rick Scott has proposed a separate $450 million plan that would in part go toward the goal of having a resource officer in every school. Is the officer-to-school ratio as imbalanced as Galvano said?  We found it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of schools served by resource officers, in part because multiple schools can share an officer, and officers are funded through various pots of money.  But Galvano's overall point that not every school has a school resource officer is accurate. Galvano’s information traces back to the Safe Schools Appropriation Expenditures Report from the state Department of Education. According to the document, there were 1,517 resource and law enforcement officers who served a total of 2,432 schools in the 2015-16 school year (the most recent year provided). The department's report counted the number of school resource officers and law enforcement officers at elementary, middle, high, alternative and ""combination"" schools. In Broward County, home of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, there were 160 school resource officers in Broward County that served 187 schools. That said, Department of Education spokeswoman Audrey Walden said the report does not necessarily capture every single school resource officer in the district. Many districts have agreements with local law enforcement agencies that allow them to have additional school resource officers funded through other sources not captured by the report. (Each school district receives a minimum of $62,660 through the safe schools appropriation.) In other words, there might be more than 1,500 school resource officers in the state.  ""This report might not capture the officers funded through other sources, so we do not have an official statewide total,"" she said. We checked other sources for a more comprehensive total of school resource officers and came up empty-handed. So while the 1,500-figure might not be reflective of every single resource officer in the state, it's the only data we could find. We asked Galvano’s office about the discrepancy in the report’s count of Florida schools (2,432) versus Galvano’s (3,800). Senate spokeswoman Katie Betta said that to arrive at the 3,800 number for schools, legislative staff counted up state data for elementary, middle and high schools, alternative schools, Exceptional Student Education centers and charter schools. More than 4,000 schools fall under that count, so the staff excluded adult high schools, hospital homebound students, virtual school students, and Florida Department of Juvenile Justice facilities, to get to 3,800. But the state report found about 1,500 officers serving 2,400 elementary, middle, high, alternative and ""combination"" schools. Galvano took a specific count for 1,500 school resource officers and applied it to a larger number of schools than what the report actually reflects. The shortage in school resource officers reflects a broader shortage of law enforcement officers in the state, said Commander Dale Tharp of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office, who is also the spokesman for the Florida Association of School Resource Officers. He said most large law enforcement agencies are short 40 to 50 officers. Other counties have already started the process of getting more resource officers into schools without waiting for the state. Both Manatee and Hernando counties added resource officers to their schools in the weeks following the shooting. Galvano said Florida has ""roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools."" A Florida Department of Education report found that there were 1,517 resource and law enforcement officers that served a total of 2,432 schools in the 2015-16 school year. However, that report does not include every school resource officer in the state. Galvano arrived at his 3,800 figure by taking the overall number of schools and excluding a handful of non-traditional schools. But as the report states, those 1,500 officers served 2,400 schools.  Galvano’s larger point  — that many schools lack school resource officers — appears to be on point. But his numbers are off, so we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE4A2C0>],/factchecks/2018/mar/02/bill-galvano/taking-closer-look-number-school-resource-officers/

A mostly on target claim: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks
","Students planning a national school walkout, angry that more hasn’t been done to protect them from school shootings, might have more support from adults than they realize when it comes to gun control. The walkouts are planned for March 14, 2018, the one-month anniversary of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. Speaking about Parkland, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is being challenged by two Republicans in her bid for re-election, made a claim about background checks that might sound extreme. At a WisPolitics event on Feb. 22, 2018, eight days after the shooting, the Wisconsin Democrat said:

We know that we need change. And it’s frustrating because there is a high level of consensus across America on the sort of common-sense safety measures that need to be brought up and passed. Among gun owners -- and I'm a gun owner myself -- 97 percent support expanded, universal background checks so we don’t have the gun-show loophole, so that we don’t have the internet purchases that don’t go through a thorough background check. To reiterate, Baldwin’s claim is about support among gun owners, not just the general public, for requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just those done by federally licensed dealers. Prior fact checks Four months before the Florida school shooting, we rated True a claim by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele that 90 percent of Americans ""support universal background checks"" for gun purchases. We found a half dozen national polls that showed support at or near 90 percent. And an October 2017 poll taken by Gallup after Abele made his claim found support at 96 percent. But that’s the general public. What about gun owners? Quinnipiac poll To back Baldwin’s claim, her campaign cited a national telephone poll by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., of 1,249 people who identified themselves as registered voters. The poll, done with live interviews on landlines and cell phones, was taken over four consecutive days, starting Feb. 16, 2018 -- two days after the school shooting in Parkland. The question: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Before we get to the results, there is one wrinkle here: Respondents weren’t asked if they were gun owners themselves; rather, they were asked if they, or anyone in their home, owns a gun. The result was 97 percent support among gun households (as well as 97 percent among all respondents in the poll). The margin of error for the gun households (which made up 555 of the 1,249 total respondents) was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Three polling experts -- Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute and Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll -- told us they were not aware of any other national polls done in recent months that published results about gun owner support of universal background checks. We did find a poll of people who identified themselves as gun owners, by the Pew Research Center, which asked: ""Would you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to
background checks?"" The result: 77 percent of gun owners strongly or somewhat favored. But that poll was taken in March 2017, 11 months before the Parkland shooting. 
It’s tempting to think that support reached 97 percent in the Quinnipiac poll simply because it was taken days after the Parkland shooting. But Quinnipiac’s results have been consistent. For example, support was 94 percent among gun households in Quinnipiac’s December 2017 and November 2017 polls, the most recent ones done before the February 2018 poll. Our rating Baldwin says ""97 percent"" of gun owners support universal background checks.

The figure is correct for the latest national poll, completed days before her claim, that asked about requiring background checks for all gun purchases. The only clarification is that the respondents weren’t all necessarily gun owners, but rather lived in a household where they or someone else own a gun. We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFAC3C0>],/factchecks/2018/mar/02/tammy-baldwin/mostly-target-claim-97-percent-gun-owners-support-/

Austin school board member says Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie each promoted slavery
","An Austin school board member hinted at the stain of slavery in the Old South when she warned that changing the names of schools named after Texans with Confederate roles makes it logical to change the names of even more schools. Austin school Trustee Ann Teich said at the school board’s Feb. 26, 2018, meeting that if the board was set on keeping the names of people who supported slavery from tainting schools, it should further move to change the names of Austin’s Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie high schools, because Austin and Bowie each promoted slavery. ""That is only fair,"" Teich said, going on: ""James Bowie was a slave trader with his brother. Stephen F. Austin did nothing to stop slavery being brought into the state of Texas."" That night, Teich and another board member were on the losing end of a 7-2 board decision to rename five schools named after military figures or other officials in the Confederacy. We wondered later about Teich’s Bowie and Austin descriptions. Was each pioneer of Anglo Texas also pro-slavery? We turned first for evidence to biographical entries in the Handbook of Texas published by the Texas State Historical Association. The handbook’s Bowie entry says Bowie teamed with a brother and traded slaves after the War of 1812 in what later became the state of Louisiana. Also, the entry says, the brothers in February 1831 sold landholdings and 82 slaves to Natchez investors for $90,000. The publication’s entry for Austin, who led the Anglo colonization of Texas, says that after 1833, Austin consistently declared that Texas must be a slave state. Also, Texas Christian University historian Gregg Cantrell says in a video posted with the entry that Austin saw his colony’s future at the time that Mexico ruled depending on a booming cotton economy that attracted American colonists and slave labor. We learned more directly from Cantrell, who last year told the Austin American-Statesman that Austin’s attitude toward slavery was complicated in that he considered U.S. slavery a necessary evil. Cantrell told us by phone: ""It’s unequivocal: At points in their lives, both men were slave owners. There are no ifs, ands or buts about that."" Cantrell said in his 1999 book on Austin’s life that Austin ""helped to bring slavery to Texas and struggled to preserve it."" Also, Cantrell wrote, Austin earlier ""used hired slave labor on a large scale in the family mining business, and he himself owned one or two slaves during most of his years in Texas."" Yet the book also says that after the republic won its independence, Austin drafted a proclamation barring the African slave trade in advance of Texas becoming a U.S. state; he died in December 1836. To learn about Bowie, who died at the Alamo, we took Cantrell’s suggestion and perused ""Three Roads to the Alamo,"" a 1999 book by historian William C. Davis tracing the lives of Bowie, David Crockett and William Barret Travis. According to the book, Bowie’s father kept slaves as the family moved south from Kentucky before settling in what became Louisiana. Bowie and two brothers subsequently got into the slave trade as young men, Davis wrote, despite that being banned by law as of 1808. ""To young men of ambition who did not scruple violating federal law, the profits could be considerable,"" Davis wrote. The book specifies that slaves were sold at $1 a pound with the average healthy man costing $140. Aside from profiting from such trade, the book says, Bowie once sold his own slave, Henry, 19, to a cousin. Also, the book says, Bowie and other family members sold land and 80 slaves in 1831. In the book, Davis calls apocryphal a tale that Bowie in 1821 saved a runaway slave and thrashed the person pursuing him. ""Given that slaves in general were property to Bowie,"" Davis wrote, ""and this one in particular could have meant profit, it is inconceivable that he would act to help the runaway."" We reached Davis by email. He replied: ""No question Bowie owned slaves, most for resale, but at different times had"" a ""personal slave or slaves as well."" We left Teich a phone message about her claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Teich told board colleagues that Austin and Bowie, key figures in the founding of Anglo Texas, each promoted slavery. Austin and Bowie each owned slaves. Austin believed his colony’s success required slaves and also that Texas should join the U.S. as a slave state. Bowie and two brothers earlier traded in slaves. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Donald Trump is wrong about the Pulse nightclub shooting
","During a televised meeting with lawmakers, President Donald Trump emphasized the importance of firearms as protection against mass shootings in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting that killed 17. He compared an unarmed group to ""sitting ducks,"" and referred to the June 2016 shooting at an Orlando nightclub. ""You take Pulse nightclub,"" he said Feb. 28. ""If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did."" That didn’t sound right to us, so we did some digging. Turns out, Trump is wrong on how that attack unfolded. On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens more in a shooting rampage at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Trump ignored the crucial fact that an armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was working security at the club that evening. Soon after the first shots rang out, officer Adam Gruler, a 15-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, exchanged gunfire with Mateen. This isn’t the first time Trump has made this erroneous claim. Our friends at Factcheck.org flagged a similar statement after candidate Trump at a June 15, 2016 campaign rally — days after the Orlando shooting — bemoaned that there were ""no guns on the other side."" Several days later Trump took to Twitter to clarify his statement after backlash from gun safety advocates and even the National Rifle Association, who said alcohol and guns don't mix.  When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees ""When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,"" Trump tweeted June 20, 2016. Trump’s latest statement on the Pulse shooting gives the impression clubgoers were defenseless, which was not the case. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) The Justice Department in 2017 released a nearly 200-page report detailing the Orlando police response to the shooting. Here’s the report’s account of Gruler’s initial confrontation with Mateen: ""Outside, in the Pulse parking lot, (Gruler), who was working extra duty at the club — to provide outside security and to provide assistance to security personnel inside the club if needed — heard the shots that were being fired; at 2:02:17 a.m., he broadcast over the radio, 'Shots fired, shots fired, shots fired,' and requested additional officers to respond. ""The detective told the assessment team that he immediately recognized that his Sig Sauer P226 9mm handgun was no match for the .223 caliber rifle being fired inside the club and moved to a position that afforded him more cover in the parking lot. Two patrons attempted to flee through an emergency exit on the south side of the club. When the detective saw the suspect shoot them, he fired at the suspect."" According to an Orlando Police Department report, additional officers arrived on the scene about a minute after Gruler’s call for backup was broadcast. A second backup officer arrived about a minute after that. At 2:05 a.m., Gruler advised that the suspect had an assault rifle (the gunman also carried a Glock 17 9mm handgun). Gruler again shot at Mateen, this time ""firing three shots at the suspect as the sound of rapid fire gunshots were heard inside the club."" Mateen was ultimately shot and killed in a shootout after law enforcement, including SWAT team members, breached the building's wall. Some 300 local law enforcement officers responded to the scene during the three-hour standoff, according to the Orlando police report. Gruler would later attend Trump’s State of the Union address on Jan. 30 as a guest of Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. Talking about the Pulse nightclub shooting, Trump said, ""If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did."" An armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was at the club during the shooting, and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who managed to kill 49 people. We rate this False.  PolitiFact Republican guest columnist former U.S. Rep. David Jolly says how politicians use and interpret true facts to influence their policy decisions is rightly a matter of their own personal judgment, for which they are ultimately held accountable by voters. But whether those politicians are actually offering facts or mere falsehoods in justifying their proposals is increasingly a matter for which fact-checking organizations are necessary to provide accountability in our political debates.

Chris Kennedy flunks data interpretation 101 with Cairo college readiness claim
","Democratic governor candidate Chris Kennedy declared recently that not a single high school senior was prepared for college in historic but economically distressed Cairo at the southern tip of Illinois. Kennedy, speaking last month to the editorial board of the Carbondale-based Southern Illinoisan, was trying to make a broader point about the sorry state of Illinois school financing when he highlighted troubling details about school kids in Cairo. ‘‘Zero percent of kids in Cairo are college-ready,"" Kennedy told the newspaper. That caused a stir in Cairo, a mostly African-American community of 2,600 at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, and prompted Kennedy to later issue a statement to the paper expanding on his initial remarks with new data. The numbers he cited the second time were different and parsed. ""It is the fault of Springfield that only 6 percent of Cairo Junior/Senior High School students (have) met college readiness levels,"" Kennedy said. ""In fact, 0 percent are college ready when it comes to math."" Wondering what gives with Kennedy’s multiple choice approach to evaluating Cairo schools? So were we. Long ago, Cairo was a thriving river port. The town figured in a key plot twist of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn as the point where Huck and his friend Jim, a slave, planned to stop their southward drifting raft trip on the Mississippi so Jim could catch a boat north into the free states. Their raft, however, bypassed the port in a fog. As the economic heart of Illinois shifted toward Chicago, the state’s so-called Little Egypt region was hard hit, few places more so than Cairo. One consequence is that residents of the bottom end of the state have come to develop an innate wariness of politicians from the north coming to court votes without spending much time trying to understand the region or its needs. Enter Chris Kennedy and his sweeping statement about the education shortcomings of high school seniors that left many in Cairo scratching their heads and wondering how the candidate could make such a claim without ever setting foot in the school. That’s because 18 of the 24 members of Cairo’s 2018 high school graduating class have received at least one college offer, according to Andrea Evers, the superintendent of the Cairo junior and senior high school where, because of declining enrollment, grades 6-12 are taught under one roof. Ten of those students have also gotten a head start by taking college classes through a dual enrollment program at a nearby community college. But Kennedy wasn’t referring to any of that in making his point about the ramifications of limited state funding. When we reached out to his campaign, a spokeswoman confirmed he made his claim about zero college readiness based solely on a reading of state standardized test data. That said, he made two different statements citing two contradictory sets of figures. What explains the difference? His initial comment referenced an overview of Cairo students’ ACT scores that showed none of those who took the test last year scored high enough to be considered college-ready in all four core subjects. That compares with 28 percent readiness in all four subjects among students statewide. The state once required all high school juniors to take the ACT college admissions test, and the results were then used to benchmark student proficiency. But Illinois dropped the mandatory ACT rule in 2015, eventually replacing it with a requirement that juniors take the competing SAT college admissions test. So when Kennedy chose to highlight ACT test results for students in Cairo’s class of 2018, he was pointing to an incomplete set of data. It did not reflect the scores of the entire class, but only those students who chose to take the ACT. What’s more, a caveat about the incompleteness of the data is posted clearly on the website of the Illinois State Board of Education where Kennedy or his staff found the numbers. It reads in part: ""This percentage relates to the students in the class who chose to take the ACT test before graduation and is not representative of the entire class, district or state."" Kennedy’s second statement to the Southern Illinoisan that mentioned a 6 percent proficiency number referred to SAT results also posted on the state board website. But whichever data set Kennedy was referring to, Evers said he still missed the mark. ""He was looking at a data set and interpreting it without ever having a conversation with anyone locally,"" said Evers, who has been with the district for six years and can rattle off a long list of political leaders who have made the trek to Cairo, including Democratic U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth. The state school board, which compiled the testing data Kennedy drew from, likewise cautioned against using test data in a vacuum to determine how prepared students are for college. ""I wouldn’t say that the SAT is the only indicator of college and career readiness because it’s one test and so it can only tell you so much,"" ISBE spokeswoman Jackie Matthews said. ""We’re building out a much more robust college and career readiness indicator that looks at a lot more experiences that students have in high school that are very important and aren’t necessarily captured by the SAT."" A draft of that plan was presented to the board in January. It considers factors like volunteer and work experience along with taking classes for college credit, as some of Cairo’s seniors are doing. Kennedy tried to make a point about inadequate state school funding when he declared ""zero percent of kids in Cairo are college-ready."" But school officials in that deep southern Illinois community report a majority of current seniors have already received acceptance offers from at least one college. Kennedy backtracked on his original statement when news media sought clarification, though he did not admit error. In the second go-around, he pointed to slightly better numbers from a different set of state-collected test data. The first figure Kennedy referenced relied on the ACT, a test the state no longer uses for its proficiency benchmark. Some, but not all, Cairo students took that test, meaning the results were incomplete and did not reflect the performance of the entire class of 2018. The caveat is clearly stated on the schools website accessed by the Kennedy campaign to derive data about Cairo. Kennedy later revised his comments to cite a different set of college preparedness data based on a different test that the state now administers to high schoolers. The results from that second set of tests, the SAT, are not great when it comes to Cairo, but they also don’t show zero percent college preparedness. It also should be stressed that the Illinois State Board of Education cautions against using a standardized test score as the sole indicator of college preparedness. The confusing set of numbers and assertions reeled out by Kennedy to bolster his comments about Cairo students make it clear he didn’t do his homework before claiming initially that no members of the graduating class of 2018 were prepared for college. For that reason, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6609C0>],/factchecks/2018/mar/01/chris-kennedy/chris-kennedy-flunks-data-interpretation-101-cairo/

Rick Scott says Bill Nelson has done nothing on gun control, ignoring his Senate record
","Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson criticized Gov. Rick Scott for not appearing at the CNN town hall following the Parkland shooting. ""There is no representative of the state of Florida,"" Nelson said during the Feb. 21 town hall in which Marjory Stoneman Douglas students spoke. ""Our governor did not come here."" Days later at a press conference where Scott announced a proposal for $450 million in school security funding, a reporter asked Scott to respond to Nelson’s criticism. Scott, a Republican, is widely expected to challenge Nelson, a Democrat, in the 2018 elections. ""Bill Nelson is a career politician,"" said Scott. ""He talks a lot. He does nothing. Think about it: He has been in office for almost 50 years. He hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control."" That’s a sweepingly broad attack by Scott to claim that Nelson hasn’t done ""anything"" on gun or school safety and mischaracterizes Nelson’s record. We found multiple examples of legislation Nelson supported that related to gun control. Nelson has supported a ban on assault rifles for decades. In 1990 when running for governor, he promised, ""As governor, I will propose a ban on the sale of assault rifles in Florida, as well as a seven-day waiting period on the sale of firearms."" At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved a weapon over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy a semi-automatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store. While in Congress in 1990, Nelson cosponsored the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to make it unlawful for any licensed dealer to sell a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless certain criteria were met. The legislation ultimately passed in 1993 after Nelson left the House. Nelson spokesman Ryan Brown sent PolitiFact a list of more than one dozen bills that Nelson had supported related to gun safety, gun control or school safety. Many were bills he either cosponsored or sponsored or voted in favor of, but many did not become law. Here’s a look at some of the key bills by topic: Assault weapons ban: Nelson has repeatedly supported an assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire in 2004. This year, Nelson became one of about two dozen cosponsors of a bill to ban semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. The bill has not reached any votes. Bump stocks: Nelson was one of many cosponsors of a 2017 bill to ban bump stocks, an accessory that allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one. Improving background checks: Nelson sponsored a bill that would require the Justice Department to include in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System information about an individual who is or has been under a federal terrorism investigation. The bill, which Nelson introduced in 2017 after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, has not reached any votes. He supported other efforts to strengthen background checks in the past. Denying firearms to terrorists: The ""no fly no buy"" bill would deny the transfer of a firearm if the transferee is known (or appropriately suspected) to be engaged in terrorism. Nelson was one of a few dozen cosponsors. The 2015 bill has not received a vote. Ban certain types of firearms: Nelson sponsored a bill in 2017 to ban firearms that are not detectable by metal detectors if certain components are removed. The bill has not received a vote. He also voted to ban guns with high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, which failed to pass the Senate in 2013. He also voted for an amendment to require trigger locks and safety devices for handguns in 2004 and to strengthen penalties for the use of so-called cop-killer bullets in 2005 -- both were amendments that passed the Senate. Conceal-carry reciprocity: Nelson voted against legislation that would allow concealed-carry permits issued in one state to be valid in all others that issue such permits in 2009 and 2013. Mental health: Nelson voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which became law in 2016. The bill stated that the attorney general may provide active-shooter response training to local law enforcement and called for the development of crisis intervention teams to include specialized training for school officials in responding to mental health crises. Nelson was one of about two dozen bipartisan cosponsors of the Excellence in Mental Health Act S. 264, which proposed grants to states to build or modernize community-based mental health services. After the Parkland shooting, Nelson, along with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, wrote a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urging her department to quickly approve applications from the Broward school district for a Project School Emergency Response to Violence grant. The money could be used for mental health services, overtime for law enforcement and school staff, and costs to operate the school at an alternative site. Nelson has taken some pro-gun votes during his Senate tenure. In 2005, Nelson voted in favor of prohibiting civil lawsuits from being brought against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm. He voted to permit Amtrak passengers to transport guns in checked baggage and to allow individuals to possess firearms in the national parks in 2009. Nelson spokesman Brown said that Nelson is not anti-gun. ""He’s a hunter, he’s owned guns his entire life,"" Brown said. ""He’s never said he wants to ban all guns. He wants to expand background checks and ban semiautomatic assault rifles, like the AR-15.""  
  Response from experts and Scott’s office We sent a list of several of the laws that Nelson supported to Harry Wilson, Roanoke College professor and author of the book Guns, Gun Control, and Elections. We asked Wilson to weigh in about Nelson’s record on guns. ""What kind of alternate universe is this?"" he said. ""The Republican argues that the Democrat is too soft on gun control. Beam me up, Scotty."" ""If one votes for the assault weapons ban and enhanced background checks and against reciprocity, one has clearly voted in favor of stricter gun laws (ask any gun rights group!),"" he said. But Scott does have a point if he wants to argue that some of these bills didn’t pass, so nothing was ""done."" As for Nelson’s pro-gun votes, Wilson said that the Amtrak and national parks votes that were signed by President Barack Obama were not major issues, while the 2005 vote for immunity for gun manufacturers was an important vote that clearly favored gun rights.   ""I would call this a mixed record, but the charge is misleading, at best,"" he said. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesman Andrew Zucker praised Nelson for fighting ""for criminal background checks on every gun sale, opposed arming teachers, and (he) has been an ally in the fight for gun safety for years."" As of 2012 when Nelson was up for re-election, the NRA had given him an F grade. We sent Scott spokesman McKinley Lewis links to several bills that Nelson supported and asked if he had evidence to support the claim that Nelson ""hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, done nothing on gun control."" ""Bill Nelson could not point to any meaningful legislation brought forth and sponsored by him to make it across the finish line,"" Lewis said. ""He’s had nearly 50 years in office, and what has happened? Has he rolled out any bills or legislative packages in the wake of the Parkland shooting?"" Scott said Nelson ""hasn’t done anything on gun safety or school safety, and nothing on gun control."" At least since 1990, Nelson has supported an assault weapons ban. He has also supported several gun control measures including bills to tighten background checks, keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, ban bump stocks as well as firearms that can pass through metal detectors. While many of the bills Nelson supported didn’t become law, it’s an exaggeration to state that he has done ""nothing."" We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC868180>],/factchecks/2018/feb/28/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-bill-nelson-has-done-nothing-gun-c/
"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Joel Giambra']","
Is Giambra the only GOP candidate for NY governor who's cut taxes?
","Former Erie County Executive Joel Giambra says he’s the only Republican candidate for governor with experience cutting taxes. Giambra said that gives him an advantage over the other two Republicans running for governor: State Sen. John A. DeFrancisco and Joseph Holland, a former housing commissioner under Gov. George E. Pataki. ""I'm the only candidate on this stage who has actually cut taxes,"" Giambra said at a debate among the three candidates. Giambra served as Erie County Executive from 2000 until the end of 2007. He is remembered partly for proposing two different budgets for 2005 with the county in fiscal distress. He most recently worked as a lobbyist. DeFrancisco has represented part of Central New York in the State Senate since 1993. He was named deputy majority leader in 2015, the second most powerful position in the chamber. Holland has not served in a role where he would be able to cut taxes. Is Giambra right? Is he the only candidate in the race who cut taxes? Giambra’s record Giambra’s spokesperson said he was talking about experience cutting taxes while serving in an executive position. Neither DeFrancisco or Holland has ever been elected as an executive. But Giambra did not specify that during the debate. Instead, he suggested he is the only candidate with experience reducing taxes. It’s true, Giambra cut taxes in Erie County. The county property tax levy when he entered office in 2000 was about $181 million. He reduced it to about $152 million in his first budget for 2001, a cut of 16 percent. Giambra kept the levy flat until 2005, when the fiscal crisis hit. Giambra proposed two budgets for that year to respond to a $108 million deficit. Both cut county services so the tax levy would remain flat. Giambra’s proposed ""green budget"" cut less in exchange for a higher sales tax rate. His ""red budget"" proposed more severe cuts in lieu of a sales tax increase. The county legislature ultimately approved the first option. The property tax levy only increased about 3 percent in 2005. But the county’s fiscal crisis was not over. Giambra agreed to raise property taxes more than $30 million in 2006, a 19 percent increase. The total levy that year was about $188 million, or about 3 percent higher than when Giambra took office. Giambra’s final two budgets for 2007 and 2008 increased the property tax levy by 6.3 percent and 5.9 percent respectively. The final tax levy he approved totaled about $211 million. DeFrancisco’s record DeFrancisco held two of the Senate’s top positions when lawmakers cut state income tax rates twice in the past eight years. He was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee in 2011, when lawmakers agreed to reduce state income tax rates. The committee crafts the Senate’s counter-proposal to the governor’s budget and has to approve any legislation with a fiscal impact before it goes to the floor for a vote. The lower rates were a trade-off for an extension of the state’s high tax rate on wealthy earners. DeFrancisco voted for the bill. He was deputy majority leader when lawmakers approved another set of income tax cuts in the 2016 state budget. The deputy majority leader controls what happens on the floor of the Senate. DeFrancisco voted to approve the cuts. The lower rates were first proposed by Republicans in the Senate earlier that year. They wanted to lower the tax rate for middle-income earners from 6.45 percent to 5.14 percent. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Assembly agreed to lower the rate to 5.5 percent instead. DeFrancisco voted for other tax cuts in that time as well, including a cut in the state’s corporate tax rate and an expansion of the estate tax. Our ruling Giambra said he is the only Republican gubernatorial candidate ""who has actually cut taxes."" It's true he's the only candidate in the race who has done that in an executive office. But he did not make that distinction in the debate. The two other candidates have not held an executive office. It's worth noting Giambra did not cut those Erie County property taxes alone. County lawmakers approved the budgets he proposed. He’s not the only candidate with experience cutting taxes. DeFrancisco was a leader in the Senate when the chamber voted to approve a handful of tax cuts since 2011. The tax cuts would not have happened without senators like him voting for them.  Giambra’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE39500>],/factchecks/2018/feb/28/joel-giambra/giambra-only-gop-candidate-ny-governor-whos-cut-ta/
"['New York', 'Guns', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio's tweet about NY gun law is accurate
","Sen. Marco Rubio took aim at one provision of a gun law passed in New York state that he suggests can be easily circumvented. The Florida Republican posted a photo of two semi-automatic rifles. Both rifles almost look the same. But one has a pistol grip attached, so it is not legal in New York state, Rubio said. ""Under N.Y. State ‘Assault Weapon’ ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned,"" Rubio’s tweet read. Under N.Y. State “Assault Weapon” ban 1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned.Otherwise exactly same 1/4 pic.twitter.com/i7CFRkmHvi   The tweet came as Rubio’s response to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said earlier in the day that Rubio ""should be ashamed of"" himself for not supporting stricter gun control legislation. During a CNN town hall the night before, Rubio signaled support for raising the age to buy a rifle or shotgun to 21 and for tighter background checks for gun purchases. Cuomo supports tougher gun-control measures, like universal background checks and a ban on military-style accessories. New York state already has a ban on some of those accessories. We wanted to know if the one on Rubio’s tweet is on that list. New York state gun laws The accessory shown in the image, called a pistol grip, has been banned on rifles in New York state since 2013. It’s one of several features banned by the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, better known as the SAFE Act. The law, spearheaded by Cuomo, was passed a few weeks after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The law banned so-called assault weapons and created a legal definition for them in New York state. The law defined them broadly as semi-automatic firearms with one or more of the features also banned by the law. There are 10 of those features for rifles. The weapon used by Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, is banned under state law, for example. Lanza used a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip and a flash suppressor — two of the features banned under the SAFE Act. But the rifle without a pistol grip pictured in Rubio’s tweet would also be subject to other gun regulations in New York state. First, anyone who wanted to buy the rifle in New York state would have to go through a background check, regardless of who they buy it from. State law would also prohibit any gun owner from attaching a magazine to the rifle that holds more than 10 rounds. Only seven other states have laws that ban large capacity magazines. Florida, where a shooter killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School this month, is not one of them. Our ruling Rubio said with a photo on Twitter that ""1 simple cosmetic change pictured here is difference between legal & banned"" in New York state. That’s true. The pistol grip shown is one of the banned features for rifles under New York state's SAFE Act. The rifle would also be subject to other New York state regulations.

NRA's Loesch cherry-picks terrorism deaths in France to argue against assault weapon ban
","  With even some Republicans talking about an assault rifle ban, the National Rifle Association has been quick to reject the idea that it might help. On ABC News’ This Week, host George Stephanopoulos suggested that nations with stricter limits see fewer mass shootings. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch challenged that before Stephanopoulos even fully asked his question. Here’s their Feb. 25 exchange: Stephanopoulos: ""We are the only country that has wide access to these kind of weapons and no one else has the frequency or the intensity of these kind of mass shootings…""

Loesch: ""That’s actually not true.""

Stephanopoulos: ""...mass shooting that we do.""

Loesch: ""That’s actually not true.""

Stephanopoulos: ""That is.""

Loesch: ""France had a higher casualty rate in one year than the entire two administrations of Barack Obama.  And they’re a fifth of our population."" Really? France saw more casualties in a single year than America saw in eight? The NRA press office told us Loesch drew from an analysis by the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that does research in support of policies favored by gun rights advocates. While Loesch didn’t specify the year, that article compared deaths and injuries in ""mass public shootings"" in France in 2015 with casualties from similar events in the United States between 2009 and 2016. In 2015, France had 150 deaths and 382 injured, for a total of 532. On the American side, between 2009 and 2016, there were 264 deaths, 263 injured for a total of 527. As many will remember, 2015 was a horrific year of terrorist attacks in France. In January, two men who claim allegiance to Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula opened fire in the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The death toll rose even higherwith a series of attacks on Nov. 13 by a well-organized Islamic State cell in and around the Bataclan Theater in Paris. A total of 132 people died. But 2015 was an aberration for France. The Global Terrorism Database at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism shows that between 2009 and 2014, attacks with guns killed eight people. In 2016, there was one victim. Our French fact-checking colleagues at Liberation found a steady rate of more conventional firearm deaths over the years. (The policy focus is on firearms but it’s important to add that a truck attack killed 86 people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice in 2016.) In contrast, mass shooting attacks in the United States occur regularly, punctuated by particularly horrific events. Loesch’s statistic cherry-picks one bad year and sets it against a more systemic pattern in America. Criminologists and terrorism experts agree that there are significant differences between mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and the Bataclan attacks. The primary distinction is the motivations of the shooters. The motives of teenager Nikolas Cruz in Florida might never be fully understood, but the ISIS cell in Paris had a clear political agenda. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism includes an attack in its dataset if the act is ""aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal,"" and if  there’s ""an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience."" Consortium director William Braniff said it’s likely ""that some of the preventative steps we might take to mitigate the likelihood of one kind of violence will be different than for others."" Terrorism researcher Jeff Gruenewald at Indiana University told us that terrorist acts generally take shape differently, giving law enforcement different ways to prevent them. ""Terrorists may plan longer, farther away from their targets, or they may be more likely to communicate with other like-minded individuals and groups through channels that can be intercepted,"" Gruenewald said. ""Terrorist shooters may also choose different forms of symbolic targets than other types of shooters, which has consequences for anti-terrorism measures."" Gruenewald also noted that many state and federal laws explicitly target terrorism, pointing to a broad consensus that such attacks are different from other violent activity. Jaclyn Schildkraut at the State University of New York in Oswego echoed that point. Schildkraut has compiled mass shooting statistics across 11 developed nations in North America and Europe.  She said in the United States, the response to terrorism and the response to mass shootings puts the difference in sharp contrast. ""After 9-11, we saw massive changes in laws and programs,"" Schildkraut said. ""We’ve seen few changes in response to mass shootings."" Schildkraut, however, argued that access to weapons is not a critical matter. Criminals, she said, will find ways to get high-powered firearms. The issue too often in the United States, she said, has been a breakdown in existing control systems that ought to have blocked firearm purchases by shooters. By cross-checking across three datasets, we can separate terrorism and non-terrorism shootings in France and the United States. We worked with the table in the article from the Crime Prevention Research Center, mass shootings in America tracked by Mother Jones magazine, and the Global Terrorism Database. If the Global Terrorism Database included the event, we flagged it in the other two datasets. Segregating those casualties eliminated all but seven casualties in France – four dead and three injured at a Roma encampment in Roye, France. On the American side, that process also flagged the San Bernardino, the Pulse nightclub and the Fort Hood shootings, to mention just few prominent examples. The net effect reduced American deaths to 165 and injuries to 160. We compared domestic mass shootings between the Crime Prevention Research Center table and the Mother Jones database. That comparison showed that the Center included some events that were not in the Mother Jones list, and vice versa. Counting only those events where there were at least four victims killed, the net change was not large – an additional 17 deaths and 17 injuries based on the Mother Jones figures. Counting only non-terrorism events, the numbers appear quite different from the picture Loesch painted. On a non-terrorism basis, both deaths and injuries are about 40 times higher in the United States than in France. Loesch said that in one year, mass public shootings caused more deaths and injuries in France than in the United States throughout the entire Obama administration. Loesch failed to mention that the year she had in mind was 2015, the bloodiest France has seen at the hands of terrorists. So the stat relies on extreme cherry-picking (by Loesch, not the underlying report behind her talking point). Criminologists and terrorism experts gave several reasons why the differences between mass shootings and terrorism matter, and those differences are enshrined in American law and policy. Separating out the terrorism casualties in both countries, the numbers show that mass shootings during the Obama years caused about 40 times more deaths and injuries than in France in 2015. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDE6040>],/factchecks/2018/feb/27/dana-loesch/nras-loesch-cherry-picks-terrorism-deaths-france-a/
"['Ohio', 'Guns', 'Tim Ryan']","
Do majority of NRA members support background checks for guns?
","Some lawmakers are pushing for changes to gun laws including universal background checks following the fatal mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who drew attention after the Las Vegas massacre in October when he announced he would donate to gun control groups roughly $20,000 that the NRA’s political action committee gave him over the years. Ryan received an A grade from the NRA earlier in his career but later broke from the group. ""Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check,"" Ryan said on CNN’s New Day Feb. 20, days after the shooting in South Florida that left 17 people dead. Polls have consistently showed broad support for a universal background check. National polls in 2016 and 2017 found between 84 and 94 percent of respondents supported background checks. But what about NRA members? While federal law requires background checks for sales from federally licensed dealers, unlicensed, private sellers are not required to conduct background checks — although states can create their own laws. Some gun control advocates want a nationwide standard to close loopholes. Ryan’s spokesman cited a 2015 poll of gun owners by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, conducted on behalf of two liberal groups: MoveOn.org Civic Action and the Center for American Progress. The poll surveyed 816 gun owners. According to the poll, 24 percent of the respondents identified themselves as NRA members. That means of the total of 816 gun owners, 196 self-identified as NRA members. Of all 816 gun owners, 83 percent responded that they supported a criminal background check for everyone who wants to buy a firearm. For the 196 who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. The margin of error for the NRA sample is 7 percentage points, said Jim Williams, an analyst for Public Policy Polling. ""Given that the support for background checks among the NRA subsample is so overwhelming, it’s still far outside the margin of error for that subset,"" he said. We also found an additional poll that included NRA members taking a position on background checks. Pew Research Center conducted a poll of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April 2017. The unweighted sample size in the survey included 262 respondents who identified as NRA members. The poll included a breakdown of replies from Republican gun owners who were and were not members of the NRA. The poll showed based on weighted data that 52 percent of NRA members favored background checks for private gun sales compared with 75 percent of nonmembers. PolitiFact has previously looked at polls as far back as 2013 that found majority support among NRA members or households where someone was a member of the NRA. For example, a poll done by Johns Hopkins University and conducted online among 2,703 adults — including 169 respondents who identified as a member of the NRA — through GfK Knowledge Networks. The poll found that 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was 7 percentage points.) After our 2015 fact-check of a claim related to that poll, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker contacted PolitiFact contending that the poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. It is common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group. The NRA didn’t respond for this fact-check. We also previously looked at a poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in 2012 commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s group. That poll showed 74 percent of respondents who identified as NRA members favored background checks. The poll included 945 gun owners, half of whom said they were current or lapsed members of the NRA and the others non-NRA members. Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll and a professor at the University of Arkansas, said that the polls do not reflect a large enough sample of NRA members to reach the conclusion that 70 to 80 percent of NRA members support background checks. While it’s tempting to take a national sample and try to drill down, when looking at a smaller subset such as NRA members ""you end up generalizing and that can be dangerous,"" she said. Ideally, a poll would include somewhere between 750 and 1,000 NRA members, she said. ""You would need an independent polling organization to either oversample NRA members or have a big enough national sample to get you to at least 500, but preferably closer to 750 NRA members who can stand as a sample on their own,"" she said. We interviewed some polling experts who said that additional polls would help shed more light on the views of NRA members and that there are caveats about these polls’ methodologies. Polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told PolitiFact that the smaller the actual subgroup in the national population, the lower the precision and the larger the margin of error. However, if several polls show a majority of NRA members favor background checks, that increases the confidence in the findings. Some of our polling experts raised some criticisms about methodology. Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Polling Center, said he is dubious of any Interactive Voice Response (IVR) polling as the one done by Public Policy Polling. ""They have incredibly low response rates and there is evidence that only the most politically motivated people really want to talk to a computer about their opinions,"" he said. Williams, of Public Policy Polling, defended the methodology and said IVR polling can cut down on social desirability bias — people telling a human questioner the answer they think they are ""supposed"" to say. Ryan said that ""70 to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check."" Ryan is citing a poll from Public Policy Polling, conducted in 2015 for liberal groups. That poll found that among the respondents who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. Other polls we looked at showed that between 52 and 74 percent of NRA members supported background checks. These polls are imperfect because they include small samples of NRA members, but they all suggest a majority of NRA members support background checks. New polling of larger numbers of NRA members would shed more light on the views of NRA members on background checks. With all that in mind, we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE37340>],/factchecks/2018/feb/27/tim-ryan/after-parkland-shooting-ohio-congressman-said-70-8/
"['Illinois', 'Guns', 'Nancy Rotering']","
After Parkland, can Illinois communities ban assault weapons?
","As mayor of north suburban Highland Park, Nancy Rotering has been in the thick of the debate over gun control in recent years. Since 2013, her suburb has prohibited weapons like the semiautomatic rifle used to kill 17 Parkland, Florida, high school students and teachers on Valentine’s Day. The Illinois city’s gun ban has survived a court challenge, with the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 refusing to hear an appeal of a ruling that upheld the Highland Park law. The practical effect of that decision was to signal other local governments that they could legally impose bans on certain types of military-style guns without violating the Second Amendment. But Rotering, one of eight Democrats vying in the March 20 primary for their party’s nomination for Attorney General, said there’s still a catch in state law that prevents other Illinois towns from following Highland Park’s example. Just days before the Parkland shooting, Rotering told the Sun-Times this: ""We in Highland Park banned assault weapons and were taken to the United States Supreme Court and we prevailed. It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity."" Nothing is ever simple when it comes to inevitably bitter disputes over gun restrictions versus gun rights, and that clearly is the case with the fate of assault weapons bans in Illinois. If the Supreme Court says Rotering’s Highland Park can impose a ban, why then does she say that other communities are prevented from doing the same? We decided to take a look. In 2013, Illinois became the last state to allow the concealed carry of guns when the legislature approved it under pressure from a federal appellate court ruling. A few years prior to that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a blanket handgun ban imposed by Chicago. When it comes to even more lethal firepower, the gun debate can get especially perplexing, with those for or against gun controls often sounding as if they speak different languages. While the term ""assault weapon"" is commonly used to describe firearms used in mass shootings, advocacy organizations like the Illinois State Rifle Association (an affiliate of the National Rifle Association) refuses to refer to semi-automatic rifles that fire a single round each time a trigger is pulled as assault weapons. Nonetheless, ordinances like that in Highland Park that ban semi-automatics often refer to them as assault weapons. Similarly, the package of Illinois laws that allowed concealed carry also included a clause designed to block imposition of piecemeal weapons bans from town to town. ""The regulation of the possession or ownership of assault weapons are exclusive powers and functions of this State,"" the statute reads. It was that language that stripped local governments of their authority to pass their restricting semi-automatic rifles, ammunition magazines and related weapons and devices. ""Local control of certain things are bad,"" said Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association. ""If they want to tax someone to death, I don’t care. They can build roads, but the Second Amendment is a fundamental right."" Two lawmakers instrumental in passing the concealed carry legislation, Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, and Rep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, said the local restriction language was the price gun-rights advocates insisted on to reach a compromise. ""There was a constant battle between the pro-gun and gun-safety advocates,"" Lang said in an interview. The measures included a narrow loophole, however. They went into effect July 9, 2013, but gave local governments a 10-day window past that date to pass local assault weapons bans. Highland Park, Chicago, Evanston and Skokie were among the few local governments that took advantage of the opening. Cook County updated an existing ban, effectively extending it to all other suburbs in the county. Two years later, state Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Deerfield, introduced legislation to reinstate power to local governments to pass assault weapons, but it languished in committee and eventually died. Morrison said she is considering another try in the wake of the Florida shooting. Meanwhile, the Illinois House is expected this week to consider several different bills aimed at gun control, including a proposed state licensing system for gun dealers. Rotering says: ""It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity."" While there’s much disagreement about how to respond to the problem of gun violence, Illinois’ law on banning powerful rifles, commonly referenced as assault weapons, is clear. Only the state of Illinois — and not local governments — can pass an assault weapons ban, although local governments like Rotering’s Highland Park were granted a narrow and long-since expired window to approve their own bans. Those provisions were included by lawmakers in a 2013 law that allowed the concealed carry of weapons in Illinois. In claiming that the ""Illinois General Assembly has failed"" to reopen the door to local weapons bans, Rotering resorts to language that to some lawmakers seems over the top because she appears to be equating inaction with failure. But the essence of her claim is correct. Lawmakers inclined to back Morrison’s proposal acknowledge it has lacked the votes to pass up to now. Even so, the Legislature has had the opportunity to revisit the issue and did not do so. From that perspective, Rotering is accurate, which is why we rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA23E40>],/factchecks/2018/feb/27/nancy-rotering/after-parkland-can-illinois-communities-ban-assaul/

Ryan Zinke wrong that gas prices are down 40% under Trump
","  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke touted the Trump administration’s efforts on reducing gasoline prices and, in the process, beefing up Americans’ disposable income. ""As good as the tax bill is, when America pulls up to a pump, and they fill their car up, under the previous administration it was 2 bucks, 4 bucks, 6 bucks, $100 to fill a car,"" Zinke said at the conservative CPAC conference on Feb. 23. ""American energy has delivered. Now it's $60. That’s $40 you have in your pocket — every American that would fill up at a pump station — that you wouldn’t have."" (The comment is around the 7:20 mark in this C-SPAN video.) Have gas prices fallen? It’s possible to come up with a 40 percent decline — but the decline came under President Barack Obama, not President Donald Trump. According to the federal Energy Information Administration, the peak gasoline price under Obama was $3.96 a gallon in mid May 2011. The low price under Trump was $2.33 — the week he was inaugurated in 2017. That’s a 40 percent decline, but the drop came entirely on Obama’s watch. For the final two and a half years of Obama’s tenure, the average gallon of gas went no higher than $3.50. It hit a low of $1.73 in February 2016, lower than at any point in the Trump presidency. Under Trump, the price at the pump has trended upward. From $2.33 at Trump’s inauguration, it rose to $2.56 in mid February 2018. That’s an increase of almost 10 percent. Here’s the full data for gasoline prices under Obama and Trump: Probably not on gasoline prices so far, experts say. Most of the ramp-up in oil production that benefited consumer prices occurred during what critics have derided as Obama's ""war on fossil fuels,"" said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business. He added that Trump policies on drilling may make a difference going forward. ""To the extent that looser environmental regulations allow greater oil production in the future, that will increase downward pressure on oil prices, and gasoline prices,"" Borenstein said. Still, the future price drops from Trump policies may not be massive. ""Increased oil production in the United States has put some downward pressure on crude prices, though that is hardly the only factor in the decline of gasoline prices,"" he said. The Interior Department did not get back to us. Zinke said, ""Under the previous administration it was … $100 to fill a car. American energy has delivered. Now it's $60. That’s $40 you have in your pocket … that you wouldn’t have."" The only 40 percent drop in the recent data occurred on Obama’s watch, meaning that Trump’s policies couldn’t have influenced it. On Trump’s watch, the price of gasoline has actually risen by 10 percent.

Precedent says West Virginia teacher's strike isn't lawful
","West Virginia teachers spent a third day on strike on Feb. 26 after negotiations over the weekend were insufficient to end the walkout. But is their strike legal? Shortly before the strike began, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (and U.S. Senate candidate) said it wasn’t. On Feb. 21, Morrisey tweeted, "" 'The impending work stoppage is unlawful and should come to an end.' — Patrick Morrisey."" Legal experts said Morrisey is on solid ground about the lawfulness of the strike. As the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported on Feb. 20, the key precedents on this case emerged in 1990, the last time teachers in West Virginia went on strike. On March 8, 1990, then-Attorney General Roger W. Tompkins, a Democrat, wrote an opinion saying, ""There is no right to strike against the state. Thus, any strike or concerted work stoppage by the public teachers of this state is illegal. … It is our opinion that any strike by public teachers is illegal and may be dealt with accordingly by school officials."" The state Supreme Court essentially agreed with this reasoning in a ruling on April 12, 1990. ""Public employees have no right to strike in the absence of express legislation or, at the very least, appropriate statutory provisions for collective bargaining, mediation, and arbitration,"" the court wrote. ""In view of our legislature's silence on these complex issues, we decline to intervene."" The West Virginia Education Association, the state affiliate of the National Education Association, the national teacher's union, did not respond to an inquiry for this article. When the group’s president, Dale Lee, was previously asked whether a strike was illegal, Lee acknowledged ""Probably yes,"" according to the Gazette-Mail. Morrisey’s tweet was carefully worded, legal experts say. If he had used the word ""illegal,"" he might have been open to critique on the grounds that teachers would not be committing a crime by taking part. ""I know of nothing that says a teacher who strikes commits a crime,"" said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. ""Participating in a strike would be no different from a teacher who feigns illness to get a day off. The conduct could expose the teacher to discipline."" Howard Seufer Jr., an attorney in Charleston, agreed. ""Strikes by public employees are not crimes in our state,"" he said. ""But public employees do not enjoy a right under our laws to strike."" On another linguistic note, Seufer pointed out that the 1990 state Supreme Court ruling specifically noted that it was using the terms ""strike"" and ""work stoppage"" interchangably. That aligns with a 1965 opinion by the same court, which ""suggested that a ‘strike’ refers to the actions of employees that may result in such a work stoppage,"" Seufer said. If it sounds unusual for a union to be unable to strike, that’s the case in West Virginia. Unions in West Virginia, including the WVEA, ""exist as voluntary associations that lobby on behalf of their members and provide them with certain services, such as representation in grievance and disciplinary proceedings,"" Seufer said. ""But our laws do not treat these associations as unions in the same sense other states do."" Specifically, West Virginia law does not recognize a right for public school employees to collectively bargain, he said. Rather, the legislature regulates public school labor by statute. Bastress said that common law applies on the issue of strikes, ""and there is no right to strike in common law."" Referring to a West Virginia teacher’s strike, Morrisey tweeted that ""the impending work stoppage is unlawful."" Precedents both from his own office and from the state Supreme Court support that view, and Morrisey was careful to say ""unlawful"" rather than ""illegal."" By going on strike, the teachers are not taking part in criminal activity; they are at risk of disciplinary action. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7C4F80>],/factchecks/2018/feb/26/patrick-morrisey/precedent-says-west-virginia-teachers-strike-isnt-/

After Parkland, Paul Ryan cites law on mentally ill and guns, but it has limited reach
","A week after confessed Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz -- who had some level of mental health problems -- killed 17 people, President Donald Trump promised tougher mental health screening for gun buyers. Trump’s pledge seemed to contrast with a claim made the day after the shooting by U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. In his weekly briefing with reporters on Feb. 15, 2018, the Wisconsin Republican said while discussing the Florida case: Remember, we do have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms. Ryan alluded primarily to a 1968 federal law. Let’s see what it does. Federal law The federal Gun Control Act was passed following the 1968 assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Among other things, it prohibits anyone ""who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution"" from possessing a firearm. That’s a small portion of people with mental illness. And it doesn’t account for people who are more likely to be dangerous but don’t meet the threshold of being adjudicated or committed. Here are more specifics from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: Adjudicated as a mental defective means a court or other lawful authority has determined that a person, as a result of mental illness or other conditions, ""is a danger to himself or others, lacks the capacity"" to manage his own affairs, or ""is found insane by a court in a criminal case."" Committed to a mental institution means a court or another authority has formally sent -- that is, involuntarily committed -- a person to a mental institution. Besides the federal law, Ryan’s office also cited similar state laws on gun possession and mental illness, but the federal law is primary here. Think of a funnel To grasp what the federal law does, picture a funnel. At the top are people with some form of mental illness; at the bottom are the relatively few who are prohibited from possessing a gun. Millions have mental illness: About 45 million U.S. adults live with mental illness, including 10 million who have a serious mental illness, according to the federal National Institute of Mental Health. ""Serious mental illness"" refers to ""a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities.""   Relatively few are violent: People with mental illness are much more likely to be a victim of a violent crime, not a perpetrator, according to studies. Only 4 percent of violence toward others in American society is attributable to mental illness, according to John Monahan, a professor of law, psychology and psychiatry at the University of Virginia. Few shooters adjudicated/committed: ""The existing body of research on mass shooters suggests that a history of civil commitment or legal adjudication"" -- the standards set by the federal law -- ""is practically unheard of among perpetrators of mass homicide and mass homicide-suicide, according to Gun Violence and Mental Illness, a 2016 book published by the American Psychiatric Association. (Experts told the New York Times -- which noted Cruz was clearly troubled but had no mental diagnosis -- that if Cruz had undergone a full psychiatric evaluation, it might have resulted in a temporary commitment at best, but not full-time institutionalization. One who has studied mass killers said: ""Most of these shooters are angry, antisocial individuals you cannot spot in advance, and even if you could, you don’t have the right to institutionalize them."") Meanwhile, there are issues with the federal law itself. Problems with the law The federal law is both overinclusive and underinclusive, experts told us. Many mentally ill people who are covered by the federal law prohibiting them from having a gun do not pose a danger to others, said Pace University law professor and mental disability law expert Linda Fentiman. At the same time, she said, the law does not cover people who could pose more danger -- such as some schizophrenics who are also substance abusers and have committed violent acts -- if they haven’t been adjudicated or committed. Indeed, many people with more serious conditions go undiagnosed or do not get treatment, much less end up in a legal proceeding over their illness. Fentiman’s points were also made in a law journal article by a New York University law professor and gun law expert James Jacobs, which says: Undoubtedly, court proceedings are never initiated for the majority of dangerously mentally ill individuals … Likewise, a significant percentage of those adjudicated mentally defective or civilly committed are not actually dangerous. A footnote Before we close, a footnote on one gun restriction change, given that it has received references since the Florida school shooting: In February 2017, Trump and Congress rescinded an executive order signed two months earlier by President Barack Obama. It was intended to prohibit an estimated 75,000 people who have mental illness and get Social Security disability benefits from buying guns. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the order, saying it ""advances and reinforces the harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent."" Our rating Responding to the Florida school shooting, in which the confessed shooter has some history of mental health problems, Ryan said we ""have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms."" A federal law, and some state laws, do prohibit people adjudicated as ""mentally defective"" or involuntarily committed to a mental health facility from possessing a gun. But experts say that standard includes people who do not pose a danger to others. And it does not account for a much larger set of people who might be dangerous but have not been diagnosed with, or treated for, a serious mental illness. For a statement that is partially accurate but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC98F300>],/factchecks/2018/feb/26/paul-ryan/wake-parkland-paul-ryans-claim-about-laws-aimed-st/

Florida lawmaker repeats dodgy claim about crimes by cops vs. concealed permit holders
","Florida State Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-North Fort Myers, appeared on CNN to explain why he and his colleagues voted not to consider a bill to ban assault-style weapons after the horrific high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. During the interview, Caldwell drew upon a favored talking point. ""A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder,"" Caldwell said Feb. 21. The comment caught our ear and we were curious about the data behind it. We reached out to Caldwell and got no response. His source is most likely number-crunching by John Lott, head of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that has written about what it sees as the media’s anti-gun agenda, the need for parishioners to go to church armed, and similar themes. In 2015, Lott compared the rate of crimes committed by police nationwide to permit revocations in Texas, Florida and Michigan. The numbers on police crime came from a national search of news reports by a team at Bowling Green State University. Lott took the national data and compared it to the fraction of permit holders in Texas who had their permits revoked. Lott worked the data several ways and found a substantial gap. ""The rate for police was between 7 to 10 times higher than for permit holders,"" Lott said. But Lott’s work contains one clear counting flaw. His data on crimes by police came from research by Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University. Stinson told PolitiFact that Lott failed to note that Stimson was reporting the number of cases, not the number of individual officers involved in crimes. ""Some officers are arrested more than once, and some arrested officers have more than one arrest case because of multiple victims,"" Stinson said. ""So, the whole analysis is wrong because the rates are mangled by using a different unit of analysis."" Lott said he doubts that would make a sufficient difference. ""The number of officers committing crimes could be higher or lower, but you’d have to have it be 7 to 10 times lower in order to reverse the ranking."" he said. ""That doesn’t seem very likely."" There’s another counting issue. Two leading researchers questioned Lott’s use of permit revocations to measure crimes by permit holders. ""Those data undercount the true number of infractions,"" said criminologist Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Think of the process: an infraction occurs, then it must be reported to the police or another legal authority, the police must find it as a crime or infraction that would warrant revocation, and then the revocation must occur."" Rosenfeld said instances fall out of the dataset at each step along the way. Lott agreed that national victimization surveys show that relatively small percentages of crimes get reported, even fewer result in an arrest, and a smaller fraction yet lead to conviction. ""Revocations won’t capture the full number,"" he said. ""I don’t know how to compare that pattern to police crimes because there are no matching survey data for police. Lott said he believes that police would be less likely than the average permit holder to be caught in a crime, but that is more theory than proven trend. Law professor and statistical analyst John Donohue at Stanford University gave another reason to doubt the link between revocations and crime. In his research, he found a ""number of cases where the permit holder was killed while committing a crime and of course those permits are not revoked."" Donohue added that much research shows that when the number of police rises, crime goes down. Caldwell said that a law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a concealed weapon permit holder. That is based on shaky numbers. The article behind Caldwell’s statement treated the number of criminal cases involving officers as if it were equal to the number of officers themselves. According to the researcher that looked at those crimes by police, that ""mangled"" the crime rates of officers. A single officer could be named in many cases. On the flip side of the ledger, other researchers said that using permit revocations undercounts the number of crimes by permit holders. The analyst behind the Caldwell’s statement agreed that it is an imperfect measure. In short, the statement rests on dicey numbers. Those numbers point to the need for more research, but they don’t prove anything. We rate this claim False. Update: After this item published, we heard from John Lott and added his comments.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA65080>],/factchecks/2018/feb/23/matt-caldwell/florida-lawmaker-repeats-dodgy-claim-about-crimes-/

Did mass shootings increase 200 percent since assault weapons ban expired?
","Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., claimed mass shootings increased substantially after an assault weapons ban expired in 2004. The Democratic lawmaker represents the Parkland, Fla., community, where on Valentine’s Day a 19-year-old man killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Authorities say the gunman who’s been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder used an AR-15 rifle. ""Let's be clear, mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired,"" Deutch said during a Feb. 21 CNN town hall with survivors of the mass shooting. We’ve fact-checked several claims about gun control since the shooting and wondered if this one was true. At least one researcher found a significant increase in mass shootings since the assault weapons ban expired. But overall, experts caution against pegging an increase solely to the ban’s expiration, and told us Deutch’s claim is based on a flawed analysis. A federal law from 1994 to 2004 banned the manufacture of 19 military-style assault weapons, assault weapons with specific combat features, ""copy-cat"" models, and certain high-capacity ammunition magazines of more than 10 rounds. Congress did not renew the ban once it expired in September 2004. What happened next? Advocates on both sides of the gun debate often point to the same report assessing the ban published in 2004 for the U.S. Justice Department. One key takeaway: The report said it was premature to make a definitive conclusion about the ban’s impact. It said there had been mixed results in reducing criminal use of the banned guns and magazines. If the ban were to be renewed, it might reduce the number of gunshot victims, but the effect would likely be ""small at best and possibly too small for reliable measurement,"" the report said. If the ban lapsed, the report said, it would be possible for new assault weapons to be used in mass murders. Former President Bill Clinton made a similar point as Deutch in 2013 when he said, ""Half of all mass killings in the United States have occurred since the assault weapons ban expired in 2005, half of all of them in the history of the country."" The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded the claim Three Pinocchios. The fact-check found that Clinton was exaggerating research from Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation at the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Why is that relevant? Deutch’s office cited commentary posted on The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, as support for his statement about a 200 percent increase in mass shootings. The commentary criticizes the Fact Checker article for missing the big picture behind Clinton’s point. Part of the Century Foundation commentary said: ""If we look from September 2004 all the way back to 1900 (104 years), as the Washington Post lays out, there were 118 mass shootings. That breaks down to 1.13 mass shooting incidents per year, on average, from 1900 to 2004. In the eight years since the assault weapons ban has expired, there have been 28 mass shooting events. That equals an average of 3.5 a year — an increase of over 200 percent."" But several experts, including Duwe, pointed out flaws in that examination and consequently, in Deutch’s relay of that information. ""This claim is, at best, very misleading for a few reasons,"" Duwe told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. For starters, to arrive at a 200 percent increase, the claim actually has to go back to 1900, and not the decade after the ban’s expiration that Deutch cited. ""The assault weapons ban was only in effect from 1994 to 2004, and that is the relevant period to compare with the period after 2004 if one is making a claim about the impact of the assault weapons ban,"" said Gary Kleck, David J. Bordua emeritus professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University. It’s also important to factor in population size changes, experts said. In an October piece for Politico, Duwe noted that ""since the mid 2000s, the incidence of mass public shootings on a per capita basis has been a bit higher than it was in the preceding 10 years."" But the rates over the past 10 years were not higher than in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Duwe said. ""If you have more shootings after the ban but also have a larger population, then when the numerator and denominator are increasing, the outcome number stays the same,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an expert on mass shootings research and an assistant professor of public justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. Nonetheless, mass public shootings have become deadlier over the last decade, as the number of victims shot and killed has increased since the expiration of the assault weapons ban, Duwe said. It’s also worth noting that there isn’t an universally accepted definition for mass shootings. Deutch’s office said their definition for mass shooting involved an individual with a firearm who targets four or more victims with intent to kill, not including the perpetrator. Duwe defined mass public shooting more narrowly as any incident in which four or more victims are killed with a gun within a 24-hour period at a public location in the absence of other criminal activity (robberies, drug deals, gang ""turf wars""), military conflict or collective violence. Louis Klarevas, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts-Boston and has also written about mass shootings, told us his research generally supports Deutch's claim. Klarevas examined incidents before, during and after the assault weapons ban when six or more people were shot and killed. • 1984 to 1994: 19 incidents • 1994 to 2004 (ban is in effect): 12 incidents • 2004 to 2014: 34 incidents That shows a 183 percent increase of incidents in the decade after the ban, compared to the years during the ban. However, several experts also cautioned against concluding that an increase in mass shootings would be solely tied to the expiration of the assault weapons ban. A critical question in the assessment of the assault weapons ban would be how often assault weapons, however defined, were used in mass shootings, said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. ""I do not expect the effect of a ban to be instantaneous, nor to end when the ban ends,"" Koger said. ""If there are a certain number of assault weapons in circulation when the ban goes into effect and these weapons are removed from circulation over time (say, if they are destroyed, become ineffective, or are seized by the police), then the effect of a sales ban increases over time."" If gun manufacturers find a way around the ban, its effects decrease over time, Koger said, adding that once a ban is lifted, ""its effects may linger to the extent that it decreased the supply of assault weapons in circulation."" Among other factors also worth considering is media coverage of mass shooters, which Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama, said rewards perpetrators with fame and can lead to copycat effects. ""Although firearms availability is the primary reason why the United States has more public mass shooters than other countries, media coverage of perpetrators may largely explain why the United States has seen more public mass shooters and deadlier incidents over time,"" Lankford said. Deutch said, ""Mass shootings went up 200 percent in the decade after the assault weapons ban expired."" Researchers of mass shootings told us the analysis Deutch relied on is flawed because it did not adjust for population changes and used irrelevant data points for comparison. Trends in the incidence and severity of mass public shootings on a per capita basis also show that the rate per 100 million is similar now to that of the 1980s and early 1990s, an expert told us. A separate analysis found an 183 percent increase in mass shootings where six or more people were killed in the decade after the ban, compared with the 10-year ban period. But experts caution against inferring that an increase is due only to the ban’s expiration. Deutch’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC897080>],/factchecks/2018/feb/23/ted-deutch/did-mass-shootings-increase-200-percent-assault-we/
