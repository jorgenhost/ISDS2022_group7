Donald Trump minimizes number of revoked gun permits in Florida
","Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton continued their battle over gun rights following his recent endorsement by the National Rifle Association. Trump told the NRA that Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment (she doesn’t) while Clinton said that Trump wants to allow guns in schools (he has promised to get rid of gun-free zones). But Trump says Clinton’s positions are misguided because gun permit holders follow the law — and that includes Florida, where he says only a tiny speck have lost the right to a gun permit. ""These are among the most law-abiding folks statistically in the entire country,"" Trump said. ""In Florida, for example, they have issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked. That's 0.006 percent."" Trump’s statement isn’t exactly right because he is only citing a certain category of revocations. A Trump spokeswoman didn’t respond for this fact-check. Number of Florida revocations Florida’s concealed weapon permit program started in 1987. Florida is a ""shall issue"" state, which means it's easier to get a gun permit here than in some other states, and Florida also grants permits to out-of-state residents. As Trump said, 3 million permits had been issued in Florida over the last three decades -- 3.1 million, to be more exact. As of April, about 1.6 million people in Florida currently have the permits. But Trump got his facts wrong about revocations, because he only cited a slice of them. Between October 1987 and April 2016, Florida revoked 10,841 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to a summary provided by the state’s division of licensing within the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The 168 figure that Trump cited is the number of those revoked for misuse of a firearm. There are various reasons that someone can have his or her gun permit revoked, according to state law. That includes permit holders who are convicted of certain crimes including felonies, those convicted of disorderly intoxication three times in a year, those committed to a mental institution, or those who due to physical problems can no longer safely use a gun. In 2011, the state stopped providing a breakdown for the reasons that permits have been revoked and by law now only track the number of revocations. What experts say about the revocations Revocation data alone doesn’t tell the full story about whether nearly all gun permit holders are law-abiding. In 2006, the state Legislature made the names of gun permit holders private, making it difficult for the public or journalists to examine whether there are questionable permit holders. That means we found little research about the topic in Florida, and much of it outdated. A Sun Sentinel investigation of those licensed to carry guns in the first half of 2006 found that permit holders included: More than 1,400 people who pleaded guilty or no contest to felonies but qualified because of a loophole in the law that allows them to carry guns three years after they complete their sentences if a judge withheld adjudication; 216 people with outstanding warrants, including a Tampa pizza delivery man wanted in the fatal shooting of a teenager over a stolen order of chicken wings; 28 people with active domestic-violence injunctions against them; and, Six registered sex offenders. The low number of revocations isn’t a surprise because the applicants had to meet criteria to get the permit in the first place, some experts said. ""Revocations are relatively rare largely because the permit-holder population was already ‘pre-selected’ to be relatively law-abiding by virtue of the requirement that applicants pass a background check to get a permit in the first place,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy & Research, said that, as a group, concealed-carry permit holders have a below average rate of arrests and convictions. ""But the policy question is are Florida and the other states who have made it so easy for nearly anyone to legally carry a loaded gun in public safer as a result? The research indicates that they are not,"" Webster said. ""The best-case scenario is that these laws don’t affect violent crime, but the most rigorous research on the subject indicates that when states expand concealed carry of firearms, assaults with guns increase."" Our ruling Trump said Florida has ""issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked."" Trump cited the number of permits issued since 1987 but exaggerated how few had been revoked. Florida revoked 10,841 permits, including 168 for misuse of a firearm. We don’t know the full picture about who has a gun permit -- or had it revoked -- because the identities of permit holders in Florida are private.

NFIB says 'vast majority' of minimum wage workers get raise in a year
","Minimum-wage jobs may not be the dead-end they’re portrayed to be, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. ""The vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year,"" says an infographic posted on the website of the Virginia chapter of the small business lobby. We emailed Nicole Riley, state director for the federation in Virginia, to see what that claim was based on. We heard back from Todd Pack, a federation spokesman for the group. Pack pointed us to a 2004 report by the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank. That study crunched U.S. Census Bureau data looking at the earnings of workers from 1979 to 2002. It examined how a minimum-wage worker’s pay in one year compared to the following year. Its conclusion: ""Over the 23 years of data studied in the report, nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage employees who continue employment are earning more than the minimum wage within 1–12 months,"" the report says. We’ll note that passage includes the qualifier that it focuses on minimum wage workers who continue working. Some low-wage workers may leave the workforce or become unemployed before they get a pay bump. Still, the report’s conclusion says minimum-wage employees get a pay bump based on their hard work and hence ""Nearly two-thirds receive a raise within a year of starting employment."" One issue with the Employment Policies Institute report is its age. It looks at a time period that ended in 2002. That’s 14 years ago and five years before the Great Recession started to grip the U.S. A more recent study examined this question. Researchers at Texas A&M University revisited the issue as part of a broad look at the minimum wage and its effect on employment in a 2013 paper. They studied Census Bureau data from 1979 through 2012 in which minimum-wage workers were asked about their earnings in an initial survey and again in a second interview a year later. The researchers found that among all minimum-wage workers, 16.55 percent of them left the labor force within a year and didn’t try to find a new jobs, and another 5.85 percent became unemployed but sought new work. Among those who remained employed, 65.85 percent were paid more than the minimum wage in the following year. The median higher pay for those workers was an additional $1 an hour, according to the report. When looking at all minimum-wage workers, including those who lost a job or left the labor force altogether, about 51 percent of them were earning higher than the minimum wage after a year on the job. Jonathan Meer, a co-author of the Texas A&M report and an economics professor there, told us workers who got a pay hike may have been at the same job or moved on to another employer. We should note that the minimum wage included people who live in states that defer to the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as in states that set the minimum at a higher rate. There are 29 states that have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate, but Virginia is not one of them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Jeremy West, the other co-author of the Texas A&M report, updated the figures for us. He said 72 percent of all minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But about one-fifth of them got raises only because the minimum wage had been increased in their states. That means 57.5 percent of minimum wage earners got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they found higher-paying jobs between 2014 and 2015. A final note: Our colleagues at PunditFact back in 2014 examined a similar statement by Steve Forbes, the former GOP presidential candidate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, told them that people who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving they’re dedicated employees who can hold jobs and that might speak more to why they’re getting a raise than anything else. As for those minimum-wage workers who instead leave the labor force entirely, they might be choosing to do so because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, Sinclair told PunditFact. Our ruling The National Federation of Independent Business here in Virginia says on its website that ""the vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year."" The group finds support from an older report from 12 years ago that says two-thirds of workers who stayed on the job got a raise within a year. The most recent numbers show that 72 percent of minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But one-fifth of them got the boost only because their state had raised its minimum wage - a step the NFIB opposes. That means 57.5 percent of the workers got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they had found better-paying jobs. We rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d50a0a2-974e-4229-bf51-191c8b60d9b2",/factchecks/2016/jun/02/nfederation-o-independent-business-virginia/nfib-says-vast-majority-minimum-wage-workers-get-r/

No, Donald Trump. You haven't broken the GOP voting record ‘by millions’ ... yet
","During a campaign speech in Sacramento on Wednesday, Donald Trump repeated claims about how many votes he’s received in the Republican presidential primary. ""We’ve broken the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party"" for votes in a primary election, the presumptive GOP nominee said. ""We’ve broken it by millions."" This is not the first time Trump has repeated the ""all-time record"" claim while in California. He said it on April 29 at the state’s Republican Party Convention when he was on pace to break the record but was still short at the time. We rated it ""False … for now."" He appears to have secured that record now. Trump’s victory in the Washington primary nearly a month later, on May 24, put him over the top, said Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics. But we wondered about the second part of Trump’s latest statement: ""We’ve broken it by millions."" Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next? We set out on a fact check.  Presumed GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigned in Sacramento on June 1, 2016 ahead of California's primary election. Jae C. Hong / AP Our research  Ostermeier told us Wednesday night that Trump got ahead of himself, once again. ""Trump will have broken the GOP record by millions after the remaining states vote on June 7th,"" the professor said in an email. ""But, currently sitting at 11.70 million votes, he is now only a shade more than 150,000 votes ahead of George W. Bush’s previous mark set in 2000, which tallied 11.54 million direct primary and caucus votes."" Trump’s campaign had not responded to a request for comment as of Wednesday night. The remaining contests include California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, all on June 7. Ostermeier is not the only one tracking vote tallies. RealClearPolitics.com shows Trump at 11.53 million popular votes -- slightly behind Bush’s 2000 vote total, certainly not ""millions"" ahead. Trump’s 2016 vote count has benefitted, Ostermeier said, from a larger national population, a more competitive race and from lasting nearly two months longer than Bush’s contest against Arizona Sen. John McCain. Ostermeier added that Trump also ""lost votes"" to this year’s crowded field of GOP candidates. Our ruling Trump said he’s broken ""by millions"" the record for GOP presidential primary votes. With victories on June 7th, including in California, he may well smash the record.  But he’s not there yet. We rate Trump’s claim False again … for now. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Massive alligator spotted roaming Florida golf course. Is it real?
","If you’ve seen the viral video of a giant alligator strolling across a Florida golf course, then you’ve probably had the same reaction we did: Can that be real? The video, originally posted by Charles Helms on his Facebook page Wednesday, May 25, shows a large alligator meandering across the fairway at Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto. The alligator is so big (some have estimated it to be around 15 feet), one of the watchers suspected it might be ""two guys in an alligator suit."" ""I didn't know if we were being punked or something,"" Helms later told reporters. Helms’ video has since traveled the globe with similar expressions of shock and disbelief. It has been picked up by several news outlets including Golf.com, Time and The Guardian. The video posted on Golf.com’s YouTube account has 6.1 million views as of this writing. Someone even mashed up Helms’ video with scenes from Jurassic Park. So, is it real? We went to the Manatee County golf course to find out. Our hunt took us to Ken Powell, regional manager for Pope Golf. Powell oversees the 18-hole golf course. Powell said the video -- and the gator -- are indeed real. Powell, who moved to Florida five years ago, said the gator can most often be found roaming around holes 3, 8 and 14. You might see him several days in a row, or not at all for weeks, Powell said. ""He could be there,"" Powell said. ""He could not. You’re never going to know."" He offered us a ride on a golf cart to try and spot the elusive beast.  Ken Powell points to the reservoir where the alligator is often seen. (Photo by Allison Graves) As we traveled along the edges of the bodies of water, we kept our eyes peeled for alligators of any kind, and especially for the ragged back of the now-famous reptile poking out of the water. Powell pointed out where he’s seen the gator and noted that it often follows a path, from a creek near Hole 8 to the lake. Sometimes, the alligator hides in the nearby black culvert pipe feeding into the lake, Powell said. We opted not to poke our head in. The 150-acre golf course is home to many wildlife species and plant life. Powell estimates there are around 37 bird species and more than 150 plant and tree species. The golf course is open every day except Christmas, open to the public and costs about $25 to play in the summer. Estimates of the gator’s length vary. Helms told ABC Action News in Tampa that it was around 14- to 15-feet long. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Florida record for a gator is 14 feet, 3.5 inches. We drove around the 8th hole and to the 3rd and the 14th. No gator. We stared off into the lake looking for him, but we only saw a pack of vultures and a few unique birds that hung out near the water holes. Cool. But not what we were after. After a thorough search, no luck. Powell showed a video he took from a different perspective, which shows the gator crossing a golf cart path, which he said is around 6 feet. He said the gator's tail was around 7 to 8 feet in total, and the entire gator could be double the length of the tail. Powell said he doesn’t want to get any closer to say for certain. He also added that the golf course may have a contest to name the alligator.  Frank Mazzotti, a professor and investigator for ""The Croc Docs"" at the University of Florida, said that a large Florida gator would typically stretch 10 to 12 feet. In his estimation from watching Helms’ video, Mazzotti said the gator was around 12 to 14 feet long. He said he doesn’t think it meets record size. Mazzotti also noted that the angle of the image could significantly alter how one measures it. Countering disbelievers arguing that the alligator is not real, Mazzotti pointed to its gait — a ""high walk"" — as characteristic of a large gator. ""An alligator moving from pond to pond — large alligators will typically engage in that behavior,"" he said. ""They will get up in all fours and walk in what I would call a stately fashion for an alligator, just dragging its tail a bit."" Saddened not to see the mammoth gator, we prepared our goodbyes to Powell and thought about our drive home. Then, on our way out, right in front of the golf course, we spotted a darkish tail sitting in a shallow pond. Could it be? Could we have found it? As we inspected the water, the alligator outline became clear. We grabbed our phones, readied our camera. But it was just 2 feet long or so. Nothing worth writing about. Our ruling Bloggers went crazy over a viral video of a massive alligator on a Manatee County golf course, with many expressing skepticism about the video’s authenticity. After speaking with the course’s regional manager and a University of Florida gator expert (and seeing additional video of the gator), we can say this video holds up. We rate this claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e08e2288-592d-478b-bf29-54b23a8da7a2",/factchecks/2016/jun/01/blog-posting/massive-alligator-spotted-roaming-florida-golf-cou/

Donald Trump: Thousands of veterans die waiting for treatment from the VA
","During a news conference called by Donald Trump to explain where money went from a veterans fundraiser, the presumptive Republican nominee for president was asked about the Veterans Administration health system. ""I'm entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. The VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country,"" he said. ""People are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They're dying while they wait on line. And I am in favor of, if they can't get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they're gonna go see a doctor and the country's going to pay for it. They're going to a private doctor, or a public hospital, or a public doctor but someplace that can take care (of them) immediately. We're losing thousands of people waiting on line."" We looked at this issue in October when Trump contended that, ""Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care."" At the time, he didn't explain where he got the estimate, but it dovetailed with a Sept. 2, 2015, report from the VA Office of Inspector General that tried to investigate a claim that 47,000 veterans died because the VA didn't process their health care applications in a timely manner. We rated Trump's claim Mostly False for several reasons, one of which was, as the report clearly stated, that 300,000 number — actually 307,173 — was an upper limit, reflecting the maximum number of unprocessed enrollment applications where, according to Social Security records, the applicant had died. But because the VA recordkeeping was so horrible, the report concluded, ""we cannot determine specifically how many pending (enrollment system) records represent veterans who applied for health care benefits or when they may have applied."" As PolitiFact reported last year, investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began. For example, the count is complicated by the fact that VA services include home loans and disability payments, some health care to family members of veterans and non-veteran employees of the VA system, and people receiving humanitarian care. In addition, in 2013, the VA added millions of records from other arms of the agency into the mix. Many of those ended up in the pending file because the software didn't allow a determination of whether the people were actually applying for medical care. Thus, an accurate count was impossible. However, Trump's new assertion backs off the 300,000 claim dramatically. At the news conference, he simply said that ""thousands"" had died waiting for health care from the VA, a disturbing but still far more modest claim. Having close to 2,000 instances would qualify as ""thousands,"" so if just 1 percent of the 307,173 records logged by the inspector general were cases of veterans dying before their paperwork could be processed, his claim would clear the bar. Clearly, deadly delays do happen. Investigators looking into operations at the urology unit of the Phoenix VA reported in 2015 that 1,484 cancer patients experienced significant delays in their care, 10 ""were placed at 'unnecessary risk for adverse outcomes.' At least half of those died,"" according to the Washington Post. CNN concluded in 2014 that it had identified 19 people who had died because of delays in getting simple medical screens at VA hospitals around the country. At one, the Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, S.C., at least six people had died. ""At the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Ga., the VA said three veterans died as a result of delayed care,"" CNN reported. In addition, the VA system is huge, with 1,550 sites providing some type of health care. It wouldn't take many cases at each site to have thousands dying because they couldn't get a timely appointment. We asked the Trump campaign for the source of the statistic, but didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said, ""We're losing thousands of (veterans) waiting on line"" because they can't get speedy health care from the Veterans Administration. Similar claims that 300,000 died because of delays by the VA clearly don't have hard evidence to back them up. Instances at individual VA hospitals seldom go into double digits, so there's no hard evidence there that the number of deaths is in the thousands either. Trump dialed back the rhetoric, but the claim still leaves out important context. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6610da3e-57d0-4e27-b0d2-29c80e1f3a58",/factchecks/2016/jun/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-thousands-veterans-die-waiting-treatm/

Is it easier to get into college than the military?
","So, if three out of every four young adults are not eligible for the military, but two out of every three high school graduates go onto college, what does that say? To Wisconsin state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a military intelligence officer in the Army Reserves and a veteran of the Iraq War, it says this: ""Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the United States military than it is to enroll in college."" That’s a broad claim from Kooyenga, a suburban Milwaukee Republican who made the statement in his April 1, 2016 constituent newsletter. He was asserting that ""if we are going to continue to be the world’s military leader, we must also become a leader in education."" Kooyenga seems to have a compelling talking point. But, as defense manpower specialist Beth Asch told us, it’s also ""a mashup of a lot of ideas in one sentence."" Post-high school Both the military and college are post-high school pursuits that require a high school diploma. But the similarities more or less end there. The military is looking for soldiers; colleges are looking for students. The minimum requirements to get into the military are pretty standard, even if they vary somewhat by branch. But the entrance requirements to get into Harvard are much different than those for getting into a community college. The military will pay you; but most students need to pay for college. So, in terms of Kooyenga’s claim: More difficult for whom? It’s more difficult for an overweight person with good grades to get into the military; but it’s more difficult for a fit person with bad grades to get into college. All that being said, Kooyenga does have some numbers on his side. The statistics Asch, an economist with the RAND Corp. think tank, said statistics Kooyenga cited to us to back his claim are generally on target. Military: Defense Department estimates dating back to at least 2009 say roughly 75 percent of Americans ages 17 to 24 would not qualify to enlist in the military. One reason is being overweight. Indeed, when first lady Michelle Obama said in 2011 that more than one-quarter of America’s young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military, PolitiFact Georgia rated her claim True. Other common reasons for being barred from the military, besides lacking a high school diploma: Conviction of a felony or serious misdemeanor; prior drug or alcohol abuse; and current prescription-drug use for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). College: Federal statistics, including one Kooyenga cited, show that roughly 66 percent of people who graduate from high school go onto college. (For 2015 high school graduates, 69 percent had enrolled in colleges or universities by October 2015, according to a federal report.) But, the two sets of figures reinforce the point that, while Kooyenga’s claim was broad, it really comes down to individual characteristics as to whether it’s more difficult for a person to get into the military versus college. Our rating Kooyenga said: ""Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the U.S. military than it is to enroll in college."" There isn’t definitive evidence to prove the claim, given that it mixes apples and oranges: The military and college are entirely different pursuits with different sets of minimum standards for getting in, and among colleges, the entrance requirements vary widely. At the same time, there are credible estimates saying that roughly 75 percent of young adults in America wouldn’t be eligible to enlist if they tried, while roughly two out of three high school graduates go on to a two- or four-year college. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/01/dale-kooyenga/its-easier-get-college-military/

Donald Trump says he wanted to keep veterans fundraising 'quiet,' but he touted it instead
","Donald Trump lashed out at reporters during a press conference in which he announced the names of veterans groups that he and his supporters had donated to. Trump had made a pledge to give money after backing out of debate in a Iowa and scheduling a rival fundraising event instead.   Trump scheduled the May 31 press conference after journalists, led by the Washington Post’s David Farenthold, asked questions about how much of the $6 million from the Iowa event had actually reached veterans charities over the next few months. At the press conference, Trump announced donations to more than three dozen groups totaling $5.6 million -- less than the promised $6 million, but close. (Here are the groups’ ratings from Charity Navigator, an independent organization that rates charities on efficiency and transparency.) But Trump also took the opportunity to slam journalists for asking about his follow-through with veterans groups. ""I wanted to keep it private, because I don't think it's anybody's business if I want to send money to the vets,"" Trump said. He then went on to talk about how much money he had raised, adding, ""I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job."" Anonymous charity has long been considered one of the most honorable types of charitable giving, but Trump has not practiced that in this case. While Trump could have kept quiet about his fundraising, he didn’t. Here are five examples in which Trump or his campaign touted their plans to hold the veterans fundraiser opposite the Jan. 28 Fox News debate in Iowa. • Press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa, Jan. 26. Trump told reporters, ""Probably I won't be doing the debate. I'm going to have something else in Iowa, do something where we raise money for the veterans and the wounded warriors. We're going to do something simultaneously with the debate."" • Statement by the Trump campaign, tweeted out by Trump, Jan. 26. It said in part, ""He will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind of mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again."" • Tweet, Jan. 28. ""It is my great honor to support our Veterans with you! You can join me now. Thank you! #Trump4Vets http://www.DonaldTrumpForVets.com"" • Tweet, Jan. 28. ""An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $6,000,000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate"" • Statement by the Trump campaign after the event. The campaign cited 22 groups that would receive donations from the fundraiser. All of those groups are also on the list that Trump released May 31.  Each of these statements touting Trump’s efforts to raise money for the campaign occurred months before the start of the media scrutiny he would come to criticize as too invasive of his privacy. We also found these photographs of Trump handing an oversized check to representatives of two veterans groups in Iowa on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.

Ted Strickland doesn't have a super PAC?
","The duel between leading U.S. Senate candidates in Ohio is feisty as ever, with polls showing Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland and incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman neck-in-neck. Strickland’s latest tactic against Portman is to call him out for serving the billionaire class at the expense of Ohio’s regular Joes. A campaign fundraising email from Strickland’s campaign manager portrays Portman in the grips of dark outside spending, while Strickland takes in small donations from voters. ""While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don’t have a super PAC,"" wrote campaign manager Rebecca Pearcey, ""and quite frankly, we don’t want one that spends millions to spew out lies and distortions."" We recalled a similar claim by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose own statement about not having a super PAC was fact-checked in the early months of the Democratic primary. We applied the same test to Strickland’s campaign rhetoric. Portman has an affiliated super PAC, meaning it’s dedicated solely to supporting him and opposing Strickland. Fighting for Ohio (though it’s registered in Alexandria, Va.) has spent more than $1.68 million against Strickland so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Top contributors to Fighting for Ohio include Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel ($250,000); Paul Singer, hedge fund manager of Elliott Management Corporation ($250,000); Edyth Lindner, widow of Carl Lindner, former owner of the Cincinnati Reds and Chiquita Brands ($100,000). Yes, Portman is funded by billionaires. But Strickland’s appeal for cash neglects to mention how he also benefits from outside spending. Senate Majority PAC is an unaffiliated funder that pledges its support to Democrats running for the Senate. The PAC mostly pays for TV and digital attack ads against Republican candidates. In this election season, the PAC has lasered in on four major Senate battlegrounds: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio.   Donors to the Senate Majority PAC include George Marcus, real estate broker at Marcus & Millichap ($1 million); Fred Eychaner, Newsweb Corporation founder ($1 million); and actor/director Seth MacFarlane ($500,000). Anyone can register an unaffiliated super PAC with the Federal Election Commission. This means even if the Senate Majority PAC’s love for Strickland was unrequited, there’s not much Strickland can do about it. It’s illegal for a candidate to coordinate with a super PAC, according to the Federal Election Commission rules. But such rules are rarely enforced — since 1999, commissioners have only launched three investigations on candidate-super PAC contact. Unlike Sanders, who filed a cease-and-desist order against a PAC backing him, Strickland hasn't disavowed the $1.75 million that the Senate Majority PAC has spent so far on the race targeting Portman. Strickland for Senate spokesman David Bergstein retweeted the Senate Majority PAC earlier this year. Donations from non-profits and ad buys aren’t reported to the Federal Election Commission, further complicating the question of whose pockets are deeper. ""The picture can change in an instant, and we may not know who’s truly ponying up the money on an ad to support a candidate,"" said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""There’s a lot of disingenuousness when candidates are saying, ‘You have more money,’ ‘No, you have more money.’ "" Our ruling A Strickland for Senate fundraising email said, ""While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don’t have a super PAC."" Strickland doesn’t have a super PAC solely focused on his campaign like the pro-Portman Fighting for Ohio. But big spenders still have Strickland’s back. It isn’t credible to say he’s impervious to the influence of dark money while still enjoying its benefits. The claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9d083367-2a63-48c5-9f3e-dd98d6775c7b",/factchecks/2016/may/31/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-doesnt-have-super-pac/

Fact-checking Hillary Clinton's claim that her email practices were 'allowed'
","Hillary Clinton is sticking to her defense that her use of a private email server while secretary of state was ""allowed,"" despite a critical independent audit that found it really wasn’t. In a May 26 interview, ABC reporter Liz Kreutz asked Clinton about her decision to use a server located in her New York home instead of a government email, as well as the audit, which was conducted by the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General. ""But this report said that you, quote, 'had an obligation to discuss' using your personal email and that you didn’t,"" Kreutz said. ""So how can you really say that it was allowed? Was it an error of judgment?"" Clinton replied: ""Well it was allowed, and the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice. Having said that, I have said many times that it was a mistake, and if I could go back I would do it differently."" Since the news of Clinton’s email came to light in 2015, she has argued that she ""complied with every rule"" and that the practice was ""allowed."" We haven’t yet put the issue on the Truth-O-Meter because there were too many unknowns. But the inspector general’s report has clarified some of those unknowns and demonstrated that Clinton’s exclusive use of personal email was, in fact, not allowed. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon told PolitiFact that in this specific interview, Clinton was making the point that some personal email use is permitted. She wasn’t disputing the inspector general’s finding that her exclusive use of personal email was not permitted. But for anyone unaware of that nuance — say, the average voter — it sounds like Clinton is defending her email practices as a whole, as something that was fully permitted by the State Department, which is the argument she has been making all along. And that’s just not right. The gist of the problem is that Clinton never asked anyone if she could use her personal email setup. And the report seems to find that if she had asked, the policy was clear that such a request should have been rejected. ""The private email server was only allowed in the sense that no one managed to prevent it from happening,"" said John Wonderlich, director of policy at the Sunlight Foundation, which promotes government transparency. First of all, the State Department’s policy as of 2005 (Clinton joined in 2009) is that all day-to-day operations are to be conducted on the official State Department information channel. Clinton never once used this State Department email system. And if an employee needs to use a personal email for conducting official business, he or she has an ""obligation"" to consult with the chief information officer and the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. However, Clinton did neither. These two offices told the inspector general that they ""did not — and would not — approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business, because of the restrictions in the (Foreign Affairs Manual) and the security risks in doing so."" She also didn’t consult the Bureau of Information Resource Management, which she was supposed to do if she needed to send sensitive but unclassified information over non-departmental channels. Many of her emails contain this kind of information. Further, Clinton needed to show that her personal email had the proper security features to send sensitive but unclassified information. While Clinton has said her private server was secure, she did not formally demonstrate this to the State Department. Clinton also didn’t comply fully with records management expectations. Notably, she did not ensure that her work-related emails were preserved on the State Department system in real time, nor did she surrender them when she left office. The inspector general and the National Archives and Records Administration say Clinton’s retroactive turnover of 30,000 emails has mitigated this problem somewhat, but the record is incomplete — with certain chunks of time and correspondence missing from her email vault. Fallon pointed PolitiFact to a May 26 CNN interview where Clinton said that at the time she made the decision to use a private server, she ""thought it was allowed."" And campaign chair John Podesta wrote in an email to supporters: ""Had Secretary Clinton known of any concerns about her email setup at the time, she would have taken steps to address them. She believed she was following the practices of other Secretaries and senior officials."" But it’s hard not to be skeptical of the narrative that Clinton was ignorant of the rules when the assistant secretary for diplomatic security sent a memo directly to Clinton in March 2011 that urged employees to ""minimize the use of personal web email for business,"" citing cybersecurity concerns. Three months later, a similar email went out to all staff, sent under Clinton’s name. According to the audit, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security employees tried to get Clinton to use a department-issued BlackBerry smartphone as soon as she took office, but they were unsuccessful. In fairness to Clinton, the inspector general found 90 individuals in the State Department who used their personal email for business. One of her predecessors, Colin Powell, also used personal email exclusively. However, the rules regarding email records preservation were a lot less clear under Powell, who served from January 2001 to January 2005, than under Clinton. And the rules became even more explicit in 2014, after Clinton left office, clearly stating that ""personal accounts should only be used in exceptional circumstances."" In any case, experts said Clinton should have known better. ""Given that the secretary of state was responsible for promoting State Department policies and enforcing them, she should be precluded from claiming she did not know about or understand them,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation. Our ruling Regarding her decision to use a private email server, Clinton said, ""It was allowed."" No one ever stopped Clinton from conducting work over her private email server exclusively. But that’s not the same thing as it being allowed. Offices within the State Department told an independent inspector general that if she had asked, they would not have allowed it. The report from the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General shatters one of Clinton’s go-to phrases about her email practice. We rate her claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4b4db57e-35dc-448b-90e4-fb3a1cbbb333",/factchecks/2016/may/31/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-claim-her-email-pra/

Pat Toomey’s Wall Street earnings likely topped one Hillary Clinton speech
","U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, R-Pa., appeared on the Chris Stigall Show two weeks ago, and he wasn’t afraid to poke fun at his Wall Street past. When Stigall mentioned that Hillary Clinton has been paid lucratively for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, Toomey responded by making a comparison between Clinton and himself. ""It's entirely possible,"" said Toomey ""that the democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s."" ""In fact,"" he went on, ""it’s quite likely."" We reached out to the Toomey campaign multiple times seeking information about how much he earned during his six years on Wall Street, but they never got back at us. The hefty salaries of modern-day Wall Street traders are viewed by many with disgust, but 30 years ago, Wall Street was a very different place. Is it possible Pat Toomey earned less on Wall Street than Clinton did for a single speech there? We decided to find out. How much has Hillary made for her speeches? It’s no secret Clinton has made a lot money from giving speeches, but most of the speeches that she’s given were not to Wall Street banks. According to her 2014 tax return, 14 of the 41 speeches Clinton gave in 2013 were to Wall Street banks, and she was paid the same amount, $225,000, for most of them. But on Oct. 7, 2014, her Public Financial Disclosure Report report states that she gave a speech to Deutsche Bank and earned $260,000 for it. CNN compiled a list of all the amounts that the Clintons have earned for speaking to big banks from February 2001 to May 2015, and it reaffirms that amount for her Deutsche Bank speech. But Toomey’s claim specifically refers to Wall Street. If Clinton made $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street firm, then Toomey would have had to have made an average of about $43,000 during his six years on Wall Street for his claim to be true. The Rise of the Stock Market and the Traders in it Toomey worked on Wall Street from 1984 to 1990 for Chemical Bank and Morgan Grenfell. In a 1999 interview with Derivatives Strategy magazine, Toomey discussed the work he did at Morgan Grenfell, where he said he and a few others were recruited to start a ""serious derivatives operation."" ""We were dealing in various currencies,"" said Toomey, ""all kinds of interest rate and currency-related derivatives—options, swaps, forwards and so on."" A report by the Los Angeles Times confirmed Toomey traded derivatives around interest rates and currencies. Again, when we asked the Toomey campaign if they could provide us with approximate salary figures for Toomey or Wall Street derivatives traders in the 1980s, we didn’t receive a response. Luckily, there are some figures we can use as approximations. The derivatives market exploded during Toomey’s time on Wall Street. In fact, the size of the global derivatives industry more than quintupled from 1986 to 1991. According to a report by Mother Jones, the notional value of derivatives contracts went from $865 billion to nearly $4.5 trillion. Salaries for Wall Street employees were not nearly as lucrative as they are today, but employees there were still among the highest-paid in the nation. A New York Times article from 1987 put the average salary on Wall Street that year at $65,000, before bonuses (which was more than three times the average New Yorker’s salary of $19,000). That number included all Wall Street employees, from the highest-ranking positions to new analysts. According to the Derivatives magazine article, Toomey’s position at Chemical Bank was ""associate,"" a position generally considered to be above entry level and often given to people with MBAs.   Philip Bond, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Washington, said a salary of $43,000 was within the realm of possibility. ""I guess an average of $43,000 a year strikes me as being on the low side,"" said Bond,  ""But I don't think it is impossible. After talking to colleagues here, I believe the starting salary for an undergraduate on Wall Street would have been considerably less than $43,000 in 1985."" However even in the 1980s, Wall Street traders generally earned significant bonuses along with their annual salaries. Former bonds salesman Michael Lewis wrote about how bonuses were determined in his bestselling book Liar’s Poker. ""A salesman's year-end bonus was determined by traders,"" writes Lewis, "" A trader's bonus was determined by the profits on his trading books. A salesman had no purchase on a trader, while a trader had complete control over a salesman."" Toomey doesn’t appear to have been a bad trader. Morgan Grenfell hired him and other associates to start its derivatives operation in 1986, according to the Derivatives Strategy magazine article.   If Toomey made significant profits as a derivatives trader, then he would likely have made a solid bonus along with his salary. Lewis, as he notes in Liar’s Poker, made a bonus of $45,000 in his first year as a bonds salesman, matching his $45,000 salary that year. Lewis had a M.A. in economics when he entered Wall Street, while Toomey only had a B.A. in government. It is possible Toomey made an annual compensation of less than $43,000 per year, but that seems unlikely when we take a bonus into account. And even if he did make an average of $43,000 a year during his time on Wall Street, inflation would put his total haul at well above $260,000. We asked two professors to help us adjust a 1985 salary of $43,000 for wage inflation. Ehud Ronn, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, also noted the figure of $43,000 a year seemed somewhat low. Ronn used an index that reported a historical time series of compensation in the financial sector. According to the index, a salary of $43,200 in March 1985 would be equivalent to $124,200 in 2016. If Toomey made an average of $124,200 over six years, he would have made $745,200 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. Bond, the University of Washington professor of finance, used GDP per capita to adjust for wage inflation. ""Nominal GDP per capita is about 4 times as high today is in the mid-1980s"" said Bond, ""So if financial compensation had grown at the same speed as nominal GDP per capita, $43K in 1985 would equate to roughly $170K today."" If Toomey made an average of $170,000 over six years, he would have made $1,020,000 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. ""Based on these back-of-envelope calculations, I suspect Toomey's statement is true, or at least close to true,"" started Bond, ""but if he adjusted for inflation, his claim is most likely not true."" Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate law at Cornell University and an internationally recognized expert in the field of financial derivatives, seemed to believe that a yearly figure of $43,000 would have been very low even in the 1980s. ""If he did receive only $43,000 a year for six years of trading,"" said Stout, ""he must have been one of the worst performing and worst paid derivatives traders on Wall Street at the time."" Our ruling Pat Toomey said that it was possible and even likely that Hillary Clinton earned more money giving a single speech to a Wall Street bank than he did in his six years there. Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street. It’s possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So it’s likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomey’s non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. And Toomey didn’t just say it was ""possible"" he made less in six years on Wall Street than Clinton did in one speech. He said it was ""likely."" Based on average salaries and bonuses from this era of Wall Street and input from experts, it does not seem likely. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomey’s non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars.

Trump inflates wind turbine eagle deaths
","Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, says he favors energy from all sources to power America. Wind is on his list, but in remarks in Bismarck, N.D., Trump emphasized that wind turbines are not without their drawbacks. ""There are places for wind but if you go to various places in California, wind is killing all of the eagles,"" Trump said. ""You know if you shoot an eagle, if you kill an eagle, they want to put you in jail for five years. And yet the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. … They’re killing them by the hundreds."" Setting aside Trump’s exaggeration about killing all of the eagles, we wondered, are wind turbines in California killing ""hundreds and hundreds,"" as he said? The truth is, we lack complete data, but Shawn Smallwood, California’s leading ornithologist for the study of raptors and wind turbines, told us Trump is exaggerating. Smallwood says about 100 eagles die each year due to impacts with the spinning blades on windmills. ""Mr. Trump could not have arrived at his number (hundreds and hundreds) from any reliable source, unless he is referring to all eagles killed by industrial-scale wind turbines since they were installed in the early 1980s,"" Smallwood said. ""Cumulatively over time, there have been hundreds of eagles killed, probably about 2,000."" We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Smallwood has worked intensively on one of the country’s first wind farms at Altamont Pass in Northern California. At one time, nearly 7,000 windmills churned out power there. But a combination of lawsuits and public pressure has cut that number by more than half. ""My best estimate for golden eagle fatalities in the Altamont Pass was 60 per year until the last couple of years when the old turbines started getting replaced by larger turbines that are being more carefully sited to reduce eagle fatalities,"" Smallwood said. Today, Smallwood said the number of eagle fatalities is much lower. Altamont Pass lies in Alameda County. Government figures show 14 golden eagles killed there in 2013. And that was two years before one of the leading operators in the wind farm announced it was shutting down over 800 turbines. By the way, bald eagle deaths appear to be rare. Also, as a species, there is less concern because their population, about 70,000, is growing, while the population of golden eagles, about 20,000, is at best holding steady and could be declining. To be sure, Smallwood said much information is missing statewide. Several facilities fail to provide regular monitoring reports, or at least, they fail to make them public. Audubon California agrees with Smallwood’s estimate. Spokesman Garrison Frost told us ""this is about as accurate as you’re going to get."" A spokesman for the American Bird Conservancy told us that they believe the number remains high. ""It is unknown how many golden eagles are being killed each year in California, but based on what we know from Altamont, it is likely that over 100 are dying each year at wind farms,"" said Steve Holmer. ""Many of these birds could be saved with proper siting and mitigation measures."" Our ruling Trump said that in California, windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. The best estimate is that about 100 golden eagles die each year from collisions with wind turbine blades. The data are not perfect, but the people most concerned about the welfare of the eagles do not go along with Trump’s figure. While the data are sketchy, the information at hand tells us that windmills were more deadly in the past, but today, fewer turbines, new designs and better siting have reduced fatalities. Trump is correct that California wind farms are a threat to eagles but not on the magnitude he suggested. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Infrastructure', 'Water', 'California', 'Dianne Feinstein']","
Does California ‘have the same water infrastructure’ as it did in the 1960s?
"," U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, has called solving California’s water wars one of the toughest challenges of her career. Tougher, she says, than passing a federal assault weapons ban in 1994. But the reason the 82-year-old lawmaker says she keeps pushing is simple: The state’s water infrastructure is outdated and its drought emergency persists. She has spearheaded a bill that would pump $1.3 billion into water desalination, recycling and storage projects. One of her recent comments about the need for that bill caught our attention. California has ""the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people,"" Feinstein said in a Q&A with the Sacramento Bee on April 3, 2016. ""We had better get cracking, because it’s only going to get worse."" She made a similar claim on February 19, 2016 during a speech at a Public Policy Institute of California event.  Feinstein makes the claim at the 27:30 mark in the Public Policy Institute of California video above. Was Feinstein right? Does California, a state known for innovation, really rely on a plumbing system from generations ago with no substantial upgrades?  View of the Oroville Dam in Northern California. Construction started on this early piece of the State Water Project in 1957. It was partially completed by 1964. Photo by Dept. of Water Resources. Our research California is now home to nearly 40 million people. It was more than a half century ago, around 1960, when the state had about 15.7 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. To get a better read on Feinstein’s accuracy, we spoke with Jay Lund, director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis. ""In some ways it’s true,"" Lund said. ""We haven’t built very large water projects for quite a long time -- since the State Water Project, really."" Construction started in the late 1950s and early 1960s on the State Water Project, a massive set of reservoirs, aqueducts and pumping plants that store and deliver water up and down the state to 25 million Californians. The backbone of the project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Chrisman Pumping Plant at the Grapevine is one of the southernmost along the California Aqueduct. Photo By Amy Quinton / Capital Public Radio. Feinstein’s spokesman, Tom Mentzer, pointed to a state timeline for the project to explain the senator’s statement. Her claim ""conveys the idea that California’s core water conveyance and storage infrastructure was designed when the state’s population was approximately 16 million,"" Mentzer said. ""The timeline shows initial facilities were finished by the 1970s. A number of subsequent facilities were built later, but they’re not the core infrastructure."" Construction on another ambitious project -- the federal government’s Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley -- started in the late 1930s and was completed in the early 1970s. Smaller projects Lund said California hasn’t built anything as large since then. Some of the state’s major water districts have independently added ""some important pieces"" of storage and conveyance in the last couple of decades, Lund said. One example is Diamond Valley Lake in Riverside County, the largest reservoir in Southern California. It was completed in 2000 by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and holds up to 800,000 acre feet of water, ""almost as big as Folsom (Lake),"" Lund noted. Another is Los Vaqueros Reservoir, completed in 1998 by the Contra Costa Water District near Brentwood. It holds 160,000 acre feet. And last December, the $1 billion Carlsbad Desalination Project, built by private firm Poseidon Water, started converting ocean water into drinking water for residents in San Diego County. It’s expected to contribute up to 10 percent of the region’s water supply. California’s water system is ""not exactly the same,"" as the early 1960s, Lund added. ""But it’s substantially the same in terms of the broad water supply and flood control projects.""  Projects above represent the bulk of the California State Water Project (SWP) as well as a few additional projects, it does not represent all the water projects in California.  Our ruling U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said California has ""the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people."" Large portions of the state’s modern-day water system, including the State Water Project and Central Valley Project were built in the 1960s, when California reached the 16 million population mark. Some pieces of those systems, which continue to provide water to California’s cities and farms, were completed in the 1970s. In more recent decades, water districts have constructed significant storage reservoirs, plus a large desalination plant, to supplement regional supplies. Feinstein’s comment could have used this additional information. Still, it’s clear that California has not constructed any new statewide projects to match the scale of those of started in the 1960s.

"['Economy', 'Population', 'Virginia', 'Nikki Haley']","
Nikki Haley: 'More people today are leaving Virginia than moving in'
","South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley came to Richmond recently and torched Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s management of the state’s economy. Haley came to endorse and raise money for fellow Republican Ed Gillespie, who plans to run for governor in 2017. She said Virginia has taken a ""nose dive"" since McAuliffe, a Democrat, took office in 2014 and is a ""non-issue"" in the competition among states to recruit new businesses. At a forum arranged by Gillespie’s PAC, Haley hearkened to the days of Gov. Bob McDonnell, McAuliffe’s Republican predecessor. ""Virginia was a tough guy to beat,"" she said, adding, ""... and then, to turn it around and find out what no state ever wants: More people today are leaving Virginia than moving in."" She made a similar statement a half-hour later while talking to reporters. ""Most disturbing is that you’ve got more people leaving Virginia than coming in,"" Haley said. ""That’s a sign of an economy that is going down, and going down fast."" We wondered if it’s true that more people are exiting than entering the state. It’s a claim that Gillespie has previously made, foreshadowing a campaign that will promise economic change. Gillespie, noting PolitiFact’s presence among the journalists covering Haley’s visit, provided on-the-spot sourcing for her comments. He said they were based on 2013 data from the Internal Revenue Service. The numbers The IRS publishes annual statistics on the number of households that moved and filed federal tax returns from a different state than the one in which they lived the previous year. Demographers and economists use these figures to track the ""net migration"" of families in the U.S. from year to year. The data show that from 1991 through 2012, Virginia always had more families coming in than going out. That changed in 2013, when there was a net loss of 3,082 households. In 2014, the last year for which figures are available, Virginia lost a net of 12,463 households. This doesn’t mean there’s been a massive flow out of Virginia. To give some perspective, about 3.8 million Virginia households annually file federal taxes. The combined net losses to other states in 2013 and 2014 come to less than half of 1 percent of households. The U.S. Census Bureau also tracks net migration through an annual survey. It estimates that Virginia gained a net of 3,099 people through domestic migration during a 12 month period that ended July 1, 2013. Then,  the state had had estimated net losses of 20,400 for the 12 months ending at the start of July 2014, and 23,813 for the 12 months ending in July 2015. The reason Jobs are the main reason people are leaving Virginia for other states, said James V. Koch, an economist and former president of Old Dominion University. Virginia is home to large military bases and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers which drive the economy of Northern Virginia. It has been hurt in recent years by efforts to curb federal spending through sequestration programs. Koch and other state economists have said those efforts largely are responsible for Virginia’s flat economic growth in 2014, the latest year for which statistics are available. Only two states did worse: Mississippi and Alaska. The result, Koch said, is that many Virginians whose paychecks were dependent on federal spending, particularly for defense, have left the state in recent years for new jobs. Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, wrote an article in September that also cited sequestration as a reason people were leaving Virginia. Lombard added that more retirees are exiting Virginia than coming into the state. Overall population All of these migration figures might give you the impression that Virginia’s overall population is declining, but that’s not the case. Virginia’s population is growing every year. It expanded from 8 million in 2010 to an estimated 8.38 million in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. What explains the seeming contradiction? Again, net migration is a narrow statistic that measures the number of people or households moving to different states. It doesn’t take into account the two much larger influences on population: •More people are being born in Virginia than are dying here, and •More people are coming into Virginia as first-year immigrants and temporary foreign workers and students than are leaving to live in other countries. Now let’s get back Haley. Her claim that more people are moving out of Virginia than into the state doesn’t count immigrants. If we include them, her claim unravels. The most current figures from the Census Bureau - tracking the 12-month period that ended on July 1, 2015 - shows an estimated net gain of about 39,000 such foreigners in Virginia compared with a net loss of about 24,000 people who moved to a different state. Put together, the numbers suggest there was a net gain of almost 15,000 people who chose to move to Virginia during those 12 months. Final note: As we’ve said many times previously, governors have little control over the economies of their states. In this case, Haley holds McAuliffe responsible for problems that economists say resulted largely from sequestration actions begun by Congress and the White House in March 2013 - nine months before McAuliffe became governor. McAuliffe took office in January 2014. The IRS data show the first year Virginia experienced a net loss of households was 2013. Census data suggest the losses began swelling in the latter half of 2013. Our ruling Haley said, ""More people are leaving Virginia today than moving in."" She made her statement in a partisan attack on McAuliffe’s economic stewardship, saying Virginia no longer is competitive in attracting and keeping businesses. Her claim was based on IRS data on the number of people who moved and filed tax returns from a different state than the one in which they lived the previous year. Economists and demographers use these figures to chart migration in states. In 2014, Virginia had a net loss of 12,463 households to other states. The latest Census Bureau figures estimate Virginia lost a net of 23,813 people to other states during a 12-month period ending in July 2015. Because Haley was talking in the context of Virginia competing with other states, we think her claim largely holds up. But there’s a caveat. If you add first-year immigrants and temporary foreign workers and students to the mix, then annual Census Bureau estimates show more people continue to enter Virginia than leave it. So we rate Haley’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2fb6662b-ae96-4dd8-8584-d361711933a8",/factchecks/2016/may/31/nikki-haley/nikki-haley-more-people-today-are-leaving-virginia/

Chris Christie says New York Giants are New Jersey’s team
","
Sandwiched between two cities with avid sports fans, New Jerseyans’ favorite sport teams often don’t bear their state’s name.

But as the New York Giants prepare to take on the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, Gov. Chris Christie is calling dibs: the Giants are New Jersey’s team, he said.

""The only thing New York about the Giants is the ‘NY’ on their helmets. They train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey,"" he said during a Jan. 22  interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" The Giants defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football Conference championship game later that day, securing their spot in Super Bowl XLVI.

The day after, Christie told reporters at a news conference: ""It's great to have one of the state’s two football teams in the Super Bowl. As you know, I root for the Jets over the Giants, but, you know, it's great for the Giants to be there and it's good for New Jersey. And so I'm thrilled to have one of New Jersey's teams in the Super Bowl. And look forward to two weeks from yesterday. And you can be sure I will be rooting hard for the New Jersey Giants.""

As fans gear up for the Giants’ fifth Super Bowl appearance, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to test Christie’s three claims: the Giants ""train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey.""

The self-declared Jets’ fan has his Giants’ facts pretty straight, we found.

Since 1976, the Giants -- a team that started in New York in 1925 -- have played in a stadium in East Rutherford. In 2010, the team moved into the new MetLife Stadium, which they share with the New York Jets.

The Timex Performance Center, the Giants’ practice facility, opened in 2009 in East Rutherford. The team practices there in the regular season.

The team had held its summer training camp at the University at Albany since 1996. But this summer, because of a labor dispute between players and the National Football League that shortened the off-season, the Giants trained at their East Rutherford facility.

It was the first time the camp was held in New Jersey since the team was  at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison from 1988 to 1995.  But John Mara, the Giants president and CEO, said in July that the team had ""every intention"" of returning this summer to Albany.

So, the Giants play in New Jersey. And, at least this year, they practiced entirely in New Jersey. But where do the players live?

Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon told us in an e-mail that the entire roster calls the Garden State home during football season.

Of the 53 players on the active roster, PolitiFact New Jersey found 23 players who have a New Jersey address, own a home in New Jersey or have registered to vote in New Jersey, according to a public records search.

Our ruling

Christie claimed the New York Giants are New Jersey’s team. ""They train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey,"" he said.

The Giants have called East Rutherford home since 1976 and started playing in its current stadium in 2010.

For 15 years the team held its summer training camp at the University at Albany, but this year’s camp was held in New Jersey at the team’s regular-season training facility. And every player on the team’s current roster calls New Jersey home during football season, according to a Giants spokesman.

We’ll leave the debate on whether that makes the Giants New Jersey’s team to gridiron fans, but we rate Christie’s statement True.

Stegmaier says Chesterfield County has cut more government jobs than state of Virginia
","
Chesterfield County Administrator James J.L. Stegmaier wants folks to know he oversees a lean government.

""Chesterfield has eliminated more positions from its general government operations than the Commonwealth has from the entire state government since (fiscal) 2009,"" Stegmaier said in an outline of a Dec. 14, 2011 speech he made to the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce.

We were struck by this statement. The state government has 33 full-time equivalent workers for every one in Chesterfield’s central government. Is it true that the county, in raw numbers, eliminated more jobs than the much larger state?

We ran a check.

Chesterfield’s general government operations include workers in all services except education. Stegmaier said that if education was included, the numbers would only grow in Chesterfield’s favor since the county has trimmed employment in that department as well.

Stegmaier, to support his claim that Chesterfield’s central government has shed more jobs than the state, pointed us to two sets of statistics.

He cited county budgets that detail Chesterfield’s authorized full-time employment levels in general government. In fiscal 2009, there were 3,697 authorized jobs. In fiscal 2012, which ends June 30, there were 3,516 such positions. That’s a decrease of 181 approved jobs.

For state figures, Stegmaier relied on data from Virginia’s Department of Planning and Budget that detail authorized employment levels for all agencies. The state lists the number of employees as ""full time equivalents"" -- a figure that lumps together full-time and part-time employees. That’s why the overall number ends in a decimal.

In fiscal 2009, the state had a maximum employment level 114,724.44 jobs. This fiscal year, the maximum is set at 114,566.73.

So the state’s drop of about 157 authorized employees falls 24 short of Chesterfield’s reduction.

But we had some issues with Stegmaier’s proof. He had not made an apples-to-apples comparison because Chesterfield only tallied full-time employees while the state counted full-timers and part-timers.

Also, the state and county numbers Stegmaier compared are maximum employment levels in budgets. Not all of those jobs were filled.

We think the acid test for Stegmaier’s statement is measuring the change in the number of people who actually worked for Chesterfield County and the state.  

We turned to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management’s website, which lists the number of state employees for any given month over the past 21 years.

On June 30, 2009 -- the end of fiscal 2009 -- , the state had 119,850.81 full-time equivalent employees. By Oct. 31, 2011, the latest date for which statistics were available, the number  rose to 120,465.97. The state had gained 615.16 full-time equivalent workers.

Then we turned to Chesterfield. Matt Harris, the county’s senior budget analyst, told us Chesterfield had 3,816 full-time equivalent employees on July 1, 2009. The number dropped to 3,664 on Nov. 1, 2011. The county lost 152 full-time equivalent workers.

Our ruling:

No matter which set of numbers you use, Chesterfield has eliminated more jobs from its general government operations than Virginia has from its entire state government since fiscal 2009.

Republican Travis Rowley says Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican
","
When you're famous and admired, everyone wants to claim you as their own.

Take the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

In a column that appeared on GoLocalProv.com the week of the slain civil rights leader's birthday, Travis Rowley, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, complained that liberals and Democrats consistently try to paint conservatives, Republicans and, in fact, all of America, as racist.

Rowley said the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Dick Harpootlian, criticized Republicans for holding a presidential debate in the state on King's birthday, even though Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus held a debate among the Democratic presidential candidates on King's birthday in 2008.

""It seems like a fitting moment to remind everyone that Martin Luther King was a Republican and, if alive, would probably have come to his own party's defense by telling Harpootlian to stop being such a whiny, hyper-sensitive, little weasel,"" wrote Rowley.

In recent history, blacks have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. So was King, who was assassinated in 1968 at the age of 39, really a Republican?

Some historical context might be illuminating.

The parties of King's era are not necessarily the parties we have today. King's father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., was a longtime Republican, not surprising at a time when most Southern Democrats supported segregation.

And when the landmark Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, it was approved on the basis of geography, not party. It became law only after Republicans and Democrats outside the South joined forces to overturn a filibuster by Southern senators.

Of the 22 Southern senators, 21 voted against it.  All but one of the opponents were Democrats. Outside the South, only 1 of the 46 Democrats and 5 of the 32 Republicans in the U.S. Senate opposed it.

But here we're focusing on the very narrow question of whether it's accurate to call the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a Republican.

Rowley's claim has been made before by other Republicans. When our PolitiFact colleagues in Tennessee and Texas checked the claim, both ruled it to be False. We'll repeat some of their points.

Perhaps the best argument in Rowley's favor comes from King's niece, Alveda C. King, who said in 2008 that ""during his lifetime, [King] was a Republican.""

But in 2008, King's son, Martin Luther King III, said it was ""disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states.""

PolitiFact found that King scholars agree with King's son.

""I've not seen any evidence that MLK Jr. was a Republican but if he registered to vote it would have been as a Republican in Alabama simply because the Dems. would not allow black voters. Throughout the [Civil Rights] movement he worked with the northern Dem. Party,"" said Dr. Kenneth W. Goings, professor and past chairman of the Department of African American and African Studies at Ohio State University, in an e-mail to PolitiFact Tennessee.

Thomas Jackson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, told PolitiFact that blacks began turning toward the Democratic party during the New Deal. He called King a "" 'tax and spend' democratic socialist.""

""He wanted the nation to spend billions of dollars directly to employ the unemployed when the private sector failed, and a vigorous mixture of affirmative action and anti-poverty programs championed by the liberal-left, and targeted federal spending in impoverished areas, especially the nation's slums,"" said Jackson.

(His proposal to spend $50 billion over 10 years -- $357 billion at today's prices -- to help the disadvantaged of all races was outlined in a 1965 Playboy interview.)

And King reported in his autobiography that he wrote to one supporter in 1956 saying, ""In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.""

King's refusal to endorse one particular party also suggests that he had more important matters to deal with than partisan politics -- he wanted an end to racial discrimination, no matter which party delivered it.

In an e-mail response, Rowley highlighted the comments of Alveda King and King's father's Republican roots. And he cited other sources who suggested why King should have been a Republican. But they didn’t prove that he was.

When we asked Rowley whether he thought King's plan to spend billions to help minorities would be embraced by today's Republican party or attacked as socialism, he said it would depend on how the money would be spent.

""There are 'spending' methods that don't result in socialist practices,"" he said, citing two examples: urban law enforcement to provide ""the safety needed for a prosperous community"" and school vouchers to ""give parents the option to rescue their children from failing public school systems that have been destroyed by the Democrat-Teachers Union alliance.""

""The argument over which party MLK would affiliate with today is another story. And admittedly debatable,"" he added in a subsequent e-mail.

Our ruling

We can certainly envision King being willing to vote against the Southern Democrats who furiously promoted segregation and voting for Northern Republicans who worked to make equal rights a reality.

But neither automatically make King a Republican, especially when, as a civil rights leader, he apparently wouldn't let himself be pigeon-holed into either political party.

In short, Rowley and other advocates for the King-was-really-a-Republican theory haven't proven their case. So we will follow the lead of the two previous PolitiFact analyses and rule that Rowley's claim is False.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Economy', 'Financial Regulation', 'Housing', 'Rick Santorum']","
Sen. Rick Santorum says he warned 'of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market'
","
As Republican presidential candidates battled over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a debate in Jacksonville, Fla., Rick Santorum sought the high ground.

""In 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market,"" the former Pennsylvania senator he said. ""I stood out, I stood tall and tried to get a reform, and we couldn't do it.""

We wondered, did Santorum sign such a letter, ""warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market"" before its collapse?

The claim

In the Jan. 26, 2012, debate, Fannie and Freddie came up in a question contributed by the public. ""How would you phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Does the private mortgage industry need additional regulation?"" 

That degenerated into a mudfest. Newt Gingrich, who once had a consulting contract with Freddie Mac, accused Mitt Romney of holding investments in the government-chartered entities. Romney accused Gingrich of also holding mutual funds that invest in them.

Moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Ron Paul and Rick Santorum a followup question.

""It seems they both acknowledge they both made money from Fannie and Freddie,"" he said ""Should they return that money?""

Santorum said:

""Well, I would just say, in answer to the question, that as I mentioned last debate, in 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market. I stood out, I stood tall and tried to get a reform, and we couldn't do it. The reform we'd need is to gradually decrease the amount of mortgage that can be financed by Freddie -- or underwritten by Freddie and Fannie over time, keep reducing that until we get rid of Fannie and Freddie.""

The letter

Santorum's campaign didn't answer our request for the letter, but we tracked it down. (Update: Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon sent us a copy about 20 minutes after this item published. It matched the May 5, 2006, letter we found.) 
In fact, we've heard something like this claim before, from GOP presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. He said then that he had warned in 2006 ""that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem, and we had to work on it."" 
We rated the claim Mostly False, noting, ""We give McCain some credit for weighing in on problems surrounding Fannie Mae, even though he got involved after a comprehensive government report issued a loud alarm to anyone watching. However, his attempts to depict those efforts as some sort of early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis just don't wash. All McCain was talking about then was the potential fallout of accounting troubles in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He didn't say anything about a freewheeling climate among creditors that had major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans.""

We might say something similar about Santorum's letter.

He did sign, along with 19 others, correspondence on May 6, 2006, to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. It noted that government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — ""mammoth financial institutions"" — held almost $1.5 trillion of debt.

It warned: ""We are concerned that if effective regulatory reform legislation for the housing-finance government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is not enacted this year, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system and the economy as a whole. Therefore, we offer you our support in bringing the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act (S. 190) to the floor and allowing the Senate to debate the merits of this bill, which was passed by the Senate Banking Committee. ...

""Congress has the opportunity to recommit itself to the housing mission of the GSEs while at the same time making sure the GSEs operate in a manner that does not expose our financial system, or taxpayers, to unnecessary risk."" 
The letter, in other words, warned of the risk Fannie and Freddie might pose to the financial system if they couldn't cover their obligations.  
America's housing crisis in many ways functioned the other way around: By the summer of 2008 the effects of a deflating housing bubble — especially foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies — were affecting Fannie and Freddie, and the agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations. The U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7, 2008. (We've talked to an expert who said that Fannie and Freddie contributed to that bubble — though he acknowledged there were other players — and another who found it ""absurd"" they would be blamed for the crisis. ""They were followers, not leaders,"" one said. Similarly, Columbia Journalism Review recently highlighted news organizations who exposed ""the big lie of the crisis"" — blaming Fannie and Freddie for the housing crisis instead of banks.)

So, did the letter warn of ""a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market,"" as Santorum put it? Not so much. It warned not of the danger of a housing bubble but of the danger of poorly regulated housing finance entities.

Santorum, Fannie & Freddie

Want more evidence that it wasn't a housing bubble Santorum was worried about?

Santorum, who served in the Senate from 1995 to 2007 after a stint in the U.S. House, gets credit for supporting the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act in 2005, the year before senators' letter to their colleagues. The goal of the legislation, according to its official summary, was to set up stronger congressional oversight of Fannie and Freddie and other housing entities by a new Federal Housing Regulatory Agency.

Santorum bucked a strong covert lobbying effort by Freddie Mac to kill the legislation, supporting it in committee — though he was not one of its co-sponsors. (The lobbying effort ultimately kept the bill from reaching the Senate floor.)

But he didn't voice any concern over ""a meltdown"" or ""a bubble"" that we saw in news clips, press releases or transcripts of related hearings from 2005 or 2006.

He focused his energy instead on an amendment to strengthen the entities' affordable housing goals. As National Mortgage News reported at the time, ""Sen. Santorum supports the concept of an (affordable housing) fund that could pump billions of dollars into the construction and renovation of affordable housing.""

In Congress, Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-N.C., a co-sponsor of the legislation, thanked Santorum in August 2005 ""for taking a leadership role in addressing the need for a better focus by Fannie and Freddie on affordable housing.""

No word about a housing bubble.

Our ruling 
Santorum said he ""went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market.""

Indeed, he signed a letter along with a group of colleagues asking for reform of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But it didn't warn of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market. And we couldn't find evidence that Santorum voiced that concern in 2005 or 2006 in press releases, transcripts or news clips. Instead, he sponsored a successful amendment of a reform bill to boost the entities' commitment to affordable housing, a very different concern.

We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/27/rick-santorum/sen-rick-santorum-says-he-warned-meltdown-and-bubb/
"['Israel', 'Terrorism', 'Florida', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Obama ""castigated"" Israel but said nothing about rockets raining down on Israel from the Gaza Strip.
","
The Republican presidential candidates want to cast themselves as best buds with Israel and President Barack Obama as the pal of the Palestinians.

At a Jan. 26, 2012, debate in Jacksonville, a listener who described himself as a Palestinian-American Republican asked this question: ""How would a Republican administration help bring peace to Palestine and Israel when most candidates barely recognize the existence of Palestine or its people?""

Romney’s reply included a comment about Hamas and its intent to eliminate Israel while he reiterated his own support for Israel. Then he turned the discussion toward a critique of Obama:

""This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip."" We emailed Romney’s campaign to ask which Obama speech or speeches he was referring to and did not get a reply, so we will look at a few of Obama’s speeches to the U.N. that included comments about Israel:

Sept. 23 2009: It's true that Obama does not specifically mention Hamas. But it's certainly not a one-sided chastisement of Israel. Obama repeatedly calls on Palestinians to understand and respect Israel's security needs and mentions the fear Israelis face about rocket attacks. And Obama notes efforts on both sides.

""Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians,"" Obama said. ""As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow. But more progress is needed. We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements""

Obama describes how the U.S. and the U.N. should respond:

""The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security.""

Obama also talked about the pain both Israelis and Palestinians face:

""We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It's not paid by politicians,"" Obama said. ""It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own.""

Sept. 23 2010: Obama laid out goals for both sides, including that the Palestinians must have opportunities, and that the Palestinians will only win rights through peaceful means and reconciliation with Israel.

As for the settlements, Obama said: ""Israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks. And our position on this issue is well known. We believe that the moratorium should be extended.""

It was another even-handed speech in which Obama made his support for Israel evident. Although Obama didn’t mention Hamas specifically, he did criticize those who murder Israelis or fire rockets at them:

""It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel's legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States. And efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it's injustice. And make no mistake: The courage of a man like President (Mahmoud) Abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances, is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children. …. This time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire.""

Sept. 11, 2011: On the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Obama said that the two sides were at a stalemate after he had called for a Palestinian state a year before. Obama spoke about the desires of Palestinians and Israelis, saying they both have legitimate aspirations.

He devoted one paragraph here to the Palestinians talking about a future in which they can live in a state ""with no limit to what they can achieve.""

And then Obama had three paragraphs focused on Israel’s side:

""But understand this, as well: America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we believe that any lasting peace must acknowledge the very real security concerns that Israel faces every single day.

""Let us be honest with ourselves. Israel is surrounded by neighbors that have waged repeated wars against it. Israel's citizens have been killed by rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their buses. Israel's children come of age knowing that, throughout the region, other children are taught to hate them. Israel, a small country of less than 8 million people, look out at a world where leaders of much larger nations threaten to wipe it off the map.

""The Jewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile and persecution and fresh memories of knowing that 6 million people were killed simply because of who they are. Those are facts; they cannot be denied.""

He didn’t mention Israeli settlements or Hamas specifically, although he did talk about rockets being fired at Israelis. Out of the three speeches we examined, in this one Obama devoted more words to the Israeli side but still spoke of hopes for both sides.

Our ruling

In Florida, a state with a significant Jewish voting population, Romney said: ""This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip."" But that doesn’t square with our review of Obama’s speeches. In his 2009 speech to the U.N., Obama said that America does not accept ""the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements."" Though he did not specifically mention Hamas, he did mention Israeli’s fear of rockets. And in later speeches to the U.N., Obama was blunt in his criticism of violent attacks against Israelis, once saying ""the slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it's injustice."" 

Our examination of three of Obama’s speeches to the U.N. showed that Obama is fairly even-handed as he has laid out goals for both sides -- while he spoke against the Israeli settlements, he also bluntly opposed violent attacks on Israelis. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2012/jan/27/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-castigated-israel-building-settl/

Mitt Romney says, 'I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot'
","
During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Mitt Romney had to fend off challenges to his record as a conservative, including a series of charges from Newt Gingrich.

In the course of arguing his closeness to Ronald Reagan, Gingrich said, ""I think it's reasonable to say, and I think (Gov. Romney) said it fairly, I am vastly closer to Reagan. In that period, the governor was an independent business person. In '92 he was donating to the Democrats for Congress and voted for Paul Tsongas in the Democratic primary.""

Romney countered, ""I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot. And -- and in my state of Massachusetts, you could register as an independent and go vote in (whichever) primary happens to be very interesting. And any chance I got to vote against Bill Clinton or Ted Kennedy, I took. … I have always voted for a Republican any time there was a Republican on the ballot.""

Is Romney right?

Media reports dating back to 1994 -- when Romney first ran as a Republican for Senate -- said that he had acknowledged voting for former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primary in Massachusetts.

""An Independent until last December, he publicizes his brief stint as a Democrat to support ex-senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 presidential primary,"" wrote David Broder in the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 1994. "" ‘I'm not a partisan politician,’ he said. ‘My hope is that after this election, it will be the moderates of both parties who will control the Senate, not the Jesse Helmses.’ ""

Three days later, the Los Angeles Times’ Ron Brownstein wrote, ""When Romney decided to run, Republicans exchanged quizzical looks: ‘We didn't know a single Republican when we jumped in in December,’ his wife, Ann, says. As a registered independent, Romney had voted in the Democratic presidential primary in 1992 to support Paul E. Tsongas (though he backed George Bush in the general election, he says). He briefly considered running for the Senate seat as an independent as well, his wife says, before rejecting the idea as impractical.""

Romney has faced some difficulty during his two presidential runs explaining his vote for Tsongas. His answer has been that he voted in Democratic primaries -- which are often the only competitive primaries in strongly Democratic Massachusetts -- for strategic reasons

On the Feb. 18, 2007, edition of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Romney was asked, ""Let me talk about your political journey. You were an independent, registered independent in the 1980s. You voted for Paul Tsongas, a Democrat, in the 1992 primaries. Now you've described yourself as a Reagan Republican.""

Romney responded, ""Kind of a mischaracterization. In Massachusetts, if you register as an independent, you can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. When there was no real contest in the Republican primary, I'd vote in the Democrat primary, vote for the person who I thought would be the weakest opponent for Republican. In the general election...""

Stephanopoulos interjected, ""So that was a way of supporting President (George H.W. ) Bush, is that what you're saying?""

Romney answered, ""Look, I've taken every occasion to vote against Ted Kennedy, he's a good friend, but Ted Kennedy, and Tip O'Neill, they're my congressman and senator. I go in their primary, just like a lot of other folks, and voted against the person who I thought was the strongest Democrat. Now, that happens in America today. But let me tell you, in the general election, I don't recall ever once voting for anyone other than a Republican. So, yeah, as an independent, I'll go in and play in their primary, but I'm a Republican and have been through my life. I was with Young Republicans when I was in college back at Stanford. But a registered independent, so I could vote in either primary.""

This explanation sounds a lot like what Romney said in the Jacksonville debate. But in the debate, he went further and said, ""I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot.""

On the same day as the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary -- March 10, 1992 -- the Republicans held a presidential primary as well. The incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, won with 66 percent over challenger Patrick Buchanan, with 28 percent. (For the record, Tsongas won 67 percent, crushing once and future California Gov. Jerry Brown with 15 percent and future President Bill Clinton with just 11 percent.)

For someone in Romney’s shoes, voting in the Democratic primary did make sense strategically. By the time of the Massachusetts primary, the renomination contest for Bush was all but over, whereas the Democratic contest still had some life in it.

Deciding this question requires weighing two distinct interpretations of what Romney did.

When Romney walked into the polling place and was handed a Democratic ballot, it’s true that there was no Republican on it. The Republican ballot was separate. So, by this interpretation, Romney is correct that there was no ""Republican on the ballot"" that day.

But there’s another way of looking at it. Romney, as an independent, was eligible to choose which party’s primary he voted in, and he made an affirmative choice to vote in the Democratic primary, not the Republican primary.

We checked with the Secretary of the Commonwealth in Massachusetts, the office responsible for running elections in the state. A spokesman confirmed that in 1992 (as is the case today) an independent would have been able to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary on Election Day.

So it was within Romney’s power to choose to vote in the Republican primary for either Bush or Buchanan, rather than voting in the Democratic primary for Tsongas. That’s a choice that more than 241,000 Massachusetts Republicans and independents made that day, but Romney didn’t.

(A postscript: Tsongas, who died in 1997, didn’t return the favor to Romney. Two years later, when Romney was challenging Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Kennedy got Tsongas to denounce television ads Romney was running against the incumbent. Tsongas’ criticism was effective in ""blunting their impact,"" the Boston Globe reported.)

Our ruling

In the Jacksonville debate, Romney said, ""I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot."" Romney has been open about the strategy behind his decision, and we expect many voters would have done the same thing. We see two contrary interpretations as having merit. Romney has a point that the ballot he was handed didn’t include any Republicans. On the other hand, Romney had a right to request a GOP ballot that day and opted not to.

True the Vote says Eric Holder supports NAACP request for United Nations' involvement in U.S. elections
","
Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, supports a group’s push for international involvement in U.S. elections, a Texas-rooted organization says.

On a web page urging supporters to protest Holder’s Dec. 13, 2011, stop in Austin, True the Vote said Holder ""is for NAACP plans to involve the United Nations in U.S. elections.

""Are you ready to have U.N. blue helmets outside your polling place?""

Not us. While pondering that possibility, we wondered whether True the Vote, a national conservative poll watchers group that grew out of 2008 efforts to monitor Houston polling places, is right about the government’s lead lawyer backing such an endeavor.

Catherine Engelbrecht of Richmond, Texas, True the Vote’s leader, told us in a telephone interview that she learned of the NAACP’s interest in enlisting the U.N. from a Dec. 5, 2011, news article posted by a British news source, the Guardian.

That story, which makes no mention of Holder, says the NAACP is petitioning the U.N. over what it sees as a concerted effort through changes in election laws to disenfranchise black and Latino voters ahead of the 2012 presidential election.

Eric Wrobel, an NAACP spokesman, told us by email that the NAACP held a ""Stand for Freedom"" march in New York on Dec. 10, 2011, culminating in a rally across the street from the UN. Wrobel pointed us to an NAACP web page promoting the march stating that ""it’s time to Stand for Freedom. We must protect our right to vote.""

A Nov. 8, 2011, press release promoting the event calls Stand for Freedom a voting rights campaign bringing together the NAACP and other groups in ""an aggressive nationwide effort to stop changes to state election laws that would suppress the rights of millions of Americans to vote.""

At issue, the release says, are state efforts reducing early voting opportunities and voting on Sundays plus new mandates in some states that voters present photo IDs before being allowed to cast ballots. In the release, Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, says: """"We are in the midst of the greatest coordinated legislative attack on voting rights since the dawn of Jim Crow. Voter ID laws are nothing but reincarnated poll taxes and literacy tests, and ex-felon voting bans serve the same purpose today as when they were created in the wake of the 15th Amendment guaranteeing ex-slaves the vote—suppressing voting numbers among people of color.""

Holder goes unmentioned in the press release -- and also did not mention the NAACP effort in his subsequent Austin speech, which otherwise underscored his interest in protecting minority voting rights. Most immediately, Holder said, the Justice Department was reviewing voter ID laws approved last year in states including Texas and South Carolina. He said the reviews are in keeping with provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which applies to parts of all of 16 states with a history of voter discrimination and requires changes in election laws in the jurisdictions to be pre-cleared by federal judges or the department before taking effect.
 
""If a state passes a new voting law and meets its burden of showing that the law is not discriminatory,"" Holder said, ""we will follow the law and approve the change. And where a state can’t meet this burden, we will object.""

Ten days later, the department deemed South Carolina’s voter ID law discriminatory because the state’s registered minority voters are nearly 20 percent more likely than whites to lack a state-issued photo ID, according to a news article posted online Dec. 23, 2011 by The Washington Post. ""The absolute number of minority citizens whose exercise of the franchise could be adversely affected by the proposed requirements runs into the tens of thousands,"" Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said in a letter to South Carolina officials, the Post reported.

According to the Post account, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, called the agency’s decision ""outrageous"" and said she plans to seek ""every possible option to get this terrible, clearly political decision overturned so we can protect the integrity of our electoral process and our 10th Amendment rights.""

Back to the NAACP:  A ""Take Action"" section of the NAACP’s Stand for Freedom website urges visitors to sign the ""Stand for Freedom Pledge"" and ""protect the right to vote in your community.""

The pledge calls, in part, for the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act; for Congress to pass legislation advancing all Americans' right to vote and making it easier for working people to cast their ballot; and for state  legislatures and governors to repeal every voter suppression measure and pass and implement measures to increase voter participation.

It also calls for the ""United Nations to investigate and condemn voter suppression tactics in the United States.""

And has Holder endorsed the pledge? We found no sign of that in a Nexis search of news articles. In response to our inquiry, Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said by email that the agency has not taken a position on the NAACP’s request to the U.N.

Separately, Hilary Shelton, the NAACP’s Washington Bureau director and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, told us in a telephone interview that while he attended Holder’s speech and the NAACP has met frequently with Justice Department officials about protecting U.S. voting and civil rights, the group has not brought up its call for U.N. officials to monitor U.S. elections with Holder or the Justice Department:

""There has not been a request from the NAACP"" for Holder to join the plea for U.N. interest, Shelton said, nor have department officials voiced support. ""We don’t see that as a role for"" the Justice Department, Shelton said. ""So we didn’t ask them... At none of these meetings do I recall the United Nations even being mentioned.""

Shelton said too that the NAACP has no desire for U.N. troops to occupy U.S polling places, though it would like researchers to gauge whether American citizens are being dissuaded or prevented from voting due to election laws. Ideally, he said, such researchers would occasionally monitor polling sites -- starting as soon as this spring’s party primaries -- in ""hot spots"" including Texas.

Shelton said in a follow-up interview that in 2004, the U.N. monitored presidential balloting in the United States, focusing on Florida. However, according to a July 9, 2004, news article from the Press Trust of India, the U.N. declined to deploy observers after fielding a request from 13 Democratic U.S. House members. The Press Trust article quotes an unidentified U.N. spokesman saying: ""The policy and practice is that the United Nations responds to requests made by national governments and not by the legislative branch. Besides, the observation must be mandated by the 191-member (U.N.) General Assembly as the activity also affects the sovereign jurisdiction of that country.""

Shelton said the U.N. has not yet aired a position on the recently presented pledge, which he said nearly 40,000 people had endorsed as of Jan. 23, 2012.

Engelbrecht, informed that neither the DOJ or NAACP had confirmed Holder’s support of the group’s U.N. request, guided us to Virginia lawyer Christian Adams, who quit the Justice Department’s civil rights division in 2009 after voter-intimidation charges were dropped against two African American activists who had stood outside a Philadelphia polling place in November 2008, one of them wielding a baton, according to an Oct. 23, 2010, news article in The Washington Post.

In an interview, Adams said U.N. officials have met with DOJ officials; such meetings occurred when he was still working for the government, he said. The U.N. ""has spent a good deal of time and effort investigating American elections,"" Adams said. ""That’s a fact."" He urged us to ask the Justice Department for confirmation.

We asked the Justice Department’s Hinojosa if any part of Adams’ claim was accurate. Hinojosa said by email: ""We are unaware of any recent meetings between Justice Department officials and U.N. officials specifically on voting issues."" He did not reply to our request to define ""recent.""

Similarly, we asked the U.N. if its officials have been investigating U.S. elections or meeting with Justice Department officials about them. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, replied by email: ""I very much doubt it,"" though he said he couldn’t speak for the entire ""big and complex"" U.N. system.

So, the Justice Department says there have been no recent meetings, while a U.N. spokesman is doubtful.

As we completed this review, True the Vote’s Engelbrecht stood by the group’s claim that Holder supports the NAACP's efforts to get the U.N. involved in U.S. elections.

Our ruling

True the Vote provided no evidence for its Holder claim while our own inquiries landed no confirmation -- nor anything close.

Holder and the NAACP both say minority voting rights should be protected. But the idea that Holder backs the group’s call for a U.N. investigation appears to be without basis. Indeed, if this claim was factual, it would be national and international news.

Instead, the statement is ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/jan/27/true-vote/true-vote-says-eric-holder-supports-naacp-request-/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum calls Massachusetts health law top-down and government-run
","
It’s like a new cover of an old song.

During a Republican primary debate on Jan. 26, 2012, Rick Santorum said that the health care legislation Mitt Romney signed as governor of Massachusetts is ""a top-down, government-run health care system.""

The former Pennsylvania senator called the issue one of ""fundamental freedom"" and criticized Romney for enacting a law similar to the one that passed nationally in 2010.

And the beat goes on.

PolitiFact has explored the Massachusetts health program extensively, considering its similarities to the federal law and examining what role the government really plays in it.

Here are a few important points:

• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or pay a penalty.
   
• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty.
   
• Health insurance exchanges. The plan involves the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" through which individuals and small businesses may purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.
   
• Affordability subsidies. Lower-income individuals and families receive government subsidies to help pay their health insurance premiums. Subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.
   
• Expansion of Medicaid. The plan expands Medicaid to all children whose families earn up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.
   
• Insurance market regulation. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 may be covered on their parents' plan.
   
We think Santorum’s use of the label ""top-down"" reflects his political opposition to both the Massachusetts plan and the national plan modeled after it. Given that opposition, a person could consider an individual mandate a ""top-down"" approach to health care, although others would disagree.

But ""government-run?"" That characterization is simply wrong.

We asked Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, to explain:

""The Massachusetts plan leaves private health insurance intact, and under the Massachusetts plan, health care delivery remains predominantly in private hands, as it was before the law was enacted,"" he wrote in an email.

""The role of government is expanded, but that is not the same as saying the government ‘runs’ the health system. The Massachusetts plan expanded Medicaid, but at the same time it expanded uninsured residents’ access to private insurance (through subsidies to buy coverage and the connector).""

What does an actual government-run system look like? Oberlander pointed to the truly socialized system of Great Britain -- as well as to one in our own backyard.

""The Massachusetts plan ... looks NOTHING like a true ‘government-run health care system...  the VA’s health system where the government owns the hospitals and employs doctors directly,"" he said.

Our ruling

Santorum called Romney’s health law ""a top-down, government-run health care system.""

  The individual mandate and the requirement that employers offer health insurance might be considered top-down, though it is still a system that relies heavily on private insurance and private medical providers. But there’s no case to for calling it ""government-run.""  A real government-run system has doctors on the payroll. Massachusetts does not.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Newt Gingrich revises claim on balanced budgets, improves Truth-O-Meter rating
","During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Newt Gingrich reiterated a talking point we several times have rated False. But this time, he tweaked the language. Responding to a comment from Rick Santorum about fiscal responsibility, Gingrich said, ""When we balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets, we doubled the size of the National Institutes of Health because we set priorities. It is possible to do the right things in the right order to make this a bigger, richer, more exciting country."" We thought we’d see whether his new wording about the balanced budget was more accurate.

Previously, we rated these statements by Gingrich:

• ""When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets."" (Republican presidential debate, Tampa, Jan. 23, 2012)

• ""I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt."" (Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Dec. 15, 2011)

• ""For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt."" (video announcement that he would run for president, May 11, 2011)

All earned a rating of False because Gingrich was taking credit for two budgets that he had no role in assembling or shepherding through the House.

As we explained in our earlier articles, Gingrich served as speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs.
   
The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.

By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.

But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. While the federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- came when Gingrich was long gone from the House.
   
In the Jacksonville debate, however, Gingrich modified his statement. This time, he said that the nation ""ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets."" That is a more accurate way of putting it.

His phrasing in Jacksonville was less boastful than some of his previous claims, such as the one in which he said, ""I balanced the budget for four straight years."" In Jacksonville, he credited a piece of legislation passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic president.

But he glossed over a pair of tax-raising bills that made a difference, and that Gingrich opposed, including the 1990 budget deal (in which President George H.W. Bush broke his ""no new taxes"" pledge), and the 1993 budget vote, which cost many Democratic lawmakers their seats in the 1994 Republican landslide.

""Like most things in life, what caused the budget to be balanced was multi-factorial, most important of which was the tech boom and the surging economy,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""You can partially credit the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, but you could also credit the 1993 and 1990 bills that Speaker Gingrich opposed. It's a little too simple to say that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act ‘balanced the budget.’ ""

In fact, when a pro-Gingrich super PAC claimed in an Iowa ad that ""Newt balanced the federal budget,"" we rated the statement Half True for this reason.

""The budget ended up balancing faster than either party expected simply because economic growth was so strong,"" Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us at the time. ""I don’t think either party had much to do with that.""
   
Stan Collender, a former Democratic staffer for the House and Senate budget committees, added that ""it happened on his watch, but it doesn’t mean that he gets credit for it. The only thing you can give him credit for is stalling some additional spending programs.""

Our ruling

At the Jacksonville debate, Gingrich was more accurate than he's been in the past and his chronology of the law and the four budgets is correct. But he oversimplifies the causes of the balanced budget. His words are accurate but need additional information, which makes this a Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47fe4a11-e312-476d-92c4-a6fb4d33a0e2",/factchecks/2012/jan/27/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-revises-claim-balanced-budgets-impro/
"['Crime', 'Guns', 'Virginia', 'Jim Moran']","
Rep. Jim Moran says U.S. gun homicide rate 20 times higher than other western nations
","
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran marked the first anniversary of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona with a call for more gun control.

""The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations,"" Moran, D-8th, wrote in a Jan. 10 column that ran in the Falls Church News-Press.

That statistic caught our eye. We wondered if Moran is right.

A Moran spokeswoman told us the congressman’s claim is based on a study of the homicide rates of wealthy nations in 2003, conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health. The report, published in 2010, uses data from the World Health Organization to compare gun-related homicide, gun-related suicide and unintentional and undetermined gun deaths for all ages and both sexes.

Vital statistics from the U.S. were compared to those from 22 other high-income countries with populations over 1 million people that reported causes of mortality to WHO for 2003. Researchers relied on The World Bank’s definition of a high income  nation, which included countries that had a gross national income per capita of $12,276 or more for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011.

In addition to the U.S., the study included Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales), United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and United Kingdom (Scotland).

Researchers determined that the rate of homicides with guns in the U.S. was 4.1 per 100,000 people; the same rate combining the 22 other countries was 0.2 per 100,000 in 2003. The rate of homicides using guns in the U.S. was 19.5 times the rate of the other countries. Moran, rounding up, correctly repeated that factoid.

We decided to see if there were more recent numbers than 2003. U.N. and national statistics for those same countries showed the gap closed. The most recent data, mostly from 2009, shows a gun homicide rate of 3.0 per 100,000 people in the U.S. and 0.2 in the 22 other countries used in the firearm fatality study. The U.S., with its decrease, had a rate around 15 times those of other countries.

Next, we moved away from numbers for a second and examined the terminology Moran used in his column. It is imprecise.

The congressman wrote that the U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times higher ""than other western nations."" But in fact, he was comparing them to them a selective group of wealthy nations. And not all them -- such as Japan -- are typically considered  a ""western nation.""

The term ""western nation"" is not listed in Webster’s New World College Dictionary and we found a range of definitions online.

Most commonly, the term is used to describe countries where Western Europeans have settled or have influence. We tried to come up with a list of such nations and settled on the 28 countries that are NATO members.

The most recent gun-related homicide rate for the U.S. was 3.0 per 100,000 compared to an 0.3 for the rest of the NATO nations. The U.S. rate was 10 times higher.

Our ruling:

Moran, calling for stronger gun regulations, wrote ""The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times the combined rate of other western nations.""

Moran used the right number from a report based on 2003 data. But the researchers did not claim to analyze ""western nations,"" they compared gun homicide rates in 23 ""populous, high income"" countries, including Japan.

If you compare the most recent data on the same group of nations, mostly based on 2009 statistics, the U.S. gun homicide rate is 15 times higher than the other countries. The number fell to 10 times as high when we defined the inexact term of ""western nations"" as countries belonging to NATO.

So Moran’s figures are outdated and on the high side. His terminology is loose. But his point -- that gun homicide rates in the U.S. tower over those of other wealthy  European nations -- holds up.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage claims his city has lowest unemployment rate among large New Jersey cities
","
Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage knows what his critics will say during his re-election campaign: he's been in charge too long.

But Bollwage, a Democrat whose fifth term ends this year, has a few reasons voters should keep him in office.

""And we're moving in the right direction, the city of Elizabeth. We've done a lot of big things, with Ikea, Jersey Gardens, and we have opportunities here in our community. Our jobless rate, our unemployment rate, is the lowest of  all of the big cities in New Jersey,"" Bollwage said during a Jan. 15 speech at the Cuban Club, drawing applause from his audience. ""That's a great testament to our community.""

You may want to hold back your applause, though, because the mayor is wrong.

A reader asked PolitiFact New Jersey to check out Bollwage’s claim. We found Elizabeth’s unemployment rate stands at 11.9 percent, according to the most recent data available from the state’s Labor Department. Newark’s and Paterson’s jobless rates are bleaker,  at 14.1 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively.

But Jersey City -- the second most populous city in the state behind Newark -- has an unemployment rate of 10.2 percent.

So, among that group of cities with a population of more than 100,000, Elizabeth is third, not last.

City spokesman William Reyes said Bollwage meant to say Elizabeth has one of the lowest, not the lowest, unemployment rates among New Jersey’s most populous cities.

In his State of the City address, which Bollwage delivered before he gave the speech at the Cuban Club, the mayor got it right: ""Our unemployment rate is among the lowest of New Jersey’s largest cities and we are looking to reduce that even more."" A chart Reyes sent us that was shown during the mayor’s address compared the unemployment rates in Elizabeth, Trenton, Newark, Paterson and Camden.

Of those cities, Camden has the highest unemployment rate, at 18.8 percent, and Elizabeth had the lowest, at 11.9 percent. Jersey City wasn’t included.

Our ruling

The Elizabeth mayor said in an appearance at  the Cuban Club that the city has the lowest unemployment rate among New Jersey’s biggest cities.

Among cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Jersey City has a lower unemployment rate than Elizabeth.

A city spokesman said Bollwage meant to say Elizabeth had one of the lowest, not the lowest, jobless rates among the state’s most populous cities -- a line he used in his State of the City address earlier this month.

He may have got it right then, but he got it wrong this time around.

John Kasich says Ohio has 77 job training programs spread across 13 agencies
","
Gov. John Kasich says job training programs will be his seminal issue of 2012.

But as Ohio continues to push for new jobs and retaining the ones it has, a problem has emerged. Employers say Ohio has too few skilled workers, which in turn makes companies leery about moving their business here from outside the state.

The governor doesn’t dispute that notion completely, but asserts that Ohio is trying.

Ohio currently has 77 workforce job training programs across 13 state agencies, Kasich said Jan. 10, 2012, in a boardroom interview with editors at The Plain Dealer. Kasich views that as a weak spot in the state’s economic development plans and wants to reorganize the programs.

Politifact Ohio double-checked to see if the governor had his figures correct.

According to the state, to be defined as a state workforce training program the service has to: 

By that criteria,  the state has exactly 77 workforce training programs, according to the Ohio Department of Development.

The programs are spread across 13 state entities:

Board or Regents                                                       Department of Aging

Department of Alcohol and Addictive Services           Department of Commerce              

Department of Development                                      Department of Education

Department of Health                                                Department of Jobs and Family Services   

Department of Rehabilitation and Correction            Rehabilitative Services Commission

Department of Transportation                                   Department of Veteran Services

Department of Youth Services

Some, for example, at the Board of Regents, are college scholarship programs but are considered workforce development because they assist students with pursuing education degrees in certain high need fields, like nursing, science or math.

To put the governor’s thoughts in sharper focus, while Ohio has a wealth of workforce training programs, Kasich doesn’t think much of the state’s efforts or efficiency in linking participants in these programs to actual jobs.

""If you have 77 and 13 it means you have zero. That’s how I add that up,"" Kasich told The Plain Dealer. ""Nobody knows what anyone’s doing.""

The point the governor is arguing is that the state does not have a strategic plan for how to address workforce training, instead it has a bunch of individual programs working in isolation. The administration is working to change that approach.

Our point here is not to argue which job training approach is best, but rather to check the governor’s claim that there are 77 programs spread through 13 agencies.

""We have cut crime across every single zone in the city of Atlanta by between 10 percent and 16 percent, depending on the zone,"" Reed announced.

Every zone? The Truth-O-Meter loves a good crime statistic, so we wound it up and let it whirl.

The Atlanta Police Department posts weekly crime data on its website. We clicked through it and found that while crime is down 11 percent across the city, it’s not down in all of the city’s six zones.

Ordinarily, we would check a claim like Reed’s by comparing the number of incidents in each zone for 2011 and 2009, the year before the mayor took office.

For this fact check, we took a slightly different approach. The department changed its zone boundaries on Dec. 13, 2011. If we used the standard method, a zone’s crime could appear to rise if its borders shifted to include a higher-crime neighborhood.

Instead, we looked at total incidents starting the first week of January 2011 to the week ending Dec. 10, 2011, the last full week before the switch. We compared it with the same time period in 2009.

We analyzed what the Federal Bureau of Investigation calls ""Part I"" offenses, or murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, auto thefts, thefts from automobiles and larceny. Researchers think tallies of these crimes tend to be a good reflection of the actual number of incidents taking place.  

This is what we found:

Zone 1: Crime declined 10 percent in this west Atlanta zone. The biggest drop was in thefts from cars, which fell 23 percent. Robbery fell 20 percent.

Zone 2: Crime dropped 16 percent in these northern neighborhoods, led by a 26 percent drop in thefts from cars.

Zone 3: This area includes areas on the city’s south side. Crime increased 2 percent, led by a 26 percent rise in larceny.

Zone 4: Crime declined 4 percent in these southwest Atlanta neighborhoods. Robberies, burglaries and thefts from cars all dropped by double digits while larcenies rose 18 percent.

Zone 5: Crime dropped 14 percent in this zone, which covers parts of downtown. Burglaries plummeted 35 percent.  

Zone 6: Crime declined in these east Atlanta neighborhoods by 27 percent, led by a 45 percent drop in thefts from cars. Burglaries and aggravated assaults dropped by more than 30 percent.

Crime is down in Atlanta, but Reed mangled the specifics.

It’s down in all zones but one. And in the case of east Atlanta, where crime dropped 27 percent, the decline is far more dramatic than the 10 percent to 16 percent decrease Reed mentioned in his State of the City address.

In a written statement to PolitiFact Georgia, Reed acknowledged that the city has more work to do, but the lower overall crime rate is a sign of progress.

""One of our goals is to say with confidence that crime is down in all zones, and I believe we are moving in the right direction,"" Reed said.

Because Reed’s broader message held true, but the data he used are topsy-turvy, we grant him a Half True. ",/factchecks/2012/jan/27/kasim-reed/atlanta-crime-down-details-inaccurate/

Pro-Gingrich super PAC blames 'Romneycare' for spiraling health care costs
","
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are on the same side, says an ad from from a pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC.

""Think you know Mitt? Think again,"" says the ad from Winning our Future, which is spending a reported $6 million on the air in Florida.

The ad then makes the point that the health care law Romney signed when he was governor of Massachusetts in 2006 is much like the one President Obama signed in 2010.

""When Mitt Romney invented government-run health care, Romney advisers helped Barack Obama write the disastrous Obamacare,"" a narrator says. ""Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets.""

Yes, Romney’s health plan is a lot like the plan Obama ushered into law. No, it’s not government-run health care. These are old talking points that we’ve fact-checked many times.

Here, we wanted to look specifically at whether ""Romneycare sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets.""

First, a little about the health care plans: Generally speaking, both laws leave in place the major insurance systems. There’s employer-provided insurance for workers and their families, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the very poor. Both laws require people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" Both laws also seek to cover the uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to moderate-income people to buy insurance. Companies that don't offer insurance will typically pay penalties, with exceptions for small business. Massachusetts paid for the plan with some new state spending, but also with help from the federal government.

In part because the Massachusetts plan is so similar to the national plan, health policy analysts have tracked the outcomes there closely and publish regular reports.

In reviewing these reports, we found consensus that the high cost of health care is still a concern for Massachusetts. Also, more people have insurance in Massachusetts, so overall spending is up.

But cost increases for individual households are largely due to the fact that health care costs have been rising across the country, regardless of the Massachusetts plan.

We found little to suggest that the Massachusetts plan caused costs to go up more there than they did elsewhere.

In an examination of the state’s health plan published in June 2011, the Boston Globe concluded that health care costs are on the rise in Massachusetts, just as they are elsewhere, but it’s not fair to blame the Romney plan for the trend.

""Massachusetts does have the highest health care costs in the nation, but it owned this dubious distinction long before ‘Romneycare’ was born,"" the Globe said.

Similarly, a January 2012 report in the scholarly journal Health Affairs concluded that affordability remained an issue for the state’s health care system. But the plan’s expansion of coverage also means that more people have insurance, and consumers have lower out-of-pocket expenses.

""Going forward, the success of health reform under the Affordable Care Act in Massachusetts, and in other states, will depend on the ability of policy makers and stakeholders to come together to take on the considerable challenge of reining in health care costs,"" the report said.

When we contacted the Romney campaign, they pointed us to statistics from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that showed while the cost of insurance has still been increasing in Massachusetts, it’s increasing more slowly than it did in the years before reform.

We asked Winning Our Future for evidence to back up its claim, but we didn’t hear back.

Our ruling

The Massachusetts health plan expanded coverage to many people who didn’t have insurance before, and that did cost the state and federal government money. Also, consumers saw increases in their health care costs. But there’s little to show that the health plan Romney signed as governor caused the increased costs that affected household budgets. In recent years, health care costs have been rising around the country, and Massachusetts is not exempt.

'Red State Socialism' graphic says GOP-leaning states get lion's share of federal dollars
","Many GOP-leaning states get more in federal funding than they contribute in federal taxes. That's the point made by a graphic that’s circulating on the Internet, titled ""Red State Socialism."" A reader recently pointed us to it and asked us to check it out. The chart suggests that Republicans are hypocritical for bashing the federal government and federal spending, when Republican-leaning states are reaping the lion’s share of federal dollars.

The graphic emphasizes this point by showing two tables side by side. States that send more money to the federal government than they receive in federal spending are on the left, and they are primarily blue (or Democratic) states. The table on the right shows states that receive more in federal spending than they contribute in taxes. This table is predominantly red (or Republican).

The graphic says: ""Of the 32 states which receive more than they contribute, 27 states (84%) are REPUBLICAN. Of the 18 states which contribute more than they receive, 14 states (78%) are DEMOCRATIC.""

The source cited is a report by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. We checked with the Tax Foundation to see whether the data was legitimate and confirmed that it is. Spokesman Richard Morrison said that the chart uses 2005 data that was published in 2007.

So the graphic is solidly grounded in reality. But we see two reasons for caution when using this chart.

How do you define red and blue states?

The graphic defines Republican states as those ""that have voted Republican in a previous presidential election."" Because the data is from 2005, that means states that voted for George W. Bush in 2004, which is a larger number than voted Republican in 2008.

But the definition of states as Republican or Democratic isn't immutable. Just four years later, in the 2008 election, six states in the right-hand chart and three states in the left-hand chart switched from Republican to Democratic, making both charts more heavily blue.

We should also note that some of the margins of victory were quite narrow. In fact, a dozen or more states can be characterized in most elections as swing states, which might be more appropriately shaded in purple.

The data is seven years old

As we noted, the data is for 2005. To the author’s credit, this is disclosed prominently, and because it’s the most recent data of its type available, we can hardly fault the creator of the graphic for using it. Still, since the data has almost certainly shifted in the interim, particularly with the 2009 stimulus and the general increase in deficit spending, those patterns could have shifted as well.

""Because of the high deficit spending we’re seeing at the federal level, it’s likely that every state is currently receiving more in federal spending than its population paid in federal income taxes,"" the Tax Foundation's Morrison said.

We tracked down the creator of the graphic, Jesse Erlbaum. Erlbaum said he was inspired to create the graphic after watching a presidential debate scene from the television show The West Wing, in which fictional Democratic President Jed Bartlet needles his Republican opponent, the governor of Florida, for seeming to diminish the importance of federal funds that his state receives.

Erlbaum said he created the graphic ""for fun"" in October 2008, just before Barack Obama won the presidency. ""Based on that, I selected the most recent previous presidential election cycle, namely 2004."" That explains the chart’s use of older electoral data; it simply hasn’t been updated by subsequent posters. Erlbaum conceded the concerns we laid out.

""It's definitely true that choosing a different election cycle and basis for assigning red versus blue will produce different results,"" he said. As for the age of the data, Erlbaum said, ""I would love to see an update of this report.""

Erlbaum added, ""I've listened to feedback about this chart for a few years now, and folks who don't like the insinuation it makes will always come up with some explanation. Popular ones are that there are more military jobs, more retirees, more farmers, and fewer cities in red states. I don't buy it. Whatever the excuse, the data is clear: These states receive more than they pay in. Everything else is just a rationalization based on someone deciding that one reason for spending money is good, and another is bad. This chart makes no such distinction. I say, ‘Deal with it!’ The facts are the facts.""

Our ruling

The graphic’s data uses data from the 2004 election rather than 2008, and the figures on taxes and spending date back to 2005. There are fewer states that would be labeled Republican based on the 2008 election, and there’s a strong likelihood that tax and spending data would have changed as well. Because of this likelihood, we downgrade the accuracy of this generally accurate chart to Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/
