Larson talked about people ""believing a lot of junk on the Internet"" about antifa activists intentionally setting fires. He asked listeners to vote in a Twitter poll as to whether they believe in ""a tie between northwest wildfire arson and BLM/antifa groups.""

Fake headline claims car lot owner took his own life after Kenosha unrest arson. He didn't.
","One of the trademark images from Kenosha in the violent unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake shows dozens of vehicles consumed by flames in a used car lot. It has spurred a viral — and plainly wrong — claim about the lot’s owner. An image that began circulating on Sept. 11, 2020, shows a supposed screenshot from the Fox Business Network website reading, ""Kenosha car dealer kills himself after his insurance won’t cover a cent of the 2.5 million dollars of damages caused by the riots."" A subhead beneath that says, ""Sad news today in the town of Kenosha. The car dealer whose lot got burned to the ground kills himself after he found out that his insurance won’t cover for the damages for the riots. Close family members are (sic) devistated."" This sloppily-worded claim is not true. The car lot involved — Car Source — is co-owned by Anmol Khindri, his father and his brother, Anmol Khindri told WKOW for a Sept. 2 story. They bought the lot in 2013. After Blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times by a Kenosha police officer on Aug. 23, the lot was targeted on consecutive nights as protests devolved into looting and violence. Khindri estimated the damage at $2.5 million. A gofundme page launched to help the lot’s 20-plus employees said 137 cars were destroyed, in addition to the damage to the building. Here is another look at 'Car Source' dealership in #Kenosha pic.twitter.com/sYJ2o8jYeB Khindri told WKOW his insurance company rejected his claim for damages. ""They don't cover the riots. This is domestic terrorism, (they) don't cover it,"" he told the TV station. ""I'm screwed. I'm bankrupt."" There are numerous reasons to doubt the image in the viral post, but we’ll start with what we learned directly from the Khindri family, and the most basic fact: No one died by suicide. PolitiFact Wisconsin spoke to Khindri’s mother, Suman Khindri, and his father, Anil Khindri, hours after the image was posted online, and both confirmed the report of a suicide was incorrect. Anmol Khindri did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. But the sloppily-assembled image also gave a discerning viewer many reasons to doubt its veracity. Among the tells: The subhead misspells the word devastated and doesn’t capitalize Kenosha. The image has the right logo and links at the top of the page, but it doesn’t show a story date above the headline or a byline and social media links below the headline, as real stories on the Fox Business Network site do. The subhead in particular uses poor grammar throughout, inconsistent with a news operation on the scale of Fox Business Network. Other references such as ""2.5 million dollars"" aren’t in line with Associated Press style guidelines used by news organizations.  A partially cropped word at the bottom of the image says ""ifunn,"" potentially indicating it is connected to ifunny.co, an online repository of memes and other doctored images. A viral image says the owner of a Kenosha car dealership destroyed by arsonists killed himself because insurance wouldn’t cover the losses. The owner of Car Source has said insurance denied the claim since it was due to ""domestic terrorism."" But the thrust of the claim is not about insurance, it’s that a man lost his life. And that element is manufactured and completely wrong. Anmol Khindri has not taken his own life. The headline shown here was manipulated — no such story was published by Fox Business Network.

Trump’s Michigan car industry claims veer off course
","If you’re going to talk about the car industry in Michigan, it helps to get the facts right. President Donald Trump did not. At a rally in Freeland, Mich., Trump described great success in reviving automotive jobs. ""After the last administration nearly killed the U.S. auto industry, I saved the U.S. auto industry,"" he said Sept. 10. ""We brought you a lot of car plants."" And he went on to say that he wrangled a promise in a meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for Japanese companies to expand in the U.S. ""The next day they announced five car companies are coming to Michigan,"" Trump told the crowd. There’s nothing fully correct in any of that. Japan didn’t announce five companies coming to Michigan. Trump didn’t save the auto industry. And he didn’t bring a lot of car plants to the state — the most he can claim is one. That one is a Fiat Chryler factory that will build Jeep SUVs in Detroit, on the site of an idled engine plant. It’s due to open in 2021. That is part of a package of investments in five other Fiat Chrysler plants in the state. ""Trump can count it as a new plant because it closed back in 2013 before he became president,"" said automobile industry researcher James Rubenstein at Ohio’s Miami University. But when Trump said that he saved the auto industry, he left out that total auto industry employment in Michigan dropped by about 3,000 in 2019. That was after a steady rise since 2010, when the major U.S. automakers began to recover from the recession and their restructurings. The coronavirus-induced economic slump this year brought more job losses, but the declines took place before the virus arrived. As for the previous administration nearly killing the industry, the evidence points to the opposite. In 2008 and 2009, intervention by the Bush and Obama administrations pulled the auto and auto parts makers back from the brink of collapse. Under the Obama administration, General Motors and Chrysler went through quick, taxpayer-financed bankruptcy reorganizations orchestrated by a federal task force and the U.S. Treasury, and both emerged from the Great Recession to add jobs and production capacity.  Trump’s comment about cutting a deal with Japan also fell wide of the mark. The Japanese automaker Toyota did announce in March 2019 that it would funnel about $750 million into its American operations. But that money wasn’t for new plants, as Trump said, and Michigan wasn’t on the list. Other Japanese automakers have added U.S. capacity, but not in Michigan. Japanese automakers and parts companies have had U.S. factories and research operations in the U.S. for decades. The timing of the promise Trump said he wrested from Japan is unclear. The two leaders met in Washington in April 2019, but that took place after the Toyota announcement.  There have been some specialized car manufacturing initiatives in Michigan, including one to build self-driving cars that might add 400 jobs, but those would not change the overall picture. We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Trump made several claims about the auto industry, saying he saved it from near destruction, and had brought many new plants to Michigan, including the arrival of five new Japanese car companies. He didn’t save the auto industry. The major U.S. automakers recovered strongly during the Obama administration. After rising for 10 years, Michigan auto industry employment fell on Trump’s watch, even before the coronavirus hit. He didn’t bring many new plants. One company, the Italian-American Fiat Chrysler, announced a new assembly plant in Detroit, on the site of an idled engine factory, as part of a package of investments in Michigan. As for the Japanese investments coming to Michigan, one company — Toyota — unveiled plans to expand its American operations. And others have added U.S. capacity, too. But none of that was in Michigan. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/sep/11/donald-trump/trumps-michigan-car-industry-claims-veer-course/

(Screenshot from Twitter) Still, many users posted the tweet alongside screenshots of conversations with friends and family members about the wildfires, which have killed at least 20 people so far. Several said they suspected antifa activists were to blame. The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office has debunked the rumor that it arrested six antifa activists in connection with fires in the area, which is located south of Eugene, Ore. ""Rumors spread just like wildfire and now our 9-1-1 dispatchers and professional staff are being overrun with requests for information and inquiries on an UNTRUE rumor that 6 Antifa members have been arrested for setting fires in DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON,"" the sheriff’s office wrote in a Sept. 10 Facebook post. ""THIS IS NOT TRUE!"" We asked Romero about the first claim in his tweet — that a ""pallet company"" in Oregon City, Ore., caught an ""antifa arsonist"" on camera. He said he couldn’t remember the name of the company, but a source told him it was caught on video surveillance and ""they’re withholding it."" We called the only pallet company listed in the Oregon City white pages. It moved to a nearby city several years ago and said it hasn’t had a fire. A fire at a pallet company north of Oregon City did take place Sept. 8, but we could find no evidence it was caused by an antifa activist. ""This is not a conspiracy theory — this is a conspiracy,"" Romero said. ""This is obviously a planned and coordinated event."" RELATED: Antifa activists did not start the West Coast wildfires That claim, and Romero’s tweet, has been amplified by supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. The rumors have inspired some armed groups to patrol fire-prone areas in Oregon. But multiple police departments and fire officials across the state say there’s no evidence that the wildfires are part of a ""politically-driven arson campaign."" All evidence points to a mix of drought, high winds, historic heat and fires set by an influx of people trying to enjoy the outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Many of the fires currently burning in Oregon are still under investigation so I don’t have confirmation of cause,"" said Joy Krawczyk, a public affairs manager for the Oregon Department of Forestry.

Donald Trump’s ridiculous claim about Joe Biden and coverage for pre-existing conditions
","President Donald Trump claimed in Michigan that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would destroy a lot of things for Americans: the suburbs, auto industry, jobs, Social Security, and — cue the record scratch — health insurance protections for pre-existing medical conditions. ""He will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions, and we will save Social Security,"" Trump said in Freeland Sept. 10. Trump’s claim is baseless. The protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions were a key pillar of the Affordable Care Act that became law when Biden was vice president. The law prohibited health insurance companies from refusing coverage to someone or charging them more just because they had a health problem before the new coverage took effect. Biden still defends the law, including its protections for pre-existing conditions. He said that if elected president, he’d ""protect and build on it."" In June, Biden told the story of 22-year-old twins from Pennsylvania who were able to get health coverage even though they were diagnosed with cancer when they were children. ""Because of the law, the ACA, the insurance companies could no longer deny them coverage because they're survivors of cancer, a pre-existing condition,"" Biden said. ""I'm proud. I'm proud of the Affordable Care Act."" What Trump said also ignores efforts by his own administration and party to undermine and get rid of the ACA. Republican proposals to replace the ACA have not provided the same level of protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump’s campaign did not provide evidence to support the president’s claim. One of Trump’s major 2016 campaign promises was to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which he calls a disaster. We rated that a Promise Broken. Trump continued to promote his pledge during his presidency, but Republican efforts to eliminate the law have failed. Trump has falsely claimed that he ""saved pre-existing conditions in your health care.""

Meanwhile, he has promoted the expansion of short-term health policies that don’t offer the ACA’s protections for pre-existing conditions. Trump said Biden ""will destroy your protections for pre-existing conditions."" There is no basis for this claim. Biden wants to protect the Affordable Care Act, which created protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Is US trade deficit under Donald Trump setting a record, as Joe Biden said? Yes and no
","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tailored a portion of his remarks in Warren, Mich., to a key concern for voters in the heavily industrialized battleground state: international trade. ""Under President Trump, the U.S. trade deficit has grown,"" Biden said in the Sept. 9 speech. ""It’s hit an all-time high. Let me say that again. U.S. trade deficit is at an all-time high under Trump in the last three years."" Is that correct? It depends on which measurement you use. The trade deficit is essentially a comparison of a country’s imports and exports. If there are more imports than exports, the country will have a trade deficit. If there are more exports than imports, the country will have a trade surplus. The United States hasn’t had a trade surplus since the early 1970s, but the scale of deficits has varied widely. There are two main measurements for trade deficits. One looks only at goods, which are tangible products. Another looks at both goods and services, which can be anything from legal and accounting services to payments for intellectual property. In recent years, the United States has had a persistently high trade deficit in goods, but a growing surplus in services. When those two are put together, the deficit in goods and services tends to be smaller than the deficit in goods alone. If you look at the deficit in goods alone, Biden is right: The U.S. goods deficit was larger in 2018 and 2019 than in any previous year. (Contrary to what Biden indicated, the 2017 goods deficit was a bit smaller than the goods deficit in 2006, 2007, and 2008, under President George W. Bush.) Here’s a chart, with the president’s party noted by color, red for Republicans and blue for Democrats:   However, if you look at the deficit in goods and services, Biden’s statement flips to being incorrect. The deficit in goods and services was larger under Bush in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 than in any year under Trump.   The difference is that the surplus in services has grown substantially since the Bush years. The U.S. surplus in services grew more than fivefold between 2004 and 2019. This gain in services has shaved the size of the overall trade deficit under Trump to levels below what it was under Bush during the mid-2000s. At the same time, the goods-and-services deficit is higher now than it was during any year of Barack Obama’s administration, in which Biden served as vice president. The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that while it wasn’t an all-time high, the overall trade deficit did hit a 12 year high. It’s worth noting that Biden isn’t the only political figure to cherry-pick trade deficit statistics that suit his talking points. Trump himself has focused on the goods deficit and ignored the goods-and-services deficit in a way that exaggerates the trade deficit figures he inherited. Biden said the ""U.S. trade deficit is at an all-time high under Trump in the last three years."" The trade deficit in goods was indeed higher under Trump in 2018 and 2019 than in any previous year, though that was not the case in 2017. However, this ignores a substantial surplus in services. When services are factored in, the overall trade deficit was larger in five separate years during George W. Bush’s administration.

Trump’s baseless claim about ‘tremendous cheating’ in 2016
","In a recent Fox News interview, host Laura Ingraham asked President Donald Trump what he would tell Republicans and conservatives in Democratic-leaning states about whether they should vote in November, and talked about whether a higher popular vote total would send a message of support for Trump.  Trump interjected with a theory of his own.  ""I think I did win the popular vote in a true sense,"" he said. ""I think there was tremendous cheating in California, there was tremendous cheating in New York and other places.""  Though he won the electoral college, Trump lost the popular vote nationwide, winning 62.99 million votes to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 65.85 million votes.  In New York, Clinton won 4.56 million votes, while Trump won 2.82 million votes.  We were curious about his claim of ""tremendous cheating in New York"" in the last presidential election.  We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign to get details of what Trump was talking about, but we did not receive a response.  Though we can’t know for sure, New York has had some voting irregularities that Trump could have had in mind when he said that.  In 2017, the New York City Board of Elections admitted to improperly removing voters from the rolls ahead of the 2016 Democratic primary. The admission followed a lawsuit, in which the city board was accused of violating federal and state election laws. According to a report from the New York City Campaign Finance Board, 126,000 voters were improperly removed before the primary, but were restored in time to vote in the general election. The report did not note anything that could be considered ""tremendous cheating"" in the general election.   A spokesman for the state Board of Elections said that Trump may have been referring to a recent story in the New York Post. Two days before Trump’s interview with Ingraham, the Post published an interview with an unnamed Democratic operative who described the ways that mail-in votes can be manipulated. The story did not refer specifically to any actions taken in New York in the 2016 general election. The operative, who worked in New Jersey and mentored operatives in other states, including New York, said that tactics to manipulate an election result, such as knocking on voters’ doors and asking residents to hand over their filled-out ballots so the operative can tamper with it later, have been used ""for decades."" The spokesman for the Board of Elections, John Conklin, said he could not confirm or deny any criminal activity by a political operative.  Conklin also directed us to a report by the New York City Department of Investigation, which found that in 2013 investigators impersonated voters who were ineligible or deceased and were handed a ballot 61 of 63 times.  ""There was nothing of note in the 2016 election to indicate there was any election tampering or cheating or whatever you want to call it,"" said Sarah Goff, deputy director of Common Cause New York, an organization that closely watches elections and was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city elections board in the 2016 primary.  There were documented problems with eligible voters being improperly purged from the New York City Board of Elections’ voting lists during the 2016 primary.  But in the interview, Trump talked about how he won the popular vote ""in a true sense,"" and made claims about ""tremendous cheating"" in New York and California. The popular vote he is talking about refers to the general election, not the primary. There is no evidence of cheating in the 2016 general election.  Trump made a ridiculous claim.  We rate his statement Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/sep/11/donald-trump/trumps-baseless-claim-about-tremendous-cheating-20/

Antifa activists did not start the West Coast wildfires
","At least seven people have died in wildfires that are ravaging the West Coast. More than 90 major fires have burned thousands of square miles, and smoke has obscured sunlight in several large areas — including the San Francisco Bay Area. A combination of drought, historic heat, lightning storms and heavy winds are thought to have contributed to the destruction, which comes in the middle of the Western United States’ wildfire season. But social media users have an alternative explanation. ""Most of these fires are all being started by antifa and a month ago (Gov.) Kate Brown warned us about these fires that will be happening in Oregon,"" one Facebook user wrote Sept. 9. ""Multiple sources in Emergency Response have confirmed that the fires along the West Coast are caused by dozens of arsonists,"" tweeted Katie Daviscourt, a representative for Turning Point USA, a conservative advocacy group with a history of spreading misinformation. ""These fires are allegedly linked to Antifa and the Riots."" ""Please tell me how all these fires are starting so far apart from each other all over the US?"" another Facebook user wrote. Dozens of other posts blaming antifa for the wildfires were flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Collectively, they’ve been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) Is there some evidence that these left-wing activists are responsible for the wildfires ravaging the West Coast?  No. Officials have dispelled the rumors, and while investigations are still ongoing, many of the fires appear to have been sparked accidentally. First, antifa stands for ""anti-fascist."" It is not a singular group, but rather a broad coalition of activists — including communists, anarchists and socialists — that’s been around for decades.  RELATED: What is antifa, and why is it all over my timeline? While antifa activists have used violence to achieve their goals in the past, experts say most of the movement’s organizing is not rooted in physical confrontation. Still, over the past few years, people ranging from President Donald Trump to everyday social media users have blamed antifa for acts of violence. In Portland, demonstrations began in late May after Floyd’s death and have continued for more than 100 days. Antifa activists have been present at some of the protests. On several occasions, protesters have started fires around the city.  But it’s unclear to what extent antifa supporters have been responsible for those fires — and there is no evidence that they are behind the dozens of wildfires burning from Washington to California. On Sept. 9, police in Medford, Ore., where the Almeda fire has consumed hundreds of homes, took to Facebook to dismiss rumors that they had arrested members of antifa or the Proud Boys — a right-wing organization of self-described ""Western chauvinists"" — in connection with the blaze. ""We did not arrest this person for arson, nor anyone affiliated with Antifa or ‘Proud Boys’ as we’ve heard throughout the day,"" the police department wrote. ""Also, no confirmed gatherings of Antifa which has also been reported."" Police in other parts of the state have also debunked rumors about antifa arsonists,  ""Rumors spread just like wildfire and now our 9-1-1 dispatchers and professional staff are being overrun with requests for information and inquiries on an UNTRUE rumor that 6 Antifa members have been arrested for setting fires in DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON,"" wrote the Douglas County, Ore., Sheriff’s Office on Facebook Sept. 10. ""THIS IS NOT TRUE!""   Joy Krawczyk, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Forestry, told the New York Times that they’re ""not seeing any indications of a mass politically-influenced arson campaign."" California fire officials told us they also haven’t seen any indication of antifa involvement. ""I have not heard any of those rumors. Here in the office, if that was going around, we would know about it immediately,"" said Sean McFadden, a spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ""Right now, it’s safe to say that this is not correct."" We reached out to fire officials in Oregon and Washington, as well as the National Interagency Fire Center, for further comment, but we haven’t heard back. Many fires on the West Coast are still under investigation, but here are a few suspected causes: In California, the El Dorado fire is thought to have started over Labor Day weekend after a family used a ""pyrotechnic device"" to announce the gender of their new baby. The blaze consumed thousands of acres east of Los Angeles. In mid-August, lightning strikes started hundreds of fires across Northern California, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since then, more than 1 million acres have burned. A wildfire east of Salem, Ore., ignited after strong wind gusts knocked down power lines in Santiam Canyon. Downed power lines have also started fires in Washington state. RELATED: Oregon law enforcement does not have six ‘antifa arsonists’ in custody Some fires were purportedly set deliberately, such as one near Eugene, Ore., that burned hundreds of acres and a small brush fire in Puyallup, Wash. But extremist groups are not thought to be connected to them, and arson appears to be the exception — not the rule.  ""I’ve talked to a lot of emergency, fire, and law enforcement personnel in Oregon over the past two days,"" wrote Lincoln Graves, a reporter and anchor for KATU in Portland, in a Sept. 9 Facebook post. ""No one thinks Antifa is going deep into the forest to start fires on selectively windy days."" The Facebook post is inaccurate.

No, House Democrats’ impeachment video did not violate US House rules
","To kick off the second trial of former President Donald Trump, Democratic House impeachment managers played a 13-minute compilation of videos taken during the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol building.  Shortly after, Star Political News, a conservative website, alleged that the video was heavily edited and that it therefore violated House rules against the dissemination of manipulated media.  ""Manipulated Video used in House Impeachment Looks to Have VIOLATED House Rules,"" reads the headline of the article. The House Rules govern the chamber's congressional proceedings. Under Article I of the Constitution, a two-thirds majority can vote to censure or expel a member who violates those rules.  As evidence of its claim, Star Political News cites a tweet by former GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who asked whether the video violated House Rules.  ""Go to page 34 of House Rules. Did the manipulated video violate the House Rules?"" it reads.  We asked three experts on congressional procedure whether there was any violation. Their answer was a clear no.  ""I cannot possibly see how (the video) violates the House rule Chaffetz is pointing to,"" said Josh Ryan, a professor of political science at Utah State University.  Here’s the section of the House Rules that Chaffetz highlighted in his tweet:  ""DISSEMINATION OF MANIPULATED MEDIA.—The Committee on Ethics is directed to report to the House not later than December 31, 2021, any recommended amendments to the Code of Official Conduct, as well as any accompanying regulations, intended to address the circumstances and instances, if any, for which a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House may be subject to discipline for the dissemination by electronic means, including by social media, of any image, video, or audio file that has been distorted or manipulated with the intent to mislead the public."" In other words, this text dictates that the House Ethics Committee issue a report to the House by the end of 2021 recommending whether members and employees should be subject to discipline for knowingly distributing deceptively edited media, like deep fakes.  So the House ""rule"" that Chaffetz cited is not actually in force.  ""The rule is a direction to Ethics, not a standard for ethical behavior,"" said Steven Smith, a professor of political science at Washington University, St. Louis.  Besides that, Donald R. Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, cited three reasons why the House manager’s presentation wouldn’t run afoul of any House rule: House Rules do not extend to the Senate chamber, which is governed by Senate rules, Wolfensberger said. In the case of the Senate impeachment trial, that would include the Senate impeachment rule and the special impeachment procedures adopted Feb. 9 by the Senate and enforced by its presiding officer.  Even if the rule were already in effect and applied to the House impeachment managers on the Senate floor, the burden of proving a violation would be steep. In particular, the Ethics Committee would have to determine that there was ""intent to mislead"" in the compilation, a tall order when all of the footage was undoctored video relevant to the proceeding.  In the case of this impeachment, House managers are charged with presenting evidence at the Senate trial in support of the article of impeachment adopted by the House. ""Nothing could be more germane or relevant as evidence than video proof of the insurrection at the Capitol,"" Wolfensberger said.  Congressional representatives have been warned about spreading manipulated media before. On Jan. 28, 2020, House Ethics Committee Chairman Ted Deutch, D-Fla., sent out an advisory memo, reminding representatives that ""posting deep fakes or other audio-visual distortions intended to mislead the public may be in violation of the Code of Official Conduct.""  The memo was sent out three weeks after Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., posted an image of former President Barack Obama doctored to show him shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. The issue flared up again in August 2020 when Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., tweeted out a video that used manipulated footage of activist Ady Barkan to falsely accuse former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to defund the police.  There is a difference between Scalise’s video, which was digitally altered to distort a person’s words, and the House Democrats’ impeachment video, which edited together documentary footage into a narrative. Hany Farid, a computer science professor at University of California-Berkeley and a leading expert in digital forensics, told PolitiFact that he would not classify the House Democrats’ impeachment video as deceptively edited because it was presented ""as a set of representative vignettes.""  Some Republican politicians have objected to the fact that the impeachment video didn’t feature Trump telling his supporters to ""peacefully and patriotically protest."" But that omission doesn’t meet the same standard of deception as a deepfake. ""A deceptively edited video is one that purports to depict an event in its entirety, but the video has in fact been edited to remove or add content that significantly alters the video's meaning,"" he said. ""For example, editing a speech saying ‘Let's peacefully take the Capitol,’ to say ‘Let's take the Capitol,’ by cutting or splicing a portion of the video."" One could argue that the edited impeachment video is incomplete, Farid said, but the exclusion of some parts of Trump’s speech does not make the video deceptive.  Star Political News wrote, ""Manipulated Video used in House Impeachment Looks to Have VIOLATED House Rules."" The rule the article points to has not actually been enacted yet.  House Rules do not extend to the Senate chamber where the trial is happening. The Senate is governed by Senate rules. Even if such a rule had been enacted, the video does not appear to violate it. The video consists of documentary footage edited into a single narrative. It does not contain audio-visual distortions or splice together words to make someone say something they didn’t say.  This is False. ​",/factchecks/2021/feb/11/blog-posting/no-house-democrats-impeachment-video-did-not-viola/

Doctors administering COVID-19 vaccines aren’t guilty of war crimes
","The video starts with a video from a child TikToker and an advertisement for silver coins. Then, it transitions to a shot of an old man in a maroon wingback chair reading from a stack of papers. That man is Dr. Vernon Coleman, a British author who has denied the existence of HIV/AIDS and authored a book titled ""Anyone Who Tells You Vaccines Are Safe and Effective is Lying."" In the video, Coleman spins a conspiracy theory that paints the coronavirus vaccine as a dangerous medical experiment. ""I’d rather die than have that stuff in my body,"" he says. Over the course of nearly 18 minutes, Coleman takes aim at politicians in the United Kingdom who have promoted the coronavirus vaccine. He calls the vaccine ""experimental"" and ""gene therapy"" — and says that doctors who administer it are guilty of war crimes. ""How many doctors and nurses jabbing people with this stuff are telling patients it’s a trial? How many are giving people the information they need to make a value judgment?"" Coleman says. ""I would guess somewhere close to none. And so legally, all those people giving vaccinations are war criminals."" The video was published in an article on the website of Charlie Ward, a Briton who has promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory on his YouTube channel. The headline: ""Doctors and Nurses giving the Covid-19 Vaccine Will Be Tried as War Criminals."" That article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) Coleman’s video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool — in spite of the platform’s recent ban on vaccine misinformation. So we wanted to take a closer look at his claims, which have been promoted by anti-vaccine activists in the U.S. Coleman is wrong. Administering approved vaccines is not a medical experiment, and doctors and nurses who administer them aren’t guilty of war crimes. Other fact-checkers have debunked similar claims. In the video, Coleman cites two pieces of evidence: a page from the National Library of Medicine and the Nuremberg Code. ""The United States National Library of Medicine published details of the vaccine program currently underway and they say that the trial will last two years,"" Coleman said. ""Anyone having the vaccine is therefore taking part in an experiment.""  The ""vaccine program"" Coleman referred to is an ongoing clinical trial for the Pfizer and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which is expected to end Jan. 31, 2023. However, that doesn’t mean the Pfizer vaccine is an ""experiment.""  It’s normal for safety monitoring to continue after the FDA greenlights a vaccine. Pfizer said in December that it would continue monitoring trial participants for adverse events for two years after they receive the second dose of the vaccine. The U.S. and U.K. governments also have systems in place for tracking vaccine safety. Regulators in the U.K., where Coleman lives, approved the vaccine for emergency use Dec. 2, 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its emergency use authorization on Dec. 11. Americans started getting shots three days later.  The FDA authorized Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use after months of stage three clinical trials, during which more than 40,000 participants received the vaccine. The FDA wrote in its assessment of the trial that the vaccine was safe and effective. ""FDA has determined that the totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19 and support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals,"" the agency wrote. RELATED: What we know about the COVID-19 variants and how they impact vaccine efficacy The second source that Coleman cited in the video is the Nuremberg Code, a set of research ethics that resulted from the Nuremberg Trials after World War II. ""Nuremberg Code stated explicit voluntary consent from human patients is required for experimentation,"" he said. ""People must be warned they're taking part in a trial."" The Code does say ""the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" And since it was adopted by the Geneva Conventions of 1949, breaking that principle would constitute a war crime. However, none of that is relevant to the coronavirus vaccine rollout. The Nuremberg Code was created in response to experiments that Nazis conducted on prisoners in concentration camps. It says nothing about using tested and approved vaccines on patients. In the U.S., all 43,448 participants in the Pfizer vaccine trial provided ""written informed consent,"" according to the FDA. The U.K. requires consent before health care providers administer vaccines. Coleman’s claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Wisconsin panel did back vaccinations for prisoners, but not necessarily before grandma
","The distribution of coronavirus vaccines in Wisconsin has been fraught with concerns about why the state started off lagging its peers and over just who was at the front of the vaccination line. And who was second. And third. Now that the dust has cleared a bit, we wanted to go back and examine what was a common theme, especially among Republicans. That is, that prison inmates should not be near the top of the list. For instance, on Jan. 12, 2021, when a document containing recommendations from a state committee was released, state Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, tweeted:  ""The committee that advises @GovEvers and his department tasked with leading during this pandemic is recommending allowing prisoners to receive the vaccine before 65 year old grandma?""  Is it true that a state committee recommended providing inmates with COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the state’s elderly?  At issue here is where various groups fall on the priority list for the distribution of limited COVID vaccines. It’s up to each state to establish its own list, though most started with front-line health care workers and nursing home residents. Republicans pushed a bill that would make the vaccine available to anyone in the state that wants it by mid-March and bar Gov. Tony Evers and his administration from prioritizing prisoners in any way as they set priorities. Health officials say there are many reasons for putting inmates near the top of the list, including the fact prisons have been the site of deadly outbreaks and because the state -- and its taxpayers -- have a legal obligation to assure inmates receive adequate health care. If they do not, taxpayers could be on the hook for lawsuits over unfair or inadequate treatment. In any case, in Wisconsin, the committee group charged with providing advice on the vaccine priority list is the Vaccine Distribution Subcommittee of the Wisconsin State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee. Its aim is to provide the best advice from a medical perspective, not taking into account political considerations. Its advice is also just that -- advice. The group does not have the final say in the matter. The panel collects public input on who should be prioritized in the rollout, and gives recommendations to the state Department of Health Services on how to manage each phase of the distribution.  When asked to provide backup for Born’s claim, his office pointed to a document released by the advisory committee on Jan. 12, 2021 -- the same day of the tweet. That document noted: ""Current supplies of vaccine limit the ability to provide vaccine to all who wish to be vaccinated; therefore, rationing of available vaccine will be necessary until production and distribution increases to amounts sufficient to meet all needs.""  At the time, the group was looking past health-care personnel and residents of long-term care facilities -- Priority 1A -- and was offering guidance for the next group, Priority 1B. The group recommended vaccines be available for anyone 70 or older, noting ""the evidence of deaths in that group in Wisconsin, where 71% of deaths and hospitalization are in those 70 and above.""  It also called for including staff and residents in what are termed ""congregate living facilities."" That category includes homeless shelters, group homes and -- yes -- correctional facilities.  It should be noted, the recommendation was not simply to immunize inmates in the 1B group, but also correctional workers, since the virus can be passed between individuals, and even move into a prison from the community via staff members coming to work. This is a good place to pause and note two things: First, our ratings are based on the information known at the time. It’s impossible for people to predict the future and, indeed, things changed after the recommendation was made. Ultimately, the state reduced the age guidelines for the general population in group 1B to 65 and older. Second, it was subtle, but Born’s tweet mentioned two groups: Not only the advisory committee, but the ""department tasked with leading during this pandemic."" That would be the Department of Health Services. The tweet said both were recommending inmates come before ""65 year old Grandma."" That’s where the claim runs into a problem. First, the document produced by the advisory committee -- and provided to us by Born’s office as backup -- includes this label: ""Draft -- for discussion only.""  While the committee was recommending that ""congregate facilities"" be included in Priority 1B, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Jan. 14, 2021, but according to Department of Health Services spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt, the panel did not submit its recommendations to the department until Jan. 21, and they were not accepted until Jan. 25. ""You’ll also note the eligibility groups are listed in priority order— congregate living settings are the last eligibility group listed for priority group 1B, after education and childcare, public facing essential workers, among others,"" Goodsitt wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Another piece of information arguing against the idea the department itself backed the inmates-before-Grandma approach, is that on Jan. 19, DHS announced those 65 and older -- not 70 and older as the panel suggested -- would be eligible for vaccinations starting Jan. 25.  What’s more, even now, a month later, congregate living facilities are not yet eligible. The next phase, which includes teachers, grocers, and anyone living in shared housing such as prisons, among other groups, is to begin March 1.   Born tweeted ""The committee that advises @GovEvers and his department tasked with leading during this pandemic is recommending allowing prisoners to receive the vaccine before 65 year old grandma?""  The panel did draw its line for Phase 1B at 70 year olds and included those in ""congregate living facilities"" -- a group that includes prison inmates. But the recommendations were not sent to the full department until days later. By that time, the department had lowered the age threshold to 65, and started that group before prisons. It’s unclear if blowback to the idea of inmates-before-Grandma prompted the department to take a different approach, as Republicans argue. But it is clear the department had not taken a public position at the time.  Our definition of Half True is ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.  ",/factchecks/2021/feb/11/mark-born/wisconsin-panel-did-back-vaccinations-prisoners-no/

GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy Distorts Job Loss Estimates For $15 Minimum Wage Hike
","Would raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour ""destroy up to 3.7 million jobs"" in the United States?  That’s what GOP House Minority Leader and California Rep. Kevin McCarthy claimed in the headline of a press release on Tuesday as Democrats in Congress began debating the move. On Twitter the same day, McCarthy wrote the wage hike ""could put nearly 4 million Americans out of work.""    This is a screen shot of the headline from McCarthy’s press release. The Biden Administration last month proposed raising the federal minimum hourly pay from $7.25 to $15, with increases of about $1.50 every year for five years.  To make that happen, Congressional Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 last month and began considering the legislation in the House Committee on Education and Labor this week.  Here’s what McCarthy said in the body of the press release:  ""At this critical point, the Democrats’ big, creative response is to raise the federal national wage to $15 an hour — a move the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office previously found could cost nearly 4 million workers their jobs."" President Joe Biden initially included the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in his $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill. But he predicted last week it would be left out due to opposition from Republicans and centrist Democrats.  Given the debate over raising the wage and its impact on jobs, we decided to take a closer look at McCarthy’s claim in this fact check.  Our Research In his press release and tweet, McCarthy linked to an analysis of the wage proposal by the Congressional Budget Office published on Monday.  The CBO, a nonpartisan research service, predicted the wage hike would eliminate jobs, but would also raise wages for an estimated 17 million people and lift 900,000 people out of poverty. It doesn’t say anything about destroying an estimated ""3.7 million"" positions as McCarthy claimed. Instead, the CBO said ""the average estimate is that employment would be reduced by 1.4 million workers.""  The report goes on to say there’s a ""one-third chance"" the loss will be between 1 million and 2.7 million workers, still far less than McCarthy’s number. ""Young, less educated people would account for a disproportionate share of those reductions in employment,"" the report adds. A spokesperson for McCarthy did not respond to questions.  Deborah Kilroe, a spokesperson for the CBO, said McCarthy likely got his figure from a July 2019 CBO report that also examined raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.  That older analysis predicted the ""median estimate"" for job losses would be 1.3 million. Meanwhile, it said ""there is a two thirds chance that the change in employment would be between about zero and a decrease of 3.7 million workers.""  That last figure lines up with McCarthy’s statement of ""nearly 4 million workers,"" but it comes from the high-end of an old report and ignores what the CBO published this week. Last month, FactCheck.org found Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul also distorted the facts on this topic. The senator told Fox News that ""the government estimates are close to 4 million people will lose their jobs,"" if the minimum wage hike goes through.  FactCheck.org examined the July 2019 CBO report [the current report had yet to be published] and found Paul cherry-picked the high-end of that report.  Our Ruling Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour ""would destroy up to 3.7 million jobs."" McCarthy appears to be citing a Congressional Budget Office analysis from 2019 that said, at the high-end, 3.7 million jobs could be lost from the wage hike. But in his statement, he linked to the CBO’s new analysis published this week which found an average estimate of 1.4 million jobs would be lost, a figure he omitted. The new CBO report added there’s a ""one-third chance"" the loss will be between 1 million and 2.7 million workers, still far less than McCarthy’s claim. In the end, we found McCarthy cherry-picked a figure from an old report while ignoring current data on the topic that tells a different story. We rated his claim False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2021/feb/11/kevin-mccarthy/gop-house-leader-kevin-mccarthy-distorts-job-loss-/

Does New York get less from the federal government than any state?
","Does New York get the short end of the stick when it comes to federal funding? Gov. Andrew Cuomo said so in a tweet on Jan. 14. ""New Yorkers are just tired of subsidizing other states with our tax dollars. New York subsidizes 42 other states. No state gets back less from Washington than New York state. The federal government must stop shortchanging NY,"" Cuomo tweeted. New Yorkers are just tired of subsidizing other states with our tax dollars.New York subsidizes 42 other states.No state gets back less from Washington than New York State.The federal government must stop shortchanging NY.#SOTS2021 Is Cuomo correct that ""no state gets back less from Washington than New York state""? We looked at a comprehensive independent analysis and found that Cuomo’s assertion was close to accurate. Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Budget, told PolitiFact that Cuomo was referencing a widely cited analysis from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy arm of the State University of New York. The report, published in January 2020, shows four-year totals of funding flows from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018. The report found that New Yorkers cumulatively sent $116 billion more to the federal government during that period than New York state received from the federal government. The four major categories of federal spending analyzed by the report are direct payments for individuals under programs such as Social Security and Medicare, federal grants to state and local governments, federal contracts and procurement, and wages paid to federal workers. The institute found that during that period, only 11 states received fewer dollars in funding than they sent to the federal government in tax payments — and of these, New York’s cumulative shortfall was easily the largest.  The other 10 states with negative balances with the federal government during that four-year period were, in descending order, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Illinois, Colorado, Nebraska, Washington, Utah and New Hampshire. In the most recent year studied in the report, 2018, New York sent almost $22 billion more to the federal government than it received. That’s a larger sum than the next two states’s shortfalls combined, New Jersey and Massachusetts. But when adjusted for population, New York isn’t the biggest loser. It’s fourth, after three of its smaller neighbors: Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Cuomo’s mention of 42 states stems from the 2018 figures in the report, which says, ""Forty-two states had a positive balance of payments with the federal government in 2018, Broadly speaking, federal money flows from high-income states to low-income states through spending by programs such as Medicaid. The system isn’t designed to give back each state the equivalent of what its residents and businesses paid.  ""Because New York is home to a large critical mass of very high-income households, as well as a considerable number of merely very affluent (mid-six-figure) residents, the Empire State’s residents generate a disproportionately large share of federal revenues through a tax system that is, after all, based on a progressive income tax,"" said E.J. McMahon, founder and research director of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank. New York’s balance of payments with the federal government could worsen in the coming years unless a change made to the tax code in 2017 is reversed. In the Republican-backed tax bill signed that year by President Donald Trump, lawmakers limited the size of the federal deduction for state and local taxes paid. This change to the state and local tax deduction meant that some taxpayers in high-tax states like New York would pay more in federal taxes. Cuomo said that ""no state gets back less from Washington than New York state.""  This aligns with a widely cited study by the Rockefeller Institute of Government that looked at every state’s balance of payments with the federal government from 2015 to 2018.  However, that same study notes a slightly different result when population is taken into account. On a per-capita basis, New York ranked fourth, after Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

The foundation, which was granted its nonprofit status in 1998, was launched in the names of then-President Bill Clinton, 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea. The New York City-based foundation says its mission is to develop and implement programs that create economic opportunity, improve public health, and inspire civic engagement and service.  It remains operational. It has had no breaks in operation, said spokesman Brian Cookstra. Among its recent activities: On Feb. 4, former President Bill Clinton launched a new version of his podcast, ""Why Am I Telling You This?"" The podcast is co-produced by the foundation.  On Feb. 2, he hosted a foundation event, ""Building an Inclusive Recovery,"" and announced the formation of a new venture, the Clinton Global Initiative Action Network on an Inclusive Economic Recovery.  On Jan. 26, the foundation announced it had surpassed 700,000 meals packaged and delivered to people in central Arkansas who have been affected by the pandemic. An Arkansas TV station covered some of the meal distributions in April 2020.  The recirculated Facebook post alleges that the foundation spent far more money on salaries and fees than it gave away in grants.  That’s similar to a November 2019 Facebook post that claimed that in 2014, the Clinton Foundation gave only $5 million to charity while spending $85 million for salaries and travel. We rated it False. The foundation hired people to carry out its own humanitarian programs instead of giving away the money, meaning its charitable contributions show up as program expenses instead of grants on tax forms. The foundation spent $217 million on programs and about $13 million for salaries and travel in 2014.  The post we’re checking began recirculating widely on Facebook in the days leading up to the Feb. 9, 2021, start of the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump.  Similar examples of disinformation about Clinton, including claims about the foundation, surfaced during Trump’s first impeachment trial in early 2020.  A 2018 Facebook post that is widely recirculating on Facebook claimed: ""The Clinton Foundation folded."" That’s not true. The post also repeats debunked claims of financial abuses by the foundation. The foundation continues to operate and there’s no evidence to indicate it ever ceased.

Fact-checking whether Biden family is ‘heavily invested’ in foreign oil, energy
","After President Joe Biden paused certain oil and gas operations and killed a cross-country oil pipeline, an image emerged on Facebook making this attack: ""I’m confused how the Biden family is so heavily invested in energy and oil in OTHER countries, yet they want to end it in OUR country."" The widely shared post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The latest financial disclosure form for Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden indicate no investments in foreign energy or oil, despite False claims on social media that suggest otherwise. But no such disclosure requirements apply to the Bidens’ adult children or to Joe Biden’s brother, James, who has been accused of trying to his brother’s political connections to help his business ventures. In short, aside from what the president and first lady have disclosed, there isn’t publicly available information on what Biden family members have in their investments.  During his first eight days in office, Biden issued three executive orders affecting oil and energy.  He paused the permitting of oil and natural gas operations in northeastern Alaska. And he paused leases for drilling on all federal land — effectively banning new fracking there for as long as the policy lasts. His moves leave current fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground, untouched.  Biden also revoked the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it was to connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries. We rated as Mostly True a 2019 claim by Biden that he ""entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government, in Congress and as vice president"" in January 2017. But after leaving the vice presidency, he and Jill Biden wrote books, and he did high-paying speaking engagements. The couple’s annual income, which had hovered around $400,000 for seven consecutive years, reached $11 million in 2017, $4.58 million in 2018 and $985,000 in 2019, according to their tax returns.  In August 2019, Forbes estimated the Bidens’ net worth at $9 million, which included two Delaware homes valued at $4 million combined, cash and investments worth another $4 million or so, and a federal pension worth more than $1 million. But in all of that, there is not direct evidence of foreign investments in energy or oil. Biden filed a federal financial disclosure form required of presidential candidates in May 2020. It said Joe Biden held between $15,001 and $50,000 each in what is listed as a ""U.S. brokerage account — cash,"" and in the TIAA-CREF Lifecycle Index 2010 Fund, which is a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds and short-term debt; they typically invest in a range of companies and industries. The form says Jill Biden had several whole life insurance policies and a number of investment funds. She held between $15,001 and $50,000 in the BNY Mellon IP Technology Growth; and between $1,001 and $15,000 each in Invesco VI Health Care, Guggenheim VIF High Yield, Guggenheim VIF Styleplus Mid Growth, Guggenheim VIF Small Cap Value, Guggenheim VIF All Cap Value, Guggenheim VIF S-Mid Cap Value, Janus Henderson VIT Enterprise, Janus Henderson VIT Research. All of those are mutual funds.  She also had between $1,001 and $15,000 each in a utilities fund, MFS VIT Utilities, which includes electric, natural gas and telephone service providers; and in a bond fund, Western Asset Variable Global High Yield. A bond fund is a company that invests primarily in bonds. When you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation. Biden’s other family members include his son, Hunter Biden; his daughter, Ashley Biden; and one of his siblings, James Biden. Ashley Biden’s name has not surfaced in news stories that raise questions about Biden family investments. Hunter Biden, a lawyer and former lobbyist, held a directorship with a Ukrainian natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, beginning in the spring of 2014, when his father was vice president. A September 2020 report by Republican staff of the Senate Finance and Homeland Security committees alleged that he was paid millions of dollars over the next several years.  George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, told PolitiFact in 2019 that the younger Biden was an unpaid board member of Bohai Harvest RST, or BHR, a private equity company, until October 2017; at that point, he took a 10% financial stake in the firm. According to a 2019 Wall Street Journal report, the firm was 80%-controlled by Chinese entities. Mesires later released a statement on Oct. 13, 2019, saying that Hunter Biden would be resigning from the BHR board, without receiving any return on his investment or shareholder distributions. In 2014, BHR had invested about $1 billion in a subsidiary of a China-controlled oil and gas company. And in April 2017, BHR paid $1.2 billion for a stake in a Democratic Republic of Congo-based mining company. In December 2020, Hunter Biden said the U.S. attorney in Delaware is investigating his taxes. The details remain unknown, but several national newspapers, citing unnamed sources, reported that the matter focused on Hunter Biden and his associates, not his father or anyone in the president-elect’s circle. A separate investigation is underway by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, N.Y. According to the Wall Street Journal, Hunter Biden’s investments caught investigators’ attention as part of a broader probe into international financial transactions. That investigation includes money laundering. President Biden was not specifically targeted, the report says.  An investigative article by Politico Magazine published in August 2019 examined whether Hunter and James Biden tried to make money off of Joe Biden’s political connections. There is no indication that Hunter and James Biden ever succeeded in bringing new foreign money into Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund they purchased in 2006, the article said. As reported by the New York Times in late 2020, records produced by Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter and James Biden show that in 2017, Hunter Biden and James Biden were involved in negotiations about a joint venture with a Chinese energy and finance company called CEFC China Energy. The deal ultimately fell apart. Individuals generally are not required to disclose their investment holdings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Individuals who are insiders — such as officers, directors, and those that hold more than 10% of any class of a company’s securities — must report purchases, sales and holdings of their company’s securities. There are also disclosure requirements for individuals who own 5% or more of a company’s shares. None of the Bidens (Joe, Jill, Hunter, Ashley or James) have filed any of those, according to a search of SEC records. An image widely shared on Facebook said: ""The Biden family is so heavily invested in oil and energy in other countries."" The latest financial disclosure filed by President Biden and the first lady show no direct investments in foreign oil or energy. Other family members are not required to file such disclosures and so the extent of their personal investments is not known.  Joe Biden’s son Hunter and his brother James have past financial ties to foreign energy interests. The statement is unsupported. It contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Courts have affirmed Biden’s victory
","Three weeks after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, some Facebook users are still pushing bogus claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. In a Feb. 7 post, one user wrote: ""Not one court has looked at the evidence and said that Biden legally won."" ""Not one,"" the post says. ""Biden did not win legally."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has more than 6,000 shares. Since Nov. 3, we’ve fact-checked scores of claims that falsely say widespread voter fraud swung the election in favor of Biden and that Donald Trump is the rightful president. This Facebook post is similarly wrong. (Screenshot from Facebook) One key point: It’s not up to courts to determine whether a presidential candidate won an election. Judges can hear legal challenges to the way elections are administered or votes are counted, and their decisions may affect the outcome of an election, but they don’t declare the winner. Under the Constitution, states have the power to administer elections and count votes. The states certified their results, some following audits and recounts, almost two months ago. On Jan. 7, Congress finalized those results, which showed that Biden won with 306 electoral votes, to Trump’s 232. Biden won the popular vote by about 7 million. Biden was duly sworn into office Jan. 20. There is no evidence that voter fraud affected that outcome. Election officials in every state said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history."" Former Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud.  Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in state and federal courts to challenge the election results. Not one of them proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome.  The Trump campaign won one lawsuit related to reducing the amount of time Pennsylvania voters had to fix errors on their mail-in ballots. The matter involved a small number of ballots that didn’t change the outcome. Some cases were rejected because plaintiffs failed to present any evidence of widespread voter fraud, while others were dismissed because they contained errors or faced jurisdictional problems. Cases were dismissed by Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges.  In his dismissal of a case seeking to have Wisconsin’s Republican-led Legislature allocate the state’s electoral votes instead of going by the result of the popular vote, U.S. District Judge Brett H. Ludwig — a Trump appointee — said Trump’s claims failed ""as a matter of law and fact."" ""A sitting president who did not prevail in his bid for reelection has asked for federal court help in setting aside the popular vote based on disputed issues of election administration, issues he plainly could have raised before the vote occurred,"" he wrote.

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim about $15 minimum wage and poverty
","President Joe Biden’s proposal for a $15-an-hour minimum wage as part of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan may not survive amid resistance in Congress, but Biden sees his campaign promise as a key path out of poverty. ""No one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage,"" he told CBS’ Norah O’Donnell in an interview that aired Super Bowl weekend. ""And if you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage."" We found that whether a person earning below $15 an hour is living in poverty depends upon various factors, including the size of their household and the cost of living in their jurisdiction. Since 2009, the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour, though 29 states and Washington D.C. have higher minimum wages, as do some cities and counties.  Among the general public, the $15 minimum wage is popular, although business groups and their allies among lawmakers argue that they would cause job losses. Economists who study wage hikes debate the impact on employment or the economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded in February that raising the federal minimum wage in annual increments to $15 per hour by June 2025 would reduce employment by 1.4 million workers but also reduce the number of people in poverty by 900,000. Measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, the current minimum wage is lower than it was from the mid-1950s to late 1980s, and in many years since then. Since Biden didn’t explain during the interview whether he was referring to full-time workers of a certain household size, we asked his spokesperson to clarify what he meant. T.J. Ducklo pointed to the federal government’s poverty guidelines that show a family of four earning $26,500 as living in poverty. Based on a calculation of 2,000 hours at a full-time hourly job, that means the wage earner in a family of four earning up to $13 an hour is living in poverty. If the same worker earned $15 an hour, the family would earn $30,000 a year, placing them over the poverty line. Experts on wages didn’t dispute Biden’s math, but said his comment doesn’t fully reflect the factors that determine if someone lives in poverty. One key factor is varying housing costs depending on geographic location.  Shawn Fremstad, a senior fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the federal poverty guidelines are updated based on inflation, but are otherwise outdated and based on an understanding developed decades ago of the amount of income needed to live out of poverty.  ""The antiquated HHS poverty standard used by the White House includes ZERO allowance for child care, health insurance, prepared foods, meals away from home, modern transportation, and other goods and services that weren’t thought of as necessities in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when a full-time housewife was assumed and mainstream living standards were very different,"" Fremstad said.  Experts said that wages alone may not shed light on whether a household lives in poverty. For example, a family with two full-time workers each earning $13 an hour would be above the poverty-level, but if they need child care for two children, it would wipe out more than half their income, said Elizabeth Pancotti, policy adviser at Employ America, a group that supports a $15 minimum wage. ""As a result, it’s likely unrealistic to think that all families of four earning minimum wage-level earnings could have both adults work,"" she said. ""I think it’s reasonable for the White House to base their analysis on one income for a household of four.""  David Neumark, a professor of economics at the University of California-Irvine, who has found negative impacts on jobs from wage hikes, said the minimum wage is a ""crude tool to target poverty"" because it targets low wages, not low family income. ""A worker gets the higher minimum wage whether she is a single mother (who needs help!), the spouse of someone who makes $1 million a year, or the teenage daughter of that same person,"" he said. The calculation by Biden also ignores other government programs, most notably the earned income tax credit, which provides a subsidy to low-wage workers. A family earning low wages may also get food stamps, subsidized housing or Medicaid. Biden said, ""If you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage."" A spokesman for Biden said he was referring to a family of four with one full-time income using the federal government’s poverty guideline, an explanation Biden didn’t include in the interview. Using that measurement, that family with a paycheck of $13 an hour would live below the poverty line. At $15 an hour, the same family would clearly be above the poverty line. So Biden was off by about a dollar, using the existing standards. But experts said wages alone don’t tell the full story about whether a household lives in poverty. Other factors include child care and housing costs, for example, which can vary by geography. Generalizing a ""poverty wage"" to a specific number ignores the different circumstances that families face. Other experts said the federal definition of a poverty level is out of date and needs changing. We rate this claim Half True.

The city of Tampa didn’t issue citations to people who weren’t wearing a mask, a mayor’s office spokesperson told Newsweek. As for the photo, Castor can be seen sitting next to two people wearing Tampa Bay Lightning jerseys. The hockey team won the Stanley Cup in 2020.

Social media posts wrong about the origin of Cracker Barrel restaurant chain’s name
","The Cracker Barrel restaurant chain has been serving Southern cuisine and selling rocking chairs in its old country stores since its first location opened in Lebanon, Tenn., in 1969.  But several posts spreading on social media claim the company’s name and logo refer to a slaveholder’s whips and the barrels they were stored in.  ""Cracker was a slang term for whip,"" reads one Facebook post that features an image of the company’s name and logo. ""Thats why blacks called whites crackers, from the crack of the whip. A cracker barrel is a barrel that held the whips for sale at the country store. You see the whip going from the R to the K? Racism in your face!!"" The story isn’t true, and the company denied the claim. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Merriam-Webster defines ""cracker-barrel"" as an adjective ""suggestive of the friendly homespun character of a country store. Dictionary.com defines the term as ""of or suggesting the simple rustic informality and directness thought to be characteristic of life in and around the country store."" The company’s name and the logo allude to barrels that were used to store soda crackers, like saltines or northern common crackers, not whips.  Cracker Barrel said its logo does not depict a whip and never has. ""The part of the logo being referenced in social media posts is a flourish, which is used in the calligraphy of the logos of many brands,"" the company said in an emailed statement. ""Cracker Barrel rejects racism and discrimination in any form."" A 2018 article by Southern Living also covered how the company got its name. The phrase, according to the article, was inspired by the barrels full of soda crackers that were for sale in general stores around the country. Visitors would sit around them to catch up on the day's news. The logo shows a man sitting in the chair, leaning on the barrel.  Photographs of old newspaper ads support this. One image shared on Twitter shows a 1913 ad from Oklahoma’s May Bugle featuring the crackers. Another, from the Newton Daily News in 1965, depicts the ""general store era"" of cracker barrels. The viral posts may be partly correct on the origin of the term ""cracker"" on its own as a racial slur. Jelani Cobb, a historian who has written on the etymology of some anti-white slurs, told NPR in 2013 that the word is suspected to be a shortened version of ""whip-cracker,"" and was used in the mid-18th century as an insult against poor whites who handled livestock with a whip. Cracker Barrel has faced accusations of racial discrmination in its treatment of Black employees and customers. A 2004 investigation by the U.S. Justice Department found that the chain violated civil-rights law in its treatment of Black customers at restaurants in seven states. Under a consent decree settling the case, Cracker Barrel agreed to introduce ""effective nondiscrimination policies and procedures,"" improve training and make other policy changes.  Social media posts claim that Cracker Barrel’s name and logo allude to a slaveholder’s whip and the barrels used to store them. That isn’t true. The company rejected the rumor and said its logo features a common calligraphy flourish used in the logos of many brands.  The barrels referred to in the name were used at general stores to store soda crackers, not whips.

Trump did not win two-thirds of election lawsuits ‘where merits considered’
","Donald Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to challenge the results of the 2020 election. Some Trump-friendly websites make it seem like the former president prevailed in the majority of them. The Feb. 7 headline of an article from the Epoch Times, a media outlet backed by the Falun Gong religious movement, said: ""Trump Won Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered."" ""Of the 22 cases that have been heard by the courts and decided on their merits, Trump and Republicans have prevailed in 15,"" the site wrote. ""This means Trump has won two-thirds of the cases fully adjudicated by the courts."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Epoch Times attributed the tally to John Droz Jr., who it described as a ""physicist and environmental advocate in Morehead City, N.C."" Droz is a political activist who has denied the science of climate change and advocated against legislation aimed at mitigating sea-level rise. None of the lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters have proved there was fraud, and judges across the political spectrum have rejected their cases. But we wanted to take a closer look at the claim that the challenges were more successful than they appear. The Epoch Times’ headline gives the impression that Trump won several election-related lawsuits on their merits. But only one of the cases cited by the article was decided after Nov. 3, many were not exclusively about Trump, and some were not related to the general presidential election at all. ""No one from the Epoch Times spoke to me about their article, so they made their own conclusions,"" Droz told PolitiFact. After we reached out to the Epoch Times for a comment, the website changed its headline to read: ""In Two-Thirds of Election Lawsuits Where Merits Considered Decisions Are Favorable to Trump."" In its article, the Epoch Times cited an analysis of ""81 lawsuits that were filed in connection with the Nov. 3, 2020 presidential election."" Droz and a team of volunteers spearheaded that work and published their findings in a public spreadsheet. It includes cases spanning from March to December 2020 and links to copies of lawsuits published by the Healthy Elections Project, an initiative from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Between November and December, Trump and his allies lost dozens of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election results. Some cases were rejected because plaintiffs failed to prove widespread voter fraud. In a statement on his website, Droz conceded that the majority of the cases he logged have nothing to do with allegations of voter fraud. The Epoch Times also included that disclaimer in its article. ""The article (and our former and current headlines) clearly indicate that these are lawsuits related to the election, not about the election results,"" the Epoch Times’ public relations team wrote in an email. ""And the article (and the Droz spreadsheet) indicate the cases involve Trump or the GOP — a lawsuit's outcome can be favorable to Trump even if he is not the plaintiff."" In his spreadsheet, Droz found that ""Trump and/or the GOP plaintiff prevailed in 15 out of 21 cases decided on the merits"" related to the election. ""Decided on merits"" a note in the spreadsheet says, means the plaintiff ""was able to argue the facts of the case, and, if applicable, given opportunity to present evidence via discovery.""  That’s more or less how the Cornell Legal Information Institute defines the term. The opposite of adjudicating cases on their merits is deciding them on procedural grounds. For example, some lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies were dismissed because they contained errors or faced jurisdictional problems. Of the 15 cases in Droz’s spreadsheet, three were filed on or after Election Day. None of them involved allegations of voter fraud.  And of those three, just one case, filed Nov. 4, had to do with the election results. It centered on reducing the amount of time Pennsylvania voters had to fix errors on their mail-in ballots. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were granted an injunction against the secretary of state to prevent extending the proof of ID period by three days. The matter involved a small number of ballots that didn’t change the outcome. ""Trump won one case in the post-election and lost 64,"" said Marc Elias, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm who has represented Democrats in the lawsuits. Trump has not prevailed in any cases that allege voter fraud or seek to overturn the election results. ""The key place to challenge election results is in state court election contests. Trump and his allies brought a few and lost because he did not have evidence of any error or wrongdoing in any state that could have affected the results,"" said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. ""Those cases are hard to win by design, and so Trump and his allies shifted to other suits, such as those in federal court, making legally dubious claims."" Trump and his allies have only won one lawsuit since Election Day. But what about those filed prior to Nov. 3? We looked at each of the lawsuits that Droz noted as a victory for Trump on their merits, dating back to March 2020. Among them are cases like RNC v. Miller and Texas v. Hollins, which blocked election officials from prepopulating mail ballots with voter information and sending applications to all registered voters. Other cases are not directly about Trump or his claims about mail ballots, such as a federal court’s decision to stay an injunction that delayed Arizona’s voter registration deadline by 18 days. ""What we are trying to do is to identify all lawsuits related to the 2020 presidential election,"" Droz said. ""In other words, these are not all directly about Trump. For example, most of them have to do with things like whether modified state election laws were changed legally.""But some of the cases Droz counted as wins for Trump and the GOP aren’t directly related to the general presidential election.  For example, Jefferson v. Dane County, filed in late March, sought to order an election official in Wisconsin to remove a Facebook post about the proper use of ""indefinitely confined"" status for voters requesting absentee ballots. Ritchie v. Polis, filed in May, had to do with whether a petition to put a measure on the ballot in Colorado had to be signed in the presence of a ballot circulator during the coronavirus pandemic. Among Droz’s tally of wins for ""Trump and/or the GOP plaintiff,"" the Trump campaign was a complainant on four successful election lawsuits, two of which were filed prior to Nov. 3.  Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said, numbers aside, the focus on cases decided on their merits paints a misleading picture of the Trump campaign’s election litigation.  ""The procedural dismissals aren’t all small things,"" Levitt said. ""Some of them are bad lawyering. But some of them are dismissals, because Trump supporters tried to challenge laws well over a year after they were passed, well after ballots had gone out to eligible voters who had the right to rely on the fact that the ballots they were receiving were lawful, and well after the election was over.""  The Epoch Times wrote Feb. 7 that Trump won ""two-thirds of election lawsuits where merits (were) considered."" That claim is not literally true. The Epoch Times revised its headline after we reached out. Trump and his allies have won one lawsuit related to the results of the 2020 election, and that case did not prove that widespread voter fraud affected the outcome. Judges across the political spectrum have rejected dozens of other cases filed after Nov. 3 that sought to overturn the election. Just because a case is dismissed on procedural grounds does not mean it wasn’t duly considered. While the body of the Epoch Times’ story contains some of that nuance, its previous headline did not.

Newsmax host falsely claims ‘only one person died’ at Capitol Jan. 6
","The night before the Senate began the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, Newsmax TV host Greg Kelly falsely claimed that only one person died Jan. 6 during the U.S. Capitol riot at the center of the push to convict Trump. ""They’ve been lying about so much, including, by the way, that five people died on Jan. 6, 2021,"" Kelly said Feb. 8. ""It's not true. Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt. Unarmed woman shot and killed by Capitol Police.""  Kelly was wrong about the Capitol siege’s human toll. A spokesperson for Newsmax declined to comment. In addition to Babbitt, three others died Jan. 6 from medical emergencies suffered during the riot, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed. A fifth person, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, died the next day after responding to the riot. Two other officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — D.C. police officer Jeffery Smith and Capitol Police officer Howard Liebengood — died by suicide in the weeks that followed, acting Metropolitan Police Chief Robert J. Contee III said Jan. 26 in testimony before Congress. The head of the Capitol Police officers’ union said about 140 officers were injured. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran and supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she climbed through a smashed door leading to the hallway outside the House chambers. Her death was captured on video. According to the New York Times and other news outlets, the three other Trump supporters who died during the events included 55-year-old Kevin Greeson of Alabama, who suffered a heart attack; 50-year-old Benjamin Philips of Pennsylvania, who suffered a stroke; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland of Georgia, who died as fellow rioters fought through a police line.  A friend who was with Boyland told WGCL-TV she was pinned to the ground and trampled by fellow rioters, which lines up with the New York Times’ reporting based on videos from the event that she ""died after losing consciousness in the crush of a pro-Trump mob."" An incident report published by Snopes said officers dispatched to the Capitol found her collapsed and receiving CPR. Contee reported all four deaths in a press conference Jan. 6. News reports from the day, including a fact-check from PolitiFact, also said four people had died in the violence. Capitol Police announced Sicknick’s death in a press release Jan. 7, writing that the officer died at roughly 9:30 p.m. that day ""due to injuries sustained while on-duty."" Sicknick was injured while ""physically engaging with protesters"" on Jan. 6, and he collapsed after he returned to his division office, the press release said. Investigations into Sicknick’s death are ongoing. Kelly said, ""It's not true (that five people died on Jan. 6). Only one person died on that day. You know who it was? The unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt."" That’s inaccurate. Four people died at the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, died the following day after he was injured in the violence. We rate Kelly’s statement False.

COVID-19 vaccines were not released to states until after approval
","In a YouTube video posted Jan. 16, and shared on Facebook, Dr. Lee Merritt, who owns a Nebraska clinic that offers tattoo removal and other services, casts doubt on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.  Merritt claims in an interview segment that the vaccine was sent to states before it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  ""This vaccine was rolled out to distribution centers before they even made a show of caring about the FDA approving it,"" she tells interviewer Alex Newman. ""It went out for distribution, I know in Nebraska, it was in the distribution center days before the FDA even said they were going to approve it.""  The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked into the timeline of the FDA’s approval of vaccines for emergency use, and when vaccine distribution began, and found no evidence for Merritt’s claim. We reached out to Merritt twice for any evidence of her claim, but did not hear back. Merritt, an orthopaedic surgeon, has spoken out against mask mandates, and has supported the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, which was touted by President Donald Trump as a possible COVID-19 treatment, has been the subject of several fact-checks by PolitiFact, and researchers have concluded that it’s not an effective treatment for COVID-19.  The FDA announced on Dec. 11 that it had approved the first vaccine, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech.   In Nebraska, the Department of Health and Human Services announced on Dec. 14 that the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine ""arrived in Nebraska today.""  In the same announcement, the state said that it expected to receive 4,875 doses of the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the day and 15,600 by week's end. On Dec. 21, Nebraska announced that it expected to receive the Moderna vaccine in the next week. The Moderna vaccine was approved by the FDA on Dec. 18.  The communications director for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, Khalilah LeGrand, confirmed to PolitiFact that no shipments of vaccine were received before approval, nor could officials order vaccine prior to approval.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website outlines how the vaccine approval and distribution process works. ""Distribution of FDA-authorized vaccines begin 24 hours after the Emergency Use Authorization,"" the site states. ""The first deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines began December 14, 2020."" HHS spokesman Bill Hall confirmed that no vaccines were distributed prior to FDA approval.   We could find no news coverage of any vaccines arriving in Nebraska before they were approved by the FDA.  Speaking at a news briefing on Dec. 12, the day after the FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, one of the federal government’s top vaccine distribution planners said that vaccines were being prepared for shipment. Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said: ""As I speak today, right now, vaccines are being packaged with a lot of emphasis on quality assurance. To that end, tomorrow morning, vaccines will start rolling from manufacturing to distribution hubs."" CNBC reported on how some of the vaccine distribution planning included sending protective gear for health care workers and inoculation supplies — but not the vaccine — to states ahead of FDA approval. These early shipments included needles, syringes and mixing vials. The advance planning also included building ""freezer farms"" to hold the vaccine, which requires cold storage.  Pfizer shipped vaccines from its Kalamazoo, Mich., factory after FDA approval and from a distribution facility in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., to states.  McKesson, which is distributing the Moderna vaccine, said that its shipping partners would deliver initial vaccine doses on Dec. 21, days after approval.  Merritt claimed that doses of COVID-19 vaccine arrived in distribution centers in Nebraska before it was approved by the FDA.  The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services announced that it received both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines after the dates of FDA approval. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that it releases vaccines for distribution 24 hours after they are approved. A top planner of the federal government’s vaccine development efforts said that the vaccine began shipping after it was approved.  We rate Merritt’s claim False.

Any Air Force plane ferrying the president is technically Air Force One
","On Friday, Feb. 5, President Joe Biden boarded Air Force One and flew to his home state of Delaware.  As images of the trip emerged, some social media users seized on the fact that Biden was taking a plane different from the one that often transported Donald Trump when he was president. ""Biden’s Air Force One is not the same as Trump’s Air Force One,"" reads the title of a video published Feb. 6 on Bitchute, which shows the photos of the different planes sandwiched between graphics that show the word ""LIE"" stamped across headlines declaring ""Biden Wins."" ""Media lied to you about Joe flying on AF1,"" reads a Feb. 7 Facebook post with a similar claim. ""Notice the difference... AF1 is in the top photo complete with seal. The bottom plane is a Boeing C-40 the one Joe flew on … used for high profile government officials to fly on but NOT the President. President flies on AF1 or Marine 1. Notice the little things... and you’ll catch them in their lies!""  These posts imply that Biden is not flying on Air Force One because he is not the real commander-in-chief, furthering a baseless conspiracy theory that the November election was not legitimate. This theory is not based in fact, and it rests on a flawed understanding of Air Force One.  Air Force One isn’t the name of a particular plane. It’s the air traffic control sign designating any Air Force aircraft carrying the president. In other words, any Air Force plane carrying the president is called Air Force One.  There are two types of planes typically designated for carrying the president: a Boeing VC-25A and a Boeing C-32. The VC-25A is the iconic military plane most commonly associated with Air Force One, while the C-32 is typically used for shorter domestic flights and flights to small airports that can’t support the much larger VC-25A.  Biden’s flight from Washington, D.C. to Delaware lasted only 25 minutes, so he took the C-32 plane. Images from Feb. 5 show him disembarking from the plane at Wilmington Airport.  Former President Donald Trump was frequently filmed and photographed taking the C-32 plane as well. So was President Barack Obama.  Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He was duly inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20. The day’s events were witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers. They were also broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.  Posts claim that ""Biden’s Air Force One is not the same as Trump’s Air Force One,"" which means that Biden is not the real president.  Any Air Force plane transporting the president is designated with the Air Force One call sign.  On a trip to Delaware, Biden took a small plane the president uses for short domestic flights and flights to small airports. Trump also took that plane when he was president. These posts are inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! RELATED: Biden took a private plane to his inauguration.

Cuomo’s claim about below-average nursing home deaths was right, but new data shows evolving picture
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo continues to defend his administration’s handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes following a high-profile independent investigation. Compared to the rest of the country, nursing home deaths linked to the virus are below average, Cuomo said. State Attorney General Letitia James revealed in a report on Jan. 28 that the death toll from the virus among residents of nursing homes had been undercounted in data released by the state Health Department. The report found that the Health Department had reported the overall number of COVID-19 deaths among all state residents accurately.  The administration had said it did not want to double count nursing home residents who died in hospitals. So their deaths in hospitals were not counted as part of the nursing home death toll. The administration has since said the numbers of people transferred from nursing homes to hospitals ""is an important data point.""  ""If you look at New York state, we have a lower percentage of deaths in nursing homes than other states,"" Cuomo said during a press briefing on Jan. 29. ""A third of all deaths in this nation are from nursing homes. New York state, we are only at about 28 percent - only. But we’re below the national average in number of deaths in nursing homes."" We approached the Cuomo administration for the source of its data.  The governor’s staff directed us to a statement from Dr. Howard Zucker, the state’s health commissioner, from Jan. 28.  In response to the attorney general’s report, Zucker cited data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan source of health information.   According to the Health Department, from March 1, 2020, to Jan. 19, 2021, there were 9,786 confirmed deaths of skilled nursing facility residents, including 5,957 in nursing facilities and 3,829 in hospitals. Zucker cautioned that the department’s audit is ongoing, but these figures represent audited data so far. The nursing home residents who died from COVID-19 account for 28 percent of New York’s 34,742 confirmed fatalities, which is below the national average, Zucker said.    Zucker compared KFF data to CDC data to calculate that nationally 35 percent of total deaths affect nursing home residents.  Across the country, KFF’s tally is 146,888 long-term care fatalities, as of Jan. 22. This figure includes some nursing home staff members, as well as residents, in the areas of the country where this data is reported. The CDC reported 423,519 total deaths as of Jan. 26, 2021.  Adding the number of deaths of nursing home residents who had presumed cases of COVID-19 -- 2,957 -- brings the New York percentage of nursing home deaths to 29.8 percent, still below the national average, Zucker said.  We asked a senior policy analyst with KFF about Cuomo’s claim.  Priya Chidambaram, who studies COVID-19 in nursing homes, told PolitiFact on Feb. 5 that Cuomo’s claim is consistent with the available data.  ""No matter which way you cut it, the New York share does appear to be lower than the national average,"" Chidambaram said.   In October, we fact-checked Cuomo’s claim that New York was ""No. 46 out of 50 states... we're 46th in terms of percentage of deaths in nursing homes,"" and found it to be Mostly False. That’s because Cuomo was comparing New York to other states while not releasing data about deaths of nursing home residents in hospitals, which would have changed New York’s ranking.  KFF also warns that because states report data differently, ""data cannot be compared between states.""   Comparing New York to a national average ""is a more fair reading of where New York ranks,"" Chidambaram said.  We also spoke with Robert Applebaum, a gerontology professor who tracks COVID-19 nursing home data at Miami University, which has a partnership with AARP.   ""I would say that our data continued to show that New York state deaths are on average, per hundred, below the national average by a fair amount,"" Applebaum said.  People who study the virus in nursing homes warn that data can be incomplete. States have different procedures for collecting and reporting data, such as collecting information about residents and staff, as well as the types of care facilities that are included.  The Covid Tracking Project, an independent research initiative, found that as of Jan. 28, the last data release before Cuomo’s statement, 157,069 long-term care residents, including assisted living facilities, and 423,645 people had died of the virus nationwide, presumed and confirmed cases. Long-term care residents represent 37 percent of total deaths in this case. In New York, 25.2 percent of total deaths involved long-term care residents, according to the Covid Tracking Project, though researchers caution that the data could represent an undercount.   A week after Cuomo made his statement, the New York numbers changed significantly.  The Cuomo administration released more data, through Feb. 4, about COVID-19-related deaths of people who lived in nursing homes. Presumed and confirmed virus-related deaths total 13,163, according to an analysis from the Empire Center, a conservative think tank that sued the administration for nursing home data. On Feb. 5, Cuomo announced overall deaths totaled 35,920, meaning the 36.6 percent of virus deaths were related to nursing homes. The Covid Tracking Project’s national average of deaths of long-term care facility residents, as of Feb. 7, was 36 percent. KFF calculated the national average of long-term care deaths as a percentage of total deaths at 37 percent, as of Feb. 8.     At PolitiFact, we base our rulings on information available at the time the person we are fact-checking made the statement.  Cuomo said that New York’s coronavirus-related death toll of nursing home residents was below the national average. Nationally, long-term care residents account for about 37 percent of COVID-19 deaths, according to KFF.  Data from KFF, the federal government and New York state show that New York’s nursing home-related deaths, as a percentage of overall COVID-19 deaths, were below the national average at the time of Cuomo’s claim. Since then, new data about the deaths of all nursing home residents, regardless of where they died, raised the percentage of nursing home residents among the state's COVID-19 fatalities. It is still slightly below the national average calculated by KFF. While his statement is accurate, there are still inconsistencies among the states in how they calculate their nursing home data, and that needs to be taken into account. So we rate Cuomo’s claim Mostly True.   ",/factchecks/2021/feb/09/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-claim-about-new-yorks-below-average-nursing/
