Dan Patrick says Border Patrol apprehends more immigrants a week than there are babies born in Texas
","State Sen. Dan Patrick put a numerical twist on the U.S.-Mexico border situation, saying that more border crossers are being apprehended than babies are being born in Texas. In a July 21, 2014, appearance on Laura Ingraham’s radio program, Patrick, the 2014 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, said: ""Just two weeks ago, we apprehended almost 10,000 people crossing the border--in one week, Laura."" After explanation about those numbers, Patrick continued, ""If we apprehend eight or nine thousand a week, that’s more people than are born in Texas each week."" Ingraham drew in her breath--and we wondered about Patrick’s border apprehensions and Texas births comparison. To our inquiry, Patrick campaign spokesman Alejandro Garcia said by phone Patrick picked up on the comparison from a briefing by state officials when he was in the Rio Grande Valley in June 2014. The comparison, Garcia said, illustrates the seriousness of border apprehensions. By email, Garcia pointed us to a U.S. Border Patrol chart showing annual apprehensions in the Southwest Border sector, meaning the southern border running from Brownsville to San Diego. In the federal fiscal year that ran through September 2013, there were 414,397 apprehensions in the sector, counting 243,550 along the Texas portion of the border, according to the chart. (As we’ve noted before, an ""apprehension"" is an arrest for being in the United States without authorization, but it’s worth noting the number of people detained will be smaller because some individuals are arrested more than once.) Garcia also noted a Texas Department of State Health Services web page indicating that in 2010, 385,746 babies were born in the state So, U.S-Mexico border apprehensions in 2012-13 outnumbered Texas births in 2010. Up-to-date data Recognizing this information didn’t enable an apples-to-apples comparison -- the births occurred three years before the apprehensions -- we looked for the latest available information on apprehensions and births. By email, Christine Mann of the Texas Department of State of Health Services gave us ""provisional"" monthly birth tallies for 2013 and 2014. Separately, Doug Mosier, an El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman, provided a chart indicating monthly apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border from October 2012 through early September 2014. This enabled us to compare apprehensions and births by month for all of 2013 and the first six months of 2014. Result: Apprehensions outnumbered births in 11 of the 18 months including the latest months, February through June 2014. Texas births outnumbered apprehensions in January 2013; July through September 2013; and November 2013 through January 2014. For the sake of gauging Patrick’s claim over the latest full year of data available when he spoke, we looked at totals covering July 2013 through June 2014. In those months, there were about 393,299 births in Texas, according to the state. Meantime, the Border Patrol tallied 480,404 apprehensions. But monthly apprehensions fluctuated considerably, ranging from a low of 28,671 in January 2014 to a high of 60,689 in May 2014 (when 17,888 apprehended immigrants were 17 years old or younger). Of note, Texas births outnumbered apprehensions in the border region in half the months, most recently January 2014 when the 33,089 births compared to 28,671 apprehensions. So, apprehensions outnumbered births in the 12 months by 87,105, or 22 percent. By our calculation, that is, there were an average of 9,213 weekly apprehensions and 7,543 Texas weekly births. Footnote: Apprehensions outnumbering Texas births looks like a new development. For instance in the federal fiscal year of 2012, 380,140 babies were born in Texas while the Border Patrol had 356,873 apprehensions near the southwestern border. The same was so in fiscal 2011, when 380,481 children were born in Texas and the Border Patrol apprehended 327,577. Divide that down into a weekly rate, and in both years, births in Texas outnumbered apprehensions along the Mexico border. Our ruling Patrick said each week, more people are apprehended after entering the U.S. by illegally crossing the Mexico/U.S. border than are born in Texas. According to state and federal figures, that was so in each of the five months preceding Patrick’s radio interview. It’s worth noting that when apprehensions sufficiently decrease -- as in six of the previous seven months -- this claim wouldn’t hold. This claim was solid when Patrick spoke. We rate it True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

McCain: Obama never said he wanted to leave troops in Iraq
","Questions about what President Barack Obama should do in Iraq now have lately been overshadowed by another question: Should Obama have left troops in Iraq after the war ended? Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has advocated for keeping residual forces in the country since he visited its capital, Baghdad, in late 2008 -- right after losing the presidential election to Obama. And he continues to argue that Obama made the wrong decision to remove all American troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. McCain repeated this point on Sept. 10, appearing on several news shows after Obama announced his strategy to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- the militant Islamic group that has taken control of several cities in Iraq and has beheaded two American journalists. On CNN, he sparred with former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney said the decision to withdraw had been ""the right approach"" and said the Iraqi government had played a role in that decision. ""You know, Mr. Carney, you are again saying facts that are patently false,"" McCain said. ""The fact is, because (Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.) and I, and (former Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.) were in Baghdad. (The Iraqis) wanted a residual force. The president has never made a statement, during that or after, that he wanted a residual force left behind."" It’s impossible to know for certain what the Iraqi government wanted, and we have limited information about conversations that happened behind closed doors in the White House. But we can check what Obama said publicly about leaving troops behind. As far as we can tell, McCain’s right. Throughout the first few years of his presidency, Obama did not make a public statement in which he clearly expressed that he wanted to keep troops in Iraq after the agreed upon withdrawal date. Promises, promises First, some background. Ending the war in Iraq was one of Obama’s principal campaign promises, and he kept that promise by removing combat troops by the end of 2010 and all other troops by the end of 2011. Obama announced his own draw-down plans a month after taking office. ""Let me say this as plainly as I can: By Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,"" he said Feb. 27, 2009. He also said he would keep between 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel there through the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military and for counterterrorism purposes. The 2011 deadline was spelled out in a 2008 Status of Forces Agreement between the George W. Bush administration and that of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki (who recently stepped down). What matters for this fact-check is what happened to American troops in Iraq after Jan. 1, 2012. There was public debate among leaders on that issue throughout 2011. Military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size, though they considered leaving up to 10,000 troops -- a controversial pitch that would have required approval from Iraq’s divided government to change the 2008 agreement. However, the New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of a 10,000-person force shrank before negotiations failed altogether. According to the New York Times, ""the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16’s."" But this was all behind closed doors and only came out later, so let’s look at what Obama said publicly. Talking points Although some White House officials spoke to the media anonymously about the potential to keep residual forces in Iraq, we found no circumstance in which Obama himself talked about this as a possibility. And if he had, it would have clashed with his usual talking points. We read quite a few of Obama’s speeches and remarks from 2009, 2010 and 2011, and he repeatedly touted the complete removal of combat troops and the upcoming withdrawal of all remaining forces. Here’s a sampling: In a speech at Cairo University in 2009, Obama said, ""Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012."" In August 2010, he announced the removal of all combat troops from his Oval Office desk. Then he said, ""Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year."" Almost exactly a year later, in August 2011, at the American Legion Conference, he said, ""Having ended our combat mission in Iraq and removed more than 100,000 troops so far, we’ll remove the rest of our troops by the end of this year, and we will end that war."" And on Oct. 21, 2011, following the final negotiations with Maliki, Obama said, ""Last year, I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq. And to date, we’ve removed more than 100,000 troops. … So today, I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America’s war in Iraq will be over."" A spokeswoman with the National Security Council did, though, point us to Obama’s president-elect platform from 2008, which said, ""a residual force will remain in Iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter-terrorism missions against al Qaeda in Iraq and protect American diplomatic and civilian personnel."" However, it’s possible that this was referring to the transitional forces that would stay between the end of the combat mission in 2010 and the complete withdrawal in 2011. Obama also said in a June 19, 2014, press conference, ""We offered a modest residual force to help continue to train and advise Iraqi security forces."" But as far as we can tell, if this is the case, he did not talk about this to the public during the negotiations. In fact, Carney, who was Obama’s press secretary then, said something of the opposite to the press. Throughout the summer of 2011, Carney told reporters that they would consider leaving forces in Iraq if, and only if, the Iraqi government requested it. But otherwise, they would go ahead with the agreed upon plan and leave by the end of 2011. ""We continue to work under the status of forces agreement that we have with the Iraqi government, that will result in full withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of this year,"" Carney said in August 2011, in response to a question of whether or not the withdrawal was slowing down. ""We have said in the past that we will listen to -- consider any request that the Iraqi government might have to further our engagement with Iraq militarily, just in terms of what we might do there. But that has not been forthcoming, and we are on track to withdraw by the end of the year."" Our ruling McCain said Obama ""has never made a statement ... that he wanted a residual force left (in Iraq)."" Obama’s president-elect platform made a vague comment about leaving residual forces, and it seems that the White House -- behind closed doors -- considered it extensively. But we found no public statements of Obama saying he wanted to leave troops in Iraq past the agreed upon withdrawal date in the months leading up the war’s end. He repeatedly asserted that troops would be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. McCain’s claim is accurate but requires additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/12/john-mccain/mccain-obama-never-said-he-wanted-leave-troops-ira/

Matt Mackowiak overshoots on what Texas spends on public education
","Calling how Texas funds its schools a ""supercharged"" topic for the 2015 Legislature, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak questioned a Democratic state district judge’s decision finding the state’s finance method unconstitutional. In a Sept. 8, 2014, opinion column in the Austin American-Statesman, Mackowiak asked how much is enough to spend on education. He continued: ""The Dallas Morning News reports that ‘Texas spends nearly $60 billion a year on its schools, which includes billions in federal funding and local property tax revenue.’ Texas has five million students in public schools. So,"" Mackowiak wrote, ""we spend an average of $12,000 per pupil per year. That is more than some four-year colleges. Is that not sufficient?"" A reader asked us to check his per-pupil figure. By email, Mackowiak confirmed he took the total spending mentioned in the Morning News and divided that by 5 million to get his per-student estimate. Curiously, the News story included a chart presenting a per-student Texas spending figure, attributed to the Legislative Budget Board, of $5,809 statewide for 2013-14. By email, a board staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, said the figure represents what the state in 2013 expected school districts to spend in state and local revenue on general operations in the fiscal year through September 2014. A May 2013 chart posted online by the budget board lists predicted per-student expenditures for each district; the Austin district, for instance, was expected to spend $6,220 per student. Then again, DeSilva said the figure, incorporating school funding decisions by the 2013 Legislature, did not add in other funding such as federal aid or state grants not part of the state Foundation School Program, the main way state aid flows to schools. There are various ways to estimate spending per student. A teacher lobby group, the National Education Association, annually estimates combined state and local school spending. In its latest report, released in March 2014, the association said Texas schools spent an average of $8,275 per student enrolled in the fall of the 2012-13 school year. That was the fifth-lowest amount among the states; Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah and Arizona spent less while nationally the average was $10,938 per student, the group said. According to another chart in the report, Texas was expected to spend at least $8,399 per student in 2013-14. By email, an association analyst, Robert Glenn, said the presented figures took into account state, federal and local spending on general operations, but excluded capital outlays for buildings and equipment and interest on school debt. The excluded items, Glenn said, are ""programs that are not part of the regular public elementary and secondary school program."" Separately, we asked the Texas Education Agency about per-student spending. By email, spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency chart indicating that in 2012-13, the latest available year of actual expenditure data, Texas schools spent $10,549 per student from state, local and federal sources. That year, 5,057,960 students attended the public schools. For another perspective, we turned to a former TEA analyst, Lynn Moak, a partner in an Austin firm that advises school districts. By email, Moak suggested wrinkles in most of the per-student spending figures posted by the TEA. While the state reported $61.2 billion in total disbursements for public schools in 2012-13, or $12,106 per pupil, Moak said, about $7.3 billion of that didn’t reflect in-school spending. The rolled-in dollars, he said, included funds transferred among districts for equity purposes; money used to refinance bonds and lower interest costs; and charges for districts buying services from other districts. Another spending figure on the agency web page, $53.4 billion, or $10,549 per pupil, Moak said, would be a more accurate base for education spending -- though that too has weaknesses, he said, in that nearly $11 billion of the total went to debt service or capital outlays as in funds that could only be spent for building or equipping facilities or for interest and principal payments on school facilities, again not direct in-school spending. ""A portion of this amount is also double-counted over time because principal repayments represent  the same funds used for capital outlay,"" Moak wrote. Subtract the capital and debt expenditures, Moak said, and operating expenditures are reflected in another total on the web page, $42.6 billion, or $8,419 per pupil. Finally, Moak said, federal aid to the schools is usually restricted to certain programs. If most such categorical aid is left out, he said, education spending drops to $36 billion, a result based on combining $30 million in payroll costs and $6 million in other operating costs, for $7,127 per student. We also asked the Texas Association of School Business Officials, which says it’s ""dedicated to being the trusted resource for school finance and operations in Texas,"" to consider this topic. By email, the group’s executive director, Tracy Ginsburg, similarly said she wouldn’t generally count debt service and capital costs into average spending comparisons partly because, she said, such decisions reflect voter approval of bonds in individual districts. Ginsburg said she would focus on the $8,327 per pupil figure shown by the TEA for average total operating expenditures, which takes into account the salary and benefits of school employees and the purchase of supplies, materials and utility costs. Our ruling Mackowiak said Texas spends $12,000 per student on its public schools. Mackowiak had a way to reach his figure, but he overshot. Authoritative calculations suggest spending has been running closer to $7,100 to $8,500 per student or so. We rate the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Congress', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'PunditFact', 'Maria Cardona ']","
Liberal pundit: GOP has 'worst reputation in American polling of any political party in history'
","On CNN’s State of the Union Sept. 7, the political roundtable never strayed far from talk of the upcoming midterm elections. By most accounts, Republicans stand a good chance to retake the Senate. But Democratic strategist Maria Cardona argued that Republicans aren’t actually in the best shape. ""Right now we're talking about Democrats perhaps keeping the Senate,"" Cardona said. ""Five months ago, Republicans were swearing up and down that they were going to take over the Senate."" ""So, let's also keep in mind that in all of these districts and states the Republican Party has the worst reputation in American polling of any political party in history."" That’s a big claim, so we wanted to check where the current iteration of the Republican Party stands in relation to American polling history. Party favors Cardona told us that she took her talking point ""from an aggregate of polls from the last year where polling for Congress in general has been at historic lows."" ""In most of those polls, the Republican Party is polling at much lower levels than the Democratic Party,"" Cardona said. ""Polling at much lower levels"" in Cardona’s case refers to the ""favorable/not favorable"" rating of Republicans. There are other ways to ask how poll respondents how they feel about parties -- a poll paid for by NBC and Wall Street Journal, for instance, asks about positive and negative impressions. But we think the favorable/not favorable measure is widely understood and accepted. And by that measure, the Republican Party recently did hit a record low. In the October 2013 Gallup poll, conducted during the government shutdown, 28 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of Republicans while 62 percent said they had an unfavorable view. The results were both a record low for a favorability rating and a record high for an unfavorability rating since Gallup began asking the question in 1992, among Democrats or Republicans. Likewise, the Pew Research Center’s lowest recorded favorability and highest recorded unfavorability belong to the Republican Party, in two separate 2013 polls. Pew’s data, like Gallup’s, goes back to 1992. CNN reported a record low for both Republican and Democratic favorability (32 and 43 percent, respectively) in October 2013, although we could only find CNN data going back to 2006. For context, the same Gallup poll that recorded record unfavorability for Republicans showed 43 percent favorability for Democrats against 49 percent unfavorability -- better, but still bad. It's important to note that the polls have shifted in the past year, however, and Republicans have bounced back from their low watermark. Gallup’s April 2014 poll had Republican favorability at 34 percent against 59 percent unfavorability. The Democratic Party also polled slightly better than it did in October, with 44 percent favorability and 50 percent unfavorability. Pew’s most recent poll also showed a similar improvement for Republicans, with Democratic favorability and unfavorability holding steady. As far as we can tell, CNN hasn’t asked the favorability question since October. Polling history is recent history ""In history,"" in our minds, implies a period of time longer than just the last two decades. But looking at political parties’ reputations further back is difficult. Scientific polling -- meaning polls with random sampling -- started in earnest in the mid 1930s, when George Gallup founded the American Institute of Public Opinion. Gallup’s innovation was to apply statistical methods from the social sciences to the more informal surveys that had existed long prior, and which often gave unreliable results. Polling then, though, was nowhere near as big as it is today. ""From the mid 1930s to the early 1970s, there were only a few pollsters in the business releasing public polls,"" said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Those polls used mostly in-person sampling, which isn’t completely comparable to the telephone sampling done today, Bowman added. Bowman told us that there’s no easy analogue from those early polls to the ""favorable/unfavorable"" question asked today, but noted that the post-depression period, the mid 1970s, and the early 1980s were all marked by a low public opinion of the political parties and government in general. Our ruling Arguing that the Democrats stand a chance in the upcoming midterm elections, Cardona said, ""The Republican Party has the worst reputation in American polling of any political party in history."" According to Gallup, CNN, and Pew, that was case roughly a year ago -- but now now. In late 2013, Gallup had Republican favorability at 28 percent, and Republican unfavorability at 62 percent. Both of those are records for either major party. There are two major caveats, though. First, polls only started asking the ""favorable/unfavorable"" question about political parties in 1992, and there’s no good analogue before then; looking back to 1992 doesn’t quite warrant ""in history,"" as Cardona phrased her claim. Second, the Republican Party has bounced back from their low watermark in the most recent polls. Cardona's claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/12/maria-cardona/liberal-pundit-gop-has-worst-reputation-american-p/

Buddy Cianci says Jorge Elorza wants to impose a municipal income tax for Providence
","Political candidates seldom recommend raising taxes or implementing new ones. So it caught our ear when Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr., the independent running for mayor of Providence, said during an interview on WHJJ-AM radio that one of his opponents, Democrat Jorge Elorza, wants to impose a municipal income tax. During the interview, host Ron St. Pierre asked Cianci, a former mayor of the city, a popular talk show host and twice-convicted felon, how he would try to get undecided voters to consider him. (St. Pierre previously worked with Cianci on his WPRO-AM talk-show.) ""Just run a good campaign and talk about the issues and talk about what the city of Providence can be and it should be a learning experience for the city,"" Cianci said. Then he added, ""My opponent, for instance, proposes a municipal income tax. . . . He wants to impose a municipal income tax. I think the last thing the City of Providence needs is another tax. It’s going to be simple in this election. If you vote for Elorza, you want an income tax."" A municipal income tax would be a first for Rhode Island. We wanted to see if Elorza really wants to impose such a tax. During Elorza's successful primary campaign, one of his fellow Democrats, Brett Smiley, criticized Elorza for the same reason. On Aug. 3, Smiley posted a YouTube video of a July 31 interview, in which Elorza, speaking before a group of progressive Democrats, pledges to advocate for more state aid for Providence. Then he says, ""In conversations that we've had before, I've mentioned that I am very much in support of a municipal income tax."" Cianci told us that was the video he was relying on. But in the 44-second clip, Elorza also makes it clear that he supports the idea of using a municipal income tax to replace other taxes. He never says he’s proposing it nor wants to impose it. ""It's been tried in many, many cities throughout the country and it's functioning effectively and it's much more progressive than what we have right now, where folks are paying so much for car taxes, real estate taxes and so many other taxes,"" he said. ""So I certainly am committed and I certainly support more progressive tax policies."" (A progressive tax is designed to be less of a burden on the people who are least able to pay for it. In contrast, a regressive tax, such as a sales tax, tends to place a greater burden on people who are least able to pay.) We asked Cianci about the rest of Elorza's statement. Cianci said the video raised many unanswered questions about a municipal income tax, including which taxes it would replace. ""There are no facts. He's just saying he's considering it very strongly. The mere fact that he's proposing it is an anathema,"" said Cianci. ""We don't need new taxes. We need to lower the ones we have."" After PolitiFact Rhode Island began inquiring about the video, it was removed. Elorza told us his statement in the YouTube video was taken out of context. ""It’s absolutely been misconstrued. I have never proposed a municipal income tax. To say I proposed a municipal income tax is flat out wrong."" Elorza said that during the video interview, ""I had just finished saying I am not raising taxes … I was asked a direct question about how I felt about the municipal income tax. I said I’m supportive of the idea, supportive of the concept."" Elorza was unable to provide the full video, but he pointed to a statement he made in a six-item questionnaire from the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 18 in which he was asked if he would oppose the adoption of a municipal tax. It was the one question where he didn't check Yes or No. But he did offer this comment: ""Raising taxes in Providence is not an option, period. I have said this repeatedly throughout the campaign. Some states and municipalities around the country have adopted municipal income taxes as an alternative to raising revenues through property or excise taxes. ""I like the concept of a municipal income tax, but whether it makes sense for Providence is a different question. This type of sweeping reform is not a part of my platform, and I will not make it part of my agenda as Mayor."" Our ruling Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci said Jorge Elorza ""wants to impose a municipal income tax."" Elorza has said he favors the tax in the context of using it to replace other taxes that he regards as less fair. But he has also made it clear that raising taxes in the city is not an option and has said it would not be part of his agenda. We found no evidence that Elorza wants to impose a municipal income tax.

"['Georgia', 'Campaign Finance', 'Ending Spending Action Fund']","
Super PAC attacks Nunn fundraising blunder
","The super PAC Ending Spending Fund is broadcasting another attack ad against Michelle Nunn, a politically pedigreed Democrat hoping to succeed Republican Saxby Chambliss as a U.S. Senator from Georgia. This time, it’s a radio ad simulating a man-on-the street interview with a potential female voter. In the ad, the announcer says: ""According to news reports, she’s acknowledged allowing a convicted felon who is well known for his radical anti-American statements to actually hold a fundraiser for her."" He then asked the unidentified woman: ""Is there any wisdom in that thinking?"" ""I’m going to say ""None,"" the woman responds. It’s part of a new campaign by Ending Spending that plays off Nunn’s well-known name. Her father, Sam Nunn was a respected moderate Democrat in the U.S. Senate for 24 years, from 1972 to 1997, who some considered White House or vice presidential material. The ad follows the theme of the super PAC’s new website, www.AbsolutelyNunn.com, which answers the question, is there any reason for Georgians to vote for her? But, PolitiFact Georgia wondered, is Nunn working with felons to win office? First, let’s look at Ending Spending Action Fund, formed by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. As of Sept. 11, the group has spent nearly $2.8 million -- more than any other outside group -- on Georgia’s Senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org. The PAC favors Nunn’s GOP opponent, businessman David Perdue. Some of its money paid for ads during the contentious Republican primary earlier this year. The race is being closely watched, and heavily funded, nationally because of the tight battle for control of the U.S. Senate. It’s also a priority for state Democrats eager to reclaim a major statewide office. The Nunn-Perdue battle has drawn the fifth-most money from outside groups in Congressional races across the nation this year, $12.4 million on ads from both sides. That brings us back to the ad, which is a reference to the July 8 Washington, D.C. fundraiser that featured Sam Nunn as a special guest. Virtual Murrell is listed as one of the co-hosts of the event, giving $2,600 to Nunn’s campaign for the honor. Guests paid at least $250 to the campaign to attend, according to the invitation. Two days after the fundraiser, the conservative National Review broke the story that Murrell, now a political consultant, had pleaded guilty in 1995 to accepting a bribe while working as an Oakland (Calif.) City councilman’s aide. He was sentenced to a year in prison. Nunn expressed surprise at the news of Murrell’s history, which also includes a stint in the 1960s as a leader in the Black Panther movement. Her campaign declined this week to make her available to discuss the fundraiser and its fallout. Spokesman Nathan Click referred us to a statement released in July, which said Nunn was unaware of Murrell’s record and promised to return contributions linked to him. Click, however, declined to confirm the exact amount of money the campaign said was returned or to disclose how much money was tied to Murrell. ""We didn't deposit any contributions from him or anything he raised for the event,"" Click said in a statement. We reached out to Murrell via email, to confirm that Nunn returned his donation and other he raised. He did not respond. We also contacted Brian Baker, Ending Spending’s president, who said Nunn has acknowledged Murrell, a convicted felon, co-hosted a fundraiser for her. That ""is exactly what we say in the ad,"" Baker said. ""The ad is 100 percent factual."" The event wasn’t the campaign’s only embarrassing moment.  In late August, a series of confidential memos were leaked, revealing Nunn’s campaign strategy and vulnerabilities. Ironically, those documents may support the campaign’s contention that Nunn didn’t know Murrell’s background. On page 57 of the 144-page document – after listing vulnerabilities such as being linked to President Obama and before several pages laying out campaign issues – is a category called ""Vetting. It takes up less than a quarter of the page, most notably this one-sentence paragraph: ""Currently, there are no plans to vet donors to the campaign,"" the memo said. Baker said finding out Murrell’s background ""didn’t require a complicated vetting process"" and was accessible with a basic Google search. PolitiFact Georgia has reviewed previous ad claims from the group, with mixed results. In August, Ending Spending ad’s claim that Michelle Nunn’s ""foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists"" earned a Mostly False. In July, we rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light around the time it laid off 90 workers due to its merger with the nonprofit Hands on Network. Available information on the latest claim suggests Ending Spending’s new ad uses guilt by association in a bid to suggest Nunn knowingly wooed an inflammatory ex-convict to raise cash for her Senate bid. Nunn has repeatedly said she did not know Murrell’s history when she attended the fundraiser. She pledged to give back the money he raised, though the campaign and Murrell have not confirmed how much was determined to be linked to Murrell. Most of the statement from the Ending Spending attack ad is correct. A convicted felon did host a fundraiser for Michelle Nunn. Nunn has said she did not know anything about the man’s criminal background. And there is evidence from a leaked memo that her campaign was not vetting donors. The claim is accurate. But it leaves out some relevant details. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/12/ending-spending-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-nunn-fundraising-blunder/

John McCain says Barack Obama went against national security team's advice to arm Syrian rebels
","President Barack Obama spoke from the White House on Sept. 10 to announce his overall strategy for dealing with the growing regional threat presented by the terrorist group the Islamic State. Part of that includes asking Congress to authorize funds to arm Syrian rebels. After, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had a terse exchange with former White House Press Secretary-turned-CNN contributor Jay Carney. McCain has supported arming Syrian opposition forces for years. ""I'm astounded that Mr. Carney should say that the Free Syrian Army is now stronger,"" McCain said, referring to moderate rebel fighters revolting against Syrian President Bashar al Assad. ""In fact, they have been badly damaged."" Carney responded, ""That's not what I said, senator. What I said is that we know a great deal more about the makeup of the opposition."" The back-and-forth continued. Carney eventually said, ""I think we have to agree to disagree on this."" But McCain wasn’t done. ""No, no, facts are stubborn things, Mr. Carney, and that is, his entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip these people, and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down,"" McCain said. ""Facts"" are stubborn, but they also get misconstrued. Is that the case here, or is McCain accurately retelling history? Mass protests broke out in Syria in March 2011 against Assad, a powerful dictator, as the Arab spring continued to spark unrest in the region. Over the next two years, the situation in the country would escalate dramatically, with Assad turning his army on his own people and Syrians in turn taking up arms against the regime. McCain and some of his congressional colleagues called for Obama to arm opposition groups, but the administration rejected those options. McCain’s office noted that in February 2013, outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, testified at a Senate Armed Services Committee that they supported a proposal to arm some rebels. ""Did you support the recommendation … that we provide weapons to the resistance in Syria?"" McCain asked. ""Did you support that?"" ""We did,"" Panetta replied. ""You did support that,"" McCain said. ""We did,"" Dempsey added. Until that point, those divisions between Panetta and Dempsey and the White House were not public. And they likely only emerged because Panetta was on the way out after serving four years in the administration. We learned more about this debate from another former member of the national security team, Hillary Clinton, thanks to her memoir Hard Choices, which recounted her time as secretary of state. In the book, Clinton said she was reluctant to support efforts to arm Syrian opposition forces. She was reminded of the Afghan fighters who, armed with American guns to take on the Soviet Union, went on to form al-Qaida. But in late-summer of 2012, she came to support a proposal put together by CIA director David Petraeus to provide some arms assistance and training to vetted groups so the United States would have an ally on the ground. ""The best I could say for it was that it was the least bad option among many even worse alternatives,"" she wrote. Obama, however, wasn’t convinced. ""He worried that arming the rebels was not likely to be enough to drive Assad from power and that with all the weapons already flowing into the country from Arab nations, our contributions would hardly be decisive,"" she said. In summary, the plan to arm rebels had the support of the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the CIA director and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That’s a pretty convincing argument for McCain. But Clinton goes on to note that, ""Despite high-level support from the National Security Council, some at the White House were skeptical. After all, the president had been elected in large part because of his opposition to the war in Iraq and his promise to bring troops home."" McCain said the ""entire National Security Team"" supported arming the rebels, but Clinton notes there was division within some quarters of the White House. Whether McCain exaggerated his point comes down to how you define the national security team. McCain’s spokesman said, ""The Senate-confirmed heads of the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and uniformed military are generally considered a president's national security team."" But the White House told PolitiFact that on ""his national security team are also numerous members of the (National Security Council) staff, like the deputy national security advisors, for example."" The National Security Council also by law includes the vice president, and meetings are regularly attended by the Secretary of the Treasury and the national security adviser, as well. Who is right? Both, said Dan Mahaffee, director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. Mahaffee said the members of the group McCain is referring to are generally called the ""principals"" who make up the core of the national security team. But other advisers, including those mentioned by the White House, are often powerful cogs in those meetings as well. President George W. Bush, for example, delegated a lot of national security authority to Vice President Dick Cheney, Mahaffee said, while President Richard Nixon made National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger his point man for those discussions. ""There are two columns you put these people in,"" Mahaffee said. ""The ones empowered by law to give advice, and the larger, more informal staff that is equally if not more weighty in this administration."" We don’t know what side many of those players fell on during the debate. The White House told us, ""We don’t discuss the details of our internal deliberations."" Our ruling McCain said Obama’s ""entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip (Syrian rebel forces), and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down."" Obama did go against the advice of four key players on his administration’s National Security Team, including Clinton (secretary of state), Petraeus (CIA director), Panetta (defense secretary), and Dempsey (chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). We also know from Clinton’s book that there was ""high-level support from the National Security Council."" There’s an element of uncertainty that Obama went against his ""entire"" team. We don’t know the positions of many of his advisers during those deliberations, including Vice President Joe Biden and his national security adviser. Their opinions are strong voices on Obama’s team.

Charlie Crist says Rick Scott supports employers denying women birth control
","Charlie Crist’s most recent TV attack labels Republican Gov. Rick Scott as ""extreme"" on women’s issues. A few days after he snagged the endorsement of Planned Parenthood PAC, Crist issued an ad showing a series of women attacking Scott’s record on abortion, birth control and equal pay for women. One of the claims in the ad is that Scott ""thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control."" PolitiFact Florida has fact-checked multiple claims about Crist’s record on abortion and we gave him a Half Flip for holding various positions on it throughout his career -- even before he switched parties to become a Democrat. Several media reports have also covered bills signed by Scott that limit access to abortion. Here we decided to fact-check Scott’s record on birth control. (Technically the Florida Democratic Party paid for the ad, but the Crist campaign announced the ad and promoted it.) Legal decisions about birth control during Scott’s tenure We reached out to Scott’s office and campaign and Crist’s campaign and searched news archives and found very few statements Scott made related to employers and birth control. Scott, a former health care executive, campaigned for governor on his opposition to President Barack Obama’s health care law in 2010. The law includes access to birth control for women; however, that was not at the root of Scott’s opposition to the law, which was more broadly about the federal government’s role and the individual mandate. We only found a couple of statements Scott made related to whether employers should be forced to provide birth control. The 2010 health care law required that most plans include birth control coverage without out-of-pocket costs. The Obama administration carved out a religious exemption for most churches and some parochial schools, finalized on Jan. 20, 2012. Certain religious entities, including Ave Maria University in Florida, opposed Obama’s rules. On Feb. 10, 2012, the White House announced a compromise: If a religious employer objected to providing birth control in its health plan, the employer would not have to pay for it, but the insurance company would pay. The next day, Newsmax TV asked Scott his thoughts about that decision while he attended the Conservative Political Action Conference. Scott said: ""This week what they did with regard to the Catholic Church and the contraceptives, it's an example [of] when government gets more involved in something they take away your rights. And this is, they are telling the Catholic Church what they have to buy. The government should not be telling us what type of insurance we should buy with our own money. The change they made makes no sense -- saying the insurance company is going to pay for it? That makes no sense. Money is going to be coming out of the Catholic institutions’ pocket to buy that insurance, so they are paying for it.""  About two weeks later, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi joined six other states in a lawsuit to challenge the birth control mandate arguing that it violated religious institutions' First Amendment rights. (Scott wasn’t a plaintiff.) In July 2012, a federal judge in Nebraska threw out the lawsuit arguing that the states failed to prove they would suffer immediate harm once that part of the law was enacted. The states appealed, but lost in 2013. On June 30, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies like Hobby Lobby that have religious objections can opt out of the birth control mandate. The companies opposed providing certain types of contraception that they believe is equivalent to inducing abortion, including morning-after pills and IUDs, while they didn’t oppose other methods of birth control. We asked a Scott campaign spokesman if Scott made any statements about Bondi’s lawsuit, the Hobby Lobby case, and in general if he thinks employers should be able to deny women birth control coverage. Spokesman Greg Blair pointed to one statement Scott made after the Hobby Lobby ruling, when a radio station reported that Scott said that the Supreme Court ""upheld our freedom of religion again this week."" ""Gov. Scott believes that people should have access to the contraception and health care they want, and he also believes in religious freedom,"" Blair told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Crist’s ad states that Scott ""thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control."" We struggled to find statements Scott made about employers and birth control. His spokesman didn't give us a denial when asked. We found a couple of statements which show he is against the federal government dictating to companies that they must provide birth control -- something that certain religious institutions opposed. It’s also worth noting that Scott doesn’t appear to be flat out against birth control but it’s clear that overall, he doesn’t like telling employers what they have to cover.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-supports-employers-d/
"['National', 'Islam', 'Foreign Policy', 'Terrorism', 'Rand Paul']","
Does a video show jihadists jumping into a U.S. embassy pool?
","In a recent op-ed for Time, Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul pushed back against hawks in Washington who write off his foreign-policy strategy as ""isolationist"" at a time of mounting international crises. ""Some pundits are surprised that I support destroying the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) militarily. They shouldn’t be,"" Paul wrote. ""I’ve said since I began public life that I am not an isolationist, nor am I an interventionist. I look at the world, and consider war, realistically and constitutionally."" Paul goes on to describe the state of world affairs during President Barack Obama’s term, including in Libya after the fall of ruler Muammar Gaddafi. ""Libya is a sanctuary and safe haven for training and arms for terrorists from Northern Africa to Syria,"" Paul said. ""Our deserted Embassy in Tripoli is controlled by militants. Jihadists today swim in our embassy pool."" Paul doubled down on that assertion Sept. 10 after Obama announced his strategy for dealing with the terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. We wondered: Are there really jihadists swimming in our embassy pool in Tripoli? So we decided to take a look. Are militants occupying and damaging the embassy? Since Gaddafi was ousted three years ago by rebel groups aided by French and American airstrikes, Libya has been in chaos, with a weak central government and warring secular and Islamic factions fighting for control of the state. Renewed violence in the Libyan capital Tripoli forced the United States and several allies, including France and Spain, to pull their embassy staffs out of the city in July, leaving behind unoccupied diplomatic posts. Paul’s statement refers to an amateur video posted on YouTube that surfaced in mid August. In it, a large group of Libyans are circled around a pool, while men jump from a second story balcony into the water. According to the New York Times, one man is heard saying, ""This used to be the American embassy. God is great!"" Since the video’s release — and prior to the publication of Paul’s op-ed — many more details have been reported about what exactly happened. For starters, the man in the video wrongly identified the compound as the ""American embassy."" On Twitter, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones wrote that the video ""appears to be a residential annex of the U.S. mission but cannot say definitively since not there."" The Associated Press and New York Times verified as much on Aug. 31. Jones added in another Twitter post: ""To my knowledge and per recent photos the U.S. Embassy Tripoli chancery and compound is now being safeguarded and has not been ransacked."" The U.S. embassy in Tripoli is about a half mile to a mile from the spot filmed. Are the men jihadists? More questionable is Paul’s assertion that those occupying the residential compound were ""jihadists."" Since the fall of Gaddafi, local militia groups, including some responsible for leading the revolution, have maintained law enforcement and government functions throughout the country. However, more recently, fighting between the various militias has escalated. In July, one militia group, the Dawn of Libya, captured the capital city and the Tripoli airport after weeks of fighting a rival militia from the city of Zintan. The Dawn of Libya also pushed Zintan forces out of the U.S. compound. It was after these fights that the video at the pool was taken. After the video was released, leaders for the Dawn of Libya sought to clear the air and assure the rest of the world that their efforts were intended to secure the embassy compounds, rather than to loot and destroy American property. They even invited embassy workers to return. (That’s not likely to happen.) Dawn of Libya leaders allowed Associated Press reporters to view the facilities. They reported little damage to the residences and that ""it didn’t appear that the villas in the compound had been ransacked."" A commander for the Dawn of Libya told them, ""This place is secure and under protection"" and their forces were guarding the embassy from other militia groups."" The State Department told the AP that the embassy in Tripoli was ""secure."" Experts we spoke with about Dawn of Libya cautioned that a lot of information and intelligence coming out of Libya is hazy. While ""jihadist"" is a vague term, it often suggests Islamic extremism that involves violence, terrorism and/or suicide attacks in the name of establishing a pure Islamic state. Under that definition, it would be a stretch to characterize Dawn of Libya as ""jihadists,"" experts said. ""That is a simplification that is absolutely ridiculous,"" said Karim Mezran, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Mezran said using the term for Dawn of Libya lumps together groups fighting for political reasons with dangerous, terrorist organizations. The Dawn of Libya is an umbrella group that includes several local Islamic militias, but the bulk of its forces are made up of rebel fighters from the city of Misrata. They undertook some of the fiercest fighting against Gaddafi's forces during the Libyan revolution. While they support the Islamist party in government, they are not considered extremists. In fact, the group has turned down requests to join an alliance with Ansar al-Sharia, the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks two years ago on the Benghazi compound that resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. Ansar al-Sharia is on the State Department terrorist watch list. Dawn of Libya is not. Ansar al-Sharia has called for the Dawn of Libya to unite under a ""common banner,"" said Wayne White, a former deputy director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research's Office of Analysis for the Near East and South Asia. ""They rebuffed it harshly, saying, ‘We oppose terrorism, we oppose extremism,’"" said White, now with the Middle East Institute. ""It has shunned what could have been a valuable alliance of combination with the east to prove it’s not a terrorist or extreme militia."" White added that it’s possible that within any organization there could be individuals or small groups of people who are extremists, and intelligence on the groups that have since joined the umbrella organization is incomplete. Still, history has shown the core group ""has not been known for wild, murderous"" attacks but rather as a ""very proud military force that took the brunt of Gaddafi's forces"" during the revolution, White said. Our ruling Paul said that in Tripoli, ""jihadists today swim in our embassy pool."" The claim stems from a video that shows members of the Dawn of Libya militia group diving into a pool. However, it has emerged that the pool wasn’t at the U.S. embassy, but rather at a residential annex a half-mile away. More critically, labeling the people in the video as ""jihadists"" is, at best, an exaggeration. The group in charge is a militia organization that is fighting a political and regional war, but it has rebuffed alliances with terrorist organizations. Reports from Tripoli suggest that the group has left the property largely intact, and U.S. officials have said the compound ""remains secure."" The average listener would not get that more nuanced impression from Paul’s comments, so we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/11/rand-paul/does-video-show-islamic-jihadists-jumping-us-embas/

Ted Cruz says SNL's Lorne Michaels could be jailed under Democratic-backed amendment
","In his brief time in Congress, first-term Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has attracted national attention for his rhetoric. On Sept. 9, 2014, Cruz gave a stemwinder of a floor speech, criticizing a proposed constitutional amendment backed by Democrats. The backers of the proposed amendment, S.J.Res.19, say it’s intended to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that loosened campaign-finance laws for corporations. They argue that the court’s ruling has opened a floodgate of campaign spending that threatens the democratic process. Cruz, however, argues that the proposed amendment severely threatens First Amendment protections that date back more than two centuries. Perhaps the most attention-getting portion of Cruz’s lengthy speech (which you can read in its entirety here) came when he suggested that Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of NBC’s long-running show Saturday Night Live, would be put at risk of imprisonment if the amendment were enacted: ""When I asked the senator from Minnesota (Al Franken, a former Saturday Night Live writer and actor) in the Senate Judiciary Committee, ‘Do you believe that Congress should have the constitutional authority to prohibit Saturday Night Live from making fun of politicians, the good senator promptly reassured me he had no intention of doing any such thing. But what we are debating is not the intentions of 100 senators. What we are debating is a constitutional amendment that 49 Democrats are proposing to be inserted into the Bill of Rights. ... ""What the amendment says is for any corporation, Congress would have the constitutional authority to prohibit it from engaging in political speech. Well, NBC, which airs Saturday Night Live, is a corporation. …  Congress would have the power to make it a criminal offense. Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician."" Political observers expect the amendment to fall well short of the two-thirds vote in the Senate that would be required before it went to the House (where it would need a two-thirds vote) and the states (where it would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states). So the fears Cruz expresses are probably moot. Still, many readers asked us to take a closer look at Cruz’s claim about Lorne Michaels and Saturday Night Live.  What the amendment says Let’s start by looking at the proposed amendment. Here are the key passages: ""Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections. … Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections. …  Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press."" Cruz’s argument Cruz, both in his speech and in a subsequent telephone interview with PolitiFact, made the case for why Michaels might have reason to worry for his freedom if the amendment were to be ratified. Among his points: • Reading the amendment literally, the SNL scenario closely fits its language. That is, a corporation (NBC) is spending money (to produce and air SNL) that could influence an election (it arguably has in the past, as in its characterization of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin). ""By any measure, NBC is a corporation,"" Cruz said in the interview. ""And the amendment says the government can prohibit such entities from spending money to influence elections."" In fact, Cruz also argued in the speech and the interview that a literal reading of the amendment also would permit restrictions on the speech of entities as diverse as movie studio Paramount Pictures, publisher Simon and Schuster, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the Sierra Club. ""Every one of these is a corporation,"" Cruz said. • SNL is unlikely to benefit from the proposal’s press-freedom exemption. While the amendment contains an exemption for freedom of the press, SNL is an entertainment show, Cruz noted, not part of NBC’s news division. ""I agree (the amendment) carves out a specific press exemption, but SNL is by no measure the press,"" Cruz told PolitiFact. • It doesn’t matter that the amendment’s backers promise that the amendment is narrowly targeted at campaign finance rather than political satire. What matters, Cruz counters, is how future generations of lawmakers will view it, once they have such powerful tools embedded in the Constitution. ""Lots of Democrats argue passionately, ‘We don’t intend to prohibit books or movies or Saturday Night Live,’ "" Cruz said in the interview. ""In all likelihood, Congress would not try to do so. But things can change. I am not content to entrust our free-speech rights to the good graces and whims of Congress and hope that politicians don’t abuse their power."" Indeed, Cruz noted that the facts at issue in the Citizens United case involved the ability of a non-profit corporation making a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. ""Democrats say it’s unrealistic, but we’ve already seen government go after a corporation making a movie about a politician."" What experts say Several legal experts we interviewed agreed that Cruz had a point. ""It’s quite obvious that, under this proposed amendment, Congress could pass a law prohibiting corporations and their agents from, say, supporting or opposing candidates during a broadcast other than a news program,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Congress would get free rein to legislate in this area."" Other scholars weren’t as gung-ho as Shapiro was but still agreed that Cruz’s scenario can’t be ruled out. ""Generally, if the government has the power to regulate some activity, it can impose civil liability or criminal penalties as it chooses,"" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. ""If the amendment were broadly construed, I would say it's possible."" And Andrew Koppelman, a Northwestern University law professor, said he sees what Cruz ""is getting at. Any criticism of a politician by something as expensive to produce as a TV show is spending money in a way that could influence elections."" That said, a number of the experts we contacted -- including some of those who acknowledged above that Cruz had a point -- consider the scenario more far-fetched than the senator lets on. Here are the two main reasons why: • Even after the amendment was in force, a lot would need to happen before any satirist felt the heat from prosecutors. Both chambers of Congress would need to pass a bill on this subject, and the president would have to sign it into law. Then, judges would have to agree wholeheartedly with the interpretation Cruz fears and uphold the law. And prosecutors would have to consider it a good use of their time to go after TV comedians or media outlets for speech violations. ""The government has many powers that could be used to do bad and stupid things,"" Roosevelt said. ""Congress could ban the sale of milk, for instance. Ordinarily we rely on the democratic political process to stop that."" Erwin Chemerinsky, the law school dean at the University of California-Irvine, said that while he opposes the proposed amendment, he believes that Cruz was ""engaged in hyperbole. It is not a reasonable way to interpret the amendment."" And Douglas W. Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor who served in the Justice Department under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, agreed. ""If the amendment referred to by Mr. Cruz could possibly be interpreted in the manner in which he described, it would be a triumph of fiction over language, and would be contrary to the well-established interpretive canon that one should certainly avoid interpreting statutes -- let alone other provisions in the Constitution -- in a manner that would negate their validity."" • Even if prosecutors started using their newly granted powers, it’s a stretch for Cruz to invoke the word ""jail."" In theory, it’s possible to go to prison for violations of campaign-finance law -- up to two years, plus fines, according to federal law. This existing law might well come into play under the SNL scenario, Cruz and his allies say. However, in U.S. history, examples of criminalizing speech itself are rare, and prison time is even rarer. Not counting examples of speech accompanied by other law-breaking behavior, such as trespassing, the experts we interviewed could only name the Sedition Act of 1798 and the Espionage Act of 1917 as examples. (Some would also include the trials of comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1960s, though Bruce’s cases involved speech that was allegedly obscene rather than political.) It’s important to note that these precedents, far from carrying judicial weight today, are now regretted and held up as cautionary tales. ""Contemporary doctrine repudiates these historical missteps,"" said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William and Mary. ""It would take nothing short of a revolutionary shift in judicial thinking to uphold any measure that criminalized pure political satire."" Cruz’s rebuttal Cruz acknowledged to PolitiFact that past history shows few prosecutions and prison terms for purely political speech. But that doesn’t comfort him, for one reason: All of this judicial and historical precedent protecting speech springs from the First Amendment as we know it, not the new reality that would be shaped by the amendment now being debated. Laws like the Sedition Act were ""patently unconstitutional,"" Cruz said in the interview. But the proposed amendment now being debated ""does not just reverse Citizens United, it goes much further than that. It was never the law previously that Congress could prohibit a corporation from speaking about politics."" Supporters of the amendment, he said, may ""point to case law upholding the First Amendment, but none of that matters, because a subsequent amendment would trump those rulings."" In this complicated debate, there’s only one thing that seems to be a pretty good bet, said Brett Kappel, a counsel at the law firm Arent Fox LLP. ""I’m sure SNL will be mocking Sen. Cruz"" on its next show, he said. Our ruling Cruz said that ""Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician."" Most experts we talked to agreed that the proposed amendment’s language left open the door to that possibility. But many of those same experts emphasized that prosecuting, much less imprisoning, a comedian for purely political speech would run counter to centuries of American tradition, and would face many obstacles at a variety of government levels and run headlong into popular sentiment. In the big picture, Cruz makes a persuasive case that it’s not a good idea to mess with the First Amendment. Still, his SNL scenario is far-fetched. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/11/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-snls-lorne-michaels-could-be-jailed-/

Facebook post claims U.S. flight canceled after 'terrorist dry run'
","A first-hand account of a supposed ""terrorist dry run"" on an American airplane is making its way around Facebook, with this July 29 post garnering over 90,000 shares. The account, written by a man named Tedd Petruna, describes how 11 passengers ""in full Muslim attire"" on AirTran Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston made such a ruckus that the flight was canceled. Petruna claims that one of the men called a stewardess an ""infidel dog,"" that two of the men were showing ""footage of a porno video they had taped the night before,"" and that all 11 men screamed at the flight crew in Arabic. Eventually, Petruna says, Transportation Security Administration agents searched the men’s bags, and that when they allowed them back on, so many passengers left the plane that the flight was canceled. ""The terrorists wanted to see how the TSA would handle"" them, Petruna wrote. Only Fox News reported that the flight was canceled, Petruna says, and even they covered up the real ""threat."" Spoiler alert: Petruna’s report is a hoax, and not a new one either. The plane in question flew Nov. 17, 2009. In this fact-check, we’ll explain this conspiracy theory’s origin, then debunk it again for good measure. Remember chain emails? We reached out to Dwayne Chassion, the man who posted Petruna’s report on Facebook verbatim as it appeared in 2009, but didn’t hear back. After we messaged him, Chassion deleted the post from his Facebook account. The day after Flight 297, Fox News published a brief article from the Associated Press noting that Flight 297 departed for Houston two and a half hours late. According to the AP, ""a crew member asked a passenger to turn off his phone,"" the passenger didn’t, and then the pilot returned the plane to the gate and ""asked (the passenger) to get off the plane."" Apparently, the man didn’t speak English -- he and his group of 11 others were travelling with a translator -- and was looking at pictures on either his phone or a camera. The full group of 13 men got off the plane when the pilot returned to the gate, but, after some discussion with airport officials, the men were allowed back on the plane. The two and a half hour delay pushed the original flight crew past mandated limits on hours worked. So AirTran subbed in a new flight crew and the plane left for Houston without incident -- minus 12 original passengers who, apparently uncomfortable, opted for later flights. That’s marginally similar to Petruna’s account, but the flight was not canceled and there certainly were no Arabic curses or homemade pornographic film. Within a few days of Flight 297, Petruna’s email began circulating. Eventually, it reached the websites of conservative pundits Glenn Beck and Debbie Schlussel. When AirTran got wind of Petruna’s email, they issued a point-by-point refutation. Long story short, Petruna wasn’t even on the plane because his connecting flight was late. Petruna later admitted that he embellished the details, and that he intended the account only for ""a few friends."" None of the other passengers corroborated Petruna’s assertion that the flight was canceled. One said that the passenger was Muslim -- but another said that he was actually speaking Spanish. According to a chaplain who arrived late but got on the plane after it returned to the gate, a passenger said that ""12 men of Middle Eastern appearance stood up and began dancing and singing in an Arabic dialect."" But no other passenger corroborated that, either. Either way, Flight 297 got off the ground, and although it may have been a tense flight, Petruna’s narrative was bogus then, and it’s bogus now. Our ruling Petruna’s 2009 account about a ""terrorist dry run"" leading to a canceled flight is going viral on Facebook. According to Petruna, 11 Muslim men were so uncooperative with their flight attendants that Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston was canceled. But the airline, other passengers from the flight, and the Associated Press all disagreed. Petruna, although originally scheduled for the flight, never boarded. In actuality, a man who may or may not have been of Muslim descent didn’t speak English well enough to understand the flight attendant’s instructions to turn off his phone. Petruna’s account is outdated and riddled with inaccuracies. This claim rates Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/sep/11/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-us-flight-canceled-after-terr/

Kissinger: Drones have killed more civilians than the bombing of Cambodia in the Vietnam War
","Henry Kissinger, secretary of state under President Richard Nixon and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has been making the media rounds to talk about his latest book. He’s mainly been asked for his take on the present: the war zones of Iraq and eastern Ukraine. But on NPR, the past came up. Kissinger was asked to defend his support for the U.S. bombing campaign in Cambodia between 1969 and 1973. For those who might not remember, while most of the fighting took place in Vietnam, as the tide shifted against the South Vietnamese and American forces, Nixon unleashed massive airstrikes in neighboring Cambodia to hit North Vietnamese soldiers and supply lines in that country. It was kept secret from the American public, and when news leaked out, Congress ultimately moved to shut it down. Kissinger deflected criticism of the campaign, saying President Barack Obama has ""hit more targets on a broader scale than the Nixon administration ever did."" ""I think the principle is essentially the same,"" Kissinger said. ""You attack locations where you believe people operate who are killing you. You do it in the most limited way possible. And I bet if one did an honest account, there were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks."" A reader suggested we run Kissinger’s comparative death tally through the Truth-o-Meter. We examined whether the Cambodian bombings killed fewer civilians than drones. The civilian death toll from both lacks precision, but by any estimates we could find, Kissinger is wrong. The only question is, by how much. Drone deaths Since 2004, it is tacitly accepted if not always officially acknowledged that missiles from American drones have targeted Taliban and al-Qaida forces in Pakistan and Yemen. The Defense Department does not report civilian casualties and so most of what we know comes through eyewitness and press reports. A handful of projects pull together the data to keep a running record, but we focused on the only two that cover every year since drones were deployed in 2004, and count civilian deaths in every country where America has used drones to lethal effect. The New America Foundation, a group backed by a wide range of supporters, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Netflix, keeps tallies on Pakistan and Yemen. It reports a maximum total number of civilian deaths of 394. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a private effort based in London, has Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia in its database. Its maximum estimate is 1,089. This includes civilian deaths in which researchers were unsure that drones were responsible. Most organizations report a range of casualties. For the purposes of this fact-check, we used only the largest estimates, so the highest number we could find was 1,089. Cambodian bombing deaths A single B-52 bomber could carry up to 108 bombs, each with 500 pounds of explosives. Hundreds of bombers flew thousands of missions over Cambodia. Based on data from the U.S. Air Force, history professor Ben Kiernan at Yale University reported that from 1969 to 1973, the United States dropped more than 470,000 tons of explosives on Cambodia. Other official estimates put the figure at over 500,000 tons. There is no firm accounting of the civilian deaths that brought. Kiernan told PunditFact, based on where the bombs fell, the tonnage, and anecdotal reports, he thinks the truth lies somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000. ""I believe the actual toll is closer to the upper limit of that range,"" Kiernan said. Getting an accurate count is difficult for reasons that go beyond the lack of any records. During the American bombing, a civil war raged in the country. Many people died in that fighting, quite apart from the American attacks. Worse, the deprivation and slaughter that followed under the Pol Pot regime killed in the neighborhood of a million people or more. Their deaths buried any hope of any census in the wake of the American air campaign. A 1980 CIA report calculated that 600,000 to 700,000 Cambodians lost their lives between 1970 and 1975.  But that would include the deaths of soldiers as well as civilians, from all causes, and the time period extended beyond the American bombing. Bruce Sharp, an independent researcher in Chicago, runs Mekong.net, a website focused on Cambodia before and after the war. Sharp said he thinks 50,000 is a safe minimum estimate. A University of Hawaii political scientist compiled a number of demographic studies and arrived at a minimum estimate of 30,000. Craig Etcheson has spent 35 years studying Cambodia. From 2006 to 2012, he served as the chief of investigations building charges of war crimes against former leaders in the Pol Pot regime. Etcheson is reluctant to quantify the civilian casualties but he thinks it is much less than many believe. ""I have conducted thousands of interviews with Cambodians who lived through that period of Cambodian history,"" Etcheson said. ""I can count on one hand the number of people who described first-hand knowledge of civilian deaths from U.S. bombing. This result does not seem consistent with estimates that hundreds of thousands of people were killed."" On the other hand, Etcheson said he was not specifically seeking an answer to the question of how many people died from American bombs. ""We know of two incidents in 1973 that were widely reported at the time, because they occurred in or near Republican territory, and not far from Phnom Penh – one at Neak Luong and one at Sa’ang – in which 300 to 400 civilians were killed in each of two unfortunate B-52 strikes,"" Etcheson said. Saying it was ""highly probable"" that this happened again in areas that westerners could not reach, Etcheson said his hunch is that ""it was probably more than 5,000 civilians killed by U.S. bombing."" The lowest figure we found came from retired Air Force intelligence officer Earl Tilford. Tilford served in the Strategic Air Command from 1971 to 1975 and had first-hand knowledge of the bombing campaigns. His latest book, Crosswinds, argues that much of the bombing during the Vietnam War was ineffective, and in the case of Cambodia, the military goal was distorted by bureaucratic in-fighting between the Air Force and the Navy. Tilford told PunditFact that the Air Force ran many missions simply to keep a higher profile in the military budgeting process. More sorties were taken as proof of military importance. Tilford recalled repeated bombing runs of a lake in central Cambodia. The B-52s literally dropped their payloads in the lake. The sole purpose was to keep the mission count high. The upshot? The total tonnage might have little relation to the damage inflicted. In addition, Tilford said most bombs were dropped in remote, thinly populated regions. ""I would say 4,000 to 5,000 civilians at most might have died,"" Tilford said. ""That’s a guess based on a knowledge of targets, of the topography and that there were just not that many civilians in those areas."" We should note that at the end of the bombing campaign in 1973, U.S. forces targeted more heavily populated centers and the sortie rate rose to 240 per day. Intelligence and press reports at the time told of entire villages being leveled. An April dispatch from United Press International quoted international relief workers who estimated that bombing raids had killed no fewer than 3,000 civilians in a few weeks. Cambodian government officials said tens of thousands had died. But reporters in Cambodia at the time bemoaned their inability to independently verify the impact of the American bombing. Still, in comparing the bombing deaths in Cambodia to the drone deaths today, Etcheson said his gut feeling is that ""Kissinger is, at best, engaging in wishful thinking on this."" Our ruling Kissinger said that he thought that an honest accounting would show that there were fewer civilian casualties from America’s bombing campaign in Cambodia than from drone attacks today. While the data lack precision in both cases, we see barely over 1,000 civilian deaths due to drones, and at least 4,000 civilian deaths due to American bombs in Cambodia (and the potential for many, many more). These figures represent a high estimate for drone deaths and the lowest guess for the Cambodian bombing in which half a million tons of bombs fell on the country over a span of four years. Kissinger couched his claim with a bit of a caveat, but a man of his experience and knowledge could reasonably be expected to understand the difference between the impact of highly targeted drone strikes and the blunt instrument of bombs dropped by B-52s. His statement departs from the most generous and common sense reading of the estimates. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/11/henry-kissinger/kissinger-drones-have-killed-more-civilians-bombin/

A projected state budget shortfall will cost Wisconsin residents $300 each?
","On the day a Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report made headlines that said the state faces a ""shortfall"" estimated at nearly $1.8 billion for its 2015-’17 budget, state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson put a personal price tag on the news. ""Over the next two years,"" the Milwaukee Democrat said in a Sept. 8, 2014 news release, ""this $1.8 billion deficit will cost individual Wisconsinites $300 each, or $1,200 for families of four."" Can a mere estimate trigger hard costs to taxpayers? The backdrop We rated Half True a related claim by state Sen. Alberta Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, that the state not only has no deficit but rather a $443 million surplus. Currently, the 20113-’15 state budget has that surplus, but by the end of the fiscal year, in June 2015, that’s projected by the bureau to turn into a $396 million shortfall. Here’s what we know from that earlier factcheck about the nonpartisan fiscal bureau’s $1.8 billion shortfall estimate for 2015-'17: 1. The projected $1.8 billion shortfall is an educated guess about future tax collections and demands for services. Shortfalls occur in large part because of changes in how much money comes in through income and sales tax collections, which are dependent on the economy, among other factors. 2. Again, the projection is not for the current budget cycle, but rather for the 2015-’17 biennium. A budget for 2015-’17 is for the winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election between Gov. Scott Walker and Democrat Mary Burke to propose and for the new Legislature to adopt during the first half of 2015. The $1.8 billion projected assumes no changes in revenue and no changes in spending -- in other words, continuing the operations of state government as they are now. The figure could turn out to be smaller or larger, depending on how tax collections and spending vary. Moreover, there’s no way to know how state officials will deal with any shortfall. It will be up to the next governor and the Legislature to decide whether tax increases or spending cuts are necessary. When Walker took office in January 2011, he faced a $2.5 billion shortfall, plus an increase of roughly $1.1 billion in funding requests from state agencies. That amounted to a $3.6 billion ""deficit,"" which Walker addressed through funding cuts and the Act 10 collective bargaining law. Later tax cuts have contributed to the projected 2015-'17 shortfall, which is sometimes referred to as the state’s ""structural deficit."" Larson’s evidence We asked Larson’s staff for evidence that the estimated shortfall will cost individuals $300 and families of four $1,200 over the next two years. A spokesman said the office simply divided the projected shortfall -- $1.766 billion -- by Wisconsin’s population -- 5,742,712, as of a 2013 U.S. census estimate. The result was $307 per person. And multiplying that by four, the figure was $1,230. But breaking down the size of the projected deficit to a per-person level in no way means individuals or families will have to pay those amounts. In fact, Larson spokesman Fred Ludwig told us Larson was referring to ""cost"" in a broad sense -- that a $1.8 billion shortfall would mean people would experience either tax increases or cuts in services. But as we’ve noted, the $1.8 billion estimate could change and there’s no way to know how state officials will respond to such a shortfall. Had a claim similar to Larson’s been made at the same stage four years ago, it would have also been wrong. One measure of how shortfalls can be addressed: Walker tackled the deficit in his first budget with big spending cuts and other changes, some of which saved taxpayers money.  Our rating Larson said: ""Over the next two years, this $1.8 billion deficit will cost individual Wisconsinites $300 each, or $1,200 for families of four."" No decisions will be made until well after the November 2014 elections on whether to raise revenue or cut spending in order to close the $1.8 billion gap, which is an estimate for the 2015-’17 state budget cycle. And it’s possible that, based on tax collections, the $1.8 billion figure could change.

Milwaukee County executive candidate says property tax exemptions can be granted to small businesses that move into the county
","
When political newcomer Chris Abele rolled out a job creation plan in January of 2011, he spiced it up with a tax break for new small businesses in Milwaukee County.

The philanthropist and candidate for Milwaukee County executive described it as a limited-time reward that would roll out the welcome mat for employers.

""What a county can do...is a property tax grace period for net new jobs,"" he told reporters.

His campaign added this in a written statement:  ""Chris will grant a short-term property tax exemption for new small business start-ups based on new net jobs created in Milwaukee County.""

The idea caught our attention because legal hurdles to such tax breaks are steep and well known.

Can Abele really do as his plan claims?

And, if it does pass legal muster, can the county executive do it himself?

We asked Abele press aide Brandon Lorenz for answers. He described the idea as bare bones, saying Abele has not fleshed out how it would work or explored all the legal angles.

But the tax, legal and legislative experts we talked to said Wisconsin’s state constitution and various state Supreme Court cases create major barriers to these kinds of special property tax exemptions.

The assessment from experts: Abele’s proposal almost certainly isn’t going to fly.

And there’s no way Milwaukee County can do it alone.

The central point in the analysis of Abele’s plan is the ""uniformity clause"" in the Wisconsin state constitution.

The clause was ""intended to prevent the legislature and local officials from granting preferential tax treatment to influential property owners and protect the citizen against unequal, and consequently unjust taxation,"" according to a 2002 Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau paper.

The author of that paper, reference bureau attorney Joseph Kreye, said Abele’s plan almost assuredly would run afoul of uniformity, and would almost certainly draw lawsuits from existing businesses that don’t get the tax break.

Kreye is the attorney who checks state bills for compliance with the uniformity clause.

Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group, agreed.

""If you are going to pick property tax payers and you favor some and not others, even though they are the same – both business, both homeowners or retail stores – the constitution says you can’t do that,"" Berry said.

Municipalities, such as Milwaukee County, are particularly hamstrung.

A League of Wisconsin Municipalities paper on the uniformity clause put it bluntly.

""Can a municipality grant a full or partial property tax exemption to a property owner or a business? No.""

The state Legislature can classify and exempt whole classes of property -- such as agriculture -- from uniform taxation, the League’s paper noted.

It added (italics ours): ""Unlike the state, municipalities do not have the power to create full or partial exemptions and a municipality may not lawfully grant a property tax break because such action would violate the uniformity clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. Thus, the assessment of property cannot be frozen as an incentive for businesses to locate in a community.""

Abele’s spokesman told us it’s at least theoretically possible his plan could get around that.

It’s possible, Lorenz said, that Abele would try to define ""new small businesses"" as a special class of property. If a legal challenge resulted, there’s a chance the county could prevail, Lorenz said.

But Kreye said that while the Legislature could exempt whole classes of property from taxation, carving out certain businesses within one class for special treatment is problematic.

Abele’s camp offered one more defense.

Lorenz said that Abele thought of his plan as a county version of Gov. Scott Walker’s plan for a two-year income tax break for firms that relocate to Wisconsin. Walker signed that bill on Jan. 31 -- and legal concerns were not an issue.

But Walker’s plan involves income taxes, not property taxes.

The uniformity clause ""does not apply to income taxes,"" said state Legislative Reference Bureau attorney Marc Shovers, an income tax specialist.

This one’s clear.

Abele is touting his idea of granting special property tax breaks to certain businesses. But well-established legal principles, the state’s constitution and expert opinion strongly suggests that not even the Legislature could make this happen.

The lack of detail in Abele’s plan may be the best thing going for it, because it’s harder to judge. But it also makes clear how far off base he was in presenting this as a simple matter of a pen stroke by the new county executive.

We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/09/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-says-property/

Sen. Isakson says counting $1 trillion takes thousands of years
","
The AJC Truth-O-Meter gets no love from politicians, be they Democrat or Republican. But it’s more than pleased to settle for a little attention now and then.

Two months after his failed bid to reclaim the governor’s seat, former Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, in an essay presented at a Jan. 28 panel at the State Bar Association, weighed in on his dim view of the state of investigative reporting.  

""We now have Truth-O-Meters, whatever that means,"" Barnes said.   

And just a few days before Barnes spoke, Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson brought up our gutsy gizmo as he explained the magnitude of the national debt during a Jan. 24 talk at the Atlanta Press Club. 

Isakson said he was at a campaign stop when a farmer asked, ""How much is a trillion?"" The senator didn’t have an answer, so he wrestled with the numbers and concluded that if you tried to pay out $1 trillion at a rate of $1 per second, it would take you more than 31,000 years. 

""Given the Truth-O-Meters out there, I put an asterisk by that,"" he said. ""I didn't account for leap years.""

We couldn’t resist. Would counting out $1 trillion at $1 per second really take more than 31,000 years? And what about those leap years? 

Before we proceed, it’s useful to note that the national debt eclipsed $1 trillion years ago. As of Feb. 2, it totaled $14.1 trillion. 

About $4.6 trillion is what’s called ""intragovernmental"" debt, or money the government loaned to itself. It does this by transferring money from the Social Security trust funds and other government divisions. 

About $9.5 trillion is what’s called ""public"" debt, or money that the government borrows from domestic and foreign investors by issuing things such as bonds or treasury bills. This debt is what worries economists because it has to be paid back in cash. 

Too large a debt could be a drag on the economy. Interest rates and tax rates might rise as government services and entitlement payouts shrink. 

Isakson wants to rein in federal spending, and on Jan. 27 he introduced the Biennial Budget Appropriations Act with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. It would change the budget cycle so one year of the two-year congressional session would be devoted to figuring out whether federal programs deserve funding. 

Isakson is also a co-sponsor of the Commitment to American Prosperity Act, which would create a federal spending limit that would gradually decrease over 10 years, based on the U.S. gross domestic product. He is also co-sponsor of a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget.  

Now, back to our fact check. 

We called Georgia Tech, which is renowned for its prowess in math and science. It put us in the capable hands of math professor Douglas Ulmer, who is chairman of the School of Mathematics. 

This is how Ulmer did the math: 

Since leap years take place every four years, Ulmer counted a year as 365.25 days. He then converted years to seconds using the following equation: 

(365.25 days) x (24 hours/day) x (60 minutes/hour) x (60 seconds/minute) = 31,557,600 seconds

Ulmer divided those seconds into a trillion, which showed that 1 trillion seconds equals more than 31,688 years. He then converted the remainder into days, hours and seconds to conclude that 1 trillion seconds is 31,688 years, 32 days, 1 hour, 46 minutes and 40 seconds.  

""Over 31,000"" is therefore close enough for all practical purposes, Ulmer said.  

We wholeheartedly agree. 

Isakson gets an A in arithmetic. We rule his statement True. And we hope he continues to tout the Truth-O-Meter in all his speeches. ",/factchecks/2011/feb/09/johnny-isakson/sen-isakson-says-counting-1-trillion-takes-thousan/

Rep. Jim Renacci's GM stock claim crashes on accuracy
","
In April 2010, General Motors announced it had paid back its government loans, in full and five years ahead of schedule. PolitiFact rated the claim as Half True.

GM had squared its government loans, but loans were only a fraction of more than $52 billion that the U.S. Treasury had committed to GM through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Most of the government's GM investment was converted to an ownership stake in the General Motors Co., the new company that emerged from bankruptcy.

While several economists told PolitiFact the repayment was undeniably a sign of progress, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the government would end up losing $34 billion in TARP money extended to the automotive industry and auto finance companies. The CBO didn't break out how much of that was tied to GM, but GM received the largest portion of the total $85 billion.

By last fall, however, the Treasury Department had revised its loss on the bailout downward, to $17 billion. Treasury officials declared the bailout a success.

But declarations of success, for the bailout or for GM, were not unanimous.

""I'm not sure we can determine one year later that General Motors is successful,"" Rep. Jim Renacci said on the  ""Sound of Ideas"" on WCPN 90.3 FM. He said, ""I think that for the company to pay back everything it owes, it would have to sell its shares at $143 a share . . . where the highest value of a General Motors share ever was $43, $44, $46, whatever the dollars were...""

PolitiFact Ohio asked the staff of the 16th District Republican about the underpinning of his numbers. They referred us to a blog posting that cited an analysis from last August by CNBC auto reporter Phil LeBeau, ""which states that for the federal government to recover its current net TARP outlays of $43 billion, each (GM) share would have to yield about $143 for the government to be repaid.""

That figure was cited by other reporters, too, about that time, as GM filed for an initial public offering (IPO) of its stock that was projected for October.

But events overtook the $143 estimate. GM kept altering several factors in its IPO, and by the time it occurred last November, analysts listed a payback figure in the low $50 range. (By then, CNBC had taken down the LeBeau’s posted analysis from its website.)

The government sold part of its 61 percent stake in GM during the IPO in November, raising $13.5 billion and reducing its share in the company to 33 percent. Treasury also swapped some secondary shares, bringing in another $2.1 billion.

Technically -- and it's an important financial distinction to make -- the automaker does not owe the government anything. GM repaid the government by giving it the bulk of its stock -- leaving it up to Treasury to get a good return on investment. Given the rest of his statement, we think Renacci was talking about the government breaking even on that investment, not GM repaying the government.

The government’s stake in GM stands at $26.4 billion. Divide that by Treasury's 500 million stock shares and you get about $53 a share -- the price Treasury would have get to break even on the bailout. The Congressional Oversight Panel lists the break-even price as $54.28.

Renacci's staff told us that the record high for GM shares was $40.85, even lower than the congressman stated,  in 1999. But according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago, and according to the oversight panel, GM's peak stock price was above $93 in April 2000.

Those figures are for the old GM that sought bankruptcy protection and reorganized. Stock prices for the new General Motors Co. closed at $36.70 on Feb. 7.

The senior Treasury official who oversees TARP told the Congressional Oversight Committee that the government hopes to sell the rest of its stake in GM within the next two years.

Financier Steven Rattner, who was dubbed the administration's ""car czar"" as head of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry, thinks taxpayers still could break even if Treasury is a little patient"" and holds its stock longer.

Selling the stock at recent non-peak levels, the government would lose around $7 billion on the entire GM bailout.

So where does that leave us?

Renacci relied on an outdated projection of the stock price needed for the government to fully recover its assistance to GM. The ""break-even"" price really is much closer to the current stock price than were initial projections. And Treasury's current loss level of $7 billion is less than half the $17 billion projected by Treasury last fall, when it declared the bailout a success.

And the congressman is way off the mark with his citation of GM’s highest-ever stock price.

Whether the new GM can be viewed as successful is a point we leave up for debate. But as to Renacci’s claim about GM stock and the government recouping its TARP investment, we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/09/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renaccis-gm-stock-claim-crashes-accuracy/

The majority of people in polls do ""not support Obamacare""
","Correction: Due to a math error, this story originally said that a Kaiser poll showed that 49 percent of respondents wanted the health care law kept or expanded. The correct figure is 47 percent. In an interview on Sunday with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, President Barack Obama defended the health care law as a common-sense measure aimed at protecting average Americans.

There's no reason people should go bankrupt if they happen to get sick, Obama said. ""The notion that that's a radical principle, I don't think the majority of people would agree with you,"" he added.

""Then why do the majority people in the polls not support Obamacare?"" O'Reilly asked.

Obama: ""Actually, I think it's pretty evenly divided.""

""It's close,"" O'Reilly said, adding that ""other people see it as a huge government intrusion, and you guys just want to take over, basically, decision-making for Americans. It's an ideological argument.""

Here, we wanted to referee the dispute on the poll numbers: Do a majority of people in the polls oppose the health care law? Since O'Reilly brought it up, we decided to check his statement.

There are many, many polls to choose from when it comes to public opinion on health care. Pollsters have been asking people their thoughts on the plan for the past two years, long before it passed in March 2010.

The best evidence for O'Reilly's position was the most recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School Of Public Health. In its most recent tracking poll, it found that 50 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the law, while 41 percent viewed it favorably. But another 9 percent said they didn't know or didn't want to answer. Certainly, the largest category in this poll didn't like health care, but if you combined supporters with the unknowns, you do get an even split.

When you average polls over the past few months, the result is that the public is evenly split on the health care bill, said Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor at Harvard who was one of the poll's designers. Opinions on it also tend to break down along partisan lines.

""Republicans continue to overwhelmingly dislike this bill, and Democrats favor it and would like to see it expanded in one way or another. Independents are split and tend to move one way or another,"" Blendon said.

Things get even trickier when you ask people about repealing the law, because a significant portion of those who say they view the law unfavorably also say they they are opposed to a complete repeal. The most recent Kaiser poll showed that 19 percent said keep the law as it is; 28 percent said expand the law; 23 percent said repeal the law and replace it with a Republican alternative; 20 percent said repeal it and don't replace it. That means 47 percent want the law kept or expanded, and 43 percent want it replaced with a Republican alternative or simply repealed.

Some polls have also found that at least a portion of people who dislike the health care bill dislike it because they wanted to see more dramatic changes to the health care system. A CNN poll in December found that 13 percent of those who opposed the law did so because it wasn't liberal enough. Another 43 percent favored the bill and 37 percent said it was too liberal.

There's also some evidence of small shifts in opinion depending on how the question is asked. When the polls are as close as they are on health care, that can make a difference in which side prevails.

Finally, individual components of health care tend to poll very well, such as tax credits to help low- and moderate-income people buy insurance (79 percent favorable) and expanding Medicaid, the government-run health care program for the poor (67 percent favorable). The least popular part of the law is the individual mandate requiring people to buy insurance (23 percent favorable).

O'Reilly said that a ""majority of the people in the polls"" do not support the health care law. If we were rating Obama's statement on its own, that the public is evenly divided, we would rate that True. But O'Reilly isn't entirely wrong, in the sense that support for the bill does not hit 50 percent or higher. Taking a broad picture of the polls reveals a divided public, so we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/08/bill-oreilly/majority-people-polls-do-not-support-obamacare/

Bill O'Reilly tells Obama he also asked Bush about people hating him
","During a Super Bowl interview on Feb. 6, 2011, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly prefaced a sensitive question to President Barack Obama by saying that he had asked the same question in a previous interview with former President George W. Bush.

""I asked this to President Bush when I talked to him a few weeks ago,"" O’Reilly said to Obama. ""Does it disturb you that so many people hate you? No. I mean, it's a serious question.""

A reader wrote to us to ask whether O’Reilly did ask that question of Bush. So we looked into it.

We discovered that O’Reilly was referring to an interview aired on Nov. 11, 2010, when Bush, by then out of office for almost two years, was doing publicity for his memoir, Decision Points.

Here’s the exchange between O’Reilly and Bush:

O’REILLY: ""Okay. But, the people in the press hated you, a lot of them. Why? Why?""

BUSH : ""I don’t know. You have to ask them. I’m not a hater, and so sometimes it’s hard for me to understand why somebody hates somebody. It could have been because of my policies, maybe they didn’t like my religion. I don’t know. I’m sure there’s a myriad of reasons. That’s what happens when you’re the president. It can either bother you or not bother you. I chose --

O""REILLY: ""You ever think about it?""

BUSH: ""Being hated? No, not really.""

O’REILLY: ""Really? Never?""

BUSH: ""No. I’m a pretty comfortable guy right now, you know.""

O’REILLY: ""You look it.""

BUSH: ""I really am. I’m honored to have served. I’m glad I served, and I gave it my all, and that’s all you can do at life. I got back -- and this sounds corny to some, I understand, but when I looked in the mirror, I know I didn’t sell my soul for the sake of any short-term politics or popularity. I think that’s important.""

For the record, here’s how Obama answered O’Reilly: ""You know, the truth is, that the people -- and I'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody. The people who dislike you don't know you. … What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that's out there. … I think that by the time you get here, you have to have had a pretty thick skin. If you didn't, then you probably wouldn't have gotten here.""

Technically, O’Reilly asked slightly different questions of each president. To Obama, he asked whether it disturbs him to be hated by ""so many"" Americans. To Bush, he asked how he felt about being hated by ""a lot of"" people in the press, and then followed up by asking him more generally if he ever thought about being hated.

Still, O’Reilly’s two lines of inquiry are similar enough that we’re giving O’Reilly a True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/08/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-tells-obama-he-also-asked-bush-about-/

President Obama says 12 judges have rejected ""the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional""
","
Ever since a federal judge in Florida ruled the health care law unconstitutional, the White House has portrayed the opinion as an outlier made by an activist judge. Many other judges have come to a different conclusion, the argument goes.

This was the tack President Barack Obama took in a pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, who asked about the recent Florida ruling.

""Well, I think the judge in Florida was wrong,"" Obama said. ""Keep in mind that we've had 12 judges said -- that just threw this case out -- the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional.""

Obama's point was clear: The Florida case got the headlines, but courts are still overwhelmingly ruling with Obama on the key question of constitutionality.

We asked the White House for some backup on the claim about the 12 dismissed cases, and they provided a list that we've appended to the bottom of this article. The White House is correct they were dismissed, but they were dismissed for procedural reasons, often because the judges concluded the plaintiffs either lacked proper standing or jurisdiction to bring the lawsuit.

The judges did not opine on the merits of these cases, such as whether the law is constitutional. They dismissed the cases for a variety of reasons: in some, the argument was that the plaintiff's lacked standing because the individual mandate portion of the law (which requires people to have health insurance) had not yet kicked in. It goes into effect in 2014. In other cases, the judges said the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not establish that they would be injured by the law.

Besides the judges who dismissed 12 cases on procedural grounds, four judges have ruled on the merits of various cases challenging the health care law. Two ruled in favor of the administration and two against:

Thomas Moore Law Center vs. Barack Hussein Obama

On Oct. 7, 2010, U.S. District Judge George Steeh, a Bill Clinton appointee to the Eastern District of Michigan, ruled that Congress has the right to impose the individual mandate portion of the health care law under the Commerce Clause of the constitution.

""The health care market is unlike other markets,"" Steeh wrote. ""No one can guarantee his or her health, or ensure that he or she will never participate in the health care market ...

""In this case, the minimum coverage provision of the Health Care Reform Act contains two provisions aimed at the same goal,"" Steeh wrote. ""Congress intended to increase the number of insureds and decrease the cost of health insurance by requiring individuals to maintain minimum essential coverage or face a penalty for failing to do so. Because the 'penalty' is incidental to these purposes, plaintiffs' challenge to the constitutionality of the penalty as an improperly apportioned direct tax is without merit.""

Score one for the constitutionality of the health care law.

Liberty University vs. Timothy Geithner

In an opinion handed down on Nov. 30, 2010, in the Western District of Virginia, U.S. District Judge Norman Moon, a Clinton appointee, also ruled the law constitutional under the Commerce Clause, the constitutional principle that allows the federal government to regulate commerce.

""I hold that there is a rational basis for Congress to conclude that individuals' decisions about how and when to pay for health care are activities that in the aggregate substantially affect the interstate health care market,"" Moon wrote. ""Nearly everyone will require health care services at some point in their lifetimes, and it is not always possible to predict when one will be afflicted by illness or injury and require care.… 
""Far from 'inactivity,' by choosing to forgo insurance, Plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later, out of pocket, rather than now, through the purchase of insurance. As Congress found, the total incidence of these economic decisions has a substantial impact on the national market for health care by collectively shifting billions of dollars on to other market participants and driving up the prices of insurance policies."" 
So the first two decisions on the constitutional merits went Obama's way. But the next two did not. 
Commonwealth of Virgina vs. Kathleen Sebelius

In a ruling filed on Dec. 13, 2010, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson, a President George W. Bush appointee, wrote that ""despite laudable intentions of Congress in enacting a comprehensive transformative health care regime, the legislative process must still operate within constitutional bounds.""

""Neither the Supreme Court nor any federal circuit court of appeals has extended Commerce Clause powers to compel an individual to involuntarily enter the stream of commerce by purchasing a commodity in the private market,"" Hudson wrote. ""In doing so, the enactment of the Minimum Essential Coverage provision exceeds the Commerce Clause powers vested in Congress under Article I.""

Hudson struck down the individual mandate, but upheld the rest of the law.

State of Florida vs. United States Department of Health and Human Services

This ruling made the biggest headlines. In a case brought by 26 states challenging the health care law, Senior U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson of Pensacola, Fla., a Ronald Reagan appointee, issued a sweeping ruling on Jan. 31., 2011, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so entwined with the rest of the law that the entire thing should be thrown out.

""In the final analysis, this Act has been analogized to a finely crafted watch, and that seems to fit. It has approximately 450 separate pieces, but one essential piece (the individual mandate) is defective and must be removed,"" Vinson wrote. ""It cannot function as originally designed. There are simply too many moving parts in the Act and too many provisions dependent (directly and indirectly) on the individual mandate and other health insurance provisions -- which, as noted, were the chief engines that drove the entire legislative effort -- for me to try and dissect out the proper from the improper, and the able-to-stand-alone from the unable-to-stand-alone. Such a quasi-legislative undertaking would be particularly inappropriate in light of the fact that any statute that might conceivably be left over after this analysis is complete would plainly not serve Congress' main purpose and primary objective in passing the Act. The statute is, after all, called ""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" not ""The Abstinence Education and Bone Marrow Density Testing Act."" The Act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker.""

There are other cases pending, as well as appeals on nearly all of the cases listed above. But here's the score so far: 
All sides agree that the issue will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.

Back to Obama's statement, ""Keep in mind that we've had 12 judges said -- that just threw this case out -- the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional.""

The president's statement ""very clearly implies the judges have said it's not unconstitutional,"" said legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. ""This is highly misleading White House spin. A ruling on standing is never a ruling on whether the underlying law is constitutional or not.""

Avram Goldstein, a spokesman for Health Care for America Now, said the point is that despite all the media attention given to the Florida court decision,  ""This one case is not the be-all and end-all.""

The judges in the 12 cases listed by the White House may not have weighed in on the constitutionality issue, Golstein said, ""but if a judge throws it out for procedural reasons, you lost.""

Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the White House, made a similar argument.

""Twelve lawsuits challenging the law's constitutionality have been dismissed,"" Bedingfield said. ""That’s a fact, and that is the point the president was making.""

We disagree. Obama said the 12 judges dismissed the cases because they disagreed with the claim that the health care law was unconstitutional. They did not. They dismissed the cases because of procedural grounds. We find his claim False.

Education cuts show up in Rick Scott's budget
","
Gov. Rick Scott unveiled his highly anticipated state budget on Feb. 7, 2011, which, as promised, calls for major reductions to government spending along with tax cuts for property owners and businesses.

Scott's two-year spending plan would shrink the overall state budget from $70.3 billion to $65.9 billion in 2011-2012 and to $63.3 billion in 2012-2013. Cuts were expected almost everywhere -- except in the area of education, where Scott has said that funding would remain the same.

At least, that's what people thought.

Scott's proposed budget for next year includes billions of dollars in education cuts. (The actual cut depends on what education budget figure you consult, but the cut would be between $3.3 billion and $4.8 billion, with per-student funding to decrease by 10 percent.) Some of that loss is offset by having teachers contribute 5 percent to their retirement and by the inclusion of temporary federal education dollars. Still, per-student funding would shrink if Scott's budget is ultimately approved.

""I've heard nothing but that education funding wasn't going to be touched,"" said Florida Education Association spokesman Mark Pudlow. ""We all were wondering what kind of alchemy we were going to see. Of course, what we saw was tons of cuts to education.""

When Scott met with reporters after announcing his budget, he was asked if he had flipped on his campaign rhetoric.

""No, it's not going back on anything I promised,"" Scott said. ""What I said throughout the campaign and what I'm saying today -- any money that came out of state general revenue, we're not cutting that. Any money that they relied on federal bailouts, that is different.""

But that's not what Scott said just four days prior in Tampa.

During an announcement where Scott said he would cut local school property taxes, called the required local effort, he was asked specifically about the effect on education funding. Here's the question and answer from Feb. 3, which we just happened to record:

Question: You referred to cuts in the RLE (required local effort) property tax. Do you have a plan to make up that revenue or will the schools take that as a loss?

Scott: ""No, my commitment is to make sure the money that they've received they'll get again. Where I'm getting the savings is, I'm reducing the state government. What I'm trying to do is keep the school budgets the same."" 
School budgets are funded through multiple sources. Local districts contribute property taxes through the required local effort, which is set by the state, and additional optional property taxes, which are set by county school boards. The state contributes general fund revenues through the state sales tax, as well as money from education trust funds. And the federal government contributes as well. The combination produces total school funding. 
If one part of the funding -- required local effort -- is reduced while the other parts simply stay the same, the result is less school money overall. 
Speaking in Tampa, Scott made no effort to distinguish or differentiate the funding formula -- all he said is he would keep school budgets the same. 
We also found references during the campaign when Scott was on the record saying education funding would not be cut as part of his budget. 
During the primary, Scott said he could offset a reduction in the school property tax through a combination of a larger share of sales taxes and other general revenue, according to the Palm Beach Post. When Scott's primary opponent, Attorney General Bill McCollum, called that plan ""unrealistic,"" Scott said the money for schools could be found by cuts in non-education spending, the Post reported.

And then during the general election, Scott again was asked to respond to questions over his education spending plan. According to the Associated Press, a spokeswoman for Alex Sink, Scott's Democratic opponent, called the Scott plan a rip-off of education. Here's how Scott responded in a Sept. 28 story: ""We're not slashing the budget, our focus is to spend the dollars well,"" he said. ""We're gonna drive down property tax rates, but we're gonna do that as we figure out how to save money. We're gonna make sure the money is there for education.""

Again, Scott offered no suggestion he was talking only about general revenue funding.

One more thing: In comments after releasing his budget, Scott said he only promised no cuts to general revenue -- but he's actually making a slight cut there as well. Scott's budget includes about a $155 million cut in general revenue funding in 2011-2012. Yes, it's a small cut from a proposed budget of $12.3 billion, but it's a cut nevertheless.

At the very least, Scott deliberately and purposely suggested that education funding would be held harmless in his first state budget. He made comments to that effect just days before his budget was released. Yet, when he announced his budget, cuts were included. We rate Scott's claim False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/08/rick-scott/education-cuts-show-rick-scotts-budget/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Bill Posey']","
Rep. Bill Posey claims nearly half will lose current health plan
","
Do you have a one-in-two chance of losing your health care plan as a result of the 2010 health care law?

That's what Republican Congressman Bill Posey, who represents Florida's 15th District in Central Florida, claims in a Feb. 1, 2011, letter to Florida Today. He wrote to explain to voters ""which aspects of the health care law I’m against,"" and this was his first point:

""Before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans. After it became law, the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan.""

He also argued that the law will not produce savings in health care costs, nor will it reduce health care spending. But for this fact-check, we are going to look at Posey's first statement. Before the health care law passed, were Americans told they could keep their current plans? And after the law passed, did the federal government issue regulations that result in nearly half of Americans losing their current plans?

On Feb. 4, Posey spokesman George Cecala sent us two 2009 videos of Obama posted on You Tube. In the first video, Obama said: ""If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what."" In the second video, he said: ""If you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it.""

Three experts on the health care law whom we interviewed all agreed the message was clear: Obama told Americans that they could keep their health plan. Our experts are Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, which has been critical of the health care law; Edwin Park, co-director on health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has supported the health care law; and Gerard Anderson, a professor and director at the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The second part of Posey's claim -- that nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan -- is more complicated. Our colleagues at National PolitiFact reviewed a similar claim on Feb. 2 by Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, that the health care law would force 70 percent of workers to ""lose their current health plan."" Here's what we found:

How grandfathering works

The law allows plans that existed on March 23, 2010, to be ""grandfathered,"" which means that they do not have to comply with new requirements that took effect last fall, such as providing preventive services without cost-sharing and direct access to ob-gyn care without a referral. To keep their grandfathered status, these plans must not significantly cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket spending for consumers. (Minor policy changes and increases to keep pace with medical inflation do not threaten a plan’s grandfather status.)

A fact sheet provided by the Obama administration on HealthCare.gov estimates how many plans are expected to opt for grandfathered status, both for the 133 million Americans whose plans are provided by large employers and the 43 million with plans provided by small employers (fewer than 100 employees). Together, those groups account for 91 percent of insured Americans.

According to administration projections, between 36 and 66 percent of the large-employer plans will remain grandfathered by 2013. For small employers, the administration expects between 20 and 51 percent to be grandfathered in 2013.

Cecala also sent us a link to a June 2010 Federal Register report that looks at how many employer plans will relinquish their grandfathered status in 2013, rather than how many retain it. Table 3 estimates between 39 and 69 percent of all employer plans will relinquish that status.

So Posey's claim refers to plans that will lose their grandfathered status, and ""nearly half"" is clearly within the government's own estimates. But the question is whether losing grandfathered status means the same thing as losing your current plan. Just because a consumer's plan loses its grandfathered status doesn't mean he or she will be forced to switch to an entirely different provider or a radically different plan.

What PolitiFact found

The Truth-O-Meter on Farenthold summarized it this way:

""Health care specialists said they expect that in many cases an employer (or the insurance carrier the employer uses) will change the plan in ways that are significant enough to end grandfather status but which will not terminate the plan or result in a radical change in its coverage. While some employers may decide to end health care coverage entirely (and thus pay a penalty under the law), many will continue to offer a similar plan but perhaps with more extensive requirements mandated under the law, possibly along with higher premiums.""

Also, when Obama made his promise that Americans could keep their plans, he failed to acknowledge that many Americans already don't keep their ""current"" plan every year. Insurers change rules and costs, employers switch providers, and Americans lose or change jobs or retire, effectively switching their plans. That is something that Farenthold, and now Posey, also fail to explain.

The Feb. 2 Truth-O-Meter attempted to quantify how many Americans switch plans unrelated to the new law and found a study by Mercer, a private consulting firm that does an annual national survey of employer-sponsored health plans. Beth Umland, the head of research for Mercer's health and benefits consulting practice, said that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly 25 percent of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, she said, that percentage rose to one-third of companies.

PolitiFact concluded that the data is too scattershot to know how many workers change plans every year, but it seems reasonable to assume that the number is not trivial.

The experts on grandfathering

Our experts also weighed in on the second part of Posey's claims.

Park said he wouldn't equate grandfathering with losing your health plan.

""Let's say the same plan loses grandfathering status because it raises the deductible,"" Park said, but employees are kept on a revised Blue Cross plan. ""It's still a Blue Cross plan -- it's the same insurer, the same rules, the same providers being covered, and now it doesn't have the grandfathered status. Essentially it's the same plan with some changes to comply with the health reform law. The rhetoric implies that the plan is completely different. ... 'Losing your plan' makes it sound like you are being forced out of your plan into something else completely. These kinds of changes happen all the time, and it happens today with or without the enactment of the health care law.""

Anderson also agreed that losing grandfathered status shouldn't be equated with consumers losing a plan.

Tanner explained:

""Over time the current plans are likely to go away and the new plans will all meet the government's requirements. To some degree, that is an advantage for people who get benefits they don't get now, but it will also likely cost them more to do so. It's a little bit like telling everybody who has a Toyota now they have to get Lexus. They got more car, but it cost them more."" And initially Americans were told they could keep that Toyota and now they can't, he said.

While some consumers may not be forced from one plan to another -- say from Kaiser to Aetna -- consumers who have Blue Cross now may still have Blue Cross ""but the plan itself will have different benefits and different costs."" The differences will really affect smaller businesses that are offering bare bones coverage now and will have to provide more expensive policies, Tanner said.

We asked Cecala, why does Posey believe that a plan that loses its grandfathered status is equivalent to Americans losing their current plan?

""It is a different version of what you were having before,"" Cecala said. If an employer can't afford the new option, then the employer might drop the plan entirely or switch to a different plan, he said.

Our ruling

On the first half of Posey's claim, we agree that ""before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans."" But the second half of his claim, that ""After it became law the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan,"" is not so simple.

Posey's math is correct when he points to the government estimates of employer plans that will lose grandfathered status. But telling the public that ""half of Americans would lose their current plan"" implies that they will be forced into a different provider's plan, a substantially worse plan or even no plan at all. By that definition, some Americans ""lost"" their current plans routinely for years before the health care law was signed. For those omissions, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/08/bill-posey/rep-bill-posey-claims-nearly-half-will-lose-curren/
"['Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says state employees could pay twice as much for health care premiums and still be paying half the national average
","
Gov. Scott Walker left no doubt in his first ""state of the state"" address that he wants benefits concessions from state employees.

Walker said state employees need to share the pain felt by private-sector workers so the state can balance its budget without tax increases. In making his case, he tossed out some stark statistics on pensions and health care coverage:

""Most state workers only pay about 6 percent of their premium costs for their health care plan,"" Walker told lawmakers. ""Asking public employees to make...a premium payment of 12 percent, which is about half of the national average, would save the state more than $30 million over three months.""

He added: ""Most workers outside of government would love a deal like that – particularly if it means saving jobs.""

We set out to test the governor’s claim.

Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie pointed to a Kaiser Family Foundation study that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported those findings on Sept. 12, 2010.

Werwie also provided state documents showing the premium contribution by union and non-union state workers, as well as the total premium cost to the state. He said they show that most state employees pay between 4 percent and 6 percent.

Let’s dig into both sides of the equation.

First, is Walker correct that ""most"" state employees pay only about 6 percent?

Unionized state workers in the most common insurance tier pay $78 a month on family premiums that cost the state between $1,500 and $1,800, state figures show. That’s in the 4 percent to 5 percent range by our calculation. Non-union state workers pay a bit more -- $89 a month in most cases. That works out to a 5 percent to 6 percent share.

So Walker’s number looks good.

And so does the ""most state employees"" claim: More than 98 percent of state employees fall into those categories, according to figures from the state’s Department of Employee Trust Funds.

There is a higher-premium plan in which some state employees pay about 15 percent of the cost, or $412 a month. But it is used by just a tiny fraction of state government workers.

Just to cap this off, we asked the state to calculate the employee share across all plans, both single and family coverage, for all employees. They came up with 5.6 percent.

Now the national side.

First, a bit of background. The national cost trend is clear. Since 2000, average premiums for family coverage have increased 114 percent, the Kaiser study found.

Several other studies back up Walker’s claim on the national numbers regarding public and private employees.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage.

Of course, there is a range, but that’s the collective national figure for civilian workers, public and private. Union workers paid much less than non-represented workers.

Now let’s tease out just government workers, to see how Wisconsin compares there.

The Kaiser study -- the one relied on by Walker for his overall comparison -- put the employee share paid by state and local government workers nationwide at 25 percent for family coverage.

Finally, a study by The Segal Co., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers showed a majority paying between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage.

If Wisconsin workers are paying around 6 percent, that puts them in the bottom fifth nationally among state employees, Segal’s data shows. A very small number pay zero toward their premium.

There’s a clear trend toward asking state employees to pay more, the Segal study said. Still, private-sector workers are being asked to share even more, said J. Richard Johnson, Segal’s public sector health practice leader.

Experts warn against drawing comparisons without looking at employees’ total package of wages and benefits -- and what they may have given up to get them. (We examined another aspect of that in an earlier item on public vs. private sector pay.)

So in this item we’re not trying to determine where Wisconsin workers stand in the big picture.

But we can come to a firm conclusion on the state employee health premiums, here and nationally.

The governor relies on a statistic that mixes public and private workers, but in this case that’s not a problem: Walker’s point is that state workers need to be more in line with their private counterparts. Walker’s numbers for state workers and the national context are right on target. And his math holds up even when the comparison is narrowed to just public employees.

Americans Against Food Taxes' ad during Super Bowl raises specter of soda, snack taxes
","
Along with Doritos and Bud Lite commercials on Super Bowl Sunday, viewers in the Washington area saw a political ad against taxes on food and soft drinks. We wondered if the ad was correct that politicians are seeking to tax sodas and food, so we decided to put the claim to the Truth-O-Meter.

The ad features a woman talking to the camera as she shops in a grocery store. It has been airing for several weeks in selected markets on cable channels such as CNN.

""Feeding a family is difficult enough in today's economy,"" the woman says. ""Now, some politicians want the government telling me how I should do it. They want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries I buy, like soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks, even flavored waters, trying to control what we eat and drink with taxes. Give me a break. I can decide what to buy without government help. The government is just getting too involved in our personal lives.""

At that point, a narrator says, ""Government needs to trim its budget fat and leave our grocery budgets alone.""

First, some background on the group airing the ad, Americans Against Food Taxes. The group is spearheaded by the American Beverage Association, which represents the makers of sodas and other drinks. According to Advertising Age,  the American Beverage Association decided to form the coalition in June 2009, when the idea of taxing sodas and other sweet beverages was being considered as a way to fund the Democratic health care bill. The coalition includes dozens of members, including 7-Eleven, Inc., Burger King Corp., Domino’s Pizza, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, McDonalds, the National Association of Convenience Stores, Snack Food Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc.

Although the food and beverage tax was not included in the health care law, the group has continued to run advertising to forestall any effort to revive such taxes. People watching the ad might think Congress is still considering such a proposal at the federal level. But if you listen closely, the ad played during the Super Bowl is careful to refer to ""politicians"" and ""government"" rather than ""Washington"" or ""Congress."" (By contrast, other ads the group has run have mentioned Washington.)

The ad is correct that politicians in some cash-strapped states are considering food and drink taxes.

In the last two years, many states and cities considered such taxes. According to the Campaign for Healthy Kids, an advocacy group that generally favors such efforts, taxes on soda were enacted in Washington state and proposed -- but not passed -- in Mississippi, New Mexico and the city of Philadelphia.

In New York, Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a New York City Democrat, has proposed a tax on foods high in calories, fat or carbohydrates, for the past several legislative sessions.

Most state lawmakers were sworn in only a few weeks ago, so we can't predict how many states will consider soda-tax proposals this year. But already, legislators have introduced bills to impose or raise the tax on sodas and/or snack foods in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia, according to separate legislative tracking by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a pro-business advocacy group, and Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.

So while Congress has not been active on this proposal since it was dropped from the health care law, it's been proposed in many states.

The ad is correct that ""some politicians … want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries."" We find the statement True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/americans-against-food-taxes/americans-against-food-taxes-ad-during-super-bowl-/

""I didn't raise taxes once. I lowered taxes over the last two years,"" Obama said.

We wanted to fact-check that statement, and we'll begin by saying Obama boils down an awful lot of complexity about federal tax policy into a short sound bite.

Looking at the whole statement, he's both right and wrong. For clarity's sake, we're going to take Obama's statement in two parts. Here, we'll look at his statement, ""I lowered taxes over the last two years.""

In a separate report, we checked the statement, ""I didn't raise taxes once"" and rated it False. Obama has raised taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning, and the health care law includes a tax penalty on the uninsured. The health care law also includes new taxes on the wealthy, increasing the rates they pay on Medicare hospital taxes starting in 2013.

For this one, we'll begin by noting that Obama has not raised income tax rates. Obama and Senate Republicans compromised on tax legislation at the end of 2010, leaving in place the same income tax rates for all tax brackets. (The extensions were necessary because the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush would otherwise have increased last month.)

It's also true that Obama has successfully supported tax reductions for workers who make less than $200,000 a year or couples who make less than $250,000.

Obama kicked off his tax cuts for workers with the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He asked for tax cuts of $500 per worker per year; Congress agreed to $400. The tax cuts -- called Making Work Pay -- were implemented in early 2009 and people saw small increases in their paychecks.

The Obama administration liked giving people the money in their paychecks every week or two -- as opposed to mailing one big check -- because administration economists thought people would be more likely to spend the money and stimulate the economy. But the increases were small enough that a lot of people didn't notice them. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in September showed that fewer than one in 10 people knew that the Obama administration had lowered taxes for American workers.

Those tax cuts expired at the end of 2010.

But as part of last fall's tax compromise with Republicans, Obama won a different type of tax cut for workers: a 2 percent reduction in payroll taxes that go to Social Security.

Keep in mind that normally workers pay 6.2 percent in payroll taxes on up to $106,800 of their earnings. (Employers pay another 6.2 percent, while the self-employed are generally on the hook for the full 12.4 percent.) The new tax cut means workers will pay only 4.2 percent of their earnings. So that lowered taxes for workers.

Generally speaking, people who make more than $20,000 will get an even bigger tax cut than they did under Making Work Pay. (Workers who makes less than $20,000 will likely be worse off, but they'll still be paying lower taxes than in 2008.)

The tax compromise was a complicated piece of legislation, and not everybody ended up better off. Nevertheless, about 80 percent of tax payers end up with a tax cut under the deal, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. And the broad-based tax cuts on income are significantly larger than the new excise taxes, said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. 
So yes, a majority of Americans have seen reduced taxes under President Obama. But he's also taken steps to increase a few taxes like cigarettes and tanning over the past two years. Overall, we find his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-he-lowered-taxes-over-past-two-y/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
President Barack Obama says he didn't raise taxes once.
","
In an interview on Super Bowl Sunday, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked President Barack Obama to react to a Wall Street Journal editorial that accused Obama of being ""a determined man of the left whose goal is to redistribute much larger levels of income across society.""

""Do you deny that you are a man who wants to redistribute wealth?"" O'Reilly asked.

Obama first noted the conservatism of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, then denied the charge ""absolutely.""

""I didn't raise taxes once. I lowered taxes over the last two years,"" Obama said.

We wanted to fact-check that statement, and we'll begin by saying Obama boils down an awful lot of complexity about federal tax policy into a short sound bite.

Looking at the whole statement, he's both right and wrong. For clarity's sake, we're going to take Obama's statement in two parts. Here, we'll look at his statement, ""I didn't raise taxes once."" In a separate report, we'll look at his statement, ""I lowered taxes over the last two years.""

The idea that Obama did not raise taxes is just plain wrong. He signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. He also signed the health care law, which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year. (Regular PolitiFact readers will remember our fact-check of reality TV star Snooki and her complaint about the new tax last year.)

The new health care law also includes a tax on people who decide not to have health insurance, as an incentive for them to get coverage. The tax phases in gradually, starting in 2014. By 2016, the tax would be $695 per uninsured person up to a maximum of three times that amount, or $2,085. The law includes exemptions for people who can't find affordable insurance, and a few other special circumstances.

More significantly, the health care law includes new taxes on the wealthy, starting in 2013. Individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples that make more than $250,000 will see additional Medicare taxes of 0.9 percent. They will also, for the first time, have to pay Medicare taxes on their investment income at a 3.8 percent rate. (Current law is that all workers and employers split a 2.9 percent Medicare tax; the self-employed pay all of it.)

The small percentages may not sound like a lot, but those taxes are expected to generate $210 billion over 10 years, or just over half of all the new revenues the health care law authorizes. Other provisions include new fees on health insurance companies and prescription drug manufacturers, and a new tax on high-cost ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans.

Before we rule on this item, though, we should note that Obama has not raised income taxes. Thanks to a compromise he brokered with Republicans at the end of 2010, income tax rates are staying the same for people of all incomes. Obama had favored raising taxes on high earners, but he gave up on that as part of the tax deal. In exchange, he gained a a 2 percent reduction in payroll taxes for all workers. When you combine that with small tax cuts that were part of the economic stimulus, most taxpayers have seen reduced rates under Obama's administration.

Obama said, ""I didn't raise taxes once."" But we've documented numerous instances when he has. He's has signed off on small tax cuts for most taxpayers, but that doesn't change the fact that he's also approved several tax increases. So we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-he-didnt-raise-taxes/

Del. Joe Morrissey says military spent $500 million enforcing Don't Ask, Don't Tell
","
Gays and lesbians will soon be allowed to serve openly in the United States military and a bill by Republican Del. Bob Marshall to ban them from the Virginia National Guard has been squashed in committee.

But that didn’t silence Del. Joe Morrissey, D-Henrico, who tried to counter Marshall by introducing legislation that would have barred the state from banning gays. His bill was killed by the same panel that snuffed Marshall’s.

Morrissey, still wanting to speak on the subject, rose on the House floor on Feb. 2 and said the military spent ""half a billion dollars to drum [gays] out of the service.""

Is he right?

Morrissey told us he based his statement on a report from The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The organization studies laws and public policies regarding sexual orientation.

A May, 2010 report from the group projected costs between $290.7 million and $555.2 million from 1994 and 2008. The research relied on information from the Government Accountability Office and the Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Palm Center studies gender and sexuality in the military.

We found two Government Accountability Office reports on the ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" policy. The first, released in 2005, examined the costs of the policy over its first decade, from 1994 through 2003. It said 9,488 soldiers and sailors were kicked out of the military under the policy during those years. The study said the dismissals cost the government about $95 million, using 2004  values, to recruit replacements.  

The GAO said it was unable to obtain the cost of replacing Marines and 136 ousted officers. Administrative costs were not calculated as well.

In the GAO’s most recent report, released last month, the government watchdog reviewed dismissals from 2004 through 2009. That report found 3,664 expulsions and estimated the replacement cost at $193.3 million, in 2009 dollars.

The GAO said this study contained more detailed information than the previous report, including data on administrative expenses and the price of replacing officers, who are far more expensive to train because the military often pays for their education at a service academy or through the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.

But Zina Merritt, who spearheaded the GAO’s latest report, said these two studies don’t necessarily allow us to determine a total cost of dismissals over the entire life of the ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" program.

""In fact, we somewhat discourage doing that because there were a number of different factors on data we got this round that we didn’t get the last round,"" she said. ""In 2005 the data didn’t include the Marine Corps, medical personnel and some other costs.""

Merritt said it would be better to view the reports as a base-line estimate of costs associated with the program. She acknowledged the true expenses were likely higher, given the GAO’s inability to gather all of the data it sought.

The Palm Center tried to establish a more comprehensive cost figure with its 2006 report, which was authored by a commission that included former Defense Department officials, including William Perry, the Secretary of Defense from 1994 until 1997. Also serving on the panel were faculty members from the U.S. Military Academy and the Naval Postgraduate School.

The commission said the GAO’s 2005 report accounted for the cost of replacing soldiers but did not adjust for any value received by the military over the course of a discharged soldier’s service. The Palm Center study said the military underestimated the price of training soldiers. It noted that while a 1998 report said the average cost of training an enlistee is $28,800, the 2005 paper found that the Navy, which had the highest per-capita training cost, said it spent just $18,000 training a new enlistee. The Army and Air Force said they spent even less.

After speaking with an Army research analyst, the Palm Center group reported the average cost of training an Army recruit was between $45,600 to $56,400. Given that information, the Palm Center said it believes the GAO report underestimated training costs.

The commission also sought to calculate the costs of training officers. If found some officers,
such as jet pilots, can cost more than $1 million to train, though most are not as expensive.

The commission considered several other costs, such as money spent by the military on travel costs for discharged soldiers. The group ultimately estimated a $363.8 million price for the policy’s enforcement between 1994 and 2003. When the Williams Center’s estimate for next five years is included, the total cost is reported at $555.2 million for 1994 through 2008.

Let’s review.

Morrissey said the military has spent ""half a billion dollars"" to dismiss gays and lesbians from the military.

If we combine the GAO costs from its two reports, we get a total of $288.3 million spent enforcing ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell."" And as the author of the most-recent report told us, that should be considered a minimum estimate, not an accurate total cost.

The Williams Institute at UCLA and the Palm Center at UCSB both believe the actual costs were higher. Williams put its most recent estimate at $555.2 million. Neither Williams nor the Palm Center had complete access to military records on recruitment and spending.

Morrissey’s figures are certainly reasonable. But because of the difference between the GAO figures and the figures from other groups, we rate his claim at Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/joe-morrissey/del-joe-morrissey-says-military-spent-500-million-/

Milwaukee County Board Chairman Lee Holloway says building code violations at his rental properties involve only exterior issues
","
The condition of rental property owned by Milwaukee County Board Chairman Lee Holloway has become an issue in the race for county executive. Indeed, Holloway says media coverage of the issue has diminished his chances to win the contest.

Holloway and his wife, Lynda, own 15 parcels in the city, including several apartment buildings on the near north side. Some of the buildings have been the subject of numerous and repeated building code violations.

Holloway was ordered to Milwaukee Municipal Court because a large batch of the violations have not been corrected. That hearing, involving dozens of long-standing violations, is set for March of 2011.

Beyond that, a security guard at one building faces misdemeanor charges for accusing him of threatening a tenant who was at odds with Holloway; another tenant faces charges of trashing that same tenant’s apartment; and reports show more than 800 police calls to Holloway-owned buildings in the past two years.

So ears perked up at a candidate forum at the Marquette University Law School when Holloway -- who was serving as acting county executive at the time -- was asked about his record as a landlord. He compared the dire economic situation facing some of his tenants with the economic woes facing the state and county government, then described the problems.

""The code violations are primarily storm windows,"" Holloway said, adding ""which we take and provide plastic which is better than storm windows.""

He added: ""And it has to do with tuckpointing, which is all complete."" And he said: ""Within the households, it’s fine.""

Finally, he declared: ""I’m saying I have resolved these problems. We are working to resolve these problems.""

This one is easy enough to check.

We looked at the city’s online database available through the Department of Neighborhood Services. Each violation for each property is listed. We counted, and then counted again.

At the time he made the statement, Holloway had 200 outstanding violations on eight of his 15 properties. Some of the violations were new -- and written up on Jan. 21, 2011, the same day as the candidate forum.

Do they all relate to exterior issues, such as brickwork, as Holloway claimed?

No.

Some examples of properties and violations listed: 

Let’s return to Holloway’s statement.

Facing a date in Municipal Court, Holloway told a forum audience -- including those who watched on TV and YouTube -- that the building code violations still at issue involve the exterior of the properties. ""Within the households,"" he said, ""it’s fine."" But inspection records paint a different picture: Roaches, exit signs, smoke detectors, ceiling plaster. All of those -- and more -- are interior issues. There’s even a note about faulty fire extinguishers.

That seems appropriate. We rate Holloway’s statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/lee-holloway/milwaukee-county-board-chairman-lee-holloway-says-/
"['Iraq', 'Religion', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Rep. Ron Paul says that the last Christians are about to leave Iraq
","
Appearing on MSNBC, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said that a lack of stability in Iraq is having dire consequences for religious minorities.

""Today there was an article, I think, on New York Times — the last Christians are about to leave there, "" he said on Jan. 20.

Paul’s comment came after news reports about an armed group, the Islamic State of Iraq, killing more than 50 people in a Baghdad church Oct. 31. The group said its fighters would kill Christians ""wherever they can reach them,"" according to a Dec. 12 New York Times news article. ""Dozens of shootings and bombings in Baghdad and Mosul"" followed in December, the article said. ""At least a dozen more Christians died.""

But still — the last Christians are leaving Iraq?

Paul’s office didn’t respond to our query, but we tracked down a Jan. 19 New York Times news article headlined: ""Last Christians ponder leaving a hometown in Iraq.""

Romel Hawal and his family are the last Christians in Habbaniya Cece, a town of 10,150 in Anbar Province, according to the article.  ""His wife wants to leave town or leave the country, joining an exodus of Christians from Iraq and throughout the Middle East,"" the article says, adding that about 70 Christian families lived in Habbaniya Cece before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

So, the Christians remaining in a single town in Iraq are considering moving away, along with other Christians who are said to be leaving the country. We wondered how many Christians still live in Iraq.

Approximately 29 million people live in Iraq, according to a Nov. 17 report on religious freedom by the U.S. State Department. According to statistics provided by the Iraqi government, 97 percent of that population is Muslim, the report says, with the remaining 3 percent Christian or another religion.

But the report notes that estimates of religious affiliations vary due to violence, internal migration ""and lack of governmental capacity.""

Indeed, Juliette Touma, a United Nations spokeswoman, told us ""there are no confirmed numbers on the numbers of Christians who remain in Iraq."" Since Iraq’s latest national census was conducted in 1997, ""we cannot really tell what is the exact number,"" she said.

The State Department report says Christian leaders in Iraq estimate that 400,000 to 600,000 residents are Christians, down from an estimated 800,000 to 1.4 million Christians in the country in 2003.

Why have Christian Iraqis been packing up?

Touma pointed us to a Jan. 31 report by the International Organization for Migration, which notes that violence in Iraq — particularly in Baghdad and Mosul — is driving Christian Iraqis to move to more secure areas, both in northern Iraq and abroad. ""Monitoring teams have been told by community leaders of increasing Christian emigration to Turkey since November 2010, which is confirmed by our colleagues in Turkey as well as recent media reports,"" the report says.

The Switzerland-based IOM was founded as an intergovernmental organization in 1951 to promote international cooperation on migration issues, among other objectives.

Threats and bombings targeting Christians occurred in Iraq before the October killings in Baghdad, but that incident marked the beginning of a more ""systematized campaign of violence against this religious minority,"" according to the report.

Still, Liana Paris, an IOM monitoring officer, called Paul’s claim ""extreme.""

""Although there has been a great deal of upheaval among Christian communities in the country, we have also heard some heart-wrenching stories about families refusing to leave their ancestral homes,"" she said.

Becca Heller, director of the New York-based Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project, similarly told us that ""there is definitely a strong trend of Christians"" leaving the country but that it’s not true that all Christians have fled Iraq.

Next, we searched online for other reports of Christians in Iraq.

A Dec. 17 briefing by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says ""the Christian communities in Baghdad and Mosul have started a slow but steady exodus"" since the October attacks. ""In addition, our offices in neighboring Syria, Jordan and Lebanon are reporting a growing number of Iraqi Christians arriving,"" the briefing says.

A May report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal body that makes policy recommendations to the president, secretary of state and Congress. According to the report, the Iraqi government  ""continues to commit and tolerate severe abuses of freedom of religion or belief, particularly against the members of Iraq’s smallest, most vulnerable religious minorities,"" which include Christians.

""The violence, forced displacement, discrimination, marginalization and neglect suffered by members of these groups threaten these ancient communities’ very existence in Iraq,"" according to the report. ""Today, only half of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is believed to remain in the country, with Christian leaders warning that the result of this flight may be the ‘end of Christianity in Iraq."" The report says that out of approximately 1.4 million Christians estimated to live in Iraq in 2003, only about 500,000 remain.

So, the number of Christians in Iraq has dropped significantly since 2003, but hundreds of thousands remain in that country. 
Paul is a prominent congressman whose utterances are widely reported. His claim that the last Christians are about to depart is not just hyperbole but ridiculous. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/ron-paul/rep-ron-paul-says-last-christians-are-about-leave-/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Dave Hunt']","
Dave Hunt says schools will suffer without planned cash infusion
","
The Oregon Legislature is up and running, which means battles over the budget -- both for the current two-year cycle and the next -- aren’t far off.

In fact, they might have already started. In an end-of-year e-mail sent out in December, Dave Hunt, the leader of the House Democrats, said the Legislature was obligated to release some $35.5 million from the Education Stability Fund.

Without it, he said, ""every school across Oregon will be negatively impacted during this school year.  The combined loss to schools across Clackamas County alone would be $3,371,694.  (North Clackamas Schools would lose $1,026,281, Oregon City Schools would lose $470,150, and Gladstone Schools would lose $121,028 for this school year.)"" Clackamas County is home to 10 school districts in all, according to the state.

(For those wondering why he’s so concerned about Clackamas County -- he’s the representative from Gladstone.)

We wondered whether this was true.

To start with, we gave Hunt’s office a call. Michael Cox, the House Democrats’ spokesman, pointed us to an analysis of school funding. It spelled out two scenarios: what schools would get under the current budget and what schools would get under the current budget minus $35.5 million.

It backed up Hunt’s statement exactly. Every school would see a loss of dollars. And the numbers he cited for specific schools were accurate.

There were a few caveats, however. According to the fine print, the analysis:

1) ""Assumes districts have same formula high cost disability grant as 09-10 preliminary""
2) ""Excludes $12.5 million for formula facility grants which can vary greatly by district by year""
3) ""Uses August 2010 school district data and estimates of school formula local revenue""

These caveats are understandable; there’s some information the state just doesn't have at this point. But, even in the event that these assumptions are way off, they apply to such a small portion of the overall budget that the outcome of the analysis wouldn’t be affected much.

When all of that checked out, we still had one nagging question: Were schools really counting on this cash? You could draw up an annual budget for PolitiFact Oregon and show our funding before and after a $35.5 million infusion (yeah, right), but if we were never expecting it in the first place, it’s not as though we’d be taking a loss. Similarly if schools were never counting on the $35.5 million -- if it was never built into their budgets -- it wouldn’t be fair to say they’d suffer without it.

For that piece, we called Oregon’s Legislative Fiscal Office. There, Monica Brown told us that the current school year was operating on a $2.86 billion budget and that, yes, in fact, that number did include the $35.5 million that Hunt was all worked up about.

We wondered when, exactly, that yet-to-be-released $35.5 million got folded into the budget, so we gave Cox another call. He pointed us in the direction of an Aug. 26, 2010, news release. At the time of the release, the state economist had just released a budget forecast that showed an additional $377.5 million shortfall.

To help offset educational cuts that might come as a result, then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, Senate President Peter Courtney and then-Speaker of the House Dave Hunt ""agreed that in order to protect schools, approximately $34 million of the state reserve funds will be committed to K-12 when the Legislature convenes in February 2011.""

Well, it’s February 2011, so Hunt is reminding legislators about the deal. Of course, a few things have since changed, not the least of which is that the House is now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. (You’ll notice that none of the parties who agreed to this move is a Republican.)

This is all beside the point, but we did contact Nick Smith, the spokesman for Co-Speaker of the House Bruce Hanna, a Republican from Roseburg, to see if there was any movement to resist tapping into the Education Stability Fund. Smith couldn’t say definitively but added ""we certainly have no interest in blocking whatever needs to be done to keep the budget balanced and the schools open.""

So, back to the statement, would every school be negatively impacted without this cash? Well, each and every school budget would take a hit. Hunt had the analysis to prove his point. We rate this claim True.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Vance Smith']","
Georgia roads are among America's best, state officials say
","
Vance Smith, the plain-spoken commissioner of Georgia’s Transportation Department, had an interesting story to tell state lawmakersabout the condition of the Peach State’s roads.

Smith said he was at a conference a year or so ago,sitting quietly near the back of the room, when a top transportation official from Missouri told the audience how they are trying to improve their roads -- mentioning that they measure themselves against a certain state from the South.

""At the top, there was a long, red line, and as I looked, it had the word ‘Georgia’ besides there,"" Smith said during a Jan. 19 state budget hearing at the Capitol. ""It made me feel pretty good in a conference that this gentleman is trying to reach this baseline and the baseline was the state of Georgia.""

So are Georgia’s roads really that good?

GDOT officials have boasted in some cases, like a January 2010 press release, that ""Georgia’s
highways have consistently been rated among the nation’s best maintained highways.""

GDOT spokesman David Spear told us that Georgia’s roads are ""some of the best maintained"" in America.

Other motorists, particularly in the Atlanta area, may raise their eyebrows at GDOT’s claim. Shirley Franklin created a ""pothole strike team"" during the early days of her first term as Atlanta mayor to deal with the tire nuisance that seemed to be on virtually every city street. WGCL-TV in Atlanta has a reporter, Harry Samler, who searches for potholes and presses the public officials in charge to fill them.

So should we really all go out and burn rubber?

We asked Smith’s office about what is Missouri using to measure itself that ranks Georgia at the top.

Spear pointed to a couple of organizations that conduct research on road conditions by each state. The most recent report was completed in September 2010 by the conservative-leaning Reason Foundation, based in Washington, D.C. The foundation’s report ranked Georgia ninth in overall performance, using data from 2008. Interestingly, Missouri, the state Smith recalled that was trying to catch up to Georgia, finished one spot ahead of the Peach State in the overall rankings.

The Reason Foundation researchers used data that compiles how much money each state spends, on average, to maintain its roads and bridges. It used information sent by each state to the federal government about the percentage of its interstate and rural roads in poor condition, traffic congestion, the percentage of bridges in bad shape and fatality rates.

The Reason report, and others, focus primarily on road conditions on interstate highways, state roads, bridges and other busy thoroughfares. The lumpy lanes in some subdivisions don’t count.

Georgia was tied for first in three categories: rural interstate pavement condition, rural principal arterial condition and urban interstate condition. The Peach State scored its lowest (39th) in capital spending on bridges, was 37th in total disbursements per mile and was 31st in urban interstate congestion -- although the foundation observed that Georgia had improved in that area from the prior year. Georgia was 15th in the percentage of its bridges that were deficient or obsolete.

Spear said money for road maintenance has been a problem in recent years.

""Frankly, as our financial resources have declined steadily in recent years, it has become problematic for the department to maintain that high level of maintenance, particularly on the secondary road system,"" Spear said. ""We simply don’t have the resources.""

Georgia fared well in another rating system of road toughness: the International Roughness Index. The index uses a formula created by the United States National Cooperative Highway Research Program that was continued by the World Bank to measure road quality.Each state conducts research of its roads and sends the findings to the Federal Highway Administration. The findings are measured against prior data to measure for consistency. In 2008, the most recent data available, more than 90 percent of Georgia’s rural, urban minor arterial and urban collector roads were considered good or smooth. Georgia was the only state to finish above 90 percent in each category.

Frank Moretti, director of policy and research for TRIP, a national transportation research group based in Washington, D.C., believes the research about Georgia. He said one reason why most Georgia roads are in good condition is because of the climate, which damages state roads less than in most states.

He added: ""The state in the past has tried to use materials and designs that were longer lasting. The challenge is to keep them in that condition with the dollars being stretched further and further.""

TRIP and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials released a report in 2009 on the nation’s roads. It found Georgia drivers spend less ($44) than motorists in any state on additional vehicle operating costs due to rough roads.

Georgia, Moretti said, has fewer urbanized roads, which helps the Peach State score well. Georgia’s population growth, particularly in metro Atlanta, may make it tougher for it to remain high on the list.

""I think traffic congestion is the greatest challenge the state faces to maintain a level of mobility that is going to maintain economic development,"" he said.

OK, where does this leave us?

Georgia is tops in some road maintenance categories. Its score in the Reason Foundation report was weighed down by data that found Georgia spends less money than most states in some road maintenance areas. Traffic congestion, where Georgia scored lower than most states, does result in more wear and tear on its roads. Spear, the GDOT spokesman, contends that congestion is important but does not address the overall condition of the road.

Georgia does rank high in nearly all measures of road maintenance. We rate the commissioner’s comments about Georgia’s roads as True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/07/vance-smith/georgia-roads-are-among-americas-best-state-offici/
