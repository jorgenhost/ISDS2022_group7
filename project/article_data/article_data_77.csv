Donald Trump exaggerates US energy independence
","President Donald Trump, eager to make good on a campaign promise to end the United States’ reliance on foreign energy, claimed a premature victory. ""We are ending decades of foreign energy reliance to unleash the blessings of American energy independence,"" Trump said Sept. 12 at a dinner with the House Republican Conference in Baltimore.  Moments later, Trump declared: ""We are very energy independent."" While it’s not accurate to say the United States has already kicked its reliance on foreign sources of energy, the country is moving in this direction. The White House did not define energy independence when we asked. So we'll go with the generally agreed upon definition: producing as much energy as is consumed domestically. Several recent months have seen U.S. energy production outstrip consumption — which supports Trump’s claim. But overall, the data cuts against the notion that the United States is ""very energy independent."" In the first five months of 2019, the United States used more energy than it produced. Specifically, the country produced 41.5 quadrillion British thermal units of energy, but consumed 42.1 quadrillion BTUs, according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration.  Some individual months have seen the United States achieve ""energy independence,"" in the sense of producing more energy than Americans consumed. Two months in fall 2018 did so, and the United States produced more than it consumed in April and May of this year.  The United States has been a net energy importer since 1953. But according to the Energy Information Administration, that’s likely to soon change. The EIA projects that with continued growth in American petroleum and natural gas exports, plus slow growth in U.S. energy consumption, the country is on track to become a net energy exporter by next year. Data from the last decade points to the country trending in that direction too. The gap between U.S. energy production and consumption has been narrowing for some time, and achieved even greater parity during Trump's presidency.  That said, some experts argue it’s not in the United States’ best interest to be totally disengaged from the foreign energy market — for instance, when hurricanes in the Gulf threaten domestic sources.  ""Without energy imports, we could not run our system optimally,"" said Frank Verrastro, an energy and national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Still, given Trump’s campaign promise to achieve energy independence, he’s eager to claim a victory — and his claim may be on ever sturdier ground as Election Day 2020 approaches. But to say the United States right now is ""very energy independent"" is a touchdown celebration before reaching the end zone. Trump said the United States is ""very energy independent."" It’s somewhat premature to label the United States energy independent given that Americans consumed more energy than the country produced for most of the last year that we have data. But the gap between U.S. energy production and consumption has been narrowing for some time, particularly during Trump’s presidency, and data shows several recent months where production outpaced American energy use.  We rate this Half True.",/factchecks/2019/sep/13/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-us-energy-independence/

Tucker Carlson falsely claims John Bolton was ‘man of the left’
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson celebrated the departure of former national security adviser John Bolton, saying the mustachioed war hawk was actually a lefty. ""If you’re wondering why so many progressives are mourning Bolton’s firing tonight, it’s because Bolton himself fundamentally was a man of the left,"" Carlson said Sept. 10 on his show. Carlson said Bolton was ""one of the most progressive people in the Trump administration"" and alleged that he ""promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council."" ""There was not a human problem John Bolton wasn’t totally convinced could be solved with the brute force of government,"" Carlson said. ""That’s an assumption of the left, not the right."" ""Don’t let the moustache fool you,"" he added. But it’s Carlson’s claims about the former national security adviser that are ridiculous. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.) First, a note about ideologies: In the United States, we tend to associate the terms ""left"" and ""right"" with the Democratic and the Republican Parties, respectively. In that context, Carlson’s claim is ""nonsense,"" said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University, who previously served on staff for the Senate Democratic policy committee and the House Democratic caucus task force on Central America. ""Obviously it’s wrong if you’re defining it in terms of Democratic versus Republican politics,"" added Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, chief executive officer of Valens Global, a counter-terrorism consulting firm, and a former advisor for the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Community Partnerships under both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump. ""There’s no question that, based on the American political context, he would be considered a man of the right,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. That’s because Bolton has spent his entire career in conservative circles and served in every GOP presidential administration going back to President Ronald Reagan, LeoGrande said. Here are just a few examples of Bolton’s work prior to joining the Trump administration: • In high school, Bolton volunteered to campaign for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who lost to President Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 general election. • Bolton spent the 1972 summer between law school semesters interning for Vice President Spiro Agnew of President Richard Nixon’s administration. • Bolton joined the Reagan administration in the Agency for International Development in 1981, serving a year as general counsel and a year in an administrative role. He later moved to Reagan’s Justice Department, where he was the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs from 1985 to 1988 and assistant attorney general for a year in 1988.  • Bolton took over in 1989 as the State Department’s assistant secretary for international organization affairs under President George H.W. Bush. He held that post until 1993. • Bolton served in 2005 as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, who appointed him on a ""recess appointment"" after the Republican-led Senate did not confirm his nomination. • Bolton flirted with running for president in 2012 before endorsing Sen. Mitt Romney. • Bolton worked for the conservative American Enterprise Institute and contributed to the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, for multiple years. He was also a contributor at Fox News, earning a salary of roughly $569,000 in 2017, per the Washington Post. • Bolton created a super PAC in 2013 that contributed millions of dollars to Republican congressional candidates in 2014, 2016 and 2018.  Best known for his foreign policy views, Bolton has criticized international institutions like the United Nations and called for a more aggressive stance toward hostile countries such as North Korea and Iran. He was an outspoken critic of Obama, penning op-eds, a number of tweets and a book about his policies. But Bolton’s hawkishness — which Carlson described as a preference for ""the brute force of government"" — does not make him liberal, LeoGrande said. ""In the foreign policy field, Bolton’s speciality, the interventionists have been conservative Republicans."" ""From Central America in the 1980s to the Middle East today, conservatives have been the ones who think that the United States can get its abroad way by ‘brute force,’"" he said. Here are some of Bolton’s recent statements about foreign policy: • In a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Bolton argued in favor of preemptively striking North Korea: ""It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ‘necessity’ posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons by striking first."" • In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton called for military action against Iran: ""Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure. The inconvenient truth is that only military action … can accomplish what is required."" • In a 2015 interview with the Washington Examiner, Bolton said he still believes invading Iraq was the right move: ""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct."" • In a 2017 Telegraph op-ed, Bolton said Russia’s interference in U.S. elections is ""a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate."" • In an address at the 2018 CPAC conservative conference, Bolton called for a ""massive military buildup"" and ""a comprehensive national debate on why preventing China from becoming the dominant world power"" should be a top concern for Americans. • In a 2018 address, Bolton said Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua represent a ""troika of tyranny"" and announced new sanctions against Venezuela. We also found no evidence to support Carlson’s claim that Bolton ""promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council."" (The NSC did not respond to requests for comment.) The Washington Post and Politico detailed the shuffling that occurred after Bolton took over as national security adviser. Many officials left their posts, while others were moved to new roles. Bolton left some openings vacant and filled others with people from outside of government. For example, Bolton brought on Mauricio Claver-Carone, a political fundraiser and lobbyist, to replace a CIA officer as the NSC director for Latin America, according to the Washington Post.  Similarly, he gave Richard Goldberg, an adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a key post focused on Iran. He had Charles Kupperman, a former defense industry executive who once worked for Reagan, appointed as deputy national security adviser. But none of them were ""Obama loyalists,"" as far as we could tell. On the contrary, LeoGrande said Claver-Carone ""denounced Obama’s opening to Cuba and has a long history of lobbying for the hardline foreign policy positions of the Cuban-American right."" Plus, government bureaucracies like the NSC are often full of career government officials who stay on staff from one administration to the next, Gartenstein-Ross said. ""If someone has served in the Obama administration, that doesn’t mean they’re an Obama loyalist,"" he said. ""It’s very typical for career civil servants to serve across administrations."" Carlson said Bolton ""fundamentally was a man of the left."" Bolton spent his whole career in Republican politics, and experts said his views have always tilted more to the American right than left.  We found no proof that he had elevated ""Obama loyalists,"" either.

Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order?
","Gun control is yet again — tragically — up for debate in Wisconsin. After mass shootings at an El Paso Walmart and a Dayton, Ohio, entertainment district left 31 dead, Wisconsin leaders have raised questions about ""loopholes"" in state law. Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation in August 2019 that would require background checks for nearly all gun sales. Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, has threatened to call a special session on the matter if Republican legislative leaders don’t take up the bill. This comes as 80% of state residents support universal background checks — including 75% of gun owners — according to a Marquette University Law School Poll conducted in mid-August. So how is that different from what Wisconsin has now? The state’s Democratic attorney general offered an example. ""Because we don’t have universal background checks, people who are a danger to others — including people who have been convicted of a dangerous felony or are subject to a domestic violence restraining order — currently can buy a firearm without going through a background check,"" Josh Kaul said in an Aug. 15, 2019, tweet. State Sen. Jennifer Shilling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day. Can someone in those circumstances really purchase a gun without a background check? A convicted felon, or someone with an active restraining order connected to domestic violence, would not pass a criminal background check to qualify for a firearm purchase. Such background checks are required under federal law for any purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearm Licenses dealer — which would include any retailers or others engaged in gun sales as a profession. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. This two-pronged system covers the ""vast majority"" of firearm purchases in the state, Kaul said in an Aug. 9, 2019, appearance on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now."" This is the process gun rights advocates refer to when noting background checks already exist.  But it’s not the only way to buy a gun. A 2015 study found 22% of gun owners bought their most recent firearm without going through a background check. That’s because gun sales in Wisconsin between private parties (those without a federal firearms license) aren’t subject to reporting, waiting period or background check requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving dealers. And Wisconsin is one of 29 states that does not impose any state-level regulations either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization that seeks ""laws, policies, and programs proven to save lives from gun violence.""  Websites such as Armslist — a Craigslist-style firearms marketplace — connect private sellers and are heavily used. A search in September 2019 showed more than 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin.  Two guns used in high-profile shootings here were purchased through Armslist by people under court orders not to possess guns. In October 2012, Radcliffe Haughton killed three people including his estranged wife and injured four others, before killing himself at Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield. A day before the shooting he purchased a .40-caliber handgun in the parking lot of a Germantown McDonald’s after connecting with the seller on Armslist. Two days before that, a judge had issued a restraining order that barred Haughton from owning a gun. In January 2018, Robert Schmidt bought a Glock 9 mm handgun from a 19-year-old man through Armslist, days after he was released from the Calumet County jail on a bond that prohibited him from having a gun. The transaction took place in a Walmart parking lot. Schmidt was charged at the time with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun to kill his wife and then himself at a home just outside Appleton. Kaul said felons and people subject to domestic abuse restraining orders are currently able to buy guns in Wisconsin without going through a background check. All purchases from firearms dealers are subject to state and federal requirements that include a criminal background check. But Kaul is right that Wisconsin is among the states with no oversight of gun sales between private parties. That has allowed people in the circumstances he described to buy guns, in some cases with tragic results.

Do 50 million people really lose health coverage each year because of their jobs?
","The moderators kicked off the third Democratic debate with health care, teeing up another round of the ongoing ""Medicare for All"" debate.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders caught our attention by claiming that 50 million people lose their private insurance every year due to employment changes.  ""George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy,"" Sanders said. That sounds like a huge number even before he qualified it by attributing it to job loss and other work-related occasions for an insurance lapse. We reached out to the Sanders’ campaign to find out the basis for this claim, and they pointed to an analysis by the People’s Policy Project, a social democratic-leaning think-tank. That analysis hinges on a question asked as part of a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey in 2014, plus a little basic multiplication. The survey asked adults between the ages of 18 and 64, in 43 states: ""In the PAST 12 MONTHS was there any time when you did NOT have ANY health insurance or coverage?"" In response, 12.9% said they had experienced a gap in coverage, while 11.5% said they had been uninsured for more than 12 months. The think-tank analysis then combined those percentages and multiplied them by current population estimates, coming up with ""just under 50 million people"" who were uninsured for at least part of the year. (It went on to endorse ""Medicare for All."") This claim becomes perplexing when you consider the total number of uninsured people in recent years. In 2013, there were more than 44 million uninsured, non-elderly Americans in total. With the initial implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that number steadily declined until last year when it ticked up slightly to 27.5 million.  A Sanders spokeswoman also cited another People’s Policy Project blog post analyzing the number of people who leave their jobs (66.1 million in 2018, it said) and government data on the number of jobs the average worker has had by age 50 (11.9). The campaign specifically pointed to this sentence in the blog post: ""This labor turnover data leaves little doubt that people with employer-sponsored insurance are losing that insurance constantly, as are their spouses and kids."" The CDC data is compelling, to be sure — but Sanders did not accurately portray what it said on the debate stage, nor did he accurately portray the policy analysis his campaign claimed was his source. Sanders appears to suggest that one-third of those with private insurance are uninsured for at least a short time every year because of a change to their employment benefits. In actuality, the CDC data show that about 24.4% of non-elderly adults in 2014 had experienced at least a gap in insurance coverage in the previous year. The question did not ask respondents to specify the cause. The age of the report also poses a challenge: The Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion began in 2014, and the report surveyed just 23 Medicaid expansion states at the time. Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, suggesting the number of people with insurance gaps on an annual basis could have dropped. And the People’s Policy Project analysis actually refers broadly to 50 million non-elderly Americans who were uninsured, temporarily or otherwise -- it doesn’t say those people were uninsured because their job situation changed. Sanders said that 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year ""when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy.""  Sanders has a point that coverage continuity is a big problem in a country where roughly 150 million get their insurance from their jobs. But his claim inflates the scope of the problem].  He took a broad finding about the number of people who had experienced an insurance gap for any reason roughly five years ago and misleadingly used it to describe a much narrower segment of the current population who lost insurance because of employment changes.  The claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression.

Fact-checking Biden on use of cages for immigrants during Obama administration
","Joe Biden claimed that a key difference between the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump is that Obama didn’t ""lock people up in cages."" During the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate in Houston, Univision anchor and debate co-moderator asked Biden why Latinos should trust him given the millions of deportations under Obama’s presidency, when Biden served as vice president. ""What Latinos should look at is, comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one,"" Biden said. ""We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things, number one."" We’ve noted that Obama did not have a policy to separate families arriving illegally at the border, and that separations under Trump happened systematically as a result of his administration’s policy to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally. But Biden mentioned ""cages,"" specifically, and reporting from the time he was vice president described an enclosure for migrant children with that word. Controversial use of ‘cages’ description The term ""cages"" has continuously been used by Democrats in attacks against Trump and the detention of immigrants arriving at the border. The Trump administration says that the facilities it uses are not cages. The description has been used to refer to chain-link enclosures holding immigrants at border processing facilities during both the Obama and Trump administrations.  Notably, critics of Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy that resulted in family separations circulated a photo that purportedly showed children face down on the floor behind a chain-link enclosure during Trump’s tenure. However, the photo was from 2014 when Obama was president. Our fact-check showed the Associated Press photo was taken in 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection facility in Nogales, Ariz. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article centered on an influx of children arriving at the border unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. The Arizona Republic article, in part, said:  ""They are undocumented. They entered the country illegally. And when they were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they were shipped to Nogales from overwhelmed processing facilities in Texas. ""But they are still children in cages, not gangsters, not delinquents. Just children, 900 of them, in a makeshift border-town processing center that is larger than a football field."" The article adds that the children are ""housed behind 18-foot-high chain-link fences topped with razor wire.""  Additional description of the enclosure said: ""Nylon tarps, tied to the fences, provide a modicum of privacy between the groups. They share the kind of portable toilets used at fairs and construction sites, placed inside the cages and vented with clothes-dryer hoses."" Reporting from the Los Angeles Times in 2014 referred to enclosures keeping immigrant children as ""makeshift cages."" Here are other 2014 photos, from Getty Images, of children kept within chain-link enclosures. For comparison, here’s a 2018 photo provided by Customs and Border Protection, of immigrants in a similar chain-link enclosure. Jeh Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary during the Obama administration, in media interviews and at other forums has been asked about the use of cages during the Obama administration. During a June 2019 interview at an event by The Aspen Institute, Johnson was asked to speak about a photo that depicts him ""walking past what appears to be children in cages."" ""Very clearly, chain link, barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on Jan. 20, 2017, okay,"" Johnson said, adding that the photo was taken during a spike in the arrival of migrant children, and that under the law, children have to be transferred within 72 hours to the Health and Human Services department. ""But during that 72-hour period, when you have something that is a multiple, like four times, of what you’re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you’ve got to find places quickly to put kids. You can’t just dump 7-year-old kids on the streets of McAllen or El Paso. And so these facilities were erected, that one I think was a large warehouse, and they put those chain-link partitions up so you could segregate young women from young men from, you know, kids from adults, until they are either released or transferred to HHS. Is it ideal? Of course not."" Johnson addressed the photo from 2014 again the next month on CBS’ Face the Nation. Johnson said in part, ""the partitions you see, some call them cages, are meant to separate the women from the men, the girls from the boys. But these were temporary."" Our ruling Biden said the Obama administration ""didn't lock people up in cages."" Immigration policies of Obama and Trump are very different. Trump’s administration implemented a policy that led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. Obama did not have that policy. But for Biden to say that Obama’s administration did not put people in cages is inaccurate. Obama and Biden in 2014 saw an influx of children arriving at the border without a parent or guardian, and reporting from 2014 by the Arizona Republic referred to a chain-link enclosure holding children as ""cages."" A former Homeland Security secretary under the Obama administration in interviews has acknowledged that some have described as ""cages"" the enclosures used during Obama’s tenure. There’s a debate on whether a chain-link enclosure is a ""cage"" and whether applying that term to those structures is subjective. But the term certainly was used in 2014 to describe enclosures used by Obama’ administration.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren conflated votes on assault weapons, background checks
","Sen.

""And unless we're willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster we're not going to get anything done on guns,"" Warren said during the Democratic debate in Houston. ""I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster."" Not all of those points are accurate. Her campaign staff told us Warren meant to refer only to background checks. Fewer than 50 senators supported banning assault weapons. In April 2013, a few months after the Sandy Hook shooting, lawmakers took up votes on multiple gun control measures. All of them failed. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, teamed up with Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey on the legislation, which came to be known as the Manchin-Toomey amendment.  The amendment called for expanding the checks to gun shows and internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. It was seen as a compromise to replace a stricter measure from Majority Leader Harry Reid. The compromise amendment still fell short in a mostly partisan vote, when it was defeated 54-46. Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass. On the same day, an assault weapons ban measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., failed when it received 40 votes. Fifteen members of her own Democratic Party (plus one independent) voted against the ban. At the time, Democrats held 53 seats in the Senate, two independents caucused with the Democrats, and 45 senators were Republicans. A spokeswoman for Warren said that her reference to 54 votes was for that Manchin-Toomey amendment. In a Medium essay in August, Warren wrote that the Senate voted down an assault weapons ban and ""rejected a background checks proposal, even though 54 Senators from both parties voted for it, because of a right-wing-filibuster. These were the bare minimum steps we needed to take. And six years later, Congress still hasn’t done a thing."" Warren said ""54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators it failed because of the filibuster."" Warren was referring to votes on gun control legislation on April 17, 2013.

Julian Castro’s attack on Joe Biden for forgetting his health care plan falls flat
","One of the most explosive moments of the Democratic debate in Houston was the face-off between former cabinet secretary Julian Castro and former Vice President Joe Biden over health care. Castro accused Biden of changing his position in short order about the contours of his health care plan. ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?"" Castro asked Biden — a line that drew criticism from some commentators for suggesting that Biden, at 76, is having memory problems. A look at the exchange and at Biden’s health care plan suggest that Castro is exaggerating any differences between Biden’s plan and his own, and is misleadingly interpreting what Biden said during the debate. Let’s first look at Castro’s attack and Biden’s parries of his criticism: CASTRO: ""The problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. … The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. That’s a big difference. Because Barack Obama’s vision was not to leave 10 million uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not."" BIDEN: ""They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.""  CASTRO: ""You just said that! You just said that two minutes ago!""  BIDEN: ""No.""  CASTRO: ""You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in!""  BIDEN: ""I said if they cannot afford it!"" CASTRO: ""You said they would have to buy in!""  BIDEN: ""They would not have to buy in. If you qualified for Medicaid, they would automatically be enrolled.""  CASTRO: ""Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago? I mean, I can’t believe you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you’re saying you don’t have to buy in. You’re forgetting that!"" BIDEN: ""I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money, you’re automatically enrolled."" CASTRO: ""It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.""   BIDEN: ""That'll be a surprise to him.""   Castro’s criticism falls into two categories. We’ll look at them both. Biden does require those who want Medicare coverage to ""opt in,"" but this requirement is not nearly as significant as Castro makes it seem. As described on his campaign website, Biden’s health care plan advocates ""giving Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option like Medicare. If your insurance company isn’t doing right by you, you should have another, better choice. Whether you’re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare."" Biden’s plan would ""ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He’ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions, such as public schools, or other programs for low-income populations, such as SNAP,"" or food stamps. This tracks with what Biden said at one point in the debate — that ""anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have."" On the surface, this is a difference with Castro’s plan. Castro’s proposal would ""strengthen Medicare for those who have it, and expand it to achieve universal healthcare coverage by including all Americans within the program."" Castro would ""allow individuals to obtain supplementary private insurance or opt out of Medicare if they have a high-standard private insurance plan through an employer or organization that is regulated under the Affordable Care Act."" But Castro’s opt-out plan and Biden’s opt-in plan don’t seem significantly different. Castro makes it sound like Biden’s opting-in process would be a noteworthy barrier. More likely, it would amount to a formality. Anyone who wanted the public option would have to request it and, presumably, sign forms like every other person seeking health insurance. But the important part is that they could not be rejected after they fill out those forms.  The distinction between filling out the paperwork to become part of the public option (as Biden would have it) and automatically becoming enrolled unless you actively reject it (which would, at some point, also require different paperwork) does not strike us as the ""big difference"" Castro touted. Castro’s second line of attack was that Biden initially said people would have to opt in to Medicare and then later changed his tune and said they wouldn’t have to opt in. Biden did say at several points before Castro challenged him that enrollment would be automatic — essentially a formality. Biden said that ""anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.""  He also said, ""If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance — from your employer — you automatically can buy into this. No pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period."" And Biden also said, ""Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately."" These are consistent with Biden’s response to Castro’s attack, that Americans who need the Medicare option would ""automatically be enrolled."" Castro said, ""The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in (to a Medicare public option), and I would not require them to opt in. … They would automatically be enrolled. That’s a big difference."" He also suggested Biden was contradicting what he’d said moments before. Castro’s plan is an opt-out plan while Biden’s is an opt-in plan, but the differences between those are much less than Castro suggests. Biden’s plan would guarantee Americans who are in need access to Medicare coverage, just like Castro’s would. The differences would likely amount to the nature or timing of paperwork, rather than being significant barriers to access. Castro used this questionable distinction to charge that Biden had said opposing things within two minutes, but that’s an exaggeration at best.  The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/sep/13/julian-castro/julian-castro-attack-joe-bidens-health-plan-falls-/

Biden exaggerated the percentage of Americans who favor an assault weapons ban
","Former Vice President Joe Biden exaggerated the percentage of Americans who support banning assault rifles. ""Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street — period,"" Biden said during the Democratic presidential debate in Houston Sept. 12. Biden was responding to a moderator’s question about his failure to get an expanded background check bill passed after the Sandy Hook school mass shooting in 2012.  The recent polls we found showed that a majority of Americans support banning assault weapons, but by a much smaller margin than Biden cited. A 1994 law barred the ""manufacture, transfer, and possession"" of about 118 firearm models and all magazines holding over 10 rounds. The ban expired in 2004. Efforts to renew the ban have been unsuccessful, but Biden has vowed to champion a ban. We looked at the results of five polls taken after the early August mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. We limited our search to that time period because the question by debate moderator David Muir mentioned the El Paso shooting. Overall, polls showed between 56% and 70% of people back a ban on assault rifles. Polls showed higher support among Democrats. Politico/Morning Consult poll: Nearly 70% of all voters would back a ban on assault rifles. (In a New York Times op-ed in August, Biden cited that statistic.) More than 91 percent supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. Fox News poll: 67% supported banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. The poll found 90% support for background checks on all gun buyers including at shows and private sales. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll: 57% said Congress should pass a ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault guns such as the AK-47 or the AR-15. The poll found 83% support for requiring background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales Washington Post/ABC News poll: 56% support a ban on the sale of assault weapons. 89% support requiring background checks for all potential gun buyers. HuffPost/YouGov poll: 59% favor an assault weapons ban and 81% favored background checks. We asked the Biden campaign for his evidence and did not hear back immediately. We wondered whether Biden was referring to the percentage of Americans who support expanding background checks, which was in the ballpark of 90% in many polls. Biden said ""over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street ⁠— period."" We looked at five polls following the El Paso and Dayton shootings in early August.

A viral post claims fish in Alaska are getting cancer because of Fukushima. They aren't
","A widely shared Facebook post is trying to connect the Japanese nuclear disaster to an increase in cancer among marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia. The post, which was published Sept. 8, displays three photos of sharks and fish with apparent tumors or lesions on their skin.  ""Sharks are being found with massive cancerous tumors on their bodies. Salmon caught off the coast of Alaska are riddled with cancer,"" the post reads. ""Fukushima has been seeping radioactivity into our oceans daily since 2011, and the oceans are extremely sick because of it.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it’s been shared nearly 2,000 times, so we wanted to check it out. The Fukushima nuclear disaster came after a tsunami hit the eastern coast of Japan in 2011, killing more than 18,000 people. The accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant between Tokyo and Sendai and resulted in the meltdown of three reactors. It was the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. While sharks and fish are capable of getting cancerous tumors, the photos in the post are misleading. None have been directly linked to Fukushima, and there’s little evidence to suggest that fish far from Japan have been affected by the disaster. We did reverse image searches for each of the photos included in the Facebook post. The first image, which shows a shark with what appear to be tumors around its mouth, dates back to at least 2013. That’s when a website called Live Science published it as part of a story about why sharks get cancer. ""It's unknown what caused the tumors in the great white or bronzer shark,"" Live Science wrote of the photo. ""However, reports of cancerous tumors in marine animals, especially mammals, have steadily increased over the past 20 years, raising concerns that industrial pollutants or human activities may trigger the cancers."" The story — which was based on a 2013 study — doesn’t mention Fukushima specifically or nuclear disasters more broadly as having an effect. (Screenshot from Facebook) The second photo, which shows a fish with a lesion on its skin, is at least seven years old. We found it in a story published by the website ZME Science in November 2012, which covered how Canadian researchers had found contaminants near oil sands operations.  The third image included in the Facebook post is a little more ambiguous. A search for it using TinEye, a tool that searches the internet for images, surfaced a 2012 Al Jazeera story about the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It reported that the image shows a shrimp with mutations as a result of the spill. None of the stories mentioned nuclear radioactivity as having contributed to the lesions. The Facebook post took three photos out of context. But does it have a larger point about the effect of Fukushima on fish? Generally, no, but the answer is a little more complicated. The post specifically mentions salmon off the coast of Alaska as being ""riddled with cancer."" But a public statement from the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation rebuts that, saying testing results have not indicated measurable levels of Fukushima-related radionuclides — radioactive atoms — in Alaskan seafood. ""(The Food and Drug Administration) has found no evidence that radionuclides of health concern from the Japanese nuclear power plant disaster are present in the U.S. food supply,"" the statement reads. Some scientists have found salmon with trace amounts of cesium 134 — a radioactive element specifically associated with the Fukushima disaster — in Canadian waters. But the levels were 10,000 times lower than health safety guidelines. As for the Great Barrier Reef, another area specifically mentioned in the post, the link between Fukushima and fish is just as weak. In a public statement published by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, officials said they hadn’t detected any substantial radioactivity off the coast. ""Ongoing monitoring programs are in place that continue to monitor for the Fukushima signature, but it is expected that by the time it reaches Australian waters, the radioactive material will have been diluted to such low levels that it will be undetectable,"" the statement reads. In this Aug. 26, 2013 photo, fisherman Fumio Suzuki sorts out fish he caught aboard his boat Ebisu Maru in the waters off Iwaki, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, Japan. (AP) Japan is a different story.  A 2012 study found elevated levels of cesium in fish directly off the coast of Fukushima, and the government banned the sale of certain species of sea life that surpassed 100 becquerels per kilogram. Those bans slowly tapered off until February of this year, when officials noticed a spike in cesium-tainted fish off the Fukushima coast. But since the disaster, the government has implemented a massive decontamination effort, which has preserved the safety of most of the country’s fish and agriculture. None of that is to say radioactive contamination of sea life outside Japan is impossible. Scientists and reporters studying the long-term effects of Fukushima warn that radiation will continue to seep into the Pacific Ocean for years to come. But as of now, those effects are measurable mostly in the waters right off the coast of the disaster site — and even there, most fish are safe to eat. A Facebook post claimed that several species of marine life near Alaska, Canada and Australia have been found with cancer, mutations and radiation as a result of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. None of the photos included in the post have been linked to radiation from the disaster, or even to Japan in general. Studies show that sharks and other marine life are capable of getting cancerous tumors and lesions, albeit not exclusively because of radiation. And while scientists have found elevated levels of radioactive elements in fish off the coast of Fukushima, most sea life is safe to consume — and officials in the U.S. and Australia have not found similar radiation. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/sep/11/facebook-posts/viral-post-claims-fish-alaska-are-getting-cancer-b/

It’s true: millions in dark money has been spent to tilt courts right
","After the Supreme Court agreed this term to hear a Second Amendment case brought by an NRA affiliate, several Senate Democrats cried foul. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and four other Democratic senators took the unusual step of filing a friend-of-the-court brief imploring the court’s conservative justices to resist right-wing activist pressure. These groups aim to reshape the judiciary to reflect their undisclosed financiers’ interests, the Democrats argued, on everything from expanding the Second Amendment to weakening unions and eroding voting rights. To influence the court’s composition, Whitehouse said, a combined $34 million in ""dark money"" went toward both blocking President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and confirming President Donald Trump’s two Supreme Court picks, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.  In a follow-up to the legal brief, Whitehouse in a Sept. 6 Washington Post op-ed described the money as follows:  ""One unnamed donor gave $17 million to the (Leonard) Leo-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network to block the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and to support Gorsuch; then a donor — perhaps the same one — gave another $17 million to prop up Kavanaugh.""  It can be difficult to trace the path of anonymous political spending with precision, and we wanted to know the factual basis for Whitehouse’s claim. The evidence we found about the money’s origins, and where it went, backed it up.  The Judicial Crisis Network is one of several organizations that comprise an opaque network of politically conservative nonprofit organizations who, under the IRS rules, are not required to disclose their donors. (Liberal groups also spend millions on Supreme Court battles, and which side spends more can be hard to track.) Whitehouse is correct that the Judicial Crisis Network received two donations from undisclosed backers to the tune of $17 million as the Supreme Court confirmation fights were underway. His office pointed us to an article by the transparency groups MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, which linked to the Judicial Crisis Network’s public disclosure documents for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  These documents showed a $17.9 million donation in 2016 followed by a $17.1 million donation the next year. Neither donor was revealed, so it’s possible they are the same person or group. Here’s how the contribution appeared in Judicial Crisis Network’s public disclosure from fiscal year 2017:    The Judicial Crisis Network is among several groups linked to activist Leonard Leo, who has advised President Donald Trump on his judicial picks — and who Whitehouse name-dropped in his op-ed. Leo is the executive vice president of the conservative and libertarian legal association the Federalist Society. But a Washington Post investigation described Leo’s influence in more sweeping terms, referring to him as ""the maestro of a network of interlocking nonprofits,"" who has ""harnessed the nation’s nonprofit system to influence judicial appointments that will shape the nation for decades."" The Judicial Crisis Network and Federalist Society did not respond to our requests for comment. Tax filings from the time of the Judicial Crisis Network’s creation in 2005 (then called the Judicial Confirmation Network) show it was based out of the home of Ann and Neil Corkery, who the Washington Post described as Leo’s ""close allies,"" and who have served in various capacities at other groups he’s affiliated with. One of those is the Wellspring Committee, which has donated millions to the Judicial Crisis Network. Both Neil and Ann Corkery have been listed at various times as the president of Wellspring. And according to MapLight, Daniel Casey, a director for Judicial Crisis Network, is the father of Wellspring director Michael Casey.  Like the Judicial Crisis Network, the Wellspring Committee was created under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, which means its donors can remain secret. But such organizations are required to disclose who they make grants to.   Wellspring reported a $14.8 million grant to the Judicial Crisis Network during its 2017 fiscal year. The previous year Wellspring gave the group $23.4 million. According to MapLight, between 2012 and 2015, Wellspring gave the Judicial Crisis Network more than $15 million. (Wellspring dissolved in December 2018.) Through the work of transparency groups like MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, more information has come to light about the relationship between Wellspring and the Judicial Crisis Network.  ""While we were able to piece together that Wellspring has been Judicial Crisis Network’s top donor many years, Wellspring is also a ‘dark money’ group so the ultimate source of funding remains hidden,"" Anna Massoglia of the Center for Responsive Politics told PolitiFact. ""Wellspring just adds an extra layer of insulation between Judicial Crisis Network and the donor or donors bankrolling the operation."" Whitehouse accurately described the Judicial Crisis Network’s role in the fight over two vacant Supreme Court seats. The group launched a seven-figure advertising campaign days after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016. The aim: to block Obama’s eventual nominee to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court.  ""Today, the Judicial Crisis Network is launching a ‘Let the People Decide’ advertising campaign,"" read a statement from the group’s head Carrie Severino. ""In this first phase, we want to thank the U.S. Senators who say that the American people should decide who picks the next Supreme Court justice.""   The ads applauded Republican senators like Chuck Grassley of Iowa, then-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who opposed holding confirmation hearings for Obama’s eventual nominee Judge Merrick Garland — which ultimately led to Scalia’s seat remaining vacant into Trump’s presidency.  According to a Judicial Crisis Network press release that has since been removed from their website, the group spent more than $7 million to block Garland’s nomination. The organization then pledged an additional $10 million to support the confirmation of Trump’s nominee Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed to the court on April 7, 2017. After Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court’s swing voter, announced his retirement in late June 2018, the Judicial Crisis Network prepared once again to spring into action. With Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh the following month, the group said it would spend at least $10 million on pro-Kavanaugh advertising — the same amount it spent in support of Gorsuch. Whitehouse said, ""One unnamed donor gave $17 million to the Leo-affiliated Judicial Crisis Network to block the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and to support Gorsuch; then a donor — perhaps the same one — gave another $17 million to prop up Kavanaugh."" Public disclosure documents show the Judicial Crisis Network received $17.9 million in fiscal year 2016 and $17.1 million the following year. Both came from an undisclosed source during confirmation fights over two vacant Supreme Court seats. (We were unable to determine if it was from a single donor.) Media reports show a number of connections and overlapping interests between the Judicial Crisis Network and the influential conservative activist Leonard Leo.   We rate this True.",/factchecks/2019/sep/11/sheldon-whitehouse/its-true-millions-dark-money-has-been-spent-tilt-c/

No, Ronald Reagan didn’t meet with the Taliban because the Taliban didn’t exist
","President Donald Trump recently announced that he called off talks with the Taliban, a meeting that was set to take place days before the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.  And while news of that planned meeting inspired criticism, a viral image circulating on social media suggests Trump wouldn’t have been the first U.S. president to have done so, had he gone through with it. In the image, former President Ronald Reagan is seated in the Oval Office with a group of men wearing turbans. ""NeverTrumpers,"" reads a Sept. 7 tweet that featured the photo, ""A president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!"" Besides being retweeted over 1,700 times, this flawed years-old claim also migrated to Facebook, where, in one version, text surrounding the image declares, ""Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ –Ronald Reagan, 1985."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s false on many counts. The men in the photo are not from the Taliban; the organization wasn’t created until years later, in the mid 1990s. Also, the photo was not taken in 1985, and Reagan didn’t compare the group in the photo to the Founding Fathers.  According to the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum, the photo was captured on Feb. 2, 1983, and shows Reagan meeting with Afghan ""freedom fighters"" in the Oval Office ""to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan."" The Reagan administration helped fund the Mujahideen to aid their fight against the Soviets. The U.S. pulled the funding after the Soviets retreated and later the Taliban was formed. So, while some of the Mujahideen may have become part of the Taliban a decade after the photo was taken, the two groups are not the same.  It’s not accurate that Reagan likened the pictured men to the Founding Fathers.  The quote’s likely origins are in in a speech Reagan delivered at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 1, 1985. But he wasn’t talking about the Taliban or the Afghan fighters seated with him in the photo. He was, in fact, talking about Nicaraguan rebels: ""I've spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they're fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance. We cannot turn away from them, for the struggle here is not right versus left; it is right versus wrong."" Social media posts claim a photo of President Reagan seated in the Oval Office shows him meeting with members of the Taliban. This is flat-out wrong.

Clinton visited Kosovo refugees, but ...
","As a way of burnishing her credentials to be commander in chief, Sen. Hillary Clinton made a number of claims during an interview with CNN, including, ""I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo.""
 
On May 14, 1999, first lady Clinton visited a refugee camp in Skopje, Macedonia, for ethnic Albanians leaving Kosovo. The trip received extensive press coverage focused on the plight of families trying to escape violence at the hands of Serbian forces.
 
""I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend to let the evil which (Yugoslavia President Slobodan) Milosevic perpetrated against these people keep them away from their homeland and their homes,"" Clinton said on the trip.
 
Hillary Clinton's campaign has put forward statements from former Bill Clinton administration officials about the importance of the trip. Richard C. Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Dayton Accords ending the war in Yugoslavia and is supporting Sen. Clinton's presidential bid, said the first lady pressed officials on her trip to keep borders open and then continued to lobby for refugees when she returned to Washington.
 
""After visiting refugees and gaining a first-hand assessment of the situation, the first lady had intense talks with President Gligorov and Prime Minister Georgievski,"" Holbrooke said in a written statement. ""In these talks, one in the Presidential Palace, another in the residence of the American Ambassador, Christopher Hill, Mrs. Clinton pressed the Macedonian government to fully open the border so that Kosovar Albanian refugees could flee the war zone to safety.""
 
The trip seemed more designed to gain media coverage than to conduct substantive diplomacy, however. Clinton visited the area for less than 12 hours, arriving at 9:20 a.m. and leaving at 5:45 p.m. According to the itinerary provided to news organizations, she arrived at the camp and was briefed on relief efforts at 10 a.m., toured the camp at 11 a.m., and met with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at 1:30 p.m.
 
Her meetings with officials appear to have been brief. Holbrooke is correct on some of the details he mentions, but the meetings all took place within the space of a single afternoon. The itinerary shows photo opportunities for the traveling press at 2:20 p.m. with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence; at 2:50 p.m. with President Kiro Gligorov at the president's residence; and at 3:30 p.m. with first lady Gligorov at the president's residence.
 
The

New York Times

reported that her visit to the camp was ""so carefully scripted that administration officials chose which refugees Mrs. Clinton would speak with.""
 
Macedonia opened its borders before Clinton visited, so it seems unlikely that she personally negotiated for border openings. But the Clinton administration wanted to make sure the borders stayed open amid concern that Macedonian officials were trying to keep refugees out. In this context, her trip suggests a diplomatic visit intended to reinforce U.S. goals in the region. In her biography

Living History

, she mentions her visit and describes it as supporting the administration's diplomatic agenda around the world, but she does not mention taking part in specific negotiations.
 
We tried and failed to find an independent expert who could speak to her role in negotiating open borders. Janusz Bugajski, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said via e-mail of her visit, ""No doubt she tried to help the plight of refugees, but whether she was mandated by President Clinton to speak on behalf of the U.S. administration concerning policy in the region one would need to ask the former president.""
 
Our reading of the record shows a good deal to suggest Clinton was concerned about the plight of the people of Kosovo, but almost nothing to indicate she was a major player in border negotiations. We'll give her the benefit of the doubt for traveling to Macedonia and meeting with officials, but the way her statement is phrased, it makes her sound primarily responsible for the United States' efforts in the region. We don't find evidence to support that aside from her less-than-12-hour visit, and so we find her statement to be Barely True.

A slight lead in popular vote
","After losing the Texas and Ohio primaries March 4, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama tried to downplay the losses by emphasizing that he leads Sen. Hillary Clinton in delegates and the popular vote.
 
""The bottom line is, we've won twice as many states. We've won a greater share of the popular vote,"" he said.
 
The first part is easy to assess. At the point when he made this comment, Obama had won primaries or caucuses in 25 states (including the District of Columbia), while Clinton had won 14 states (not counting Florida and Michigan). Obama's math is off, but he's in the ballpark. Still, he would have been more accurate if he said he had won

nearly

twice as many states.
 
The second part is a little trickier because some states that held caucuses — Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine — have not released popular vote totals. They've only released the percentage of the vote and the number of delegates won.
 
Also, the election results from Florida and Michigan are in limbo because the Democratic National Committee has not recognized the results from those states because they defied the DNC schedule. It's further complicated by the fact that Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan.
 
Adding up vote totals from the other contests, PolitiFact finds Obama to be ahead (as of March 7, 2008) by 13,002,527 to 12,413,052 if Michigan and Florida are not counted. He's also ahead by 13,578,741 to 13,284,038 if Florida is included but Michigan is not.
 
The only scenario in which Clinton is ahead is if Michigan is also included. She has 13,612,347 to Obama's 13,578,741.
 
We have to give thanks to

RealClearPolitics.com,

which tracks popular vote totals and provides links to results on state Web sites. We went to those individual sites and tallied the numbers on a spreadsheet.
 
Keep in mind, some states are still adding up votes and these numbers will change. Also, we completed these calculations before the March 8, 2008, Wyoming caucus, so those results are not included.
 
Back to Obama's claim: We find he has it mostly right. On the first part, he'd be better off hedging his claim on winning twice as many states as Clinton. But on the matter of popular vote, Obama is accurate. Though, to be fail-safe, he should have specified that he was excluding Michigan. Overall, we find his claim to be Mostly True.

20 years is an accurate count
","
In a race where his opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton has touted ""35 years of experience"" over and over, Sen. Barack Obama has begun to cite his own experience of 20 years.
 
At a debate in Cleveland, moderator Brian Williams asked Obama to respond to Clinton's charges that he was heavy on oratory and light on action. Obama responded:
 
""You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service.""
 
The voters will decide if the lesser number is significant, but we find Obama's claim of two decades' experience to be accurate.
 
To arrive at this number, we looked closely at Obama's official congressional biography, his professional resume and news articles chronicling his political rise in Illinois.
 
If Obama wins election and takes office in January 2009, he will have served four years in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois.
 
Before that, he was a state senator in Illinois for eight years. He also was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school during that time.
 
His schedule from the school shows him teaching two or three classes in the fall and winter terms — usually Constitutional Law III: Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process; Voting Rights and the Democratic Process; and Current Issues in Racism and the Law. In the spring, he would attend the Illinois legislative sessions. It seems a fairly safe bet that, like most legislators, his constituent work — fielding phone calls and helping people in his district — went on year round. Press reports indicate he did a small amount of private law practice during the summer. So that's eight years as a public official in Illinois, bringing our total to 12 years.
 
To get to 20 years of experience, we still need eight years from Obama's career prior to holding public office. Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983. He worked for a year as a financial analyst; in his memoir he said he spent his days behind a computer terminal, ""checking the Reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages across the globe"" and feeling like ""a spy behind enemy lines."" He gave up that job to go into community organizing, work he felt was more important politically. He worked three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. We won't count the junior-level business experience as working ""on behalf of families who are having a hard time,"" but the community organizing work does seem to fit the bill. That brings his work experience to 15 years.
 
At Harvard, Obama began to receive national attention. He became the first black president of the

Harvard Law Review

and was recruited heavily by law firms around the country. (He met his future wife, Michelle Robinson, as a summer associate at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin.)
 
He graduated in 1991. He ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992, and then accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. The firm specialized in political and civil rights work and neighborhood economic development work. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993. He was elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1996 and took office in 1997, so his full-time work after law school comprises five years. That gets us to 20 years.
 
(During these years, Obama also worked on his career as an author. His memoir

Dreams from my Father

was published in 1994 and reprinted after his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. A follow-up,

The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream

, was published in 2006. His personal financial disclosure statements show that those books earned him $1.8-million in 2005 and 2006, the majority of his income.)
 
The other part of Obama's claim is that his experience is ""on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream."" We take that to mean his experience is broadly in the field of public service, and that too is an accurate claim. The bulk of Obama's professional experience is either in elected office or working for a nonprofit, a university or a civil rights law firm.
 
Obama's 20 years of experience are 15 years short of Clinton's, but it's worth noting that Obama is 14 years younger than Clinton. Voters will decide whether the gap between 35 years and 20 years of experience is significant, but we find Obama's statement about his own experience to be True.

Straight talk, twisted
","The Democratic candidates and groups that oppose John McCain have been quoting the Arizona senator as saying the United States could be in Iraq for 1,000 years.
 
""John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq,"" Rose Forrest, an Iraq war veteran, says in an ad for VoteVets.org that aired in Washington, D.C., in late February and is still available on the Web. ""That's

uses humor to make the same point. It spoofs a pro-Obama music video called

. The parody has grainy footage of McCain saying, ""I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or 10,000 years"" and ends with these words on the screen: ""IRAQ WITHDRAWAL DATE: 12,008 . . . . GOOD LUCK WITH THAT IN NOVEMBER."" (We're not putting the parody to the Truth-O-Meter, but it's worth checking out to see a funny perspective on McCain's comments.)
 
Sen. Barack Obama made a similar charge (but without the catchy music) during the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, when he said, ""We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years.""
 
The videos and Obama's statement made us wonder about the full context of McCain's remarks and whether the comments were portrayed accurately. We've previously addressed Sen. Hillary Clinton's claim about the 100-year remark with

this item,

but McCain has elaborated since then. So in this article, we will examine the new claims.
 
It's well known that McCain has been a strong supporter of the Iraq war, even when his position harmed his presidential campaign. At a town hall in Derry, N.H., on Jan. 3, 2008, McCain was glib about the need for a long-term U.S. commitment:
 
QUESTION: ""President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — ""
 
McCAIN: ""Make it a hundred.""
 
Q: ""Is that — ""
 
McCAIN: ""We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al-Qaida is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day.""
 
Three days later, he was asked about the remark on CBS's

Face the Nation.

He likened the future U.S. role in Iraq to other nations where the United States has a military presence:
 
""My point was and continues to be, how long do we have to stay in Bosnia? How long do we have to stay in South Korea? How long are we going to stay in Japan? How long are we going to stay in Germany? All of those, 50-, 60-year period. No one complains. In fact, they contribute enormously, their presence, to stability in the world,"" McCain said.
 
""The point is, it's American casualties. We've got to get Americans off the front line, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more of the responsibilities. And then I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that's American blood. So what I'm saying is look, if Americans are there in a support role, but they're not taking casualties, that's fine.""
 
When McCain was asked about the remark Jan. 9 on ABC's

Good Morning America,

he said the U.S. presence could last 1-million years:
 
""Could be 1,000 years or a million years,"" he said. ""We have bases in Kuwait right now. We have bases in South Korea and Japan, Germany. I mean (the allegation by critics is) a straw man. It's a fallacious argument by people who don't understand that it's not American presence, it's American casualties. If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them, Americans are not concerned — in fact, they may be glad we have a secure base in that part of the world as we do in Kuwait.""
 
The interviews show McCain is not advocating that the war in Iraq continue for a thousand years (or a million). But once combat ends and U.S. casualities dwindle, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Germany. That presence could continue for many years.
 
Clinton correctly described the first remark by saying ""Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years."" We gave that a

True.

 
But Obama twisted McCain's words in the Cleveland debate. He said, ""We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years.""
 
As we explain above, McCain was referring to a peacetime presence, not the war. So we find Obama's statement False.

"['Environment', 'National', 'Sierra Club']","
He was campaigning, not ducking
","In his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Arizona Sen. John McCain hasn't shied away from citing his differences with Republican orthodoxy on the environment. On the campaign trail, for example, he's touted a Senate bill he is sponsoring to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to combat global warming.
 
It's a bill that has won McCain lots of friends in the environmental movement. So it was something of a surprise earlier this month when Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope sent out a tough missive condemning McCain as an ally of corporate polluters.
 
Urging Sierra Club supporters to write to their local newspapers to spread the word about McCain's poor environmental record in the Senate, Pope said McCain had ""a history of siding with the polluters and special interests, and a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes.""
 
For this item, we'll focus on the allegation of ducked votes.
 
As evidence, Pope cited a new study by the League of Conservation Voters examining crucial environmental votes taken in the Senate last year. Of the 15 votes the League studied, McCain was not present for any of them.
 
Under the League's strict methodology – dating to the vote study's origins in the early 1970s – a missed vote counts as one against the environment. As a result, McCain's environmental support score for 2007 was zero percent, a point Pope stressed in his letter. ""According to the scorecard, McCain was the only member of Congress to skip all 15 crucial environmental votes,"" he wrote.
 
Pope didn't mention that the strict methodology also turned Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic front-runner in the presidential race, from an environmental champion into one of the least environmentally friendly Democrats in the Senate. His score dropped from a 96 in 2005-2006 to 67 last year. The drop was almost entirely attributable to missed votes. New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton also suffered for missing votes. Her score dropped from 89 in 2005-2006 to 73 in 2007.
 
The methodology is inherently unfair, says David Jenkins, a lobbyist for Republicans for Environmental Protection, a group that has endorsed McCain. He notes that McCain had a good excuse for missing votes: He was running for president against Republican challengers who had no similar commitments to keep them from the campaign trail, nor could McCain easily coordinate his absences with the Senate Majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who schedules votes and was more accommodating to his Democratic colleagues, Clinton and Obama, according to Jenkins.
 
For his part, McCain has never scored very high on the League's vote study. Still, his average grade of 44.3 from 2001-2006, before his current presidential campaign and after his previous one, is actually the third-highest score among Senate Republicans.
 
And the League itself apparently doesn't think so poorly of McCain. In endorsing him for re-election in 2004, the group called him ""a leader on global warming"" and a ""strong voice of reason"" against a controversial plan to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. McCain, the League said, had also been a strong opponent of the Bush administration's energy policies, which have been widely condemned by environmentalists.
 
Even Rob Smith, director of the Sierra Club's Arizona affiliate, says McCain — while he hasn't supported the group in all of its local campaigns — has been ""a champion"" when it comes to preserving forest land in Arizona and reducing noise pollution around the Grand Canyon.
 
The case against the charge that McCain has ""a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes,"" is clear cut. Indeed, McCain did miss 15 important environmental votes in 2007, while running for president. He also missed five environmental votes scored by the League in 1999, during his prior bid for the White House. But those years excepted, McCain has missed only three of 212 votes scored by the League since McCain's first year in the Senate, 1987. That's not a consistent pattern. The Sierra Club's charge, therefore, is False.

"['National', 'Ethics', 'John McCain']","
McCain says ""accept;"" Obama says ""pursue""
","
Sen. John McCain says Sen. Barack Obama committed to a campaign restricted to public financing and suggests the Illinois senator is reneging on that promise.
 
""I committed to public financing; he committed to public financing,"" McCain told reporters Feb. 20, 2008, in Columbus, Ohio. ""It is not any more complicated than that. I hope he will keep his commitment to the American people.""
 
First, some basics: When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who pay a voluntary $3 on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount determined by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election.
 
Keep in mind that $84.1-million is less money than Obama raised in January and February 2008 combined, according to campaign estimates. And, given his longshot status in early 2007, this prolific fundraising was not foreseen.
 
To the question of whether Obama committed to public financing as McCain asserts, we have to back up to one year ago, when the two candidates were vying to break out of a crowded candidate field. This is how we got here:
 
• On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the Federal Election Commission on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised.
 
• On March 1, 2007, by a vote of 5-0, the FEC approved an advisory opinion: ""Senator Obama may solicit and receive private contributions for the 2008 presidential general election without losing his eligibility to receive public funding if he receives his party's nomination for president, if he (1) deposits and maintains all private contributions designated for the general election in a separate account, (2) refrains from using these contributions for any purpose, (3) refunds the private contributions in full if he ultimately decides to receive public funds.""
 
• The same day, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. ""Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same,"" Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, tells the

New York Times.

 
• And Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: ""If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
 
The next key development in this saga is a questionnaire sent to all presidential candidates in the fall of 2007 by the Midwest Democracy Network. McCain didn't respond, but Obama did and his answer to the question of whether he would participate in public financing was clear:
 
""Yes. ... In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
 
It would appear then, from public statements, that Obama and McCain both wanted a publicly funded general election.
 
In the midst of this developing dispute over the general election fundraising, McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying, ""I ... am withdrawing from participation in the federal primary-election funding program."" McCain was one of the few candidates to seek public money during the

primaries

and as such, his spending is limited through the convention in September. His campaign apparently has nearly reached the limit already.
 
Problem is, the FEC cannot rule on McCain's request because the six-member commission has four vacancies. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling.
 
Against this backdrop, the McCain-Obama dispute has grown hotter. The League of Women Voters and other reform groups wrote to Obama on Feb. 15, 2008, urging him to renew his commitment to public financing.
 
And Obama wrote an op-ed for

USA Today,

which his campaign now says is the clearest explanation of Obama's position. ""I propose a meaningful agreement in good faith that results in real spending limits,"" Obama writes in the Feb. 20, 2008, piece. ""The candidates will have to commit to discouraging cheating by their supporters; to refusing fundraising help to outside groups; and to limiting their own parties to legal forms of involvement. And the agreement may have to address the amounts that Senator McCain, the presumptive nominee of his party, will spend for the general election while the Democratic primary contest continues.""
 
Then in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, moderators pushed Obama to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. ""What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.""
 
Stephen Weissman, associate director for policy at the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit institute affiliated with George Washington University, says Obama is hedging his bets.
 
""The hedges that he's raised are very considerable because he's mentioned two things — outside groups and pre-convention spending by McCain,"" Weissman said.
 
""I think that what's happening is someone said to Obama, 'We think we can raise $150-million or something, or $200-million, through the election and you never know what the Republican will throw at us, so be careful, don't commit yourself to this. We have a possibility here for really winning this election and restoring the Democrats.' ""
 
Evaluating the truthfulness of McCain's statement, ""I committed to public financing; (Obama) committed to public financing,"" it's clear that McCain committed to public financing in March 2007, and reiterated that commitment in February 2008.
 
It's also clear that Obama has committed to ""aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election."" And in answering the question, ""Will you participate in the presidential public financing system"" on the Midwest Democracy Network questionnaire, Obama said, ""Yes.""
 
But every comment Obama makes is in the context of reaching an agreement with the Republican nominee. It is not a blanket commitment to public financing.
 
For this reason, we rule McCain's statement to be Mostly True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Barack Obama']","
When a briefing isn't as good as a book
","Trying to counter Sen. Hillary Clinton's questions about his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama accused the New York senator of bungling the biggest foreign policy vote of her career by authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in 2002 without first reading the National Intelligence Estimate – a forecast by the nation's intelligence services of potential developments that could affect national security.
 
To underscore his point, Obama noted that former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at the time, voted against the resolution, citing dissents in the document, primarily from the State and Energy departments, to intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.
 
""If you have a National Intelligence Estimate and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says, 'You should read this, this is why I'm voting against the war,' you should read it,"" Obama said in a speech in Westerville, Ohio, on March 1.
 
Obama didn't serve in the Senate when the chamber cleared the use-of-force resolution, 77-23, on Oct. 11, 2002, but spoke against the war while serving as an Illinois state senator.
 
To evaluate the vote on the resolution, one has to consider the ambivalence and fears about war that filled Congress at the time. With the memory of the Sept. 11 terror attacks fresh in everyone's mind, many lawmakers worried that the failure to give Bush the power to act against Iraq would make the United States more vulnerable to further attacks. Others were concerned they would be labeled unpatriotic if they voted against a popular president in the weeks before a national election. Many who had questioned Bush's talk of war wound up joining in a broad coalition behind the president.
 
As a presidential candidate, Clinton has repeatedly said she made a mistake voting for the resolution but also noted that reading the entire National Intelligence Estimate was not a necessity because she and other lawmakers were getting frequent briefings from high-level Bush administration officials. The book

Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton

, by

New York Times

reporters Jeff Gerth and Don van Natta Jr., first suggested she did not read the report.
 
""I was fully briefed by the people who wrote that. I was briefed by the people from, you know, the State Department, the CIA, the Department of Defense; all of the various players in that,"" Clinton said in a Jan. 13, 2008, appearance on

Meet the Press.

""Some people read it and voted for the resolution, some people read it and voted against the resolution. I felt very well briefed.""
 
Clinton sidestepped host Tim Russert's question about whether she read it, but she did not challenge his assertion that she had not. Instead, she emphasized that she spoke with the authors of the report.
 
The back-and-forth is casting new attention on the National Intelligence Estimate, versions of which have been prepared since 1946, at the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The documents are periodically requested by administration officials, military commanders or members of Congress and produced by the National Intelligence Council, which serves as the intelligence community's forecast center and reports directly to the director of National Intelligence. All of the nation's intelligence agencies have an opportunity to weigh in on the reports.
 
Graham, in a 2005 op-ed piece in the

Washington Post,

said a careful reading of the National Intelligence Estimate revealed it didn't contain the rationale for a pre-emptive war in Iraq. Graham said he exercised the intelligence committee's prerogative during the run-up to the war and demanded that then-CIA Director George Tenet prepare a classified estimate in September 2002 after learning the White House had not requested one and that none was being prepared.
 
The resulting 92-page document, in Graham's opinion, was slanted toward the conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction at 550 sites, but contained what he called ""vigorous dissents,"" especially about aluminum tubes that were offered as evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program.
 
Clinton was far from the only member of Congress to rely on in-person briefings instead of actually reading the document.
 
To read the report, members of Congress had to go to a secure location in the U.S. Capitol. The

Washington Post

reported in 2004 that no more than six senators and a handful of representatives had logged and read the report beyond a five-page executive summary.
 
In the end, 29 out of 50 Democrats in the chamber voted in favor of the resolution, rejecting arguments by opponents led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia that it amounted to giving President Bush unlimited authority to wage war, akin to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing military action during the Vietnam War.
 
We find Obama's accusation is accurate because Clinton said she relied on in-person briefings from the administration. We find Obama's statement to be True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Republican National Committee']","
Funny math doesn't quite add up
","Nothing confirms a Democratic front-runner's status quite like being baptized a tax-and-spend liberal by the national Republican Party.
 
The Republican National Committee did it to Sen. Hillary Clinton in November, unveiling a ""Spend-O-Meter"" to tally new spending associated with her policy proposals. PolitiFact found its calcucations to be

Mostly True

in terms of a projected cost of $777.6-billion, but

way off

with the inclusion of an $80-billion baby bond proposal that Clinton had decided against. Read our analysis

here.

 
Now, the RNC is going after Sen. Barack Obama, charging that Americans would have to finance more than $874-billion in new spending if the Illinois senator makes good on his promises over one term in the White House.
 
As custodian of the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact has an affinity for graphic widgets. And, the Spend-O-Meter does a reasonably good job of accounting for Obama's spending proposals.

See it for yourself.

 
Problem is, it's not entirely honest and accurate.
 
Two proposals the RNC cites — an economic stimulus package of tax rebates and business incentives, and a plan to help create a nuclear fuel bank to store enriched uranium — already have been enacted into law in the 110th Congress.
 
What's more, some aspects of Obama's energy plan were covered in a 2007 energy law enacted in December.
 
So even accounting for differences between Obama's plans and the new laws, most of the projected cost the RNC cites wouldn't really be ""new"" because significant spending in these areas is already underway.
 
The Republican tally sheet also notably categorizes Obama's package of tax cuts and credits aimed at workers earning under $50,000 as new spending. That is an eyebrow-raiser, because the GOP assiduously avoided calling tax cuts spending when it rallied support for President Bush's tax plans. Republican front-runner Sen. John McCain also is avoiding the label when he talks about his proposed tax cuts, which would keep more than $5-trillion in potential revenues from reaching the Treasury over a decade.
 
For good reason: Tax cuts technically aren't new spending. But because they reduce government collections, the cuts require corresponding spending cuts in order to be ""budget neutral"" and not increase the size of the deficit.
 
Many of the dozen proposals and cost projections cited on the tally sheet come directly from Obama's

campaign Web site.

The RNC is right about five proposals that would be new spending:
 
• A plan to spend about $18-billion a year on elementary education.
 
• Expanding the AmeriCorps national service program at a cost of about $3.5-billion a year.
 
• Doubling the size of a foreign assistance fund, from $25-billion to $50-billion, that's directed at meeting the United Nations' Millennium Development Goal of reducing global poverty.
 
• Providing at least $2-billion in aid to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries.
 
• Creating a $1.5-billion fund to help states implement paid-leave systems.
 
Other RNC claims are dubious or make priority assumptions. For example, Obama has proposed creating a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank that would invest $60-billion over a decade in highways, new technology and other projects. The Spend-O-Meter says this would mean $6-billion a year in new spending, and $24-billion during a four-year presidential term. But Obama has not specified how the money would be parceled out.
 
The RNC also assumes Obama's proposal to expand health coverage to uninsured Americans — which Obama's campaign estimates would cost $50-billion to $65-billion a year when fully implemented — would cost the higher amount immediately when he takes office. The Spend-O-Meter also does not factor Obama's companion proposal to cover much of the cost by allowing Bush's tax cuts on dividends and capital gains and for individuals making more than $250,000 a year to expire in 2010.
 
On energy, the RNC tally sheet counts the full $150-billion cost of Obama's plan to expand funding for biofuels and other forms of alternative energy, invest in clean coal technology and invest in a new, digital electricity grid over the next decade, even though the issues were addressed to one degree or another in last year's energy law. Tens of billions of dollars have been authorized in those areas, making it difficult to categorize Obama's entire plan ""new spending.""
 
Obama's tax plan aimed at giving $85-billion a year in relief to middle-income Americans also is lumped into the new spending category, though the Spend-O-Meter correctly notes that the plan would also raise taxes on capital gains and dividends and eliminate the preferred tax treatment of ""carried interest"" — a key source of private equity and hedge fund profits that's taxed at the 15 percent capital gains rate instead of the 35 percent rate wealthy Americans pay on ordinary income. In other words, Obama is making the wealthy pay more in taxes, offsetting some of the breaks to their working-class and lower-income counterparts. So it's unfair to categorize all of the middle-income breaks as new spending.
 
RNC spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson said Obama's plan amounts to new spending because it calls for both tax cuts and increases, and because he hasn't detailed precisely how he would offset the cuts with reduced spending.
 
The RNC also focuses on Obama's plan to provide $1-billion over five years for job training and career advancement, failing to acknowledge that the Bush administration is trying to consolidate several existing programs into a single grant program for which it has requested $2.8-billion in funding for fiscal 2009. Should the administration succeed, it's unclear whether Obama's plan would add new spending to this amount or divert money from those grants for a new effort.
 
Two Obama initiatives cited in the Spend-O-Meter have been addressed in large part by new laws passed in Congress. Many of the goals of Obama's $75-billion economic stimulus package were addressed in the $124.5-billion, 10-year package President Bush signed in February 2008. The package includes business tax breaks, rebate checks for individuals and provisions raising federal mortgage loan limits.
 
Obama could, of course, come back with more proposals, including ones dropped in congressional negotiations. But it's highly unlikely that a President Obama would need to press for a stimulus package as big as the one Congress just enacted unless the economy truly tanks.
 
Congress also dealt with an Obama proposal to provide $50-million to help create a nuclear fuel bank administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency when it rolled the amount into the fiscal 2008 omnibus spending bill. The nonproliferation effort is intended to discourage countries from developing their own enrichment facilities.
 
So putting it all together: If we subtract the $75-billion stimulus proposal and $50-million nuclear fuel initiative from the RNC's total of $874.4-billion and do not count tax cuts as new spending, the total spending associated with Obama's proposals would be about $459-billion.
 
Because Republicans have correctly identified roughly half of the Obama spending proposals as new spending, we rate the Obama Spend-O-Meter Half True.

His plan includes adults
","Sen. Hillary Clinton made a strong new charge against Sen. Barack Obama on Feb. 28, 2008, suggesting that he doesn't care about the health needs of adults.
 
""I want ... each and every member of the family to have health insurance,"" she said at a campaign event in Hanging Rock, Ohio. ""My opponent only wants your children to have health insurance. I don't think that's smart.""
 
There's been lots of discussion about the differences in the candidates' health plans, and there are uncertainties about cost estimates and whether the plans could achieve universal coverage. (We have explored the health plans in detail in

this article

and in previous Truth-O-Meter items on Obama's claim

that Clinton would force people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it

and on Clinton's claim that

Obama's plan would leave out 15-million people).

 
But with her new claim, Sen. Clinton makes her strongest attack yet, suggesting that Obama is ignoring the needs of everyone except children.
 
We find that is not an accurate description of Obama's plan.
 
When PolitiFact asked the Clinton campaign about her comment, spokesman Mo Elleithee said Clinton was referring to the major difference between their plans: She would require everyone to purchase insurance (a mandate that has been likened to state requirements that drivers buy car insurance), while Obama only requires parents buy insurance for their children.
 
Clinton says the mandate is the best way to achieve universal coverage. But Obama says it could penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all his reforms are implemented, people would still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't, he contends.
 
We won't go into all the details of Obama's plan, but it includes several elements that apply to adults:
 
• It would expand Medicaid, the federal program that provides health coverage for the poor.
 
• It would provide income-related subsidies to help people who don't qualify for Medicaid but still need financial help to buy coverage.
 
• It would require employers to provide health insurance for their workers, or contribute to the cost of the insurance.
 
If Clinton had said that Obama's plan ""does not mandate insurance for adults,"" she would have been on solid ground. But she didn't and, given that Obama's plan has elements to expand coverage for adults, it is simply wrong to say he ""

only

wants your children to have health insurance."" We find her statement to be False.

Certainly, Steve Jobs is
","Celebrating a primary victory, Sen. Barack Obama roused the crowd at a Feb. 19, 2008, rally in Houston, Texas, when he went after inequities in corporate America.
 
""I believe in the free market,"" Obama said. ""I know Texans believe in entrepreneurship. We are an independent and a self-reliant people. We don't believe in government doing what we can do for ourselves.""
 
""But when we've got CEOs making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year... "" pause for applause from the audience, ""and it's the CEOs who are getting a tax break and workers are left with nothing, then something is wrong, and something has to change.""
 
Finding information to evaluate Obama's statistic was not easy. His campaign did not respond to inquiries. And we couldn't locate any reports supporting the ""making more in 10 minutes"" idea.
Here's what we did find:
 
• A 2007 report from the independent Institute for Policy Studies and the independent nonprofit United for a Fair Economy, ""Executive Excess 2007,"" that states: ""CEOs of large U.S. companies last year made as much money from just one day on the job as average workers make over the entire year."" So, not 10 minutes, but in the ballpark.
 
• A 2007 report in

Forbes

magazine which states that the average salary for the 20 highest-paid chief executives is $145-million. Separately, in a 2007 U.S. Census report, we find that the median annual income for a full-time worker is $35,603. Assuming a 40-hour work week, with 50 work weeks a year, the 10-minute average salary of the highest-paid CEOs is $12,083. At this salary, it would take 30 minutes to exceed the annual salary for a full-time worker.
 
• Now in the same

Forbes

report on CEO compensation, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is listed as the highest-paid boss of America's 500 biggest companies at $646.6-million a year. Doing the math on Jobs' income, he makes $53,883 in 10 minutes. That's $18,280 more than the average worker's annual salary.
 
So, while it's fair to say

some

CEOs ""are making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in an entire year,"" Obama would be on safer ground if he qualified his statement. We rule his statement Mostly True.

Force yes, but she wants it affordable
","
In a debate the week before primaries in Texas and Ohio, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama argued yet again over their health care plans. Clinton charged Obama with distorting her health care plan in a mailer, while Obama stuck by its claims.
 
The mailer states in part: ""The way Hillary Clinton's health care plan covers everyone is to have the government force uninsured people to buy insurance, even if they can't afford it."" Clinton said that wasn't an accurate description of her plan.
 
""It's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not,"" Clinton said, adding ""my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable.""
 
But Obama defended the mailer, saying that it ""accurately indicates that the main difference between Senator Clinton's plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care.""
 
""If it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as they've done in Massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out. And if that's the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate.""
 
When candidates talk about universal health care plans, they usually mean that every person in the country will be covered. Clinton's plan achieves that with an individual mandate, requiring every person in the country to either have insurance or buy it. Obama's plan does not have a similar mechanism, and Clinton regularly criticizes him for it.
 
Clinton's plan also has several strategies for lowering costs so that insurance is affordable. (Many of these strategies are similar to Obama's plan.) She wants to expand Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program and seeks to limit premiums that people pay to a certain percentage of their income.
 
Obama's argument is that there will be some people who don't get health insurance through work but who make too much money to qualify for special programs. If those people don't buy their own insurance, they will be fined, and that's punitive, according to Obama.
 
Clinton said during the debate that that won't happen because her plan has enough subsidies to make sure insurance is affordable for all. Her implicit argument is that there won't be any people who can't afford coverage or who don't qualify for a free or low-cost plan.
 
A big part of this mandate debate hinges on future events: Can Clinton's health care plan lower costs enough so that even low-wage workers pay only a reasonable portion of their income for coverage? The experts we've talked to say a lot will depend on what the actual legislation looks like, and clearly that's a future event.
 
Right now, though, Obama's characterization of Clinton's plan seems too reductive. Yes, it does ""force"" people to buy insurance in the sense that a mandate requires everyone to be covered. But her plan's intention clearly is that everyone will be able to afford it. Obama's mailer makes it sound like Clinton's plan is a ham-handed law, and that Clinton isn't concerned with cost. So we can't completely agree that Obama's mailer is accurate. We rate his statement to be Half True.

Et tu, Clinton?
","At the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton stole a line from Sen. John McCain and President Bush.
 
Clinton said that last summer, Sen. Barack Obama ""basically threatened to bomb Pakistan, which I don't think was a particularly wise position to take.""
 
Clinton's line echoes recent comments by McCain, who told reporters Feb. 20 that Obama ""suggested bombing Pakistan,"" and Bush, who said in a Feb. 17 TV interview that he didn't know much about Obama's foreign policy except that ""he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad.""
 
Clinton is seriously distorting Obama's remarks, just as Bush and McCain did. As we said with

our check of McCain's statement last week,

it is an extreme charge because Pakistan has been a key ally to the United States.
 
 
Clinton, Bush and McCain are referring to a speech that Obama gave in August 2007 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as the authorities there work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan.
 
Then Obama added:
 
""I understand that (Pakistan) President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.""
 
The transcript of his speech makes it clear that Obama is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government.
 
We recognize that Clinton et al. are making a larger point questioning the wisdom of Obama telegraphing future military plans and we are not addressing whether that is a good idea. But it is a significant distortion to say Obama wants to ""attack Pakistan,"" as President Bush did, and an even more serious one that he supports ""bombing Pakistan"" as McCain and Clinton did. (Indeed, all Obama said was that he would ""act."")
 
The charge from Clinton and her odd allies is especially unusual in light of

a Feb. 19 article

in the

Washington Post

that revealed missiles from a CIA-operated Predator aircraft recently killed a key al-Qaida commander in the Pakistani town of Mir Ali. The U.S. government did not have permission from the Pakistani government for the attack, the article said.
 
So the United States is already doing what Obama is advocating.
 
We might give Clinton points for qualifying her remarks with ""basically."" But even with that qualifier, she is twisting Obama's comments to imply he wants to attack a U.S. ally. It's not enough to call that False. We called it Pants-on-Fire wrong when McCain said it and we're doing the same for Clinton.

Obama's Iraq remark taken out of context
","In a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Sen. Hillary Clinton attacked Sen. Barack Obama's record on opposing the war in Iraq, saying that once the invasion ended, he didn't oppose the policy as strongly as he did in 2002.
 
""By 2004, he was saying that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war,"" she said.
 
The 2004 remark comes from an interview Obama gave the

Chicago Tribune

on the eve of the 2004 Democratic convention to nominate John Kerry for president. The invasion had long since ended. Troops there were attempting to stop insurgent attacks and prevent kidnappings in the face of concerns from the American public that the situation in Iraq was starting to deteriorate.
 
""On Iraq, on paper, there's not as much difference, I think, between the Bush administration and a Kerry administration as there would have been a year ago,"" Obama said. ""There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage.""
 
""How do you stabilize a country that is made up of three different religious and in some cases ethnic groups with a minimal loss of life and minimum burden to the taxpayers?"" Obama said later in the interview.
 
Taking the interview in its entirety, it's clear Obama was speaking about the need to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the Iraq invasion once it had commenced, not diminishing his initial opposition to the war.
 
In the debate with Clinton, he made the same point a little more succinctly: ""Once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out.""
 
Clinton's statement wrongly gives the impression that Obama was endorsing the Bush administration's overall policy in Iraq. We find her statement to be Half True.

She's often first, but is that a bad thing?
","
Suggesting that she's being treated more harshly by the press than her opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton noted toward the start of a debate with Sen. Barack Obama that she often has to answer the first question in televised debates. The comment was surprising in tone and content, coming abruptly after a long back-and-forth on health care and in answer to a question about who's right on NAFTA.
 
""Well, could I just point out that, in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time? And I don't mind,"" Clinton said during a Feb. 26, 2008, Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio. ""You know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious. And if anybody saw

Saturday Night Live

, you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow.""
 
A few boos could be heard before the debate continued.
 
Clinton is right. She has received the first question in five of the six debates this year. Here's a look at the opening question for each of those debates:
 
• Jan. 5 in Manchester, N.H.: Moderator Charles Gibson of ABC News asks Sen. Barack Obama if he stands by a foreign policy speech in which he said he ""would go into western Pakistan if (he) had actionable intelligence to go after (Osama bin Laden) whether or not the Pakistani government agreed.""
 
• Jan. 15 in Las Vegas: Moderator Brian Williams of NBC News asks Clinton how, on Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, race became such a prominent issue in the campaign. ""How did we get here?"" he asks.
 
• Jan. 21 in Myrtle Beach, S.C.: CNN correspondent Joe Johns asks Clinton: ""How much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?""
 
• Jan. 31 in Los Angeles (first one-on-one debate): Doyle McManus, Washington bureau chief for the

Los Angeles Times,

asks Clinton what she thinks is the ""most important policy distinction between"" her and Obama.
 
• Feb. 21 in Austin, Texas: Univision anchor Jorge Ramos starts things off in Spanish: ""The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?""
 
• Feb. 26 in Cleveland: NBC's Williams questions Clinton about the change in tone between the Feb. 21 debate and rhetoric on the campaign trail: ""You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking,"" he says.
 
Still, it's funny that Clinton would complain about getting the first question all the time because it wasn't too long ago that there were so many Democratic contenders that many were complaining about not getting enough questions. Besides, in a debate format, isn't it a good thing to go first?
 
""In terms of receiving the first question, I have not seen people make a big deal about that,"" said Gordon R. Mitchell, University of Pittsburgh professor and director of the William Pitt Debating Union, one of the nation's oldest debate organizations. ""There are issues about who gets to speak first in terms of opening speeches and closing speeches ... but in this format, where there were a series of questions ... if there was an advantage or disadvantage to receiving the first question, it quickly was counteracted by the many follow-up questions that evened things out.""
 
Mitchell thinks Clinton got her message wrong.
 
""My impression of what was happening here is Hillary was actually trying to say, 'Hey, I always get all of the hard questions,' and it just came out as, 'Hey, how come I'm always getting the first question?' "" he said.
 
Perhaps that's what she meant, but we can only evaluate what she said. We rate her statement True.

Dormant while Obama campaigns
","In one of the more pointed barbs in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate, Sen. Hillary Clinton charged that Sen. Barack Obama has been so busy running for president that he hasn't done much of anything as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs.
 
""I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee,"" Clinton said. ""He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.""
 
Obama responded: ""Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.""
 
Although Obama acknowledges the point, we sought to confirm what the subcommittee has been doing.
 
Congressional records show, and spokesmen for several subcommittee members confirm, the subcommittee has not held any policy hearings since Obama was appointed chair in early 2007.
The subcommittee's jurisdiction includes ""all matters, policies and problems concerning the continent of Europe, including the European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.""
 
The chair sets the agenda for a subcommittee and Obama could have asked to hold a hearing on NATO and its role in Afghanistan.
 
But Clinton's claim, while technically true, is unfair, said Andrew J. Fischer, a spokesman for Republican Sen. Richard Lugar. Lugar now serves as a minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he was the chair, from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. He is the ranking Republican on the committee.
 
Fischer, who is a minority staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee.
 
In fact, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Afghanistan on Jan. 31, 2008, and NATO was a part of the discussion. Obama attended a Democratic debate in California that day. Clinton is not on the committee.
 
The Clinton campaign put out a statement reiterating Clinton's comments to reinforce the theme that Obama is more about talk than action.
 
""Given the opportunity to take the reins of leadership and shape two critical areas of U.S. foreign policy — Afghanistan and our alliances in Europe — Senator Obama has done next to nothing,"" the statement said.
 
Obama's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
 
So let's look at Clinton's statement:
 
""He chairs the subcommittee on Europe."" Yep.
 
""It has jurisdiction over NATO."" Yep.
 
""NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan."" Yep.
 
Some may argue that the issue of NATO's role in Afghanistan typically and more appropriately would come before the full Foreign Relations Committee. But Clinton is right when she says Obama's subcommittee has been largely dormant while Obama has campaigned for president. We rate her comment True.

Clinton at times forgets major caveats
","Sen. Hillary Clinton has a detailed plan to deal with the foreclosure crisis in the housing market — so detailed that she sometimes leaves out crucial caveats when she explains it.
 
Most of Clinton's plan centers on subprime loans. A subprime loan is a home loan at a higher-than-normal interest rate to a borrower who is perceived to be a higher credit risk. It is typically issued to homeowners with poor credit, and sometimes to investors who are taking on higher-than-normal debt loads.
 
Clinton's plan has several elements: She wants lenders to freeze foreclosures for 90 days on owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages. She wants lenders to freeze interest rates on subprime loans for owner-occupied homes for five years, or until homeowners can refinance. She wants to create a $30-billion fund for states to deal with the effects of foreclosures, everything from helping individual homeowners pay their bills to making up lost property tax revenues for police and firefighters.
 
Clinton believes lenders should voluntarily embrace the freezes she suggests as a means of preventing widespread defaults. She would not impose the freezes through the force of law.
 
Got all that? It's a detailed policy, and she has criticized Obama for having a less substantive position. Obama does not advocate the freezes Clinton suggests, but offers a similar fund for states and reforms for the lending process designed to increase transparency for home buyers.
 
The problem Clinton is running into on the campaign trail is that she regularly shorthands her terminology, giving the impression that her plan is broader than it is. Instead of saying she wants to freeze interest rates for subprime loans on owner-occupied homes, she has said only that she wants to freeze interest rates. Anyone with an adjustable rate mortgage might think her plan applies to them, when it doesn't.
 
For example, at a debate on Jan. 31, 2008, in California, Clinton said:
 
""I think it's imperative that we approach this mortgage crisis with the seriousness that it is presenting. There are 95,000 homes in foreclosure in California right now. I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes, and I want to freeze interest rates for five years.""
 
Well, lots of homeowners have adjustable rate mortgages, and not all of them are subprime borrowers. Nowhere did Clinton mention that the freezes only apply to owner-occupied homes bought with subprime loans.
 
Some of her direct-mail pieces also elide these caveats; check out examinations from Factcheck.org

here

and from the

Atlantic Monthly


here

.
 
That vagueness has prompted criticism. Two economists wrote in the

New Republic

recently that they weren't clear what Clinton was proposing, and that some of her language suggested an interest rate freeze for every adjustable rate mortgage in the country. Such a widespread change to the mortgage industry would be foolhardy, argued economists Richard Thaler and Susan Woodward.
 
""Promising the American people that you can fix things by just lowering their interest rates is dishonest, a fairy tale that won't come true,"" they wrote.
 
Economist Laura Tyson, who served as Bill Clinton's national economic adviser, responded in defense of Clinton's plan, reiterating its details and saying that Thaler and Woodward distorted Clinton's proposal to make points.
 
""Her recommendations deserve serious discussion, not unsubstantiated attacks by scholars who should read her words more carefully than they apparently have,"" Tyson said.
 
Thaler and Woodward wrote again, saying that Clinton was the one who needed to be more careful in her public remarks. They also said that Clinton has offered a frustrating lack of specifics on how she would implement a largely voluntary plan.
 
We agree with Thaler and Woodward that Clinton has omitted details of her plan, most notably at the California debate. Yes, it is easier to say ""freeze interest rates"" than ""freeze interest rates in owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages."" But that doesn't mean the short version is accurate. We find her overly broad synopsis of her plan to be Half True.
