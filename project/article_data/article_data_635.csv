Taking stock of small businesses' impact on the W.Va. economy
","How big a deal are small businesses in West Virginia? Pretty big, according to a recent article in WVNews. The article, published March 30, 2019, quoted Nikki Bowmar, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia district office of the U.S. Small Business Administration, saying that ""there are approximately 114,391 small businesses in West Virginia. Cumulatively, these businesses make up 99 percent of the total number of businesses in the state and employ 280,213 people — nearly 50 percent of the state’s workforce."" Last year, a prominent West Virginia lawmaker, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, garbled a related talking point, saying that small businesses ""make up about 96% of our state's economy."" PolitiFact rated that statement Mostly False. Manchin was wrong because he used the term ""the economy,"" which refers to all economic output in the state. While small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of businesses in the state, small businesses only account for about half of employees in West Virginia. The other half of workers, who work for a small number of big companies, produce a disproportionate share of economic output due to their large workforces, economists told us. So did Bowmar get it more accurately? Yes, though the data is a bit old. When we contacted Bowmar, she sent us the same data release that we used when we researched Manchin’s statement -- the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy’s 2018 Small Business Profile. Bowmar’s remark in the newspaper lined up with the data in the agency’s profile. The only caveat is that the data was collected in 2015. Small businesses are created and fail all the time, making the numbers somewhat volatile. Still, the data she cited is the most recent available. Bowmar said that small businesses in West Virginia make up ""99 percent of the total number of businesses in the state"" and employ ""nearly 50 percent of the state’s workforce."" That’s correct according to the most recent data from the federal Small Business Administration, though the data is a bit old. We rate it Mostly True.","[('WVNews, ""\'The lifeblood of communities\': Small businesses encourage growth in NCWV,"" March 30, 2019', 'https://www.wvnews.com/news/wvnews/the-lifeblood-of-communities-small-businesses-encourage-growth-in-ncwv/article_dfdcea5d-6619-5736-88fe-b47f99717ba9.html'), ('U.S. Small Business Administration, 2018 Small Business Profile, accessed on April 8, 2019', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Joe Manchin off-target on small business share of West Virginia\'s economy,"" March 26th, 2018', 'https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/2018-Small-Business-Profiles-WV.pdf'), ('Email interview with Nikki Bowmar, public affairs specialist for the West Virginia district office of the Small Business Administration, April 8 , 2019', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/apr/24/nikki-bowmar/taking-stock-small-businesses-impact-wva-economy/

Do more than 20 veterans die by suicide every day?
","Do 20 veterans die every day by suicide? Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., cited that figure in a recent press release that accompanied a veterans mental health and suicide prevention bill he introduced. Saying that the goal of the bill is to ""connect more veterans with the mental health care they need and earned,"" Manchin said in the release that ""it is estimated that more than 20 veterans die by suicide every day"" and that ""of those, 14 have received no treatment or care from the VA."" The data needs to be put into context, but the statistic is largely on target. In 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office for Suicide Prevention published a report that found that ""in 2014, an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each day. Six of the 20 were recent users of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services in 2013 or 2014."" The report said that the data ""confirms that when compared to their non-veteran peers, most veterans are at an increased risk for suicide."" At the same time, the report cautioned that the overall number of daily suicides obscures key variations within age group and sex within the veteran population. For instance, veterans between 18 and 39, between 50 and 69, and 80 and older have seen increases in suicide rates, the report found. And suicide rates are higher for male veterans than female veterans. The report found that suicide is likeliest among younger veterans of both sexes and among older male veterans. But since these groups account for a relatively small share of the total veteran population, the largest number of suicides occur among the much larger population of middle-aged veterans. A 2018 update by the VA found that the average number of veteran suicides per day had remained ""unchanged at 20."" We checked with Robert Bossarte, the director of Injury Control Research at West Virginia University who helped author the VA’s 2016 report. He told PolitiFact West Virginia that he considers the 20-a-day figure to be accurate. Manchin said, ""It is estimated that more than 20 veterans die by suicide every day."" The most recent Department of Veterans Affairs data confirms that figure, though it’s worth adding some context -- that the overall figure obscures significant variability for different age groups and for men as opposed to women. We rate this statement Mostly True.","[('Joe Manchin, ""Manchin Introduces Landmark Veterans Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Bill,"" March 18, 2019', 'https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-introduces-landmark-veterans-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention-bill'), ('VA Office of Suicide Prevention, ""Suicide Among Veterans and Other Americans (2001-2014),"" Aug. 3, 2016', 'No link'), ('Department of Veterans Affairs, Press release on the National Suicide Data Report, June 18, 2018', 'https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/2016suicidedatareport.pdf'), ('Department of Veterans Affairs, veteran suicide data update, June 18, 2018', 'No link'), ('White House, ""President Donald J.

Are a majority of working women earning the minimum wage? No
","During a CNN town hall, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris responded to a participant’s question about how she would ""level the playing field and empower working women"" if she won the presidency. Harris responded that she would urge passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and make sure people fully understand the realities of the economy. She gave special attention to minimum-wage workers. ""Women are paid on average 77% to the dollar. And then if you look at African American women and Latinas, even less, and for doing the same work. You look at the fact that we have a real battle in this country around minimum wage and the need to increase minimum wage. We should understand minimum wage is a minimum standard of living, but federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which averages $15,000 a year, and the majority of women are minimum wage workers."" One aspect of Harris’ answer was problematic -- the part where she said that gender, racial and ethnic pay differences are comparisons for ""doing the same work."" As we have often noted, wage gaps are not calculated on an apples-to-apples basis comparing the same jobs. Instead, they reflect overall pay for all jobs held by men and women, meaning that gender-based patterns of job selection -- whether due to discrimination or voluntary choices -- play a role in creating the pay gap. But here we’ll focus on a separate part of Harris’ response -- the part where she said that ""the majority of women are minimum wage workers."" This is incorrect. According to 2017 data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1,824,000 Americans were paid the minimum wage or less. (Sub-minimum-wage workers exist because there are a few exceptions to the federal minimum wage law, such as for students and tipped workers.) Of that pool of minimum wage workers, 678,000 were men and 1,146,000 were women. During 2017, the economy as a whole employed approximately 72 million women, meaning that 1.6% of all female workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. So it’s incorrect to say that ""the majority of women are minimum wage workers."" When we contacted the Harris campaign, spokesman Ian Sams described it as a ""slip of the tongue on live TV. She meant that a majority of minimum wage workers are women."" That statement would accurate. Using the numbers we cited above, women accounted for nearly 63% of minimum wage workers -- a clear majority. In fact, we previously rated a similar statement True. As evidence that it was an accident, Sams sent us several other examples of Harris using the talking point more accurately. Still, PolitiFact’s policy is to rate the statement made in the high-profile setting because the comment was seen by a large number of people. Harris said, ""The majority of women are minimum wage workers."" That’s not correct; minimum wage workers actually account for a tiny fraction of all working women. Harris said she meant to say that a majority of minimum wage workers are women, and that’s the case -- 63% are women. We rate her statement at the CNN town hall False.","[('Kamala Harris, remarks at a CNN town hall, April 22, 2019', 'https://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1904/22/se.04.html'), ('Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, ""Employment level: women,"" accessed April 24, 2019', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Labor, ""Questions and Answers About the Minimum Wage,"" accessed April 24, 2019', 'https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12000002'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Characteristics of minimum wage workers, 2017,"" March 2018', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Iowa, ""Clinton says most minimum-wage workers are women,"" Nov. 13, 2015', 'https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/q-a.htm'), ('Email interview with Ian Sams, spokesman for Kamala Harris, April 24, 2019', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/apr/24/kamala-harris/are-majority-working-women-earning-minimum-wage-no/

Jared Kushner wrong on scope of Russia’s interference
","Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, suggested Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia and whether the president obstructed justice was more disruptive to the country than Moscow’s election interference. ""The whole thing is just a big distraction for the country,"" Kushner said at a Time magazine event. ""You look at what Russia did — buying some Facebook ads to try and sow dissent. And it's a terrible thing, but I think the investigation and all the speculation that's happened over the past two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads."" Kushner’s entitled to his opinion on impact, but his characterization of Russia’s activity during the 2016 political season is wrong. ""Buying some Facebook ads to try and sow dissent"" is starkly at odds with the U.S. government’s description of the Kremlin’s ""active measures"" campaign, which officials concluded was carried out to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Ultimately, Mueller did not establish there was an illegal relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the notion that Moscow’s efforts amounted to ""a couple of Facebook ads"" is belied by the factual record Mueller compiled, as well as the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment. Russia’s active measures campaign comprised two major efforts. The first was a multi-platform social media campaign, which Kushner downplayed as the purchase of ""a couple of Facebook ads."" The second was the hacking and disseminating of Democratic materials to harm Clinton’s electoral chances. ""The investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome,"" Mueller’s report notes. Mueller’s conclusion came after the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced a similar conclusion after the 2016 vote. ""We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" the Jan. 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment states. ""When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency."" The scope of Russia’s social media campaign went vastly further than Kushner’s claim of ""a couple of Facebook ads."" A Kremlin-backed entity called the Internet Research Agency, or IRA, ran the social media campaign out of St. Petersburg, Russia. Mueller found that by the end of the 2016 U.S. election, ""the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts."" The IRA purchased over 3,500 Facebook advertisements and spent some $100,000 on the political ads, the report states. The group also controlled multiple Facebook groups and Instagram accounts that ""had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants,"" Mueller said. About a year after the election, a Facebook executive told Congress that the IRA controlled some 470 accounts that generated 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017. But the biggest statistic concerns the length of its reach. ""Facebook estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Facebook accounts,"" the Mueller report states. Their effort went well beyond Facebook. Additionally, the IRA controlled Twitter accounts with ""tens of thousands of followers,"" Mueller said, adding that among the followers were ""multiple U.S. political figures who retweeted IRA-created content."" Twitter later revealed the IRA controlled more than 3,800 accounts, and likely reached nearly 1.5 million Twitter users. Kushner’s description also ignored the Russian intelligence operation to steal and release documents. To help Trump’s odds, Russian hackers controlled by the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service, stole emails belonging to Democratic organizations and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and relayed them to several publishers, including WikiLeaks, Mueller concluded. Two WikiLeaks dumps of damaging Clinton material came at pivotal moments during the campaign. In late July 2016, Democrats selected Clinton as their presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention. But days before the nominating convention, a ceremony meant to foster party unity, WikiLeaks began publishing stolen Democratic Party emails. The first tranche — nearly 20,000 emails — revealed an embarrassing glimpse at internal deliberations among the Democratic National Committee. The correspondence appeared to show the party apparatus conspiring to boost Clinton and undermine her rival Bernie Sanders. The emails sparked Democratic infighting just as the party sought to coalesce support for Clinton. The next big WikiLeaks dump of damaging Clinton information came the month before the election, on Oct. 7. That afternoon, the Washington Post published video of a 2005 interview with Access Hollywood in which Trump boasted that his celebrity status enabled him to grope women. Less than an hour after the Trump tape went public, WikiLeaks revealed it had received 50,000 of Podesta’s emails. It released an initial dump of around 2,000 of the Clinton campaign chairman’s messages. The timing of the Podesta email release fueled suspicions that WikiLeaks wanted to distract from the Access Hollywood news. Nearly all of the Mueller report’s findings about WikiLeaks’ role is redacted. Kushner said Russia’s interference in the 2016 election amounted to ""a couple of Facebook ads."" This claim grossly mischaracterizes Russia’s active measures campaign, which comprised both social media efforts to help Trump’s candidacy and a hack-and-dump operation aimed at hampering Democrats’ electoral chances. On Facebook specifically, the tech company estimates Kremlin-controlled accounts reached as many as 126 million people around the election. We rate this Pants on Fire.

"['Deficit', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'David Craig']","
State Sen. Craig hits and misses when taking aim at Wisconsin governor's budget
","In his proposed 2019-’21 budget, Gov. Tony Evers has increased spending for roads and infrastructure, as well as special education, and included raises for state employees, among other changes. In all, the budget tallies some $83.5 billion. But does it increase taxes and create a deficit? State Sen. David Craig (R-Town of Vernon) thinks so. ""Gov. Evers’ proposed budget has massive tax and fee increases, yet he spends even more on his way to a nearly $2 billion deficit,"" Craig said via Twitter on April 2, 2019. Is Craig right? Yes and no. More on the budget We reached out to Craig seeking backup for the claim, but his staff did not respond. That said, it’s pretty clear what he is referring to in his tweet. Let’s start with the tax part of the equation. Does Evers’ proposed budget include tax and fee increases? The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters, issued a report on April 1, 2019 that says that answer is yes. In some cases, tax increases in Evers’ budget are offset by other changes. For instance, the gas tax would increase by eight cents, going up from 32.9 cents to 40.9 cents. At the same time, the plan calls for repealing a law that requires retailers in many cases to sell gas at 9 percent above the wholesale price, which Evers argues will bring the cost of gas down overall. The budget scales back an agricultural and manufacturing tax credit, one put in place by Republicans. It uses some of that money to help pay for an income tax cut for the middle class. But as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported March 14, 2019, Evers’ budget includes a net increase of more than $1 billion in tax hikes over the two year period. Deficit details But what about the deficit part of the claim, where Craig said Evers is spending ""more on his way to a nearly $2 billion deficit."" That’s where the apples meet the oranges. In the first part of his claim, Craig is referring to Evers’ proposed two-year budget. By law, that budget must be balanced. And it is. So where does the $2 billion come from? That number comes from the fiscal bureau, but it refers to what is commonly called the ""structural deficit."" That’s something that has long existed. In short, the structural deficit measure comes from mapping out spending and income trends into the future to create a projected gap (or surplus) for years down the road. The LFB report says Evers’ budget would balance for 2019 and 2020, but the spending patterns it establishes would create a shortfall of $847 million for 2021. The Department of Administration also includes projections. Its tallies show a potential shortfall of $1.1 billion in 2022 and about $1.9 billion by 2023. Of course, there are many things that can happen between now and then: The economy may improve more than expected, and bring in more in tax revenues. Or, inflation could be higher than anticipated, making it more expensive to run state government. In other words, the picture could get better or worse. In that respect, the structural deficit numbers are hypothetical ones: Evers will again have to submit a balanced budget for the second half of his term. That said, the numbers are a real measure that provides an indication of how fiscally sound the state’s finances are overall. When Gov. Scott Walker took office in January 2011, he talked about facing a $3.6 billion structural deficit. It was based on projected tax revenue and spending costs, including budget requests that had already been made by outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle’s staff. In fact, Wisconsin has long had a structural deficit. According to the fiscal bureau, it has existed for at least the last 10 budget cycles, or about 20 years. What’s the best view? ""Part of this is politics and part of this is stating the truth,"" said Craig Maher, a public affairs professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, who has studied Wisconsin public spending and budgets. ""The governor is running a (structural) deficit, but remember the state of Wisconsin has been running that deficit for 20 years. If you look at any administration prior, there has always been this deficit so this isn’t something new generated by Governor Evers."" Though the state has previously faced structural deficits in the past, the one proposed by Evers is larger than some earlier ones. Maher noted that states, unlike the federal government, are required to put forward balanced budgets by law. The federal government, in contrast, can run an annual deficit which, in turn, adds to the long-term national debt. That’s where the apples-oranges mixing by Craig goes awry. He compares the current budget to potential long-term issues in future budgets, making it sound like the plan before the Legislature would leave the state $2 billion in the red during the budget period itself. Our rating Craig said Evers’ budget increases taxes and creates a deficit of about $2 billion. The budget does increase taxes. But it has to be balanced by law. That said, projected numbers do show Evers would start the next two-year budget, beginning in July 2021, with a projected gap of $1.96 billion. That number will change based on the performance of the economy and other factors. We rate this claim Half True.","[('State of Wisconsin, Budget in Brief, February 2019', 'https://doa.wi.gov/budget/SBO/2019-21%20Budget%20in%20Brief.pdf'), ('WMTV, Gov.

Dan Patrick says the remains of 1,671 migrants have been discovered in Texas
","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick joined other Republican lawmakers from Texas at a news conference this month criticizing Democratic lawmakers for ignoring reports of violence at the U.S.-Mexico border and a rise in illegal immigration. Patrick said the media is part of the problem is  not giving enough coverage to tragedies like human trafficking or people dying as they attempt to enter the country. He said ranchers on the border have discovered the remains of more than 1,000 migrants on their properties — evidence of the current crisis at the border. ""Since 2011, we have documentation of 1,671 dead bodies we have recovered in Texas, many in Brooks County,"" Patrick said. ""Look at the photos. Skeletons. It looks like something we’d see in a Third World country where there has been some civil war in the dust. There are thousands and thousands and thousands more out there. These are just the ones we’ve seen, on millions of acres."" Press reports have detailed the perilous journey many people attempt to make as they cross the border and the grisly fate that sometimes awaits. News outlets have also captured what happens after bodies are discovered, as researchers attempt to identify the individuals. But is his claim about the number of bodies discovered since 2011 accurate? Border Patrol data backs Patrick’s claim Alejandro Garcia, Patrick’s spokesman, pointed us to data maintained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol that show deaths recorded in the Southwest border region every year from 1998 to 2018.  The majority of the recorded deaths are cases where the remains of an individual suspected of entering the country illegally succumbed to exposure to extreme heat or cold while attempting to traverse vast ranchlands with few water sources and were discovered near the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a CBP spokesman. This report does not include individuals who died while in CBP custody or who died during an apprehension. It also does not include deaths that occurred at ports of entry or detention facilities. Between 1998 and 2018, there were 7,505 deaths recorded across the entire U.S.-Mexico border, according to the report. Of those, 3,125 were in Texas. There were also 244 deaths in the El Paso sector, which includes the city of El Paso and the entire state of New Mexico. But Patrick’s claim looked at a more limited timeframe: bodies discovered since 2011. From 2011 to 2018, CBP data shows that there were 2,773 bodies discovered along the entire border. Of those, 1,641 were in Texas. There were also 30 in the El Paso sector.   What about Brooks County? Patrick said many of these deaths are recorded in Brooks County, 942 square miles directly north of the border county of Hidalgo. The county is covered by ranchlands and includes live oaks, mesquite, brush and cacti. From 2009 to 2019, there have been 642 bodies discovered in the county, according to data provided by the sheriff’s office. These numbers are included in the CBP numbers that look at the entire border, according to Maggie Saenz, the administrative assistant at the sheriff’s office. Brooks County is considered one of the deadliest places for people crossing the border illegally. A 2017  New York Times investigation found that migrants travel through the brush in this county to avoid busy Border Patrol traffic checkpoints in Hebbronville and Falfurrias. When people try to hike around the checkpoints, often without enough food or water, they die after encountering cold in the winter and heat in the summer. Saenz used to help oversee recovery of the remains and helps maintain the office’s tally of remains that have been recovered. The number of deaths recorded in the county has been declining since 2012, dropping from 129 that year to as low as 48 in 2015. Since then, the number has fluctuated from 61 in 2016 to 52 in 2017 and 50 in 2018. So far this year, the sheriff’s office has recorded eight deaths, the lowest number reported for the first four months of the year since 2010, when three deaths were recorded from January to April and 20 were recorded for the entire year. Remains discovered in Brooks County have made up more than 33 percent of all bodies discovered in Texas since 2009.   Recorded numbers don’t tell the whole story Law enforcement officers are not actively searching for bodies, but instead frequently receive phone calls from ranchers who see human remains on their property. ""They know what to look for, unfortunately, because they’ve had so many people die,"" said Lori Baker, an anthropology professor at Baylor University who founded Reunited Families, a program that helps government agencies recover and identify the remains of migrants found along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""All along the southern border, people have gotten used to the idea that they might find someone who didn’t make it or who might be in distress,"" she said. Baker, who has been working to identify migrant remains since 2003, said the numbers reported by CBP or even locally are a ""drastic underestimation"" of the number of people who die attempting to enter the country. ""Most of the individuals who die probably go unrecovered,"" she said, noting that animals can scatter remains, making it challenging to spot them on vast tracts of land. There’s also an issue with data collection generally, since no one government agency or group is actively working to find bodies. Limited resources locally prevent law enforcement officers from prioritizing this work and there has been little interest nationally in funding these efforts. Other roadblocks exist in Texas, since a significant portion of land on or near the border is privately owned. This creates a host of problems when it comes to third parties searching for bodies, as landowners tend to prevent these groups from entering their property. When they are allowed to enter certain properties, they run into another problem: the vastness of the land. Baker said she has worked on a case since August of a woman searching for her mother, who reportedly died while attempting to cross the border in South Texas. ""We haven’t been able to find her, even though the people traveling with her described where they left her,"" Baker said. ""But it’s on such a large ranch."" Baker said it’s also possible that local entities are not reporting all discoveries of human remains to CBP, since there are no explicit requirements for them to share this information. Some international groups — like the International Organization for Migration — also track these deaths, but their numbers are even lower than those reported by CBP. Our ruling Patrick said, ""Since 2011, we have documentation of 1,671 dead bodies we have recovered in Texas, many of them in Brooks County."" U.S. Border Patrol has recorded this many deaths since 2011 in Texas and even more along the entire border. The number of recorded deaths has been declining in recent years. These deaths do not paint an accurate picture of the number of migrants dying as they attempt to enter the country — the real number is likely much higher. But Patrick’s claim is right. Just 1,671 bodies have been documented in Texas and many of them are from Brooks County. We rate this claim True.

No, Donald Trump is not the first president with low approval amid a good economy
","During an hours-long tweetstorm, President Donald Trump complained that he wasn’t getting enough credit for presiding over a strong economy. In an early morning tweet on April 23, Trump wrote, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, ‘It’s the economy stupid.’ Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!"" In the “old days” if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, “It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will! We wondered whether Trump was right that historically, ""if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism."" (His mention of ""It's the economy, stupid,"" was something Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign team would say to remind themselves to stay on message.) Short answer: Trump is wrong. For starters, we’ll note that ""criticism"" of government leaders is virtually inevitable given the First Amendment, which protects ""freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" ""Presidents have never been ‘immune’ to criticism, regardless of the economy,"" said Jeremi Suri, a historian at the University of Texas and its Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. ""From Washington to Trump, every president has faced serious criticism from domestic adversaries and various groups. That is as American as apple pie."" But even if you define the issue more broadly, Trump’s statement lacks evidence. For a quick-and-dirty analysis, we looked at two statistics that measure the strength of the economy and public support for every post-World War II president: the unemployment rate, and the president’s approval rating from the polling firm Gallup. We found four presidents -- Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush -- who experienced roughly similar low unemployment rates as Trump but whose approval percentages ranged from the low 20s to the high 30s. Here’s a summary:  Truman’s strong-economy doldrums lasted for the better part of two years, Johnson’s for a year and a half, Nixon’s for a couple of months, and Bush’s for about six months. What they all shared is a major issue other than the economy that sapped public support. ""If a president has a good economy, it gives them the chance to get a good approval rating -- but it’s not a guarantee,"" said Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Southern Methodist University Center for Presidential History. For Truman, Johnson and Bush, a war proved unpopular. For Nixon, it was Watergate. ""War, when it is protracted, tends to be a downer for presidential approval,"" said Bert A. Rockman, an emeritus political science professor at Purdue University. ""All things being equal, a booming economy is a help to a president, unless they are caught up in conflicts that produce high numbers of casualties over a protracted period of time and that seem to be at an impasse."" Johnson faced problems beyond the Vietnam War. ""I think he could have survived the war if not for race riots and assassinations,"" Engel said. ""It wasn’t just one thing. It was the multiplicity of them."" Even presidents who maintain their approval ratings aren’t immune from ""criticism"" during good economic times, Suri said. Johnson and Bill Clinton ""were presidents during two of the best economic periods in post-war U.S. history, but both faced intensive criticism from Republicans and some Democrats,"" Suri said. ""The Republicans impeached Clinton at a moment of very low unemployment, strong economic growth, and even a budget surplus."" (Clinton’s approval rating on the eve of his impeachment vote in the House was 63 percent.) Low unemployment rates don’t guarantee that everyone will be happy with the economy, either, Suri added. ""There is also the question of who benefits from good economic numbers,"" he said. ""Growing inequality, despite low unemployment, has been a source of criticism for all presidents since at least Nixon."" The White House did not respond to an inquiry. Trump said, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism."" Even setting aside the constitutionally protected right of Americans to petition the government with their grievances, Trump lacks basic evidence for his assertion. At least four prior presidents served during good economic times yet had approval ratings lower than Trump’s are currently, usually because of wars or scandal. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.","[('Donald Trump, tweet, April 23, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1120635200327831552?s=03'), ('Text of the First Amendment', 'No link'), ('Gallup, Presidential Job Approval Center, accessed April 23, 2019', 'https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment1.html'), ('Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, national unemployment rate, accessed April 23, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Bert A.

US minorities surpassed 25 percent of electorate when Obama ran in 2008, and it's going up
","The election of President Barack Obama marked a turning point in the share of the minority electorate. An executive producer of a new documentary said the same year led to more restrictive laws for voting. ""Rigged: The Voter Suppression Playbook"" is co-produced by Mac Heller and Tim Smith. It focuses on Republican efforts to pass laws that added voter ID rules or other restrictions after the 2008 election. While supporters of many such laws say they were intended to prevent fraud, voting rights advocates say they were created with the goal of suppressing the vote. ""The 2008 election was the first election in which voters of color comprised over 25 percent of the electorate, and that number is going up,"" Heller said on CNN’s New Day April 7. ""And some Republicans took a look at this and said, you know, we need to make a bigger tent. We need to change our party's policies and include more people. But others took a different route and said let's try and have less of the other people able to vote, and that's direction they took."" We decided to fact-check whether the share of the non-white electorate in 2008 increased since Obama’s first presidential election. When looking at eligible voters — a.k.a. the electorate — Heller’s numbers are correct. Keep in mind, this is not a measure of who actually turned out to cast a ballot, which is another story entirely. The minority share of the electorate is growing, as Heller said. We reached out to both executive producers for this fact-check. Smith said Heller was referring to raw demographics of eligible voters, pointing to an analysis of the racial profiles of eligible voters by demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. (Frey is quoted in the documentary.) Using census data, Frey found that in 2008, minorities accounted for about 26.6 percent of eligible voters, slightly more than 2004 (24.8 percent). So in 2004, the minority electorate was pretty close to 25 percent. (Heller used the term ""voters of color,"" but it’s important to note Hispanics can be of any race.)  In 2012, the minority share of the electorate grew to about 28.9 percent. In 2016, it was about 31.1 percent. Pew Research predicts that in 2020, minority voters will account for about one third of the electorate. ""This increase is at least partially linked to immigration and naturalization patterns: One-in-10 eligible voters in the 2020 election will have been born outside the U.S., the highest share since at least 1970,"" Pew wrote. But while Hispanics will outnumber blacks among eligible voters in 2020 they may not actually cast more ballots. In recent presidential elections, blacks were substantially more likely than Hispanics to vote, Pew wrote. So the pool of eligible minority voters has grown since 2008. But the growth story does not hold for minority voter turnout. Strong minority and black voter turnout made a difference in electing the first African-American president in 2008 and again in 2012. But without Obama on the ticket in 2016, the black turnout rate fell for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, Pew found, down to 59 percent. Minority turnout continues to trail that of whites, particularly during midterms, found Bernard Fraga, an assistant professor of political science at Indiana University, and author of ""The Turnout Gap: Race, Ethnicity, and Political Inequality in a Diversifying America."" Those on the left have sometimes blamed changes in voter laws on suppressing minority turnout, as Hillary Clinton wrongly did in her claim about Wisconsin. Fraga found that voter suppression doesn’t explain the turnout gap. Racial turnout differences hurt Democrats, because whites tend to vote for Republicans while minorities vote for Democrats. Heller said, ""The 2008 election was the first election in which voters of color comprised over 25 percent of the electorate, and that number is going up."" His literal point about the electorate is mostly correct. Within the body of people eligible to vote in 2008, nearly 27 percent were minorities. This was up by about 2 percentage points in 2004. The minority share of the electorate reached about 31 percent in the 2016 presidential election.   Keeping in mind he was not referring to actual voters, we rate this statement True.","[('Rigged: The Voter Suppression Playbook', 'https://vimeo.com/291373548'), ('Transcript, CNN, April 7, 2019', 'No link'), ('Brookings Institution, William Frey, Census shows pervasive decline in 2016 minority voter turnout, May 18, 2017', 'http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1904/07/ndaysun.02.html'), ('Pew, Black voter turnout fell in 2016, even as a record number of Americans cast ballots, May 12, 2017', 'No link'), ('Pew, An early look at the 2020 electorate, Jan. 30, 2019', 'https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2017/05/18/census-shows-pervasive-decline-in-2016-minority-voter-turnout/'), ('Washington Post, The turnout gap between whites and racial minorities is larger than you think — and hard to change, Sept. 25, 2018', 'No link'), ('ACLU, The facts about voter suppression', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/'), ('PolitiFact, Black voter turnout exceeds white voter turnout, even in states with strict ID laws, pundit claims, July 17, 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Clinton on the hot seat with claim that thousands were turned away from the polls in Wisconsin, March 16, 2019', 'https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/'), ('Interview, Tim Smith, Rigged co-producer, April 9, 2019', 'No link'), ('Interview, Bernard Fraga, assistant professor of political science at Indiana University, and author of The Turnout Gap: Race, Ethnicity, and Political Inequality in a Diversifying America, April 9, 2019', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/09/25/the-turnout-gap-between-whites-and-racial-minorities-is-larger-than-you-think-and-hard-to-change/?utm_term=.01bef24d0f63'), ('Interview, Mark Hugo Lopez, Pew Research Center director of global migration and demography research, April 8, 2019', 'No link'), ('Interview, William Frey, Demographer, Senior Fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program, The Brookings Institution, April 9, 2019', 'https://www.aclu.org/facts-about-voter-suppression'), ('Interview, Ted Johnson, senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.

The photo is part of a series taken by various news agencies, like Reuters, and depicts Maria Gabriela Ruiz, a 66-year-old Colombian woman who was one of three people protesting the Colombian government’s failure to relocate 150 displaced people to a safer sector of the city of Cali, according to one caption. Ruiz and others protested by voluntarily burying themselves up to their necks in July 2003, as was documented by photographs of the protests, which are available on Getty Images and Adobe’s stock images.

Democratic congressional candidate right about poor military facilities
","North Carolina’s 3rd Congressional District, in the eastern part of the state, is home to several military bases, including Camp Lejeune, New River and Cherry Point. So it’s no surprise that, with a special election for the U.S. House heating up, the candidates in the primary are talking a lot about the military. ""We also need to adequately provide for our military families via increased infrastructure projects,"" said Democrat Allen Thomas in a pre-election candidate questionnaire with the Jacksonville Daily News. ""Currently, 23 percent of our military’s infrastructure is graded as ‘poor’ while 9 percent is ‘failing.’"" We wondered if Thomas had his numbers straight, so we decided to put his claim to the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out he’s correct. Thomas did not respond to requests for comment, but he likely got his statistics from a budget request that Lucian Niemeyer, assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations and environment, provided to the House Committee on Armed Services on April 18, 2018. Noting that the Department of Defense needs a steady flow of investment to keep its bases in good condition, Niemeyer requested more money for the 2019 fiscal year to compensate for low funding in past years. ""As a result of limited investments in previous budgets for facilities sustainment and recapitalization, 23 percent of the Department’s facility inventory is in ‘poor’ condition … and another 9 percent is in ‘failing’ condition,"" Niemeyer said in prepared testimony. Infrastructure is a broad term. In this context, it seems to refer primarily to the buildings on military bases. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb confirmed the numbers in the budget request are accurate. For what it’s worth, the DOD budget President Donald Trump ultimately proposed for 2019 was more than $686 billion, with about $10.8 billion devoted to maintenance and repair for facilities. Thomas said, ""Currently, 23 percent of our military’s infrastructure is graded as ‘poor’ while 9 percent is ‘failing’."" These numbers are in line with what the Department of Defense reported to Congress last year. We rate this statement True.

Is racial gap in infant mortality higher today than in 1850, as Beto O'Rourke says?
","Democrat Beto O’Rourke brought his presidential campaign to the Richmond area on April 16, pledging to reform an economic system he said, ""works too well for too few, and not at all for too many."" He said national policies have fostered racial inequalities in criminal justice, education and wages. Then, he called out what he sees as another unfairness. ""It’s our system of health care,"" he said, ""where you see disparities in infant mortality between white Americans and black Americans greater today, in 2019, than in the year 1850 - 15 years before the abolition of slavery."" We fact-checked whether the racial gap in infant mortality has, indeed, widened over the last 169 years. Let’s start with a definition: The infant mortality rate is the number deaths before age 1 per 1,000 live births. Chris Evans, communications director for O’Rourke’s campaign, sent us an email saying the candidate got his information from an April 11, 2018, article in The New York Times Magazine headlined, ""Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis."" The article cites estimates of child mortality in 1850 that were made by economists Michael Haines of Colgate University and Richard Steckel of The Ohio State University. Haines concluded that in 1850, the infant mortality rate for blacks was about 340 per 1,000; Steckel estimated the white rate was 217 per 1,000. The Times compared those estimates to modern rates computed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2016, the latest year available, the infant mortality rate for blacks was 11.4 per 1,000. For whites, it was 4.9 per 1,000. In other words, in 1850, blacks were 1.6 times more likely to die in infancy than whites. In 2016, blacks were 2.3 times more likely to die in infancy than whites. That shows ""a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery,"" The Times article said. Haines, who developed the 1850 black estimate, said O’Rourke’s statement is ""right,"" but tells an incomplete story about infant mortality since the decade before the Civil War. ""There has been remarkable improvement for both races; really quite dramatic,"" he said. The estimates roughly show that in 1850, one in three black infants died in the first year compared to one in five white newborns. In 2016, CDC statistics show one in 88 black infants died before the first birthday compared to one in 204 whites. ""The mortality decline since the late 19th century seems to have been the result particularly of improvements in public health and sanitation, especially better water supplies and sewage disposal,"" Haines wrote in a 2008 paper. ""The improving diet, clothing, and shelter of the American population over the period since about 1870 also played a role."" Haines said there have been ""rapid reductions"" in infectious and parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and gastrointestinal infections; and in ""well-known lethal diseases"" such as cholera, smallpox, diphtheria, and typhoid fever. So, why has the racial gap increased? There's debate among researchers.  Infant mortality is often associated with premature births and low birth weights, and black infants in 2014 were 3.2 times more likely than whites to dies of those causes, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But what leads to prematurity and low weight isn’t fully understood. Black mothers are more likely than white mothers to be impoverished, very young and unmarried - factors associated with with higher infant deaths. They are twice as likely as whites to have received late or no prenatal care. But research has shown a gap in low birth weights exists even when black and white mothers are matched for age, marital status, education, prenatal care and the father’s education. A growing body of research points to racial discrimination as a cause of infant death disparity. It was pioneered by Arline Geronimus, a professor in the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education at the University of Michigan. The theory is that repeated exposure to discrimination and insult can have a stress-related ""weathering"" effect on a black mother’s body, producing poor pregnancy results and infant death. Our ruling O’Rourke said, ""Disparities in infant mortality between white America and black America (are) greater today, in 2019, than in the year 1850..."". O’Rourke’s statement is deeply grounded. Academic studies lead to estimates that in 1850, live-born black babies were 1.6 times more likely to die in their first year than white ones. The latest racial infant mortality statistics are from 2016 - not 2019 as O’Rourke suggests. They show blacks were 2.3 times more likely to die in infancy than whites. O’Rourke’s claim, however, lacks important context. He omits in his statement and entire speech that, even with gap growth, there’s been a monumental drop in infant death rates for blacks and whites since before the Civil War. In 1850, it’s estimated that roughly one in three blacks and one in five whites died in infancy. Statistics show in 2016, the ratios improved to one in 88 black babies, and one in 204 white ones. So, overall, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Mostly True.","[('Beto O’Rourke, Comments at a rally in Henrico County, Va., April 16, 2019.', 'http://eh.net/encyclopedia/fertility-and-mortality-in-the-united-states/'), ('Email from Chris Evans, Communications director for O’Rourke, April 18, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Michael Haines, ""Fertility and Mortality in the United States,"" March 19, 2008.', 'https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htm#chart'), ('Interview with Michael Haines, Economics professor, Colgate University, April 18, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Centers for Disease Control, ""Infant Mortality by Race and Ethnicity, 2016.""', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_09.pdf'), ('CDC, ""Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2013 Period,"" Aug. 6, 2015.', 'No link'), ('The New York Times Magazine, ""Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis,"" April 11, 2018.', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html'), ('Samuel DuBois Center on Social Equity, Duke University, ""Eradicating Black Infant Mortality,"" March 2018.', 'No link'), ('JAMA Pediatrics, ""Trends in Differences in US Mortality Rates Between Black and White Infants,"" September 2017.', 'https://socialequity.duke.edu/sites/socialequity.duke.edu/files/site-images/EradicatingBlackInfantMortality-March2018-DRAFT4.pdf'), ('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, ""Infant Mortality and African-Americans,"" assessed April 20, 2019.', 'No link'), ('The New England Journal of Medicine, ""Differing Birth Weight among Infants of U.S.-Born Blacks, African-Born Blacks, and U.S.-Born Whites,"" Oct. 23, 1997.', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2633490?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&utm_source=articlePDF&utm_content=jamapediatrics.2017.1365'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/apr/23/beto-orourke/la-di-dah/

Did Donald Trump ‘fully’ cooperate with Mueller investigation? No
","  In his rollout of the special counsel’s report, Attorney General William Barr painted the Trump White House as a willing participant in all key respects during Robert Mueller’s nearly two year probe. ""The White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation,"" Barr said at an April 18 press conference prior to the release of Mueller report. The report found the Trump campaign did not illegally conspire with Russia. While Mueller declined to reach a legal judgment as to whether the president obstructed justice, Barr and his deputy concluded Trump did not. But Mueller completed his report without the Trump White House’s full cooperation — and Barr’s claim to the contrary is simply wrong. Not only did Trump refuse an in-person interview and supply written responses that Mueller found ""inadequate,"" but the president also tried on multiple occasions to shut down or curtail the investigation itself. Barr’s claim employed some legalistic and rhetorical ju jitsu, and it’s instructive to see his quote in its full context: Barr: ""The White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation."" As the quote shows, after Barr touts the White House’s ""full"" cooperation, he then injects language to narrow the universe of cooperation to something well short of ""full."" He notes the administration provided ""unfettered access"" to campaign and White House documents, that they ""directed senior aides to testify freely"" and that Trump did not assert privilege. Those are measures of cooperation, to be sure. But they are far from an exhaustive list of the ways Mueller sought the White House’s cooperation. More to the point, Barr’s selective list overlooks Trump’s explicit non-cooperation. ""Barr’s statement was brazenly disingenuous and misleading,"" said Bradley Moss, an expert on national security law. ""It is only true in the narrowest of legal framings, and omits the Mueller report’s detailed findings of the president’s consistent and repeated efforts to obstruct or impede the investigation."" One key way in which Trump failed to cooperate was by denying Mueller an in-person interview. Mueller and his team sought for more than a year to personally talk to the president — but they were ultimately rebuffed. Instead, the special counsel eventually agreed to accept Trump’s written answers to questions. But Trump’s written responses were ""inadequate,"" Mueller said, and contained dozens of instances where Trump claimed not to recall the information sought by the special counsel. Mueller also noted that Trump declined to answer questions about obstruction of justice, or questions on events that occurred during the presidential transition.  Here’s how the report describes the back-and-forth with Trump’s personal counsel: Mueller: ""We informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects. We noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he ‘does not recall’ or ‘remember’ or have an ‘independent recollection’ of information called for by the questions. Other answers were ‘incomplete or imprecise.’ "" Because the written exchange gave investigators ""no opportunity to ask follow-up questions,"" Mueller’s team again requested an in-person interview. Once again, Trump declined. Ultimately, Mueller concluded, ""We viewed the written answers to be inadequate."" The special counsel’s office considered issuing a subpoena for Trump’s testimony, an avenue that would have been fraught with thorny constitutional questions, Mueller said. Rather than risk a protracted court battle on that front, Mueller’s team decided against a subpoena, noting that investigation already ""had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report."" Perhaps the strongest rebuttal to Barr’s claim is the second volume of Mueller’s report. In it, the special counsel documented some 10 ""key issues and events"" that his team examined as part of its obstruction investigation. They included instances of Trump trying to impede the investigation or directing his staff to do so — including firing Mueller. In one dramatic section, the report provides a window into Trump’s distress over the news that a special counsel had been appointed in the wake of his firing of FBI Director James Comey. ""Oh my God. This is terrible,"" the report quotes Trump as saying. ""This is the end of my presidency. I’m f-----."" Trump grew more alarmed following media reports that the special counsel’s office would look into whether Trump obstructed justice, according to the report. It describes a frantic Trump calling then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and ordering him to say Mueller should be removed due to conflicts of interest. McGahn refused. ""The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful,"" the Mueller report notes, ""but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."" Barr said, ""The White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation."" Trump declined an in-person interview that Mueller’s team sought for more than a year. In response to Trump’s refusal, Mueller’s team agreed to accept written responses. But those contained more than 30 instances in which Trump claimed not to remember the information being sought, and Mueller ultimately concluded the responses were ""inadequate."" In addition, the president tried on multiple occasions to shut down or curtail the investigation itself, including ordering White House counsel to fire Mueller, a directive that was refused.

No, anti-vaccination meme is way off on vaccine testing
","As one of the largest outbreaks of measles spreads throughout the United States, an uptick in anti-vaccination claims also appear to be spreading on social media. As of April 11, there have been 555 cases of measles confirmed in 20 states, up from 465 in 19 states at last count. It is the second-highest number of cases reported in the United States since measles was eliminated in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, another anti-vaccine claim has surfaced on Facebook on a page called Greeninfo.com, which describes itself as an ""alternative and holistic health service."" The post reads: ""Think combined doses of vaccines have been tested? They haven’t. Not once. EVER. Our children deserve better."" The post, which provides no details or evidence, has been shared over 600 times since April 15 and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s cut to the chase: The claim is false – all vaccines are tested for years before and after being made available to the public, including ""combined doses."" We reached out to Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute For Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, on the veracity of the claim. ""This is not a true statement,"" he told us in an email. Salmon pointed us to a December 2008 document from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The review covered federal vaccine safety programs and public health activities."" The summary begins: The evaluation of safety for vaccines is conducted through a network of diverse, yet integrated activities that cuts across Federal agency responsibilities and includes the private sector and academic investigators. The development, licensure and widespread use of a vaccine involves activities and programs from a broad range of groups, including State health departments, academia, industry, healthcare providers, professional organizations, third party payers, managed care organizations, philanthropic and service organizations, and agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). According to Health and Human Services vaccine safety page, which is coordinated by the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO), every licensed and recommended vaccine goes through years of safety testing. This includes testing and evaluation before the vaccine is licensed and recommended, as well as monitoring after it is recommended for the public. ""Before a vaccine is ever recommended for use it’s tested in labs. This process can take several years. FDA uses the information from these tests to decide whether to test the vaccine with people,"" the page says. ""During a clinical trial, a vaccine is tested on people who volunteer to get vaccinated. Clinical trials start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers."" The CDC’s multiple vaccines information page reports that data shows getting several vaccines at the same time does not cause any chronic health problems. ""A number of studies have been done to look at the effects of giving various combinations of vaccines,"" the CDC says, ""and when every new vaccine is licensed, it has been tested along with the vaccines already recommended for a particular aged child."" Several of these clinical trial tests are available for review via the US National Library of Medicine. Here is a handful on combination vaccine doses: Meningococcal C conjugate vaccine with all infant vaccines (2002) 7VPnC with a combination DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine (2003) Hexavalent with Hepatitis A (2006) MMR-V with Hib/HepB (2006) Hexavalent vaccine with PRV vaccine (2009) PCV-13 with infant vaccines (2010) PHiD-CV and MMRV vaccine (2010) HepA vaccine with MMRV vaccine (2011)   Gardasil with Menactra and Adacel (2011) VAQTA with/without administration of other US pediatric vaccines (2018) A post on Facebook claims that ""combined doses of vaccines"" have never been tested. The testing of vaccines, both singularly administered and given in conjunction with other vaccines, is a well-documented, years-long process that is critical for vaccine approval across the world.

Checking Ted Cruz on whether Ukraine 'blatantly interfered' in 2016 election
","During a heated exchange with ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd on Sunday, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, repeated a debunked claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Cruz is the latest in a string of Republican politicians to repeat this claim, including President Donald Trump. The theory surfaced during the U.S. House’s impeachment inquiry into Trump over allegations that he withheld military aid to compel Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. During the Dec. 8 interview, Todd asked Cruz if he believed Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.  ""I do,"" Cruz said. ""And I think there’s considerable evidence of that.""  After Todd pushed back on Cruz’s assertion, the Texas Republican said the media is playing a game with its coverage of election interference.  ""Look, on the evidence, Russia clearly interfered in our election,"" Cruz said. ""But here’s the game the media is playing. Because Russia interfered, the media pretends nobody else did. Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election. The sitting ambassador from Ukraine wrote an op-ed blasting Donald Trump during the election season.""  Cruz went on to say: ""Two years ago, there was article after article after article, in the mainstream media, about Ukrainian interference in the elections. But now, the Democrats have no evidence of a crime, no evidence of violating the law. And so suddenly, Ukrainian interference is treated as the media clutches their pearls, ‘oh, my goodness. You can't say that’."" U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., made the same argument during a separate ""Meet the Press"" interview one week earlier. He said former Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko ""actively worked for Secretary Clinton,"" citing eight news articles that he said support his statement. We rated his claim False. There’s no question that some officials in Ukraine favored a Clinton presidency over a Trump presidency. But that is a separate issue from actual election interference, which U.S. intelligence officials have said did not happen. Cruz’s evidence When contacted for supporting evidence, Cruz’s office pointed to two social media posts shared by Ukrainian officials in 2016 as evidence of interference.  In one, Arsen Avakov, Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs, shared a tweet calling Trump a ""clown.""  In the other, a Facebook post, former prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk said that then-candidate Trump ""challenged the very values of the free world, civilized world order and international law"" when he said he would ""look at"" whether the United States would recognize Russian control of Crimea.  Cruz’s office also pointed to two news articles on Ukraine and the 2016 election — one from Politico and one from the Financial Times. Cruz shared both pieces in a series of tweets he posted defending his statement from ""Meet the Press."" The Politico article, from January 2017, is cited frequently by Republicans promoting the theory that Ukraine interfered in the election. It explores efforts by some Ukranians to discredit Paul Manafort, then Trump’s campaign chairman, by promoting work he did on behalf of the previous, Russia-aligned government in Ukraine. PolitiFact vetted the article and found that Republicans citing the article use its findings selectively, as the article itself reports that there was little evidence of any top-down effort to interfere. ""The article did not state that the Ukrainian government conspired with the Clinton campaign or the DNC,"" said Melissa Cooke, a booking manager for Politico, in an email to PolitiFact. ""It also emphasized that the acts of Ukrainian officials to raise questions about Trump were not comparable to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, and reported that the then-Ukrainian government was trying to make amends with then-President-elect Trump."" The Financial Times article cited by Cruz was about the Ukranian lawmaker who revealed more than $12 million in secret payments to Manafort from the pro-Russia party in Ukraine. The lawmaker told the outlet that he wanted to show the world that Trump was a ""pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world.’"" Financial Times editor Edward Luce said their coverage did not support Kennedy’s claim about election interference. Intelligence officials say no evidence Multiple intelligence officials have said there is no evidence to support the theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.  One day after Cruz’s appearance on Meet the Press, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked about allegations of Ukrainian interference being pushed by Trump, Cruz and other officials during an interview on ABC News. ""We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,"" Wray said.  David Hale, a top-ranking official at the State Department, told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Dec. 3 that he was not aware of any evidence of Ukrainian interference in the U.S. presidential election. During the U.S. House impeachment hearings, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who is responsible for Ukraine policy on the National Security Council, said there was no ""factual basis"" to support claims that Ukrainian officials worked with Democratic operatives to damage Trump while promoting Clinton.  ""I am, frankly, unaware of any authoritative basis for Ukranian interference in 2016 elections, based on my knowledge,"" he said. At the same hearing, Fiona Hill, the Trump White House’s former top Russia advisor, pushed back at assertions from the Republicans’ lead counsel that Ukraine government officials discussed Trump’s then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his ties to Russia with a Democratic National Committee employee.  ""It is a fiction that the Ukrainian government was launching an effort to upend our election, upend our election to mess with our Democratic systems,"" Hill said, according to Politico.  A New York Times article describes a briefing between American intelligence officials and senators that included information that supported Hill’s testimony. The report did not identify the officials.  ""American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election, according to three American officials,"" reads the article. Our Ruling During a television interview, Cruz said that ""Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election."" Cruz’s claim is based on the existence of two social media posts and one op-ed from 2016 written by different Ukrainian officials criticizing Trump. He also highlighted reports about efforts by some Ukranians to discredit Paul Manafort, then Trump’s campaign chairman.  However, multiple intelligence officials said there is no evidence Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.  We rate this claim False.","[('NBC, Meet the Press, Dec. 8, 2019\xa0', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-8-2019-n1097796'), ('Twitter, Ted Cruz, Dec. 8, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Maria Jeffrey, Cruz spokeswoman, Dec. 12, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1203744006062182402?s=20'), ('PolitiFact, No evidence Ukraine president helped Hillary Clinton, as GOP senator claimed, Dec. 4, 2019', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, What we know about the Politico story at the heart of a Ukraine conspiracy theory, Dec. 3, 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/dec/04/john-kennedy2/gop-senator-falsely-says-ukraine-president-helped-/'), ('PolitiFact, Trump and Russia, Clinton and Ukraine: How do they compare?, July 12, 2017', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Charges of Ukrainian Meddling?

Pete Buttigieg wrongly claims South Bend’s black poverty rate fell more than half
","Pete Buttigieg sat down for an interview with the author of a viral essay that called him ""a lying MF."" The Root's Michael Harriot said Buttigieg asked him for a face-to-face conversation, and so they met up. The video of the interview posted Dec. 9 shows them talking about Buttigieg’s tenure as mayor of South Bend and how his actions have affected racial disparities in the city. At one point, Buttigieg said: ""I'm proud of the fact that black poverty fell by more than half on my watch."" Buttigieg has been the mayor of South Bend since 2012 and is now seeking the Democratic nomination for president. South Bend’s population this decade has been around 100,000 people, and people identifying as black or African American alone have accounted for approximately a quarter of the city’s residents. We turned to Census Bureau poverty data to find out if Buttigieg was right about the decline in the black poverty rate in South Bend. He exaggerated. The most favorable metric shows a decline of about 39%. Another metric shows substantially less improvement, 6%. The Census Bureau collects poverty data annually through its American Community Survey (ACS). There are two sets of data that one can use to examine how poverty has changed over the years in South Bend — one-year and five-year estimates. The one-year ACS for 2018 covered January 2018 through December 2018. The five-year ACS released in 2018 covered estimates from 2013 through 2017. There are pros and cons to each set of data. The one-year estimates represent more current information and are useful for places with rapidly changing characteristics. But the five-year estimates are more precise because they have larger samples and smaller margins of error, and are particularly helpful for small geographic areas and small population subgroups, said a bureau handbook. Buttigieg’s campaign said his claim is based on the one-year ACS estimates, comparing data for 2011 — the year before he took office — and 2017. (The Buttigieg campaign prefers the one-year metric, because the five-year look does not fully account for millions of dollars invested in the city in the last few years, a spokesman said.) From 2011 to 2017 there was a nearly 54% decline in the black poverty rate. But 2018 data was available by the date of Buttigieg’s remark. From 2011 to 2018, South Bend’s black poverty rate dropped about 39%. That doesn’t back Buttigieg’s ""more than half"" claim. The black poverty rate also has fluctuated during Buttigieg’s eight years as mayor. The five-year estimates don’t make his case stronger. The ACS covering 2007 through 2011 shows that the black poverty rate in South Bend was 41.8%. The latest available five-year estimates are for 2013 through 2017 and show a 39.3% black poverty rate. That’s about a 6% decline from one five-year period to the other. Buttigieg made a similar claim about South Bend’s black poverty rate during a campaign stop in South Carolina. The Washington Post fact-checked it, concluding that he cherry-picked the data. Declines in poverty rate may not necessarily mean things improved much for some people. The Census Bureau determines poverty status based on a ""money income"" threshold, which varies based on the size of the family and the ages of its members, and includes factors like job earnings, workers’ compensation, social security, alimony and more. If a family’s total income is less than the poverty threshold, then the family is in poverty. (Thresholds do not vary based on where someone lives, they are the same nationwide.) The weighted average threshold in 2018 for a family of four was $25,701; in 2011, it was $23,021. The poverty threshold is ""rather arbitrary,"" said Joan Maya Mazelis, a sociology associate professor at Rutgers University-Camden. She added that some argue it’s too low to adequately capture the real percentage of the population that is struggling financially. ""But even before we consider that, it's important to remember that if poverty rates decline, it could be because people are making slightly higher incomes while the poverty threshold remains constant, or that incomes increased slightly more than the poverty line increased,"" Mazelis said. It's also important to note that people could be making more money, but have higher expenses, Mazelis said. ""Wages tend not to keep pace with rising costs of housing, health care, and other fundamental living expenses,"" she said. A group called Prosperity Now in partnership with the city of South Bend in September 2017 published a report on the city’s racial economic inequality. ""Although all racial groups in South Bend face lingering economic challenges in the aftermath of deindustrialization, communities of color face the dual burdens of a weak local economy and deep racial economic inequality,"" said the report commissioned by the city. ""As South Bend diversifies its economy to include green manufacturing, technology and the arts, a focused effort must be made to include South Bend’s diverse population."" Buttigieg said that in South Bend, the ""black poverty fell by more than half on my watch."" Buttigieg relied on outdated data that did show a decline of more than 50%. But new numbers available at the time of his remark invalidate his claim. Overall, two sets of Census data on South Bend’s poverty do not support his claim. The metric that most favors Buttigieg, one-year estimates, shows a near 40% decline from 2011 to 2018. (Buttigieg’s comment draws from one-year estimates for 2017.) The other metric, five-year estimates with greater reliability, shows a decline of about 6%. Buttigieg’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Update: This fact-check was updated Dec. 13, 2019 to include comment provided by Buttigieg's campaign after publication.","[('YouTube, Pete Buttigieg South Carolina campaign event, Dec. 2, 2019', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFJRXb2O8Ko&feature=youtu.be&t=1231'), ('Email interview, Pete Buttigieg campaign spokesman Sean Savett, Dec. 10, 12-13, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Joan Maya Mazelis, a sociology associate professor at Rutgers University-Camden, Dec. 10, 2019', 'https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html'), ('Email interview, Mike Friedrich, Public Affairs Specialist, U.S. Census Bureau, Dec. 11, 2019', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Poverty Thresholds; Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2011, Sept. 12, 2012; How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty; American Fact Finder, 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates; American Community Survey interactive table with South Bend, Ind. poverty rates; When to Use 1-year, 3-year, or 5-year Estimates', 'https://prosperitynow.org/resources/racial-wealth-divide-south-bend'), ('Prosperity Now, The Racial Wealth Divide in South Bend, September 2017 report\xa0', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post, Pete Buttigieg’s claim that ‘we cut the black poverty rate by more than half,’ Dec. 5, 2019', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/05/pete-buttigiegs-claim-that-we-cut-black-poverty-rate-by-more-than-half/'), ('The Root, Pete Buttigieg Is a Lying MF, Nov. 25, 2019', 'No link'), ('The Root, Pete Buttigieg on Institutional Racism, Economic Inequality, and White Supremacy, Dec. 9, 2019', 'https://www.theroot.com/pete-buttigieg-is-a-lying-mf-1840038708')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/12/pete-buttigieg/fact-checking-pete-buttigieg-south-bends-black-pov/
"['Impeachment', 'Crime', 'PunditFact', 'Paul Gigot']","
Would Donald Trump be the first president impeached without a cited crime?
","In the days before articles of impeachment were unveiled against President Donald Trump, Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot claimed that a Trump impeachment would be the first of its kind. Speaking on the ""Journal Editorial Report,"" a show he hosts on Fox News Channel, Gigot attributed his information to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley.  ""This would be the first impeachment in American history — if it proceeds, as it will — without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president who is impeached would have allegedly committed,"" Gigot said. Trump roughly quoted Gigot’s statement in a tweet the next day. Neither of the two prior presidential impeachments cited specific criminal violations. But in one instance, a possible prison term was in play and in the other, a felony crime was alleged, though not formally charged. In addition, experts say impeachment isn’t based on citing a particular criminal statute. ""Every scholar concedes that the presence or absence of a federal crime is beside the point when it comes to constitutional high crimes and misdemeanors,"" said Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, co-author of ""To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment."" The presidents who have been formally impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives were Andrew Johnson, in 1868, and Bill Clinton, in 1998. Both were acquitted in the U.S. Senate and remained in office. (Richard Nixon faced three articles of impeachment, but he resigned in 1974 before the House could take a vote on impeaching him.) Turley testified in the impeachment proceedings against impeaching Trump, saying: ""We have never impeached a president solely or even largely on the basis of a non-criminal abuse of power."" Gigot and Turley did not respond to our requests for additional information. Constitutional law attorney David Rivkin said on Gigot’s show that he agreed with Gigot. Rivkin told us by email that Johnson violated a federal statute and Nixon and Clinton were ""credibly accused of violating specific criminal law violations,"" but Trump has not. In the context of Gigot’s statement, Johnson’s impeachment is tricky, even though he was not charged with violating any criminal code. By firing his secretary of war without Senate approval, Johnson allegedly violated the Tenure of Office Act, a civil statute that was later repealed. The statute carried a possible fine of up to $10,000, or prison for up to five years, or both.  But ""no one was seriously threatening to put Johnson behind bars,"" said University of North Carolina professor of law Michael Gerhardt, who testified in support of Trump’s impeachment and is the author of ""Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know."" Clinton’s impeachment also did not cite a specific criminal violation, but his conduct was allegedly criminal in that he was accused of committing perjury.  The two articles of impeachment said Clinton ""willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony"" to a grand jury related to the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky sexual harassment cases, and that he obstructed justice related to the lawsuits against him. ""Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury,"" said Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner in the Dec. 12 Judiciary Committee hearing. ""That is a crime."" The impeachment articles against Trump do not cite a specific crime or criminal statute. Trump is accused of abuse of power for his alleged efforts to strong-arm Ukraine into investigating his potential Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, by withholding military aid and an Oval Office visit; and of obstruction of Congress, for his efforts to block cooperation with Congress on its impeachment inquiry. ""Like the Clinton and Nixon articles, they don’t allege a particular statutory criminal violation by name, but they do allege facts that could be charged as a crime in an ordinary court,"" said Frank Bowman, author of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump"" and a University of Missouri law professor.  The first article against Trump ""contains language drawn from bribery law, even though it doesn’t use the word bribery,"" Bowman said. Gigot said if Trump is impeached, this would be the first impeachment in U.S. history ""without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president who is impeached would have allegedly committed."" The two presidents who have been impeached, Johnson and Clinton, were not charged with violating any criminal code. But that is only part of the story: Johnson was accused of breaking a law that carried a possible prison sentence, and Clinton was accused of the crime of perjury.  The claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Democrat wrong about the history of NC's teacher pay
","Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper this year vetoed a state budget proposed by the GOP-controlled legislature, saying it didn’t do enough for teachers. Republicans, meanwhile, have questioned Cooper’s commitment to teachers. They’ve suggested that, if he cared about them, he wouldn’t have blocked raises that were included in their proposed budget. And so the blaming and posturing has gone on for months now, with each side blaming the other for this year’s budget stalemate. Enter NC Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Charlotte Democrat who recently tweeted his goal for improving teacher pay in North Carolina. ""We need to raise NC teacher pay to at least the national average - which is where it was back when I was in public school,"" Jackson tweeted.  Jackson’s tweet appears to claim that, during his time in the public school system, North Carolina’s average teacher salary was on par with the average salary for all of the nation’s teachers.  (Jackson says that’s not what he meant by ""average,"" and we’ll get to his argument later.) First, though, let’s set the record straight on average teacher pay in North Carolina and how it has stacked up to average teacher pay in America as a whole. Jackson said he finished high school in the year 2000. So we looked at that year, the 1990s and into the 1980s. Turns out, the good old days weren’t so good after all. Lagging behind Our primary source was the National Education Association, which is known for releasing annual reports detailing the average annual teacher salary in each state. (In March, the organization estimated NC’s average teacher pay at $53,975 for the 2018-2019 school year, WRAL reported.) NEA data shows that, over the last 40 years, North Carolina’s average teacher pay never reached the national average. The National Center for Education Statistics also tracks teacher salaries for the U.S. Department of Education. For the 1990s to 2000, the NCES had similar numbers to the NEA.  The data is ""spotty"" for older years, according to Tom Snyder, the NCES director of annual reports and information staff. But, for the years NCES does have, Snyder said ""North Carolina is lower than the national average."" For 1990 and earlier, the NCES shows: 1989-1990: US $31,367, NC $27,883 1979-1980: US $15,970, NC $14,117 1969-1970: US $8,626, NC $7,294 We also reached out to the North Carolina Association of Educators, a left-leaning advocacy group for teachers. Kevin Rogers, the group’s government relations and communications manager, said North Carolina has ""never quite hit"" the national average. ""The closest we came was in 2001-2002,"" Rogers said. ""We were ranked 20th in the country, with an average NC salary of $42,680 as compared to the national average for that year of $44,660. Rogers’ mention of rankings takes us to Jackson’s argument. Mean vs. median So far, we’ve been comparing NC’s average pay to the nation’s average pay. But when we reached out to Jackson, he said he used the word ""average"" to compare NC to other states — not the average (or mean) salary for the country as a whole. ""We were above average (U.S. teacher pay) in my senior year of high school, understood as the median rank for all 50 states."" It’s true that, in 1999-2000, NC’s ranking among all 50 states was 23rd — meaning NC paid better than half the states. And, as Rogers mentioned, NC moved up to 20th during the 2001-2002 school year. So, as far as rankings go, NC looked good when compared to other states. But, there are a couple problems with Jackson’s reasoning. First, a state’s ranking isn’t necessarily reflective of whether it pays teachers more than the national average. Let’s look back at the 1999-2000 school year. NC ranked 23rd, but the state’s average teacher pay was still $2,599 below the national average. Second, his explanation suggests that average pay refers to the ""median rank for all 50 states."" But that’s not how the average teacher pay is determined. It’s determined by looking at average pay across the country -- not by taking the median salary of the states. Being above the middle value in a list isn’t the same as being above average. Jackson told us that the difference between what his tweet says and what he meant is a matter of semantics. In this context, however, the word ""average"" has a very specific meaning. We asked Kris Nordstrom, a senior policy analyst for the liberal NC Justice Center, about how he’d interpret someone saying they ""want to raise NC’s teacher pay to the national average."" Nordstrom has done extensive research on the topic. He said, ""I would interpret that as wanting to bring the state’s average salary to the same level as the nation’s average salary."" Our ruling Jackson said North Carolina needs ""to raise NC teacher pay to at least the national average -- which is where it was back when I was in public school."" Jackson told us he graduated high school was 2000, so we looked at that year and the preceding decade.  And we found no evidence that NC’s average teacher pay ever matched the national average.  Jackson said he used the word ""average"" as a reference to the median salary among all 50 states. There’s some validity to his claim that, generally speaking, NC could be seen as faring better than most other states for a couple years. But this argument strays from his original tweet, which made no mention of NC’s rank, median pay or how its pay compared to other states. We rate the tweet False.","[('A tweet by NC Sen.

No evidence old Christmas tradition had women ‘begging’ for husbands’ forgiveness
","A bizarre story about an old ""Christmas tradition"" between husband and wife is roaming around Facebook. The post features what appears to be a dated, black-and-white image of five women kneeling in front of a line of men who are supposedly their husbands with text above that reads: ""At Christmas women used to apologize to their husbands for all the mistakes they made during the year and beg for forgiveness … let’s not let this beautiful custom get lost.."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could find no evidence in internet searches or archived news databases that support the claim that women used to ""beg"" for their husbands forgiveness during the holidays. The image has been shared online for years, with the Christmas tradition description being attached to it later on.  Previous postings of the image contain different explanations as to what’s going on in the photo. A reverse-image search showed that it was widely circulated on various websites in 2014 with captions that simply said ""women begging men"" (with no mention of Christmas, marital relationships, or forgiveness). It has also been shared on many Russian-language websites for years. In one 2017 posting, the caption translates to:  ""Etiquette a century ago. Ladies invite gentlemen to the White Dance, 1900."" A ""white dance"" festival in Russia has been described as an event in which the women ask men to be their dates, similar to a ""Sadie Hawkins"" dance in the United States. Jim Leary, emeritus professor of folklore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told PolitiFact that he hasn’t ever encountered evidence of any seasonal tradition like the one described in the Facebook post.  Leary said there are major seasonal traditions, such as the Jewish holy day, Yom Kippur, where atonement and forgiveness figure, but he is only aware of reciprocal practices, rather than one-way traditions regarding forgiveness between couples. He called ""ridiculous"" the claim that ""‘women’ (what women? since not all women share the same traditions) apologized so abjectly to their husbands, who the implication is had nothing to apologize for"" and said it sounded more like a ""patriarchal fantasy"" than anything based in reality. What’s more, this version of the image we saw on Facebook included, in hard-to-read type, the words ""Shitz & Giggles"" in the lower portion of the photo, with the url ""facebook.com/theshiggles,"" an account that says it posts ""comedy, memes, humor and other stuff to make you laugh out loud."" Despite that, commenters who found the item shared by a non-comedy account wondered if it was real. (The url was not live.) We were not able to track down the photo’s precise origin and these descriptions are devoid of any citations or supporting details that can be verified.

Fact-checking Barr’s dispute of inspector general’s report on the FBI, Russia probe
","Attorney General William Barr blasted the FBI over its 2016 decision to open the Russia investigation later led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, rejecting an inspector general’s conclusion that the FBI’s probe was justified from the get-go. ""The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,"" Barr said in a statement. The report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz did find ""significant inaccuracies and omissions"" left out of the FBI’s applications for court-ordered surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. But it said the agency’s decision to open an investigation into the campaign’s ties with Russia was warranted and not motivated by politics. Barr’s reading put him at odds with FBI Director Christopher Wray, who pledged to make changes to the FBI’s surveillance process and accepted the report’s determinations in full. Barr doubled down in interviews with NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, calling the basis for the investigation ""flimsy"" and claiming the FBI spied on the Trump campaign. He said John Durham, the U.S. attorney he picked to lead a separate probe on the same topic, would have the final word on the matter.  We decided to look at some key conclusions from the IG report, which was based on more than 1 million documents and interviews with over 100 witnesses, in light of Barr’s remarks. (A Justice Department spokesperson referred us to the report and Barr’s interviews.) We found that Barr’s claim that the report shows the FBI launched its probe on ""the thinnest of suspicions"" does not square with one of the report’s key findings.  When the FBI opened its investigation — known as ""Crossfire Hurricane"" — into possible coordination between members of President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia, it had both an ""authorized purpose"" and an ""articulable factual basis,"" the IG report found. The investigation was launched on July 31, 2016, three days after the FBI heard from a ""friendly foreign government"" that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had signaled that Russia had dirt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Trump campaign. The IG report said this information alone was enough to trigger the Russia probe, because it gave the FBI reason to believe a crime or threat to U.S. national security was in the works.   Sen. Dianne Feinstein: ""Did Attorney General Barr provide any evidence that caused you to alter this key finding that the FBI investigation had an adequate predicate?""Inspector General Horowitz: ""No, we stand by our finding."" https://t.co/c868WmzANb pic.twitter.com/sSzTAzfLI4 The report also discounted the role of a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, saying it ""played no role"" in the FBI’s decision. (Trump has falsely claimed the dossier started the investigation.)  Rosa Brooks, professor of law and policy at Georgetown University, told us that Barr’s assessment that the suspicions were thin ""appears willfully inaccurate.""  ""The report concluded precisely the opposite,"" she said. ""The IG report makes it clear that the decision to launch the investigation was justified."" Jennifer Daskal, professor of law at American University, agreed. ""Barr’s statement is at best a misleading statement, if not a deliberate distortion, of what the report actually found,"" she said. The IG report also dismissed the notion that the investigation was politically motivated.  For years, Trump has ripped into former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page for anti-Trump texts that he saw as proof that career government officials were out to get him. But the report concluded that Page and Strzok were not the decision makers Trump made them out to be.  According to the report, Lisa Page ""did not play a role in the decision"" to open the investigation or the related individual cases tied to Papadopoulos, Carter Page and fellow Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. Strzok was ""directly involved,"" but ""he was not the sole, or even the highest-level, decision maker as to any of those matters,"" the report found. The final say on whether to launch the investigation belonged to Bill Priestap, assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division, who complied with DOJ and FBI policies and made the decision with widespread support from FBI officials. ""We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced his decision,"" the IG report said. Where Barr has a point is on the issue of intrusiveness.  To determine which campaign officials had Russian connections, the FBI used various methods listed among its ""least intrusive"" measures, such as open-source searches, the report said. That led the agency to open four individual cases against Page, Papadopoulos, Manafort and Flynn. The FBI then used confidential human sources — a ""permitted"" but more intrusive technique — to ""interact and consensually record conversations"" with Papadopoulous and Page. The IG report found no evidence that this technique was politically motivated or done in bad faith. Eventually, the FBI secured and repeatedly renewed a court-ordered FISA warrant to electronically surveil Page. The IG report said this technique is considered ""highly intrusive"" and said the FBI did not seek similar warrants to monitor Papadopoulous, Manafort or Flynn.  Notably, there were problems with the requests to surveil Page, which relied in large part on information from Steele. The report counted seven ""significant inaccuracies and omissions"" in the original application and 10 ""additional significant errors"" in the three renewal requests, including one resulting from alleged document tampering by a low-level FBI lawyer.  The IG report said these errors made the FISA applications appear more convincing. The report was silent on whether the court would have approved them with more accurate information.  Still, surveillance under FISA is legal, and the report said the FBI did not ""infiltrate"" or otherwise spy on the Trump campaign. Plus, the errors made in relation to the FISA application process had no bearing on the start of the Russia investigation. ""The report separately found some problems with respect to specific, and later in time, applications for FISA surveillance of Carter Page,"" Daskal told us. But those problems ""do not change the fact that the initial overarching decision to investigate was justified."" Barr said, ""The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions."" The report found that the decision to start the Russia investigation was justified. But the FBI did secure a FISA warrant to surveil Page, a technique that is permitted but considered intrusive.

Mark Pocan wrong to blame President Trump, trade wars for all dairy woes
","It’s a tough time to be the Dairy State. The family farms that long formed the backbone of the state’s milk production are increasingly being forced out of business. And the U.S. agriculture secretary came to town and cast doubt on the future viability of any small dairy farms. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, says Wisconsinites should lay the blame at the feet of President Donald Trump. In a Dec. 2, 2019, tweet, Pocan said Trump is ""waging a trade war against WI farmers — forcing more than 1600 dairy farms to close."" Trade tensions are certainly having an impact, but is it reasonable to blame them — and Trump — for that many closures? Pocan’s is roughly correct on the number of closures. Wisconsin had 9,288 dairy farms on Feb. 1, 2017 — about two weeks after Trump was sworn in. By Dec. 1, 2019, that number dropped to 7,337, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That’s a loss of 1,951 farms, even more than Pocan referenced. But Wisconsin dairy farms closing is hardly a new trend. The number of milking operations here has plummeted by more than half in the last 15 years, from 15,000 at the end of 2004 to about 7,300 as of December 2019. That trend has indeed worsened under Trump, however. In the 34 months since Trump’s election Wisconsin has lost an average of 57 dairy farms per month. In the 34 months before that, the monthly average was 33 farms. Pocan blamed the closures not only on Trump, but specifically on the president’s trade wars. Defending the claim, Pocan spokesman Usamah Andrabi pointed to a category of Chinese dairy exports that dropped from mid-2018 to mid-2019 amid retaliatory tariffs. ""That being said, I think we can reasonably attribute the majority of these farm closures to the effects of China’s tariffs/Trump’s trade war,"" Andrabi said. That’s simply not accurate. Pocan’s claim — and his spokesman’s defense — oversimplify an industry facing a complex set of economic pressures. How do Wisconsinites feel about President Trump? Well, he's:✖️ Waging a trade war against WI farmers--forcing >1600 dairy farms to close✖️ Refusing to protect workers or enact environmental standards in the USMCA✖️ Undermining folks' healthcare access.How do you think? pic.twitter.com/bjN7hL2Wn1 Low milk prices, historic levels of oversupply and changing consumer demand were dealing devastating blows to dairy farmers long before Trump picked a fight with China. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel summarized the demand struggles this way as part of its Dairyland in Distress project, an exhaustive examination of the state’s trademark industry. Sales of milk as a beverage have fallen steadily since the 1970s, with fewer parents encouraging their children to drink milk than ever before. Soy milk and almond milk — which dairy farmers point out aren't real milk — and scores of sports drinks have flooded the beverage market. And although consumption of cheese, yogurt and butter have all increased, they've not always kept pace with runaway production. Today, for instance, U.S. commercial and government cheese stockpiles are at about 1 billion pounds — the highest level in a century. At the same time, foreign markets for American dairy products have shrunk in response to tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on foreign steel and aluminum. Cheese shipments to China have fallen almost 65 percent, according to industry figures, and exports to Mexico are down more than 10 percent. So tariffs are a factor in limiting demand, but far from the only one. And supply is a major problem as well. Advances in genetics and feed science mean the average cow today produces about four times more milk than it would have in the 1950s. This leads to a market saturation that both generates waste — some farmers are forced to dump milk down the drain for lack of a buyer — and contributes to reduced prices. Milk prices have nudged up in recent months but before that went through a yearslong downturn that often left prices below the break-even point for farms.  ""There were four years of the depressed milk prices before the trade war started,"" Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition, told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""If you go back and you look, we've always had attrition going on.""  Pocan said Trump is ""waging a trade war against WI farmers"" that has forced more than 1,600 dairy farms to close. Setting aside the rhetorical overreach of calling it a trade war ""against"" state farmers, Pocan’s finger-pointing is off the mark. Wisconsin has lost that many dairy farms — slightly more even — since Trump took office. Trade wars certainly haven’t helped, and accordingly farm closures have increased under Trump. But it’s not reasonable to attribute all the closures to Trump and trade tension when this trend dates back more than a decade. Milk prices, over-production and changing consumer demand have all played key roles in devastating the dairyland economy and shuttering Wisconsin farms. Pocan’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s what we call Mostly False.","[('Mark Pocan, twitter, Dec. 2, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/repmarkpocan/status/1201529003225600000'), ('Email exchange with Usamah Andrabi, spokesman for Mark Pocan, Dec. 4-6, 2019', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Agriculture, Number of monthly milk cow herds, Wisconsin 2004 to current, updated Dec. 1, 2019', 'https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Wisconsin/Publications/Dairy/Historical_Data_Series/brt2004.pdf'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Dairy farmers are in crisis — and it could change Wisconsin forever, Oct. 18, 2019', 'No link'), ('Interview with Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition, Dec. 9, 2019', 'https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/special-reports/dairy-crisis/2019/02/21/wisconsin-dairy-farms-failing-milk-prices-fall/2540796002/')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/11/mark-pocan/are-president-trumps-trade-wars-blame-all-wisconsi/

Social posts falsely connect Trump’s impeachment to Biden’s dealings in Ukraine
","One of Republicans’ key arguments opposing the effort to impeach President Donald Trump is that Trump was genuinely worried about corruption when he asked Ukraine’s president to investigate political rival Joe Biden. On Facebook, some users are taking that misleading point to its extreme. ""Let me get this straight,"" reads one meme published Nov. 29. ""Biden blackmailed Ukraine with a billion in tax dollars to drop an investigation into his son and Democrats want to impeach President Trump for simply asking if it was true?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it’s been shared by a variety of different users and pages, racking up thousands of engagements, so we decided to check it out. (Screenshot from Facebook) Key takeaways: • Biden didn’t blackmail Ukraine. His demand that a prosecutor be fired was the will of the U.S. government and other Western leaders. • There’s no evidence that Hunter Biden was under investigation at the time Biden made his request. • Trump wasn’t simply ""asking if it was true."" He wanted a public announcement of an investigation of the Bidens. Aid to Ukraine was held up in the meantime.   Biden in 2015 threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if it didn’t fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. But there’s no evidence Biden did this to shield his son from scrutiny. In 2014, Biden assumed a lead role in U.S. diplomacy with Ukraine. His son Hunter joined the board of Burisma that same year. The move raised eyebrows because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under former President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in a popular revolution. After the uprising, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving Burisma. In 2015, Shokin, the prosecutor general, was charged with investigating corruption associated with Yanukovych. But several Western leaders, activists and institutions argued Shokin was not pursuing corruption aggressively enough. They were largely united in seeking Shokin’s removal.  RELATED: Rand Paul’s false equivalence about Trump, Biden on Ukraine So in December 2015, Biden threatened to withhold the money in an attempt to get Ukraine to hire a new prosecutor. And the threat was ultimately successful; the Ukrainian government fired Shokin in March 2016. We’ve found no evidence that Biden pursued Shokin’s ouster because the prosecutor had inherited an investigation of corruption at Burisma, where Biden’s son was a board member. In addition to having international support for his anti-Shokin position, Joe Biden was acting on behalf of the U.S. government and the views of its foreign policy analysts. Then there’s the fact that what Biden did likely doesn’t meet the threshold for the legal definition of blackmail, as the post claims. ""Blackmail is an unlawful demand for compliance with a threat to disclosure of harmful information,"" said Kenneth Nunn, a law professor at the University of Florida, in an email. ""Based on what I know about the Ukrainian situation, the demand made by Biden that Ukraine’s prosecutor cease corrupt activities would not be an unlawful demand."" In addition to mischaracterizing the nature of Biden’s dealings in Ukraine, this viral Facebook post distorts the chief reason for the House impeachment inquiry into Trump. The investigation centers on a July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During that call, Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine. Trump had temporarily frozen $400 million in aid to Ukraine before he made that request. The aid was released Sept. 11. In its impeachment report, the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee wrote that the chief motivation for pursuing the investigation was to determine whether Trump’s actions constituted an impeachable abuse of power. RELATED: PolitiFact's Trump-Ukraine-Biden coverage in one place ""President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign,"" the report’s summary reads.  ""Accordingly, as part of the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in coordination with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, were compelled to undertake a serious, sober, and expeditious investigation into whether the President’s misconduct warrants that remedy."" The report also says the claim that Biden called for Shokin’s firing because he was investigating Burisma is ""a baseless allegation."" PolitiFact previously rated Half True a claim that Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion if Ukraine didn’t fire a prosecutor investigating Burisma, the energy company that his son Hunter worked for as a board member. This claim is more misleading and is reminiscent of a Trump campaign ad assertion that we rated False. A Facebook post claimed Joe Biden ""blackmailed"" Ukraine by withholding $1 billion from the country in order to kill an investigation of the company his son worked for. It also claimed Democrats want to impeach Trump because the president asked Zelensky about Joe Biden’s actions. Biden did threaten to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine if it didn’t fire a prosecutor who had been tasked with investigating corruption, including Burisma. But there’s no evidence he acted to protect his son’s business interests, and Biden was not alone in calling for the prosecutor’s ouster. Additionally, there is no evidence that Biden’s actions meet the legal definition of ""blackmail."" As for the impeachment inquiry, Democrats have been primarily concerned with whether Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate Biden constituted an abuse of power. They are not pursuing impeachment against Trump ""for simply asking if it was true"" that Biden ""blackmailed"" Ukraine. We rate this claim False.

GOP congressman says terrorists in Iraq had more due process rights than Trump. He’s wrong
","In a House Judiciary Committee hearing, a southwest Florida Republican congressman said the impeachment process had reached a new level of unfairness: Not only was President Donald Trump receiving less due process than average Americans, but Iraqi terrorism suspects are treated more fairly.  ""Even terrorists in Iraq were afforded more due process than you and the Democratic majority have afforded the president,"" said U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, directing his comment to Democratic committee leaders Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff. ""I know, because I served in Iraq, and I've prosecuted terrorists in Iraq, and we provided terrorists in Iraq more rights and due process in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq then you and Chairman Schiff have afforded the president of the United States."" We decided to check out his comparison. Steube’s spokeswoman did not respond to our requests for evidence.  Like similar claims before his, we found Steube ignores that the stage where Trump would receive due process to defend himself is in the Senate — and also that Trump’s team was invited to participate in the House Judiciary hearing. Related: Should Trump be impeached? What law professors said at the House hearing The U.S.-led coalition created the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) in 2003 for Iraqi judges to hear serious cases, including terrorism. Steube, who was a captain U.S. Army JAG Corps in Iraq, said on Fox News that defendants could present evidence and call witnesses. While the U.S.-created court was intended to include standards of due process, the court was criticized by the media and human rights groups. Human Rights Watch concluded in 2008 that the court failed to meet due process standards. The report stated that confessions were likely coerced, some defendants were held with no hearings for two years, and defense counsel had scant access to files before court. Vanderbilt Professor Mike Newton, an expert on international law and Army veteran, said that the Iraqis had due process rights but in practice rarely used them. But he said that the system in the court in Iraq is a different system than the American judicial system. In Iraq, the judge already has the entire dossier of evidence, unlike the adversarial system in the United States in which the prosecutor and defense make their cases in front of the judge. The comparison of the Iraqi court system to the House impeachment hearings is misleading for another reason. It misrepresents what the Constitution asks the House to do in impeachment proceedings. The House’s role is akin to the role of prosecutors who gather facts and decide whether to present a case for potential charges to a grand jury. If a prosecutor proceeds with charges, that triggers the due process rights for the defendant.  Under the Constitution, the trial phase involving due process happens in the Senate. It comes after the House decides whether there are grounds for impeachment. (The House is expected to vote on articles of impeachment before Christmas.) ""This idea that the rights that you saw in a criminal system — any criminal system, American, Iraqi, whatever — aren’t being provided by the House of Representatives misrepresents what the House is doing,"" said Scott Anderson, a Brookings Institution fellow and former State Department legal adviser. Stanford law professor David Alan Sklansky said Steube’s comparison doesn’t make sense. ""Impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives can't be compared to a criminal trial,"" he said. ""An impeachment is just a formal charge; the trial is then held in the Senate. So what happens in the House of Representatives is like what happens during the charging stage of a criminal case. In the United States decisions at the charging stage are made either inside the prosecutor's office or in the grand jury.  Either way, the proceedings are held behind closed doors, and defendants have few if any rights."" It’s important to know the White House was invited to participate in the Dec. 4 House Judiciary Committee hearing of four constitutional scholars’ arguments for and against impeachment. The White House declined to participate, criticizing the process on multiple grounds. Senate leadership has held closed-door meetings about the impeachment, so it’s not clear exactly how it will conduct the trial. But that decision lies with the Republican-controlled Senate.  ""I highly doubt they will fail to give adequate due process to a president of their own party,"" said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. Steube said, ""We provided terrorists in Iraq more rights and due process in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq then"" House Democratic leadership has afforded President Donald Trump. This is a misleading comparison between two entirely different types of venues — criminal cases in Iraq and the impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House.  Trump is not yet on trial. The House’s role is akin to a grand jury, a place where prosecutors — or in this case, House members — decide whether to proceed with a case. If the House approves articles of impeachment, then it will go to the Senate for a trial. It is in that venue where Trump would be afforded due process rights. Also, there is some question about whether Iraqis really had due process rights in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. This statement rates False. ","[('Human Rights Watch, The Quality of Justice, 2008', 'https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/12/14/quality-justice/failings-iraqs-central-criminal-court'), (""Washington Post, Iraq's New Form Of Justice Seems To Satisfy Few; Case Offers View of U.S.-Backed Court, Aug. 4, 2004"", 'No link'), (""New York Times, Iraq's Legal System Staggers Beneath the Weight of War, Dec. 17, 2006"", 'https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/world/middleeast/17justice.html'), ('Fox News, Neil Cavuto interview with U.S. Rep.

Pants on Fire claim that Adam Schiff under investigation for Burisma ties
","One America News, a pro-Trump cable news upstart, posted a story with a powerful headline. ""Adam Schiff Under Investigation for Ukrainian Burisma Oil Connections,"" it said Nov. 30. It would be a twist if Schiff himself were under investigation for his ties to Burisma. But One America News’ report is rife with factual errors and misleading innuendo. Schiff, D-Calif, spearheaded the House Intelligence Committee investigation into President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. When his father was vice president, Hunter Biden took a lucrative post on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. One America makes a claim that Schiff has received campaign donations from companies tied to Burisma.  ""New evidence appears to show that Schiff has received donations from two U.S. corporations tied to the $7.4 billion corruption scandal involving Ukrainian gas giant Burisma,"" One America News reported. ""A report from Gateway Pundit shows Schiff has received numerous donations from both Blackrock and Franklin Templeton Investments. Both of which are now part of a criminal investigation for laundering money through Burisma."" One America News seems to have confused donations with investment earnings. Campaign finance records show neither of the two investment companies mentioned — Blackrock and Franklin Templeton — made any campaign donations to Schiff.  On his 2017 financial disclosure form, Schiff showed dividends, capital gains and interest earned on seven funds managed by the Blackrock and Franklin Templeton firms, out of a total of 38 investments.  So, there’s a ""connection,"" but not the sort that the One America News report described. Note that by 2017, Schiff had sold his Blackrock holdings. As for Franklin Templeton, the firm offers a wide variety of funds, and more Republicans (22) held Franklin Templeton funds than did Democrats (18). The claim about an underlying ""criminal investigation for laundering money"" comes from an article on the Ukrainian news website Interfax Ukraine. At a news conference, two members of parliament called for an investigation into the alleged diversion of $7.4 billion by deposed former president Viktor Yanukovych. They said, according to ""investigative journalists,"" Ukraine’s prosecutor general has ""suspicions"" of money laundering.  The Ukrainian lawmakers mentioned Burisma and the two fund management firms, but offered no clear connection between Burisma and the other two companies. The pair cited no official materials from the Prosecutor General’s office. They said nothing about Schiff.  Many conservative websites have been carrying this story, and, from what we see, the connection to Schiff stems solely from his holdings managed by the two fund management firms.  One America News said that Schiff is ""under investigation for Ukrainian Bursima oil connections."" The notion that Schiff has ""connections"" to Burisma oil stems from a news conference held by two Ukrainian lawmakers, who actually never mentioned Schiff or presented official documents. The lawmakers called for an investigation; they did not announce one. The news report confused earnings on mutual fund investments with campaign donations. The firms cited gave no money to Schiff.
