Chris Christie claims United States has “the world’s greatest health care system”
","As Gov. Chris Christie made his pitch Tuesday for electing Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, the governor ripped into the signature legislation of President Barack Obama’s tenure: health care reform.

""Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world’s greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor,"" Christie said during his keynote address at the Republican National Convention.

Putting aside the debate over the health care reform law, Christie’s boasting made us wonder: Does the United States really have ""the world’s greatest health care system""?

The answer is not perfectly clear, but the findings of various studies have created a portrait of a United States where the health care system performs relatively well in certain areas and less so in others, as compared with other countries. In short, it’s a mixed bag.

""We just don’t come out as the best,"" Robert Berenson, a health care policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, told us.

In a separate fact-check, we evaluated Christie’s claim that the health care reform law is ""putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor.""

Now, let’s look at where the U.S. health care system stacks up internationally.

To analyze Christie’s claim, we first turned to a fact-check from PolitiFact National, which issued a Half True on a similar claim by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) that the United States has ""the best health care delivery system in the world.""

As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, the World Health Organization has ranked the U.S. health care system as the 37th best out of 191 countries for ""overall performance."" WHO, which is part of the United Nations system, issued that ranking in its World Health Report 2000.

The methodology behind that study has drawn a great deal of criticism, but more recent analyses also have shown the United States falling behind in certain categories.

A study updated in June 2010 by the Commonwealth Fund found that the U.S. health care system ranks last or next-to-last when compared with six other nations for five performance measures, including access to care and efficiency.

""The U.S. health system is the most expensive in the world, but comparative analyses consistently show the United States underperforms relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance,"" according to the study.

In June, the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released data on various health care indicators for 34 member countries, including the United States.

As a share of gross domestic product, the United States in 2010 accounted for the highest level of health care spending among OECD countries. Yet the United States had fewer practicing physicians per-capita than in most of the countries. Compared to the OECD average of 3.1 physicians per 1,000 residents, the United States had 2.4 physicians in 2010. An OECD study released last year also presented a mixed picture on vaccination rates. The United States was above the OECD average for rates of flu vaccination for senior citizens. But the country was below OECD averages for the percentage of children vaccinated for pertussis, measles and hepatitis B.

However, that same study also said the United States was ""performing very well in the area of cancer care, achieving higher rates of screening and survival from different types of cancer than most other developed countries.""

For example, between 2004 and 2009, the five-year relative survival rate for breast cancer in the United States was 89 percent, marking the highest level among OECD countries.

Berenson, the health care policy expert at the Urban Institute, said the United States is in the middle of the pack for the quality of health care services.

""The US does relatively well on caring for seriously ill patients at risk of death and disability, such as treating car accident victims and life threatening illnesses for those with health insurance, but does relatively poorly on primary and preventive care, such as caring for patients chronic health conditions, such as diabetes,"" Berenson said in an e-mail.

Our ruling

In his keynote address, Christie claimed the United States has ""the world’s greatest health care system.""

However, studies have suggested the quality of the U.S. health care system is a mixed bag. For example, the United States has fallen behind some other nations for access to care and childhood vaccination rates, but in terms of cancer care, the United States is outperforming most other developed countries.

We rate the statement Half True.

Crossroad GPS says the $1.17-trillion health care law Sherrod Brown backed taxes manufacturers
","
Crossroads GPS, the conservative political advocacy group created by Karl Rove, is one of the top spenders among the third-party organizations targeting Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in his re-election battle with Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.

A spin-off of the group American Crossroads, it has spent money most visibly on television ads attacking Brown's record.

Among them is ""Doing,"" a 30-second spot whose several claims include the assertion that Brown voted ""for the 1.17 trillion dollar health care law that adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers.""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered particularly about a tax aimed at manufacturing. We asked Crossroads how it supports its cost and tax claim.

Crossroads pointed to a July report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The report says that the insurance coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act -- the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare -- contains added costs of $1.17 trillion from 2012 to 2022, confirming the figure in the ad.

The cost figures only paint part of the picture, however.

The CBO report, and the staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that the cost figures ""do not include the budgetary impact of other provisions of the ACA, which in the aggregate reduce budget deficits.""

When assessing the overall cost of the health care law, the CBO said it could actually reduce budget deficits, because of its provisions that reduce net outlays and because of provisions that increase federal revenues. Those offset the added costs, and then some.

One of those provisions is a 2.3-percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices.

Crossroads GPS cites that as the ""new tax on Ohio manufacturers,"" and notes that the Joint Committee on Taxation says it will generate $20 billion in revenue by 2020.

The tax does not apply to devices made for export, or to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids or other medical device ""generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use,"" the law states.

It applies to imported devices as well as those made domestically.

In responding to our query, Crossroads GPS also pointed to a 2011 study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed. It said that the excise tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, leading to the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs.

An analysis by the research service Bloomberg Government, however, found that the trade group's study ""is not credible."" Bloomberg concluded that its assumptions conflict with economic research, overstate companies’ incentives to move jobs offshore, and ignore the positive effect of new demand created by the healthcare law.

Crossroads GPS also cited an article in the Columbus Dispatch, ""Medical-device makers fight tax,"" to show the tax's negative effects on jobs.

But the same article notes that AdvaMed and industry officials ""could not cite an example in Ohio of a company that has cut jobs or put growth plans on hold in anticipation of the tax.""

Where does that leave us?

The ad's statement is partially accurate. The Crossroads ad puts an accurate figure on the 10-year net cost of the healthcare law.

But the claim leaves out several important details.

While there is a federal cost generated by the insurance requirements, overall the law would reduce federal deficits, according to the same reports that Crossroads cites.

The law does include an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Its impact is arguable. Dissenters say it could cost jobs and force business overseas.

But portraying it broadly as ""a new tax on Ohio manufacturers"" over bills the scope of the tax.

In Ohio, Crossroads said, about 20,000 workers are employed by makers of medical devices and equipment. Those jobs amout to about 3 percent of the more than 660,000 workers in Ohio that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says are employed in manufacturing.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True. ",/factchecks/2012/aug/30/crossroads-gps/crossroad-gps-says-117-trillion-health-care-law-sh/
"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'Anthony Gemma']","
Anthony Gemma says that when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was mayor of Providence, the city had ""amongst the last school system in the entire country.""
","
In between leveling charges Tuesday night that U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was a liar and had committed voter fraud -- charges that Cicilline strenuously denied -- challenger Anthony Gemma claimed that the first-term congressman’s  ""number one lie"" pertained to the condition of Providence’s schools while Cicilline was mayor.

During their first television debate in the 2012 primary race, broadcast on WPRI-Channel 12, Gemma said Cicilline had described the capital city’s school system during his eight years as mayor in glowing terms when that was far from the truth.

""When Mr. Cicilline was mayor of Providence -- we’re going to stumble on the number one lie of Mr. Cicilline during his tenure as mayor --what he said is that the City of Providence during his eight years had a world-class -- and he used the word world-class -- school system. And not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but, as measured, was amongst the last school system [sic] in the entire country.""

We knew that the city’s schools -- like those in many urban centers -- have problems and are among the most troubled in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are among the worst in the entire country.

We called the Gemma campaign to get the candidate’s supporting evidence and, while we waited for a response, started doing our own research.

At no time in American history are students and their schools more tested and ranked than today. With every changing season, it seems, comes another report evaluating their educational progress and slippage.

There are tests that can be used to compare schools within the same district and school districts within each state. There is even the rare instance of one state’s schools ranked against another state's. But we could not find one ranking that measured Providence’s school system against other city systems around the country, as Gemma claimed, let alone that ranked it so poorly.

We called the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, a statewide children’s policy organization. Neither knew of any national test rankings that ever compared the performance of Providence’s school system with, for example, Los Angeles or Cincinnati.

Terris Ross, a research scientist at The National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, said the center does compile an annual list of statistics on the nation’s 100 largest school districts. But it does not rank or compare school districts by achievement or performance.

Locally, Providence’s schools rank among the worst in Rhode Island. According to data by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, 65 percent of Providence’s public schools made ""insufficient progress"" in 2008 while Cicilline was serving the third of his four terms as mayor.

But what Gemma’s campaign spokesman supplied as evidence supporting the candidate’s remarks was way off the mark.

In an e-mail, Alex Morash said Gemma’s claims were based on low marks given in several studies to  ""Rhode Island and/or Providence schools. "" But how Rhode Island schools fared is not at issue here at all.

Gemma specifically criticized Cicilline for the low marks Providence schools allegedly received while Cicilline was mayor. And none of the studies his campaign provided links to specifically ranked Providence against other cities in the nation.

Further,  the only reference the Gemma campaign provided of Cicilline using the phrase ""world class"" was a speech Cicilline gave at a school in Cumberland talking about the importance of students -- in general -- receiving a ""world- class"" education.

Cicilline was using the phrase as a goal to shoot for -- not, as Gemma claimed, to describe Providence’s schools.

Our ruling

Anthony Gemma, who is challenging David Cicilline in the Democratic primary for Rhode Island’s 1st District congressional seat, said the former Providence mayor had described the capital city’s school system as world class when, in fact, ""not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but as measured, was amongst the last school system in the entire country.""

We’ve already cited why Gemma was wrong about the ""world-class"" remark. Concerning the schools, neither state nor federal education officials know of any national school-district ranking that would have placed the city’s school system among the worst in the country.

And Gemma didn’t provide any.

For those reasons, we rate his statement a world-class False.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says the United States has been growing jobs for 24 months
","
In the contest for the hearts and minds of voters, Democrats have been claiming that the economy is really improving and the Republicans have been saying they can make the anemic recovery even more robust.

During the online-only portion of the Aug. 28 Providence Journal-WPRI debate among Democrats David Cicilline and Anthony Gemma, both running in the 1st Congressional District, incumbent Cicilline was asked how he would tackle the massive national debt.

Cicilline said that in addition to cutting spending and closing loopholes in the tax system, the pace of job creation needs to increase.

""When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now we've had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months,"" he said.

We've heard a lot of chatter about the job numbers and whether they really indicate a recovery, so we decided to look further.

First, a look at what the employment situation was like when Obama took office.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that in January 2009, when the president was sworn in, the country lost 818,000 jobs. (The numbers do not include farm workers and are adjusted for seasonal shifts in employment, but that's the standard way of calculating employment and unemployment rates.)

That's 17 percent more than the 700,000 jobs Cicilline cited.

(To put the numbers in perspective, the losses for the first three full months that Obama was in office averaged 738,000 per month. The average job loss for the last three full months of the Bush administration was 651,000.)

When it comes to the number of months in which the United States has had job growth, Cicilline's timeframe was also somewhat off.

BLS data show that the last time the United States lost jobs was in September 2010, when 27,000 jobs were lost.

That's 22 months ago, not 24. 

How significant have the increases been?

Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution told PolitiFact National in May that the economy needs to create 90,000 to 100,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with the number of people coming into the work force.

During 7 of those 22 months, including as recently as April, May and June of this year, job growth was below 100,000. In 8 of the 22 months, it was over 200,000.

When we asked his campaign for the source of Cicilline's statement, spokeswoman Nicole Kayner sent us a White House blog item from Aug. 3 reporting: ""The economy has now added private sector jobs for 29 straight months."" We confirmed that with the BLS database, but this is for non-government jobs, and Cicilline didn't make that distinction in his debate comment.

Our ruling

In the debate, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said: ""When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now we've had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months.""

We want to note, as we repeatedly have, that even though there's been improvement in the job numbers during the Obama administration, a president's ability to influence the economy is severely limited.

As for Cicilline’s comment, he understated the job losses occurring when President Obama took office and, by the most commonly used measure, he overstated by two months the timespan of continued job growth. But his main point -- that there has been growth for nearly two years -- is sound. 

Because the statement is ""accurate but needs clarification or additional information,"" we rule it Mostly True.

Paul Ryan touts Mitt Romney's record in Massachusetts on income, unemployment and credit worthiness
","
As part of the Republican Party’s continuing effort to celebrate business success and private-sector ingenuity, Paul Ryan offered Mitt Romney as Exhibit A during his convention speech in Tampa.

""Mitt has not only succeeded, but succeeded where others could not,"" the Wisconsin congressman and vice presidential nominee said. ""He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending, and corruption – sounds familiar, doesn’t it?""

Ryan then turned to Romney’s four years as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007

""He was the Republican governor of a state where almost nine in ten legislators are Democrats, and yet he balanced the budget without raising taxes. Unemployment went down, household incomes went up, and Massachusetts, under Mitt Romney, saw its credit rating upgraded.""

Let’s look at the last three claims.

PolitiFact fact-checked the household income trends and found an increase of $5,500 under Romney without considering inflation -- but a decrease in real dollars after adjusting for inflation.

That earned a Romney surrogate a Half True for noting only the positive side of the equation. 
On unemployment, PolitiFact tested a Romney claim that he reduced Massachusetts unemployment to 4.7 percent. We rated that claim Half True; the number was correct, but we ruled that Romney did not deserve as much credit as he was giving himself. The employment situation in Massachusetts was subject to many factors, not just the governor’s policy.

Finally, the credit rating.

Multiple media accounts, including stories in the Tampa Bay Times and The Hill, have noted that Romney was among the governors who achieved a credit rating upgrade while in office.

This was how the Tampa Bay Times put it in a July 15, 2012, story:

Romney had an advantage of entering office as the economy was improving — though the state budget did not yet reflect it. He also had the benefit of a 2002 tax increase without having to shoulder any responsibility.

In 2004, Romney's administration lobbied Standard & Poor's to improve Massachusetts' credit rating based in part on the extra money generated by that tax hike — which raised capital gains tax rates, eliminated charitable deductions, delayed a planned cut to the state income tax and raised the state cigarette tax 75 cents.

A presentation to Standard & Poor's, which was first obtained by POLITICO, included the tax increases on a computer slide that said Massachusetts ""acted decisively to address the fiscal crisis.

The state's credit rating was upgraded four months later, from AA- to AA.""

 Our ruling

Ryan said in his convention speech that when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, unemployment went down, household income went up, and the state’s credit rating was upgraded.

Ryan’s claim was well grounded mathematically on the unemployment and credit-rating claims. The income claim comes with a significant footnote: That increase turned to a decrease when the numbers are adjusted for inflation.

We also have noted that no governor can take major credit for economic trends in his or her state. Many other facts are at work than just a governor’s actions.

Did Barack Obama break a promise to keep GM plant open?
","
If the hometown of Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has had an icon during his lifetime, it was a sprawling General Motors auto assembly plant.

For decades, the Janesville, Wis., plant gave thousands of people a comfortable living. In 1970, the year Ryan was born, it employed 7,000.

Ryan stirred memories of the factory on Aug. 16, 2012, attacking President Barack Obama during a campaign speech in Ohio.

""I remember President Obama visiting it when he was first running, saying he'll keep that plant open. One more broken promise,"" Ryan said.

He made the same point Aug. 29 during his speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa:

""My home state voted for President Obama,"" he said. ""When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory.

""A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you … this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That’s what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn’t last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that’s how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight.""

Did Obama make such a promise as a candidate and break it after becoming president?

Actually, the plant closed before he even took office.

The plant

In 1918, General Motors bought a farm implement manufacturing plant in Janesville, a city of 60,000 near the Illinois border. Production of Chevrolets began there in 1923. Employment peaked at 7,100 in 1978, but a series of five layoffs occurred over the next 30 years.

By December 2008, when President George W. Bush authorized nearly $14 billion in loans to General Motors and Chrysler, both of which were near financial collapse, GM had already warned it might close the Janesville plant because of sagging sport-utility vehicle sales. The plant was effectively shut down on Dec. 23, 2008, when GM ceased production of SUVs there and laid off 1,200 workers. (Several dozen workers stayed on another four months to finish an order of small- to medium-duty trucks for Isuzu Motors.)

So, the plant closed while Bush was still in office, about a month before Obama was inaugurated.

Ryan's evidence

We asked Kevin Seifert, spokesman for Ryan's U.S. House campaign, for evidence that Obama promised to keep the Janesville plant open and failed. (Ryan will be on the November 2012 ballot both for his House seat and as Mitt Romney's running mate.)

Seifert cited this portion of a February 2008 campaign speech then-Sen. Obama gave at the Janesville plant:

""And I believe that if our government is there to support you, and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another hundred years.  The question is not whether a clean energy economy is in our future, it’s where it will thrive.  I want it to thrive right here in the United States of America; right here in Wisconsin; and that’s the future I’ll fight for as your president.""

That's a statement of belief that, with government help, the Janesville plant could remain open -- but not a promise to keep it open.

Seifert also referred us to Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Romney-Ryan campaign. Buck cited a Detroit News article on the same speech, saying the article made clear that ""it was the takeaway from the event that (Obama) was pledging to keep the plant open if he got his bailout.""

That might have been Buck's interpretation. But the article reported that Obama, who later provided an $80 billion auto bailout, had pledged to help keep the Janesville plant and others like it ""viable."" That's not quite the same thing as pledging keep the Janesville plant open. We find nothing in the article that he explicitly promised to keep it open.

Our rating

Ryan said Obama broke his promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing. But we don't see evidence he explicitly made such a promise -- and more importantly, the Janesville plant shut down before he took office.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan said President Obama “funneled” $716 billion out of Medicare “at the expense of the elderly.”
","
Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has made some of his sharpest attacks yet on Barack Obama’s health care law, calling the law ""the greatest threat to Medicare.""

Ryan himself advocates a plan to give voucher-like credits to seniors, so they can shop for a private plan or choose a traditional Medicare option. That plan has come under withering attack from Democrats.

Ryan fired back Aug. 29 during his acceptance speech at the at the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

""The biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly,"" Ryan said. ""You see, even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health care takeover, even with a new law and new taxes on nearly a million small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn’t have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more.  

""So, they just took it all away from Medicare, $716 billion, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed, all to pay for a new entitlement we didn’t even ask for. The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we’re going to stop it.""

Ryan’s comments are highly misleading. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Still, the number has a slight basis in fact.

The health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The total anticipated savings comes to $716 billion over the next 10 years, as determined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

We should note that both parties agree Medicare spending is increasing too fast as baby boomers retire and medical costs increase. The government needs to find savings so those costs don’t overwhelm the federal budget in the future.

So, yes, Obama’s law did find $716 billion in spending reductions. They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost the government more than traditional Medicare. The health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.
   
Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.
   
Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures, the overall Medicare budget is still projected to go up for the foreseeable future.

There is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending.

We should point out that some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs.
   
More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending.
   
The health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending.

Our ruling

Ryan said Obama ""funneled"" $716 billion out of Medicare ""at the expense of the elderly."" This gives a very misleading impression.

In fact, the law limits payments to health care providers and insurers to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Lawmakers said they hoped the measures would improve care and efficiency. Those savings, spread out over the next 10 years, are then used to offset costs created by the law (especially coverage for the uninsured) so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. Ryan’s statement is exaggerated and we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/30/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-president-obama-funneled-716-billio/

Barack Obama proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores, John Thune said
","
Hey kids on farms! Set down your screwdrivers and bags of seeds! Put your feet up and relax! Fire up the Xbox! The federal officials in the big urban city of Washington D.C. have put a target on family farms and part of that includes banning chores, says Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.

""The big-government bureaucrats of the Obama administration have set their sights on our way of life,"" Thune said during the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Aug. 29. ""Instead of preserving family farms and ranches, President Obama's policies are effectively regulating them out of business. His administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores!""

Is it true that Obama’s administration proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores?

We’ve heard similar claims about a proposed U.S. Department of Labor rule change about children working on farms. Members of Congress such as U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., said the proposed rule ""would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture....The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose.""

Rooney was particularly concerned about regulations on power equipment. We ruled his statement Mostly False, though, in April 2012. The proposed rule didn’t specifically mention hoses or screwdrivers, and the Labor Department specifically said it had no intention of banning children from using such equipment.

Thune introduced legislation in March 2012 to block the Labor Department from enacting the proposed restrictions.

The Labor Department wrote that the goal was to increase safety and provide parity between rules for children working on farms and non-farm settings. The department was specifically concerned about actual cases of minors killed or maimed in incidents with equipment on farms. But the widespread criticism prompted the Labor Department to yank its proposal, which never went into effect.

Parental exemption

Thune mentioned ""family farms,"" which suggests Obama’s administration wanted to ban kids from doing chores even on their own parents’ farms. By saying ""chores"" rather than something such as ""paid work"" Thune seems to also be suggesting that this is work on their own parents’ farms.

For decades, though, a parental exemption has allowed children to do any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. That means if Dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids’ chores, the feds won’t raise a fuss.

The summary of the proposed rules stated they ""would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents.""

As we wrote in a fact-check of a similar claim from U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., that meant no matter the government rules, if a parent who owns a farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine, there’s nothing to prohibit it.

That seems like an important and broad exception, given that the bill sponsored by Alexander and 44 others has as its title: ""Preserving America's Family Farm Act."" If you’re working your own parent’s farm, the proposed rules wouldn’t have applied at all.

The way the department interpreted that parental exemption -- that farms had to be wholly owned by parents for kids to work -- led to an outpouring of angry letters from family farmers who didn’t quite meet that strict definition. In February, the department announced that it would rework that section by 2012 and any decision on a final rule would follow.

But that still left a lot of proposed no-nos for children working somewhere other than their own parents' farms. Children under 16 would have been banned from harvesting tobacco, doing certain work with animals, and working from ladders or structures at elevations higher than 6 feet. Violators would have faced fines, and the government could have stopped shipment on crops.

Our ruling

Thune said that the Obama administration ""even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores.""

There was a proposed rule, prompted by cases of children suffering injury or death while working with agricultural equipment.

But the rule did not apply to kids working on their parents' farms.

We should note there was controversy because some farmers felt that the Labor Department was interpreting the exemption too strictly. In the end, the whole proposed rule was tossed in the trash by federal officials after an outpouring of complaints.

But while the proposal was alive, federal officials did not propose banning children from doing basic chores on their parents’ farms.

At GOP convention, Rob Portman says Barack Obama “never even worked in business.”
","
When Barack Obama was seeking the presidency in 2008, Republicans frequently derided his career experience, saying it was limited to a scant four years in the U.S. Senate, some time in the Illinois Senate, and having been a ""community organizer"" in Chicago.

The GOP has often returned to that theme, asserting that Obama doesn’t have the business savvy and private-sector experience to lead the country out of the economic doldrums. And it has reached a fever pitch with a Republican National Convention dominated by criticism of Obama’s comment that business people ""didn’t build"" their businesses. (We’ve checked that contentious comment here.)

During his speech to delegates in Tampa, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- widely considered a finalist for the vice presidential slot eventually given to Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan -- brought up Obama’s career history again. He contrasted Obama’s work experiences with those of GOP nominee Mitt Romney, whose work has primarily been as a business executive.

""Then you have Barack Obama, who never started a business--never even worked in business,"" Portman said.

Obama’s work experience, or lack thereof, is well-plowed ground. So we thought we'd explore whether the president has ever worked in a business. (We interpreted Portman’s statement to mean that Obama had never worked in a private, profit-making enterprise.)

As PolitiFact first noted two years ago, the president does, in fact, have some experience in business.

In 1983 and 1984, he had a stint as a research assistant at Business International Corp. in New York City, where he helped write a newsletter.

From 1993 to 2004, he was an associate, and then a partner, at the Chicago law firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, where his work included employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases. (The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature.)

If you count the best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship.

Our rating

Clearly, Obama has had less experience in the private sector than Romney; before he became president, he spent most of his working life either in the non-profit sector or in politics. However, Portman went too far when he said that Obama has ""never even worked in business.""

Pam Bondi says women care most about jobs and the economy
","
Women and Mitt Romney see more eye-to-eye on the issues than the polls and press would have you believe, says Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

As the Republican National Convention convened in Tampa, CNN host Wolf Blitzer asked Bondi if she thought debate over abortion rights played into why Obama leads Romney with women. He pointed out the party’s policy platform, which calls for a ""personhood""-style amendment that would define life at the moment of conception.

Bondi said ""that issue really has not come up"" during her travels across the country on Romney’s behalf.

""What women care about are jobs, the economy, the unemployment rate,"" Bondi said on Aug. 27, 2012. ""You know, 401,000 women have lost jobs under President Obama’s reign.""

Later in the interview, she said, ""Wolf, when I’m around the country, women care about the same issues as men, and that’s getting jobs, keeping jobs.""

We’ve heard this retort from Republicans throughout this election cycle as reproductive rights issues have at times dominated the news.

We wanted to know if Bondi is right about jobs being the priority for women or if it just sounds nice on TV. We put the question to experts in polling, political science and women’s issues (and to Bondi’s press aides, who did not respond).

Women have trended Democratic since the Ronald Reagan-Jimmy Carter 1980 election, but abortion isn’t the driving issue, said Seth McKee, a University of South Florida political science professor.

""It’s one of the myths in American politics that people think that’s where the gap comes from,"" he said of abortion. ""There are lots of pro-choice men.""

Instead, the gender gap is traditionally widened by issues of aggression -- meaning, more aversion from women to war and gun rights -- and government programs. Women are more likely to be in charge of family decisions on education, health and budgets, so they place more value on programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.

""It’s typically the woman who is responsible for all of that,"" she said. ""And in general the Democrats are more supportive of providing those services to women and their families.""

Where do reproductive issues rank? Not high, no matter the poll.

Here’s how the issue of abortion ranked in May 2012 when Washington University’s American Panel Survey asked people what issue they thought is ""the most important problem facing the country today."" 
Abortion didn’t break a percentage point. 
Still, Bondi’s statement does not account for a couple factors, said Jeffrey Jones, managing editor of Gallup polls. First, he said, everyone cares most about the economy when it’s bleak. And even in a decent economy, sizing up single issues (abortion, gay marriage, campaign finance) next to as broad a topic as the economy is comparing apples and oranges.

In a close presidential race like this one, both sides will pounce on social controversies in hopes of moving the needle.

The Obama campaign, for instance, is using the abortion debate -- inflamed anew by Todd Akin’s ""legitimate rape"" controversy -- to appeal to unmarried women, said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

""Obama has to be sensitive to women's concerns about the economy and deflecting their concerns to issues such as contraception and abortion could be a good strategy,"" she said.

NARAL Pro-Choice America political director Beth Shipp said polls by the group show abortion rights help Obama among women labeled ""Obama defectors,"" meaning they voted for him in 2008 but are not committed this year.

""We don’t need to move 5 percent or 10 percent. We don’t need to move 2 percent,"" Shipp said. ""I can move a .5 percent or 1 percent and affect the outcome of this race.""

On the other side of the debate, anti-abortion advocates plan to use Obama’s ""extreme abortion record"" with the same end goal, according to an Aug. 29, 2012, Washington Post story.

Some experts argue that reproductive rights and the economy aren’t completely separate issues. If women aren’t worried about issues of contraception and abortion, it’s probably because they think those issues are long settled, says David Johnson, a University of South Florida history professor.

""Women in the ‘60s and ‘70s were fighting for reproductive freedom so that they could work,""
Johnson said in an interview. ""If they could not control when they could have children, they could not work.""

Our ruling

It’s worth noting that people on both sides of the issue believe debates on abortion rights can help or hurt a candidate on the margins in a tight race.

But Bondi is right that women, like men, place the most importance on economic issues this election cycle. We rate her statement True.

"['National', 'Welfare', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says that when his grandfather arrived in the U.S., “there were no government benefits for immigrants""
","
During a speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, former presidential candidate Rick Santorum evoked the America his father found when he arrived on these shores as an immigrant in the 1920s.

""In 1923, there were no government benefits for immigrants, except one: Freedom!"" Santorum said.

This is close to a claim by Santorum that made in a Feb. 29, 2012, speech near Knoxville, Tenn., he said that during that era ""there were no government benefits,"" which earned a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

So we will re-evaluate it here, though we won’t consider the issue of ""freedom,"" which we believe is too vague to be fact-checked.

When we first looked at this question, we found there were two major sources of payments to individuals prior to 1925 -- veterans benefits and workers' compensation.

Veterans benefits. The federal government began funding benefits for Civil War veterans in 1862, initially for those who had been injured and then, progressively, to wider and wider groups of those who had served. In 1904 President Theodore Roosevelt signed an order defining ""disability"" to include old age, as long as the beneficiary had at least 90 days of service and an honorable discharge.

University of Arizona economist Price V. Fishback wrote that ""roughly 40 to 48 percent of the elderly in the North and Midwest in the early 1900s were receiving pensions"" through the system. Peter Blanck and Chen Song wrote in a 2003 paper in the William and Mary Law Review that ""at its height in the 1890s, the (Union veteran) pension scheme consumed almost half of the federal budget and was intimately linked to the Republican Party's strategy to maintain the soldier vote and hold the White House.""

Worker compensation. A federal worker-compensation law to help civilian government workers injured or made sick on the job was adopted in 1908, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. Starting in 1911, states began passing such laws, and by 1929, laws were in effect in all but four states.

While these are the clearest examples that run counter to Santorum’s claim, there are a few other efforts worth noting.

Local government aid to the poor. During the period Santorum is talking about, local governments were responsible for providing benefits to the poor, Fishback told PolitiFact. These payments tended to be modest. Fishback cited a study by Brendan Livingston of Rowan University that looked at welfare policies in Massachusetts -- generally considered the most generous state in the first decades of the 20th century -- and found that local governments were spending an amount equivalent to about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all income earned by state residents on relief for the poor. Private charities were spending at about twice that rate.

By 1925, most states also had ""mothers' pensions"" on the books, which allowed widows to raise their children without having to put them in orphanages, according to Fishback’s paper. By then, a handful of states also had means-tested pensions for the elderly, and a sizable number had pensions for the blind. And states or municipalities often operated mental hospitals, old-age homes, orphanages and general hospitals, all for the public benefit.

Schools and universities. While education isn’t a direct payment to individuals, it’s worth pointing out that they represented a government-provided benefit in kind. ""Primary and secondary education were already overwhelmingly paid for by taxes from the late 1800s on,"" said Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis.

Meanwhile, higher education had land-grant subsidies -- federally backed institutions dating back to the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. ""Because they were public institutions, tuition was cheaper on account of public subsidies,"" said Gary Gerstle, a historian and political scientist at Vanderbilt University. ""This was clearly a government benefit.""

Health funding for mothers and newborns. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act, which gave states matching federal funds to build and operate prenatal and child health care centers.

All told, by 1922, various expenditures for public benefits amounted to 6.8 percent of expenditures by the three levels of government combined. Santorum does have a point that social welfare spending by 1925 was relatively small compared to what it would ultimately become, because two major programs, Social Security and Medicare, didn't start until later.

It’s worth noting that the specific individual Santorum cited -- his newly arrived immigrant grandfather -- wouldn’t have directly benefited from military pensions or a land-grant college upon his arrival on these shores, though other immigrants, such as those who arrived in time to serve in previous wars, could have. Experts contacted for this story said they were not aware that the benefits provided were restricted only to the native-born.

In the meantime, his ability to collect worker compensation would have depended on what state he lived in upon his arrival. Similarly, the local aid to the poor he would have qualified for would have varied significantly depending on what city or county he lived in, and it would have been small by the standards of later decades. Still, it was not zero, as Santorum said.

Our ruling

Contrary to Santorum’s claim, millions of Americans in the 1920s would have either qualified for benefits directly, such as payments to veterans, or have been protected by workers' compensation laws that provided benefits to those who became disabled by their jobs. And state and local governments had the longstanding role of paying support to people who were disabled or indigent. This provides a much more complex picture than Santorum is painting.

Stephanie Cutter said Mitt Romney's platform won't protect the mortgage interest tax deduction for middle-class families
","
The Obama campaign, to no one’s surprise, is highly critical of the Republican Party’s platform.

In one email, Obama’s team offered several reasons for their disapproval, such as the Republicans will turn Medicare into a voucher program, they’ll ban marriage equality and reject civil unions of all kinds.

But one claim about the GOP agenda and of its standard bearer, Mitt Romney, caught us off guard, particularly since it is so divergent from a Republican Party tenet.

Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter wrote in an email that Romney ""won't protect the mortgage interest deduction for middle-class families if Romney enacts his tax plan, even though it helps more than 30 million middle-class families.""

Republicans generally support tax cuts. Could Cutter be right about this one?

We contacted Obama campaign officials, who did not respond immediately respond to a request for comment.

Generally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan on your home or a second home. The loan may be a mortgage to buy your home, a second mortgage, a line of credit or a home equity loan. In most cases, you can deduct all of your home mortgage interest, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

The mortgage interest deduction is a popular policy with millions of American homeowners, particularly middle-income earners. Nearly 50 percent of Americans who take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction make annual incomes between $100,000 and $200,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. As president, Ronald Reagan famously promised in a 1984 speech to the National Association of Realtors that he would ""preserve the part of the American dream which the home mortgage interest deduction symbolizes.""

Some argue the deduction is the federal government’s way of paying Americans to buy a house.

Over the years, there have been complaints that some wealthy Americans have abused the system, such as claiming deductions for yachts by claiming them as second homes. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in a 2010 report that the mortgage interest deduction will cost the federal government about $98.5 billion this fiscal year.

Romney’s idea is that tax rates could be lowered if the tax code was scrubbed of loopholes and exemptions. That way, the government would get the same amount of tax revenue coming in. But Romney won’t say which loopholes and exemptions he would like to target.

Democrats have argued that Romney’s tax plans would require him to make changes to the federal tax code, such as eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The Tax Policy Center released an analysis of Romney’s tax plans that concluded Romney would raise taxes on middle-income Americans if he eliminated the mortgage interest deduction and ended other policies, such as the charitable deduction.

The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Romney said at a fundraiser that he wants to stop allowing deductions on second homes. The Romney campaign later said the candidate was floating ideas and that it was not a firm proposal.

Several news outlets reported earlier this month that the GOP was not going to support the mortgage interest deduction in its party platform. There was a battle over the deduction between the real estate industry, which wanted to keep it in the platform, and some conservative activists, who desired a simpler tax code, according to those reports. The Wall Street Journal later reported there was a compromise.

The Republican Party platform lays out its position in a section called ""Protecting The Taxpayers: ‘No More Too Big to Fail.’ "" It says at the top of Page 25 that ""we strongly support tax reform; in the event we do not achieve this, we must preserve the mortgage interest deduction.""

That wording does not explicitly back up Cutter's point. But it leaves open the possibility that eliminating the deduction could possibly be included in tax reform. Still, it's a stretch to conclude from that wording that Romney would eliminate the deduction. 
Our ruling

Cutter said, ""Mitt Romney's platform … won't protect the mortgage interest deduction for middle-class families."" Romney wants to limit some tax deductions in exchange for rate cuts, but he hasn’t said which deductions he wants to end. The platform's general wording leaves open the possibility of changes to the deduction, but specifically expresses support for it. We rate Cutter’s claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/29/stephanie-cutter/stephanie-cutter-said-mitt-romneys-platform-wont-p/

Scott Walker says 44 of 50 states last month saw unemployment-rate increases
","
  
Continuing the Republican Party’s attacks on President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took aim at the state-by-state jobless statistics during his opening-night speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

""Last month,"" he said, ""44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate.""

We decided to check whether this was accurate by looking up the most recent monthly state employment data published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

We found that Walker has counted correctly -- but he’s cherry-picked the numbers in a way that puts the most negative spin on the data.

First, many of the increases were so small that they were statistically insignificant. If something is statistically insignificant, that means it’s so small that you can’t be certain the change actually happened.

According to BLS, only 18 of the 44 states with a rise in unemployment between June 2012 and July 2012 had increases that were statistically significant. The remaining 26 were too small for anyone to be certain that a change actually happened. Typically these states had increases of two-tenths of a percentage point or less.

Second, there’s another way to look at the data -- not looking from one month to the next, but looking from July 2011 to one year later, July 2012.

Using this methodology, there were 18 states with statistically significant changes, of which 17 saw the unemployment rate decrease. Only one state increased.

Finally, it’s worth noting that the most recent figures are preliminary and may be adjusted. This increases the level of uncertainty in month-to-month comparisons.

""The month-to-month changes shouldn't generally be interpreted as being that tightly related to policy -- you want to look at longer-run trends for that, like year-on-year changes,"" said Tara Sinclar, a George Washington University economist.

Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, said Walker has a point. ""Both the state-level and national-level unemployment rates suggest there was some weakening of the job market in July compared with June,"" Burtless said. And the fact that each of the 18 statistically significant changes in the unemployment was upward supports the point.

Still, Burtless added that a different BLS report, the national employer survey estimate of job creation, showed a 163,000-job increase nationally in July, suggesting a strengthening job market. ""If one wanted to judge Gov. Walker’s statement harshly,"" Burtless said, ""one might say it is ‘true, but incomplete.’""

(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Our ruling

Walker’s statement that ""last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate"" is accurate, but it lacks some important context. In only 18 states, not 44, was the increase statistically significant. And longer-term employment data, particularly the year-over-year statistics, shows that the labor market has improved, suggesting that the labor picture is more complex than Walker’s claim would indicate. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-44-50-states-last-month-saw-unem/

Rick Scott says we have 'record funding' for the environment in Florida
","Gov. Rick Scott says that Florida has invested big bucks in the environment. As he boasted about the state’s record during his economic summit for GOP presidential contenders in Orlando June 2, Scott reeled off a bunch of statistics about Florida’s budget and economy including this one: ""If you care about the environment, we've got record funding."" Scott’s record on the environment has been scrutinized since he first ran for office in 2010. Since that time, news reports detailed how state officials under his watch have been banned from using terms such as ""climate change,""  environmental fines have nosedived, and Scott has boasted about reducing the number of days to get an environmental permit. But despite that record, does Florida now have ""record funding"" for the environment? No, it doesn’t. Everglades and springs funding Scott’s spokesman pointed us to his proposals to increase funding for springs restoration and for preserving the Everglades. During his re-election campaign in 2014, Scott promised to propose a $500 million plan over 10 years to restore springs. The 2013 budget included $10 million for springs, and the 2014 the budget included $30 million. In his budget proposal for 2015-16, Scott recommended $50 million. As for the Everglades, the state reached an agreement in 2012 with the federal government to end a dispute that predates Scott. Over 13 years, the state will spend $880 million on Everglades cleanup, or about $32 million a year. In 2014 the Legislature increased Everglades restoration funding to $169 million, more than double the previous year’s total. The Legislature also earmarked $90 million for raising 2.6 miles of the Tamiami Trail to let the Everglades flow more freely beneath it. That brought the total amount during that session to $259 million. ""The one place where he did step up was on the Everglades,"" said Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida. ""It was the environmental highlight of his term as governor."" But where Scott has fallen short on the Everglades is acquiring U.S. Sugar land south of Lake Okeechobee, Jackalone said. A deal in the works for the state to buy about 46,000 acres fell apart earlier this year. Department of Environmental Protection While Everglades and springs restoration are important parts of environmental funding, they don’t provide a complete picture. If we look back a decade at funding for the Department of Environmental Protection, the high point was $2.9 billion in 2006-07 under then Gov. Jeb Bush. DEP is tasked with protecting air, water and land. Under Scott, DEP’s budget peaked at $1.8 billion in 2011-12. In 2006-07, the state used an extra $310 million (on top of Florida Forever’s usual $300 million land-buying program) to purchase Babcock Ranch, 73,000 acres of cypress domes and pine forests in Charlotte and Lee counties. DEP’s budget was also in the $2 billion range part of the time under the next governor, Charlie Crist. But once the recession kicked in, DEP’s budget decreased. This year, the total budget is $1.56 billion, and for next year Scott proposed a budget of about $1.53 billion -- $29 million less than the current year. (You can see the year-by-year DEP funding and caveats including that it combines state and federal dollars.) What Scott omits There have been several other cuts related to the environment under Scott: ""Record funding"" for the environment has become a talking point for Scott. But after we rated a similar claim False in 2014, he tweaked his message to talk specifically about ""record funding"" for springs. On the national stage surrounded by presidential contenders in May, he went back to talking about record funding generically for the environment. But environmentalists say he doesn’t hold a record for overall environmental funding. ""He cut back services to DEP, he cut back funding to various water management districts in state, he hasn’t done what needs to be done to acquire sugar land south of Okeechobee to finish Everglades restoration,"" Jackalone said. Also, ""he cut back on environmental enforcement."" Our ruling Scott said, ""If you care about the environment, we've got record funding."" Scott's team points to investments the state has made to restore the Everglades and springs during Scott’s tenure -- and he has championed both. While those are high-profile projects, he claimed that Florida has ""record funding"" for the environment overall, and that’s not the case. The budget for the state Department of Environmental Protection and for Florida Forever were not a record under Scott -- two major pots of money that relate to the environment.

UPDATED: Rick Perry says Texas created 1.5 million jobs in seven years, rest of country down 400,000
","Addressing supporters in an airport hangar in Addison, Perry said that on his watch, companies in Texas created almost one third of all new American jobs. And, he said,  ""in the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs."" Sounded familiar. In May 2013, we found True a Perry claim about Texas accounting for 33 percent of the country’s net new jobs over the last 10 years. That conclusion was supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government.   Later, in January 2015, we rated Mostly True Perry’s statement that starting in December 2007, ""1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."" His figures mostly held up according to household surveys by the federal government looking into civilian employment including self-employment, though at the time positions not yet recovered outside Texas totaled closer to 350,000, according to the latest available data when Perry spoke to lawmakers Jan. 22, 2015.   When we looked at the earlier Texas-nation comparison by Perry, his spokesman encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint.   Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. ""In contrast,"" he wrote, ""civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level … there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007.""   To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls ""total employment,"" covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs.   Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates.   A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparisons, ""comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included.""   In contrast, the federal government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers ""covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments."" By this other metric, Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the bureau, told us, Texas netted 1.2 million additional jobs from December 2007 to December 2014. In the period, she said, 24 states had net decreases in total civilian employment.   But again, those figures weren’t total employment, the indicator chosen by Perry.   After Perry declared for president, we circled back to Abbot, who emailed us data indicating that from December 2007 to December 2014, Texas saw an increase in total employment of 1,572,694; the nation as a whole had a surge of 1,169,000. Put another way, but for Texas, the nation would have experienced a total employment decrease of 403,694.   When we looked into Perry’s seven-year contrast before, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute commented that the timeframe singled out by Perry may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government’s payroll surveys, he said, the country had added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. had added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them.   At the time, Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: ""Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did,"" he emailed. ""Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won’t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that’s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains,"" he wrote.   Also at the time, Abbot said by email Perry’s claim could have been precise by referring to ""total civilian employment"" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. ""On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763,"" Abbot wrote.   Our ruling   Perry said: ""In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs.""   These figures hold up though Perry cherry-picked a time period arguably giving Texas more of a gloss than it might get with other periods. More generally, no governor determines job gains or losses in a state; outside factors tend to prevail. In Texas, the fracking boom comes to mind. Governors don’t create oil and gas fields.   We rate this claim Mostly True.   MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.   CORRECTION, 12:40 p.m., June 18, 2015: This fact check was revised to correct our error in quoting an email from Cheryl Abbot of the BLS. This change, clarifying that 24 states had net decreases in civilian employment in the period singled out by Perry, did not affect our rating.",/factchecks/2015/jun/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-gained-15-million-jobs-over-/

At last count, there are 10 confirmed contenders (Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz) with more possible on the way (Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal). Fox News announced it would hold the first debate on Aug. 6 in Cleveland, but the cable network said it would invite only the top 10 declared candidates. The network’s ranking would be set according to ""an average of the five most recent national polls"" as of Aug. 4. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, called the cut-off arbitrary. Appearing on Fox News, where he once was a contributor, Santorum dipped into history to show that early poll results are meaningless. ""We should have the opportunity for everyone to be heard,"" he told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on June 7, 2015. ""You know, if you would have taken the top two-thirds of the folks in 1992, Bill Clinton wouldn't have been on the stage."" Clinton obviously went on to win the White House, and Santorum’s concern is obvious. While Santorum won 11 primaries in 2012, today he ranks tied for 11th in the latest Fox News poll. That’s just outside Fox News’ debate cut-off -- though that can change depending on who officially declares and what later polls show. We decided to dig into the wayback machine of primary polls. We wanted to know what numbers Santorum had in mind and reached out to his communication staff but did not hear back. What we found suggests Santorum is right that Clinton started out in 1991, the year before the presidential election, with low polling numbers. But Santorum is making a comparison that doesn’t quite fit because of the huge difference in the 1992 primaries versus the one beginning now. Moreover, by the time the Democratic candidates did debate in 1991, Clinton was not doing as poorly in the polls as Santorum claims. The early polls FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver accumulated and analyzed several cycles of presidential primary polls, including the cycle leading up to the 1992 election. Silver was able to find just three polls from January-June 1991, a period comparable to today. And the ones he found showed Clinton at the back of a crowded field -- with an average of just 1.7 percent.  That was good enough for 13th out of 19 prospective candidates. In a hypothetical sense, a debate that included the top two-thirds of those candidates just barely might have excluded Clinton. The problem with such a hypothetical is that there were hardly any declared Democrats running for president by June 1991. One of the conditions for the Fox News debate is that only official, announced and registered candidates need apply. In mid 1991, the would-be frontrunner was New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Cuomo ended up not running. And in fact, the top 9 candidates in early polls that year all declined to run, Silver found. Clinton himself didn’t announce his candidacy until October 1991. So a snapshot of June 1991 versus June 2015 is hardly useful. Neither is a comparison that focuses on an August 2015 debate. The earliest debates in the 1992 cycle we found were an NBC debate on Dec. 15, 1991, and one sponsored by PBS on Jan. 19, 1992. By then, the hypothetical field had been narrowed to actual candidates, and the polling was more favorable to Clinton. By the time of the first debates, there were five main Democratic candidates: Clinton, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Sens. Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas. A sixth candidate, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, withdrew on Jan. 8, 1992. He participated in the Dec. 15 debate but not the one on Jan. 19. A search on LexisNexis provided us with a handful of polls for the men who were left standing: Poll Date Brown Clinton Harkin Kerrey Tsongas New York Times/CBS Oct. 22 12 5 3 7 2 Los Angeles Times Nov. 12 18 9 6 5 4 Los Angeles Times Nov. 27 20 9 4 5 4 USA Today/CNN/Gallup Jan. 14 21 17 9 11 6   Silver’s polling average from July to December 1991 shows a tight pack: Candidate Polling average Mario Cuomo 9.9 Douglas Wilder 9.7 Jerry Brown 14.9 Bill Clinton 8.3 Bob Kerrey 7.7 Tom Harkin 6.3 Paul Tsongas 4.1   The point here is that there never were more than 10 serious declared candidates, as might happen in 2015. And Clinton’s position was not as poor as Santorum made it seem. By the time of the first debate, Clinton would have passed muster by the Fox News standard as an announced candidate ranked among the top two-thirds of the pack. Our ruling Santorum said that if Fox News had applied its 2016 rules to a hypothetical Democratic primary debate in 1992, that Clinton would not have been on the stage. Santorum was trying to make the point that early presidential polls may not be the most useful yardstick to determine who gets into a debate and who doesn’t. In that regard, Clinton’s story from 1991 somewhat backs that up. Early presidential polls showed Clinton as a significant underdog. But in reality, Santorum errs in trying to make a comparison between the 1992 and 2016 presidential cycles. Most of the top Democrats Clinton trailed in those early polls never actually declared as candidates. Under the Fox News rules, none of them would qualify to participate in its debate. And by the time the field was set in late 1991, Clinton’s position in the polls suggested he was a viable candidate.   Santorum’s statement contains an element of truth in that Clinton did start low in the polls, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/07/rick-santorum/foxs-debate-rules-would-have-kept-bill-clinton-sta/

Lincoln Chafee says Ronald Reagan talked about converting to the metric system
","When former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee announced he was joining the 2016 Democratic primary race, some people scratched their heads when he said switching to the metric system would be one of his goals as president. Of the world’s major countries, only the United States, Liberia and Myanmar don’t use metric units as their primary measurement systems. Instead, America uses U.S. customary units. CNN anchor Dana Bash asked Chafee about his desire to have the country use meters instead of feet and kilometers instead of miles in a June 7 interview. Noting that he lived in Canada while they converted to the metric system in the 1970s, Chafee said this discussion has been going on for a while in the United States. ""I know many in the scientific community, the health care community that deal internationally, the business community, are saying this is way overdue,"" he said. ""(Former President) Ronald Reagan talked about it. Others have talked about it."" It’s amazing how often politicians use Reagan’s name as a way to advance their cause. In this case, we wondered if Chafee’s claim measures up. Falling short In 1975, Former President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act, which created the United States Metric Board, charged with leading the planning and educational efforts for switching over to the metric system. (Check out this delightful cartoon about converting to the metric system from 1975.) So when Reagan took office in 1981, a government-backed push for metric conversion -- also known as metrication -- was already well underway. However, the Metric Board had limited effectiveness in that there was no mandatory conversion timeline, and the board included some members who actually opposed conversion. In 1982, Reagan effectively dismantled the metrication effort by stripping funding from the Metric Board. The group morphed into the Office of Metric Programs, under the Department of Commerce, with much less responsibility and less than a fifth of the budget. That year’s federal budget also cut a $2 million Department of Education program for metric education, according to the New York Times. The Reagan administration justified the Metric Board cut as part of a general reduction in federal spending, rather than opposition to conversion -- preferring to leave conversion to the private sector. Reagan’s budget proposal said, ""The board has accomplished its mission to familiarize the public with the metric system. Voluntary metrication will continue through market adjustments.'' The U.S. Metric Association, a current group dedicated to metric conversion, dug into this issue with Reagan Library materials. They found more than one piece of correspondence indicating that Reagan’s action against the Metric Board did ""not imply a lack of support for voluntary metrication."" It’s worth noting that Frank Mankiewicz, a former Democratic strategist and National Public Radio president, took at least partial credit for killing the Metric Board -- having convinced a top Reagan adviser that metrication could damage the country. We looked through newspaper archives with LexisNexis and found that for nearly the rest of the Reagan administration, there was very little talk of metric conversion, at least in Washington. (Other than in 1985, when the U.S. ambassador to Canada resigned in part because he called the Canadian metrication process ""rubbish."") But in 1988, his last year in office, Reagan signed into law an omnibus trade bill that included a slight amendment to the 1975 Metric Conversion Act. Tucked into the 1,000-page bill was a declaration that the metric system was ""the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce"" and called for federal agencies to switch to the metric system wherever practical by 1992. While supporters of metrication saw this as a win because it had a timeline for implementation and a directive for federal agencies, unlike the earlier legislation, some believed the bill was without teeth because it allowed agencies an economic out from conversion, according to news reports from the time. It’s unclear how much influence Reagan had over this amendment to the Metric Conversion Act because it went over with little fanfare, and we were unable to track down any relevant White House statement. Reagan’s successor, President George H.W. Bush, further solidified that directive with an executive order in 1991. All in all, the Reagan administration seemed ambivalent toward metrication, at best. Today, not all, but many federal agencies -- including the military -- use metric units almost exclusively, according to a statement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Many metric experts estimate that the United States is 50 percent metric, said U.S. Metric Association President Don Hillger, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. While most Americans use customary units in their homes, those in science and heavy industry typically use the metric system. He added that there is no longer a standard yard or pound because U.S. customary units are defined by their metric equivalents. ""So we really are on the metric standard in the U.S.,"" Hillger said. ""It’s just that we continue to use non-metric units that no other major country uses anymore."" Our ruling Chafee said, ""Reagan talked about"" converting to the metric system. The issue of metrication rose at the very beginning and at the very end of Reagan’s presidency. However, Chafee’s statement implies that Reagan had more than a passing interest in the issue, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The metrication process started before Reagan took office. He slowed the process to a standstill by taking away funding. He was silent on the issue for the next six years until he signed a law that directed federal agencies to make a more concerted effort to transition to metric units when practical -- though it’s unclear how much influence Reagan’s White House had on that tiny aspect of a 1,000-page omnibus bill. Without this additional context, Chafee’s claim is off by a few yards. Or meters.

Rep. Morgan says the Convention Center was sold with the pledge that it wouldn’t cost taxpayers
","State Rep. Patricia Morgan of late has repeatedly criticized the state’s financial support for the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority, asserting that the entity has cost taxpayers more than $450 million, even though it was never supposed to cost them a dime. Last week, the West Warwick Republican, who represents a group calling itself the Republican Policy Group, convened a press conference and unveiled an investigative report on the subsidies, which totaled more than $30 million last year. This included $23 million for debt service. ""Seriously,"" Morgan said, ""it was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime and it continues to cost us money."" Year after year, state budgets show, in addition to paying off the convention center’s debt -- its mortgage, so to speak -- the taxpayers have kicked in subsidies to keep the authority afloat. Since 1994, the state has allocated in excess of $450 million to the authority, which runs the Dunkin’ Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium in addition to the convention center. That’s a big number and it made us wonder: Did someone really say this facility would never cost taxpayers a dime? If so, what were they talking about? So we asked Morgan for her sources. We also searched through The Journal’s archives and found someone who had made just such a statement -- Richard M. Oster. Oster, the heir of a family metals enterprise, had risen to the loftiest heights of the business world, serving as the chairman of the London-based Cookson Group PLC, a multinational company. In 1987, then-Gov. Edward DiPrete installed Oster as chairman of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority. This made him the front man in 1989 for the campaign to sell the public on the need for a convention center, which was expected to cost $225 million. It was to be one of the largest economic development projects in Rhode Island’s history. Oster told The Journal such a facility would bring 500,000 visitors a year to the city, pump $60 million to $100 million per year into the economy and generate enough new tax revenue -- via hotel, income, sales and property taxes -- to offset the deficit from construction and operations. ""This won’t cost the taxpayers one dime,"" Oster said in 1989. That was his clincher, the line he used after detailing a list of economic benefits.   Morgan told us this was the quote she had in mind in her attack on the convention center’s finances. Morgan, however, did not talk about how Oster and the other proponents claimed that new tax revenue would make up for the taxpayers’ costs. Morgan’s repeated emphasis on costs without discussing new tax revenues drew criticism from Joseph R. Paolino Jr., the former mayor and another champion of the convention center. ""I think she’s wrong,"" Paolino said. ""I don’t think she truly understands the concept of the convention center and what a convention center is supposed to do for a community."" Paolino, who refers to the late Oster as ""one of the leading business giants of our community,"" says any analysis of convention center appropriations must consider tax revenue generated by convention center activity. This is the ""real story,"" he says. He acknowledged that he doesn’t know how Oster’s projections worked out. But last week the Authority said its experts calculate that the convention center, the Dunkin’ Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium have an average annual impact totaling $135 million and generate $10 million in state and local tax revenue across about 500 events — hockey games, conferences and musical performances among them. That’s the opposing point of view. Is it credible?   We turned to Gary Sasse, who headed up the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in the 1980s and is now director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University. Sasse, who supported the project in 1989, says he believes the presence of the convention center has had some degree of multiplier effect on the local economy -- possibly enough to offset costs. But Sasse emphasizes that the actual numbers are important for this debate and there is no independent entity around to do the hard work of providing a trustworthy assessment.   ""Who is the independent scorekeeper?"" he asks. ""That’s the problem."" Our ruling Morgan had her numbers right. And Richard Oster did famously tell the public that the center wasn’t going to cost the taxpayers a dime. But she failed to put Oster’s claim in context. Oster didn’t say convention center revenues would pay its bills. He was talking about the center’s overall economic impact. And, as Gary Sasse says, without an independent scorekeeper, we won’t know whether the center’s impact offsets its costs. As a result, we rate her statement Mostly True.

Brian Stelter: Fox 'barely covered' Duggar story until Megyn Kelly secured exclusive interview
","It’s been a big week for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, chosen by the famous Duggar family of TLC’s 19 Kids and Counting to exclusively air their side of the story involving the oldest Duggar son molesting five minors, including his sisters, a decade ago. But to some observers, Fox’s intense promotion of Kelly’s June 3 interview with parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and her later sit-down with two daughters molested by Josh Duggar marked a drastic shift in the network’s coverage of the story. ""It’s slightly amusing that Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview,"" said CNN senior media correspondent and Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter on June 2. ""Now they’ll be covering it a lot more."" We wanted to double-check Stelter’s analysis. Was Fox News essentially mum about the story until Kelly scored the at-home exclusive? Stelter told PunditFact that he first started thinking about the coverage disparity when he saw a story by liberal site Media Matters for America that compared light coverage by Fox with intensive coverage by MSNBC and CNN. He and CNNMoney media reporter Tom Kludt did their own research and reached a similar conclusion for a story about the interview. ""Along with the amount of time spent, we took into account the type of Fox's coverage,"" Stelter said. ""Early on, the mentions of the controversy were fleeting, not substantive at all."" The controversy went public when In Touch Weekly published the first story May 19 about Josh Duggar being the suspect in a 2005 underage sexual abuse investigation. In Touch and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published more stories May 21 based on a police report that said the father did not go to law enforcement until a year after the fondling incidents took place. After the stories appeared, Josh Duggar resigned his position as executive director of the Family Research Council and apologized in a statement, saying, ""Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation."" TLC pulled all episodes of 19 Kids and Counting the next day, May 22. Fox first told its viewers about the situation in a 30-second segment on May 22, followed by a  20-second segment on May 23. On May 26, the Duggars were mentioned on The Five in the context of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee defending the family. ""You don’t go around defending the Duggar family when you’ve got bigger issues going on,"" said pundit Greg Gutfeld.  Fox analyst Howard Kurtz criticized the media’s focus on the Duggar family in a May 24 segment. Those are the only references we could find before May 30, when Kelly’s interview was announced. Needless to say, those mentions of the story were super-brief — especially when you compare how the other networks handled it. CNN and MSNBC anchors devoted considerably more time to the controversy from the start. We used Critical Mention, which searches closed-captioning transcripts, to look for mentions of the Duggars on the three networks from May 19 to noon on May 30, roughly when the interview was announced. This method isn’t perfect — misspellings aren’t captured, for instance — but it does provide a rough snapshot of how often each network discussed the family. Fox News personalities mentioned ""Duggar"" four times. Within the same timeframe, the family name came up 99 times on CNN and 72 times on MSNBC. On Stelter’s home network of CNN, the story was brought up on five different shows on May 22, with Erin Burnett OutFront and Anderson Cooper 360 devoting substantial chunks of air time to interviews with an In Touch staffer and child psychiatry professionals, as well as going into other TLC shows with stars that fell from grace. CNN Tonight host Don Lemon continued to explore the story in his May 26-28 shows. On MSNBC, nearly every show on May 22 talked about the story, including hosts Alex Wagner, Ed Schultz, Al Sharpton and Chris Hayes, often bringing in experts to dissect some of the story’s finer points. The network continued to cover the story on May 26, 27 and 28. Fox began to report the story in more depth on June 1, when Kelly criticized the media’s handling of the story with Fox media analyst Howard Kurtz. She equated the rush to cover the story as feasting on a carcass, going after CNN specifically for bringing up how GOP presidential candidates had taken pictures with Josh Duggar before the scandal broke. Kelly’s coverage of the story has also focused on the release of police records, which she and the Duggars say should have never been made public. Other shows on the network, including The O’Reilly Factor, Outnumbered, Your World and Fox and Friends, started talking about the Duggars in the context of Kelly’s interview. From noon on May 30 to about 5 p.m. on June 5, there have been 134 mentions of ""Duggar"" on Fox, according to Critical Mention. Fox News spokespersons did not offer comment for the story. Our ruling Stelter said, ""Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview.""

West Texas sheriff says U.S. only nation not to use military to secure 'our border'
","A Texas sheriff was emphatic about the United States being alone on the planet in relying on non-military agencies to patrol its borders. Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter also was incorrect, we found. A Midland Reporter-Telegram news story posted online May 10, 2015 — in the wake of the Islamic State group claiming credit for a failed attack on a Garland, Texas, contest to draw cartoons of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad — quoted Painter saying he had no doubt ISIS has ""contacts in Mexico supporting them. They’re a huge threat,"" Painter said, ""because it is an avenue of approach to get into the U.S."" Our eyes clamped on what Painter said next: ""We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border. We’re not serious about it."" By phone, Painter told us the United States is one of the few nations in the world not using the military to secure the border. He said he based his declaration on news reports showing military forces on the borders of other countries. ""All you’ve got to do is look at the news on TV,"" Painter said. ""You see it."" He said he didn’t remember which countries he saw on those news reports. Experts say not so In contrast, experts we consulted called the Texan’s statement a substantial exaggeration. That said, some countries have heavy military presences on national borders, such as the forces watching over the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea. Separately, Israel’s 7,500-member Border Police, a branch of the Israel National Police, deals with problems relating to public security, terror, severe crime, rioting, guarding sensitive sites and securing rural areas, according to Israel’s Ministry of Public Security. In Mexico, a mix of agencies rely on the Army and Navy and the federal police to watch over its borders, Christopher Wilson of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars told us by phone. But, Wilson said, Mexico’s ports of entry are run by the country’s customs service with immigration-related security managed by its Instituto de Migracion. The military branches provide security at the ports as needed, Wilson said, and also are in charge of stopping and catching traffickers in drugs and people. Wilson said numerous countries similarly rely on military forces to pitch in near international borders in part because some border zones are isolated and other agencies don’t have the manpower. He offered as examples of strong military presences Guatemala and Brazil. Then again, Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University professor, told us by email, countries don’t deploy troops on borders unless they’re engaged in cross-border conflicts ""that necessitate emergency border management procedures. Weak states in sub-Saharan Africa have most recently fallen into this category,"" Burkhart said. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said by phone that Canada and Costa Rica, which has border guards but no regular military, are examples of the many countries that do not secure their respective borders with the military. Then again, many countries have border-area checkpoints run by officers with weapons, he said. Commenting on the sheriff’s mention of TV news reports, Janda said: ""Anything on the news is going to be violence, right? They’re not going to say nothing happened today on the border between Vietnam and Laos."" U.S. Homeland Security For our part, we checked on how the United States regulates border security, then peeked at how Canada does so. In both instances, the military has not been the primary agency handling border safety. By email, Wilson said civilian law enforcement agencies handle U.S. border security. Still, he said, ""we have securitized border management, rolling customs and immigration functions into agencies that have law enforcement and national security at the heart of their mission."" On its website, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it ""secures the nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade."" Homeland Security’s border security overview says U.S. Customs officials and a record 21,000-plus Border Patrol ""agents, agriculture specialists, Air and Marine agents, and officers guard America’s front lines. These men and women prevent terrorists and their weapons from entering the United States while continuing their mission of seizing contraband and apprehending criminals and others who illegally attempt to enter the United States."" Other Homeland Security agencies relevant to border security include the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), responsible for criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration and the Transportation Security Administration. So, the U.S. military doesn’t lead the charge on border security, which is in keeping with the Posse Comitatus Act, passed into law in 1878, which barred the Army from being employed to execute laws unless otherwise authorized by Congress or the Constitution. Still, Homeland Security has a military component: the United States Coast Guard is entrusted with defending the country’s maritime borders. And it’s not as if military forces don’t get called in. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service said in a February 2013 report, ""Although the military does not have primary responsibility to secure the borders, the Armed Forces generally provide support to law enforcement and immigration authorities along the southern border."" Since the 1980s, the report said, U.S. forces including the National Guard, as authorized by Congress, have conducted a wide variety of counterdrug support missions along the borders of the United States."" The Defense Department’s ""support role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts appears to have increased the department’s profile in border security,"" the report said. Also, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each authorized National Guard troops to help watch the border with Mexico, the report said. Canada We didn’t have to venture far to find another country that doesn’t police its borders with the military. Canada’s Border Services Agency says it ""ensures the security and prosperity of Canada by managing the access of people and goods to and from Canada."" Broadly, the agency says it’s ""responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security and public safety priorities."" We spotted no mention of Canada’s armed forces being involved in border security. They’re not, academic experts told us. Burkhart, who helps direct Boise State’s Canadian Studies program, said by email the Canada Border Services Agency handles such duties with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in concert with the U.S. Coast Guard under the joint law enforcement ""Shiprider"" maritime security program in the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. ""The Canadian Forces, the name for the Canadian military, does not participate in border enforcement,"" Burkhart said. Other nations To our inquiry about countries using the military to secure borders, Peter Andreas, a Brown University professor, singled out Germany as a country whose military doesn’t secure the border. ""Of course,"" Andreas said by email, ""all nations that have a military would use the military if there were a military attack from another country."" In the same vein, Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, called the sheriff’s claim ridiculous. ""Almost all advanced countries use law enforcement officials who are much like our own Border Patrol and Coast Guard,"" Alden emailed. By email, Denmark-based author Frank Jacobs advised that most European Union countries don't use the military to secure their borders. He said the Schengen Area describes the EU states and even a few non-EU nations where business people and tourists can freely circulate without being subjected to border checks. Anyone crossing into the United Kingdom faces border checks, he said, though those are handled by Her Majesty's Border Force, which is not a military force, but an agency of the Home Office (Ministry of the Interior). He said that travelers returning to the Schengen Area have to pass through the French douane, but that is not a military unit, instead a part of the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service. Janda followed up by email, calling the sheriff’s statement ""demonstrably false. Most countries in the world use national law enforcement to police their borders just like we do."" He added: ""The only countries that rely on their military to police/defend their borders are nations facing severe instability involving lawlessness and/or refugees in neighboring countries and/or open warfare."" Our ruling Painter said the U.S. stands alone in the world in not using the military to secure ""our border."" We didn’t have to go far to prove Painter wrong. Canada is one of many countries that rely on federal patrols, not the military, to handle border oversight, just as the United States does. The sheriff might’ve seen some border-guarder troops in war-torn lands in TV news reports, but that’s not factual basis for this claim. Pants on Fire!

"['New Hampshire', 'Energy', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have more energy resources than Russia and Saudi Arabia
","Former Texas governor Rick Perry was talking energy in Deerfield when he decided to put the country’s resources in perspective.   ""The entirety of North America -- Canada, the United States and Mexico -- there's more known reserves in those three countries than in Russia and Saudi Arabia,"" Perry said at  the 9 Lions Tavern on May 7.   While energy production in the United States has certainly boomed in recent years, Perry’s statement seemed surprisingly broad. Could three North American countries really outrank oil-rich Russia and Saudi Arabia?   We decided to check it out.   Thankfully, there’s a U.S. government agency that keeps track of just this kind of data. It’s the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Department of Energy that collects statistics and does analysis on all topics related to energy.   Going through the site’s tables, though, would seem to suggest that Perry is off track. Using its 2014 data set for crude oil proved reserves, Canada, the United States and Mexico had a combined total of 219.8 billion barrels.   A hefty amount, no question.   But Russia and Saudi Arabia have a combined crude oil proved reserves of 348.4 billion barrels. The vast majority of that -- 268.4 billion barrels -- is held by the Saudis. (There are questions about the reliability of the Saudi-reported numbers, but let’s put those aside for now.)   That certainly doesn’t seem to support Perry’s contention. So we checked with his staff. They also sent along data from the Energy Information Administration, but not just crude oil reserves. Their numbers included coal and natural gas totals.   Those 2014 numbers show North America has proven reserves of 422.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Russia and Saudi Arabia have combined reserves of 1,986.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with 1,688 trillion of that coming from Russia.   Once again, the energy giants to the east win out.   As for coal, North America looks to be the clear leader. While only data from 2011 is available, Canada, the United States and Mexico have 267,411 million recoverable short tons of coal in reserve. Of that, 258,619 tons are in the United States. Russia and Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, have 173,074 million short tons of coal, all located in Russia.   While Perry’s staff added the numbers from the various energy sources together to emphasize the former governor’s point, that’s misleading.   The problem, put simply, is that each source of energy has a different kind of measurement. Barrels of oil, cubic feet of natural gas and short tons of coal are not directly equivalent.   As the EIA explains, one short ton of coal (or 2,000 pounds) produces 19,210,000 British thermal units (a basic heat measurement). One thousand cubic feet of natural gas produce 1,025,000 Btu. And a single barrel of oil produces 5,892,000 Btu.   There is a way to measure all of the resources together, though. It’s called BOE, or barrels of oil equivalent. The Congressional Research Service uses a simple multiplier to equate natural gas and coal to petroleum.   Using these figures, including proven oil and natural gas reserves and recoverable coal reserves, North America has roughly 1,217 billion BOE. Russia and Saudi Arabia have about 1,296 billion BOE.   But energy is a tricky subject. Proven reserves aren’t the same as estimated or potential reserves. Extraction methods can improve, adding resources thought off-limits to the overall supply. Energy efficiency measures and the types of coal or petroleum used can introduce even more variables. Much remains to be learned.   As Ryan Carlyle, a subsea hydraulics engineer, wrote on Quora in 2013: ""Corporate reserve estimates are too low by an unknown amount, and national reserve estimates are too high by an unknown amount. And no one knows how much oil is still undiscovered.""   While the United States has a lot of recoverable coal reserves, there are questions as to whether it will ever be mined. New environmental regulations, legal action and overall costs make it more challenging for energy companies to use the fuel.   That being said, Perry has been outspoken in his criticism of President Obama’s energy policy, including coal regulations, so a Perry administration could see a change in course.   Our ruling
  Perry said ""The entirety of North America -- Canada, the United States and Mexico -- there's more known reserves in those three countries than in Russia and Saudi Arabia."" There is some basic truth to Perry’s statement. North America does have a large supply of petroleum, natural gas and coal. But combining the three fuel sources together is like comparing fossil fuel-based apples and oranges.   Just comparing straight numbers, Perry was right about coal, but wrong on natural gas and crude oil.   We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/05/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-us-canada-and-mexico-have-more-ene/
"['Climate Change', 'Weather', 'Texas', 'Don Zimmerman']","
Don Zimmerman says every child learns the sun warms the Earth; carbon dioxide does not
","In April 2015, Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist, briefed the Austin City Council on the consequences of climate change on Texas. Scientists generally agree that industrial and auto emissions from the burning of fossil fuels contribute to global warming. But Don Zimmerman, the council member representing District 6, was dismissive of Hayhoe’s presentation, saying there’s ""no way to have definitive science on something so nebulous and so foolish as climate change."" ""You don't have to be as smart as a fifth-grader to know what causes the climate is the sun,"" Zimmerman said. ""The sun.  I have people tell me, ‘carbon dioxide warms the Earth.’  No, it doesn't.  The sun warms the Earth.""   We remember graphic textbooks – carbon paper inside! – and goggles in fifth grade. But we were not quite advanced enough at the age of 10 for climate science; that didn’t roll around till high school astronomy. We remember learning in that class that the sun is the chief source of energy in our solar system, but we also remember studying how greenhouse gases – like carbon dioxide – helped trap warmth from the sun. (We recall a textbook diagram showing rays from the sun smacking off the surface of the Earth before reflecting back into the atmosphere; aptly named greenhouse gases prevented all the heat from escaping.)    SOURCE: Website, ""Climate Change,"" Department of Ecology, University of Washington (accessed May 12, 2015)   So, did we remember our science correctly? Or, put another way, was Zimmerman correct that ""what causes the climate is the sun"" and that the ""sun warms the Earth,"" or was he just blowing hot air?   We asked Zimmerman to elaborate on his statement. ""It’s common sense,"" he told us, ""that the source of energy that drives everything is the sun.""   By email, a Texas A&M University professor who doubles as the climatologist for the state of Texas, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us that, indeed, save negligible amounts of heat generated within the Earth, ""the sun is the source of the energy that drives the climate system.""   Score one for Zimmerman!   But, Nielsen-Gammon went on, everything from volcanic eruptions to carbon dioxide can also affect Earth’s climate. ""If carbon dioxide concentrations increase, for example, the sun drives the Earth to a higher temperature because the solar energy that the Earth absorbs cannot escape to space as efficiently,"" he said.   Score one against Zimmerman!   Climatologist Steven Quiring, Nielsen-Gammon’s Texas A&M colleague, had a similar take: ""The sun is important. It is the primary source of energy for the climate system.""   ""However, the Earth's atmosphere is also very important,"" Quring said by email.   For example, Quiring suggested, compare the temperature of the moon and the Earth. Both are about the same distance from the sun, but the moon has an average surface temperature of about 23 degrees Fahrenheit and the Earth has an average surface temperature of about 61 Fahrenheit. His point: If the sun were the only thing that mattered, both would have a similar average surface temperature.   So why the large difference? ""It turns out that having an atmosphere is very important,"" Quiring said. ""In particular, the Earth's atmosphere contains a number of greenhouse gases that are very effective at absorbing energy (at certain wavelengths) and re-radiating it back to the Earth's surface.   ""If Mr. Zimmerman thinks that having an atmosphere does not matter, perhaps he should try to live on the moon for a while.""   In Texas, by the way, it’s not until Grade 8 that public school students are expected to ""identify the role of natural events in altering Earth systems,"" according to state curriculum guidelines published by the Texas Education Agency, which state: ""Students learn how interactions in solar, weather, and ocean systems create changes in weather patterns and climate.""   And it’s only toward the end of high school that students are meant to learn the ""interacting components of Earth's system change by both natural and human-influenced processes.""   ""Some human-influenced processes such as pollution and non-sustainable use of Earth's natural resources may damage Earth's system,"" the guidelines say. ""Examples include climate change, soil erosion, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. The time scale of these changes and their impact on human society must be understood to make wise decisions concerning the use of the land, water, air, and natural resources. Proper stewardship of Earth will prevent unnecessary degradation and destruction of Earth's subsystems and diminish detrimental impacts to individuals and society.""   We bounced all this off Zimmerman, who stood by his solar statement.   Our ruling   Zimmerman said that as every child learns, the sun warms the Earth—and, he said, carbon dioxide does not.   We remember: The sun warms the Earth. But Zimmerman’s bigger point--discounting the role of carbon dioxide in climate change--disregards international scientific consensus.   We rate this claim Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Children', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal knows his numbers on child deaths
","Editor's note: This fact-check was updated after it first published to included corrected information from the state on one child death. A year ago this month, hearts across Atlanta collectively sank. Dominating the news last June 18 were reports that a 22-month-old Cobb County boy had been left in the back seat of his family’s locked SUV and had been found unresponsive nearly eight hours later. His dad, Justin Ross Harris, would tell family he thought he had dropped off young Ross at daycare before parking the SUV and going into work for the day. Police would later say the dad’s account didn’t add up. Harris, who has denied any wrongdoing, is awaiting trial on several charges, including malice murder. His boy is now part of the statistics that state officials used Wednesday in their ongoing campaign to raise public awareness of the potential dangers of leaving a child alone in a car, especially in the hot Georgia summer. ""Since 2010, eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke,"" Gov. Nathan Deal said at a press conference outside the state Capitol. The governor, first lady Sandra Deal and a contingent of state leaders gathered to promote a new public service video that encourages parents and caregivers to ""look again"" before they leave their vehicle to make sure they are not leaving a child behind. PolitiFact Georgia decided to look deeper into the stats Deal cited on child deaths caused by heatstroke. But first a little background. Annually, since the death of 2-year-old Jasmine Green in 2011, state officials have used the kickoff of summer to launch a public campaign to remind the public of the dangers of leaving a child in a hot, closed vehicle. Jasmine was found dead in a day care center van that had returned from a field trip to a Chuck E. Cheese in Jonesboro. Authorities said she had apparently fallen asleep between the seats of the van, and staff didn’t notice she was missing from the center for more than two hours. The state agency that oversees child care centers received 17 reports in fiscal 2013, 18 reports in fiscal 2014 and four reports in fiscal 2015 of children being left in vehicles by child care providers. ""We receive calls about incidents where children are left in vehicles from a few minutes to several hours, and we investigate each incident,"" Amy M. Jacobs, the commissioner of Bright from the Start: Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL), said Wednesday. ""While, thankfully, we have not seen any heatstroke-related deaths in child care centers since 2011, these dangerous close calls are completely unacceptable,"" she said. So what about those stats? We contacted DECAL, which provided us information on the eight Georgia deaths. In addition to the deaths of Ross and Jasmine, they include: *a 2-year-old Clarkston girl who was apparently trapped inside her mother’s car for more than an hour in 2014; * a 5-month-old girl was left in the family car outside a Kennesaw day school for five hours in 2011; * a 3-year-old Warner Robins boy left in a car outside a family day care for an hour in 2011; * a 3-year-old Canton girl left outside a church in 2010 for an unknown amount of time in the family minivan; *a 6-year-old girl from Evans who gained access to the family car in her garage for an undetermined amount of time in 2010. *an 18-month-old Monroe County boy was left in 2010 in the family van at an elementary school for seven or eight hours. Nationally, 639 children -- or an average of 37 per year -- died from heatstroke after being left in a vehicle between 1998 and 2014, according to data compiled by Jan Null with the Department of Meteorology & Climate Science at San Jose University. In that same time period, Georgia had 22 deaths, Florida 68, Alabama 14 and South Carolina 9. Our ruling Gov. Nathan Deal held a press conference Wednesday to raise public awareness of the potential dangers of leaving a child alone in a car. He and other state officials have been doing similar events since 2012, following the tragic death of a 2-year-old girl. The governor cited statistics showing that since 2010, eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke. The death count is accurate and makes the case that without vigilance on the part of parents and caregivers, there’s the potential for tragedy.

"['Labor', 'Wisconsin', 'Protect American Jobs']","
Group claims repeal of prevailing wage would open an 'illegal worker loophole'
","The state’s prevailing wage law, in place for 84 years, sets a minimum wage for construction workers involved with publicly funded projects. Critics say the law artificially inflates wages and raises the cost of projects, meaning taxpayers pay more. Supporters say the law ensures quality work and fair pay for workers. The Assembly Labor Committee voted 5-4 on May 27, 2015  to advance a measure that would repeal the law. Through a spokeswoman, Gov. Scott Walker said he would sign a bill repealing or amending the law. But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos says he has no plans to schedule a vote. Meanwhile, a group calling itself Protect American jobs has launched a television ad that warns of unintended consequences if the prevailing wage law is changed. ""Wisconsin worksites could soon be taken over with illegal workers,"" the announcer intones. ""Politicians in Madison are about to weaken the law to make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs."" The ad goes on to urges viewers to contact Walker and tell him ""no to the illegal worker loophole in the state budget."" Wait. Illegal workers? Before the ad started running, no one was talking about that issue. Would the prevailing wage measure ""make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers""? Illegal workers Let’s start with the most basic problem: The ad says the measure is in the state budget. But the move to repeal prevailing wage has been introduced as a separate piece of legislation, not as part of the 2015-’17 spending plan. On the substance of the claim, we tried to reach the group, but did not get a response, so we turned to the ad itself and the group’s website. In the ad, a caption on the screen cites ""ABC/ACG policy letter: 3/13/2013"" during one mention of illegal workers. That appears to be a letter urging immigration law reform that was sent to members of Congress by a group that called itself a ""broad base of contractors"" that employ ""thousands in all facets of construction."" The letter says that ""any future immigration law must include a new market driven program to provide a legal path for foreign workers to enter the United States when the economy needs them, with fewer entering when the U.S. economy contracts."" OK, but that refers to legal immigration. And the letter came years before this prevailing wage measure was introduced. The Protect American Jobs web site goes further, suggesting the ""real motivation"" for the prevailing wage repeal can be found in a different letter from an executive with the Associated Building Contractors, a non-union group. That letter cited the need to ""make it easier for people to move to the United States from other countries and work in the construction industry."" Again, that refers to legal immigration. The group also refers to an  April 2015 paper by University of Utah economist Peter Philips -- written at the request of the Wisconsin Contractors Coalition -- that notes the end of prevailing wage laws would lead to lower pay and less apprentice training. The paper goes on to say that other states where such laws have been repealed have seen a call for guest workers, because when wages fell contractors had trouble attracting workers. But a guest worker program does not amount to illegal workers. By its very definition, guest workers are in the United States legally. What’s more, the television ad doesn’t say there could be such problems down the road. It says the proposed bill, as written, contains an ""illegal worker loophole."" For that, we turned to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which issued a May 26, 2015 memo that said flatly the proposed bill doesn’t address immigration. The council assists members of both parties with the drafting of legislation. ""While the bill removes the requirement for employers to maintain certain records concerning wages paid to workers on a project of public works, that requirement relates only to enforcement of the prevailing wage law by the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT),"" the memo reads. ""The repeal of that record -keeping requirement does not affect enforcement of federal immigration laws by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security."" Our rating A television ad from a group against repeal of the state’s prevailing wage law says such a measure would ""make it easier for state contractors to hire illegal workers for Wisconsin construction jobs."" This ""illegal worker loophole,"" it says, is in the state budget. But the bill doesn’t have any direct impact on immigration laws and the group’s own references to potential problems -- down the road -- describe workers who would be here legally, not illegally. It also fails on the basic claim of the stand-alone measure being in the state budget. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/05/protect-american-jobs/group-claims-repeal-prevailing-wage-would-open-ill/

Jeb Bush says Estonians can file their taxes in five minutes. Really?
","One of the more unusual claims to come up at the recent economic summit in Orlando was this one from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: ""You can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes."" Now, we knew that 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis supposedly read books on Swedish land use planning for fun, but does Bush really spend his time studying up on tax administration policies in Estonia, a Baltic nation with roughly 1.3 million people? More importantly -- five minutes? Really? With tax compliance in the United States estimated to cost upwards of $107 billion in 2005, we knew we had to take a closer look. We started by asking aides to Bush -- who is preparing to officially announce his candidacy on June 15 -- for supporting evidence. They sent us links to two articles. In 2012, the website Business Insider called Estonia’s tax system ""scarily efficient,"" noting that ""the process takes an average of five minutes."" The following year, The Economist agreed, reporting that ""filing an annual tax return online, as 95% of Estonians do, takes about five minutes."" We decided to go a step further and check with actual Estonians. So we contacted four journalists in Estonia who have not only written about economic policy but have filed taxes there themselves. Here’s the kicker: It turns out Bush was over-estimating how long the Estonian system takes. • ""Yes, it is possible to file a tax return in Estonia online in five minutes. And probably even in three to four minutes,"" said Tarmo Vahter, deputy editor of the weekly newspaper Eesti Ekspress. • ""If you have only one, or maybe two or three, income sources, like a salary from your main job … five minutes may be even too long,"" said Argo Ideon, the political and business editor at the daily newspaper Postimees AS. ""I have probably used just two minutes several times."" • ""It took me no more than five minutes,"" said Sirje Rank, the foreign editor at the business newspaper Äripäev. ""Just push the send button. Done."" • ""Of course, it depends on the person and on the variety of incomes and the complications, but in general, the tax form may be filled even in one minute,"" said Kaja Koovit, the head of the business desk at the daily newspaper Eesti Päevaleht. ""I can confirm it based on my own experiences."" Okay, okay, so it’s an awesome system. But what makes it so good? It’s because Estonian taxpayers are presented with a tax form that is pre-filled with their data. All they have to do is add in any additional factors, make sure it’s correct, and press ""send."" ""We have a simple tax system, a very high level of accessibility to the Internet, easy and secure electronic authentication, highly developed information-technology programs and certain tax laws that help us to gather the data from third parties in order to use it for pre-filling tax returns,"" said Mailis Peek da Costa Figueira of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board, Estonia’s equivalent of the IRS. Those third parties that submit financial information electronically to the tax and customs board include employers, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations, said Hannes Udde, another specialist with the board. ""Forty percent of taxpayers submitted their return with one click, and it took less than one minute,"" Udde said. If there is additional data required, such as income from abroad, self-employment income or property sales, ""it may take more than five minutes, but it is still very easy and convenient,"" Udde said. Once the taxpayer verifies and submits the data, the tax agency double-checks the declared information. If no problems come up, refunds are typically issued within five days. If a possible error emerges, the agency emails the taxpayer for additional information to reconcile the situation, Udde said. Sounds wonderful -- maybe it’s something the United States could benefit from? Well, as it turns out, President Barack Obama proposed something much like this during his 2008 campaign. Obama said he would direct the IRS to ""give taxpayers the option of a pre-filled tax form to verify, sign and return to the IRS or online. This will eliminate the need for Americans to hire expensive tax preparers and to gather information that the federal government already has on file."" But a funny thing happened on the way to enactment: Crickets. PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken. Why? According to the Sunlight Foundation, ""companies that prepare taxes are throwing millions at Congress to oppose making tax filing easier."" The foundation writes that the companies ""warn that IRS-prepared returns will cost millions to develop and will result in more filing errors and missed refunds for taxpayers. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform … calls the system ‘a money-grab by the government’ and points out the conflict of interest that arises from a tax collector like the IRS preparing taxpayers' returns."" If you win the presidency, Gov. Bush, you’ll get your chance to make it happen. Our ruling Bush said ""you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes."" If anything, Estonian tax filers tell us, it takes even less than that. We rate Bush’s claim True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-estonians-can-file-their-taxes-five-/

Lindsey Graham: Freedom Act means less privacy for phone records
","Soon, the government will no longer be able to accumulate Americans’ phone records in bulk. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says this doesn’t settle any concerns over privacy. On June 2, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which altered parts of the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law passed soon after 9/11. The most significant aspect of the Freedom Act is that it effectively ends the National Security Agency’s bulk phone records collection program, made public by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013. Graham, also a presidential candidate, was not present for the final vote on the bill. But in a CNN interview he gave from Manchester, N.H. he said he opposes the Freedom Act and would have preferred to keep the Patriot Act as is. ""The (metadata) provisions I don't like at all,"" Graham said of the Freedom Act in a June 2 interview with Jake Tapper. ""Basically, you've undercut privacy now. All of the records will be in the hands of the phone company with hundreds of people available to look at the records versus 20 or 30 people in the government. So I think the (metadata) program has been undermined in terms of the (USA) Freedom Act, and quite frankly, we've told the enemy so much about it, I'm not sure it works anymore."" We took a look into Graham’s claim that because of the Freedom Act, hundreds of phone company employees will now have access to the phone records, as opposed to just a couple dozen government employees currently. But here’s the rub: The phone companies have always held this data, and the new law doesn’t change that. As it always was Prior to the Freedom Act, major cell phone providers like Verizon, AT&T and Sprint would steadily hand over all of their phone records to the NSA, which maintains a massive database. The records include information like the location of a call, phone numbers involved and the length of the call, but not the content or audio. Intelligence workers can then run a phone number with terrorist ties through the database to find out who they called and when. Even without the content, phone records metadata can reveal significant information about a person. Government officials have said there are tight restrictions on who can access the database, with Justice Department oversight. Officially, only 22 NSA analysts are allowed to approve a database query, and only 33 can actually access the database. This is the ""20 or 30 people in the government"" Graham references. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology privacy advocacy group, told us that some people dispute these figures, but they are the best figures we have.) The Freedom Act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies. If the government wants to look at a suspected terrorist’s call data, they must get a court warrant first. So in six months, when agencies have implemented the new law, will hundreds of phone companies employees have access to this data who didn’t before? Well, no. The Freedom Act doesn’t change much for phone companies in terms of how they maintain their records, so there is no reason to believe the law would dramatically increase the number of employees with access to the data. ""Cellular service providers have always had access to cellular metadata,"" said Stephen Wicker, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University. ""The expiration of various provisions of the Patriot Act has simply eliminated the authority under which the government requested the data from the service providers."" Phone companies hold onto these records, in some cases for several years, for business purposes. Per FCC regulations, phone service companies can only access these records with the customer’s permission or if required by law, such as providing information to aid a criminal investigation. We weren’t able to pin down the number of employees who can lawfully access the records. We reached out to Verizon, AT&T and Sprint, and none were able to give us a head count. But with about 175,000 employees at Verizon alone, it very well might be in the hundreds. Phone companies have customer service operators who can access an individual record to provide clients information about their account, and they have teams of lawyers who handle records requests for law enforcement. And an engineer might access the anonymous metadata for planning cell tower placement and optimizing coverage. A spokesman for Verizon, the largest wireless communications service provider, said the company will not increase the number of employees with access to the records. ""Verizon takes seriously its commitment to protecting its customers’ privacy, and we have strict protocols that limit access to customer data unless there is a specific business purpose to do so,"" said Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden. ""No additional Verizon employees will need access to those records as a result of the change in law."" Graham’s office told us that while phone companies will have the same access to all the data now as they did before, there are other privacy concerns, such as the fact that phone companies will now know things like which phone numbers the NSA is interested in. The Freedom Act does not create any new database for phone companies or require them to keep any information they don’t already keep, though it does require the companies to standardize their records for ease of cross-referencing between carriers, said Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, who called Graham’s claim ""bizarre.""   One might find cause for concern in the possibility that the new system would allow phone company employees to access other companies’ metadata, said Timothy Edgar, a fellow at Brown University’s Watson Institute and a former director of privacy and civil liberties at the White House under President Barack Obama. If the NSA wants to see all the calls connected to a phone number associated with terrorism, that might include calls to numbers belonging to other service providers. But the ideal system would have security measures that would ensure that employees wouldn’t be able to access other companies’ information while still providing the NSA with a full picture, he added. ""I see very little prospect that the NSA queries of phone records held under the USA Freedom Act would result in more people having access to phone records than under the NSA bulk collection program,"" Edgar said. Our ruling Graham said that because of the USA Freedom Act, ""the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records, versus 20 or 30 people in the government."" The premise of Graham’s statement is incorrect. Many phone service company employees already have access to their company’s phone records, and the law doesn’t increase that number. Currently, the phone companies keep their own records, and the NSA collects these records in bulk. The new law eliminates the NSA bulk collection program, but it does not affect how the companies themselves maintain their records, other than some standardization measures. The law does not cause the phone records to change hands, nor does it create new databases or record-keeping systems.

A Facebook meme, meanwhile, said the runnerup was an Iraq war veteran who lost his arm and leg defending the United States. When last we looked, it had been shared more than 100,000 times. Here it is:  ""Caitlyn Jenner won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award,"" it reads.

Mike Huckabee says one-third of seniors depend on Social Security for 90% of income
","At a Disney World powwow of GOP stars, Mike Huckabee took a jab at Jeb Bush, in Bush’s own state of Florida and on a particularly Floridian issue: Social Security. Speaking at the Florida Economic Growth Summit on June 2, 2015, the former governor of Arkansas and current presidential candidate alluded to Bush’s comments on reducing benefits and raising the retirement age. Huckabee called the idea political and economic suicide. ""Sixty million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income"" he said. ""The government took that money from you involuntarily when you started working – with the promise that you’d get that money back when you retire. For the government to even think about breaking that promise is absolutely ridiculous."" Huckabee’s numbers intrigued us. We reached out to his campaign but did not hear back, so we delved into the statistics. The actual number of people who receive benefits is slightly higher than what Huckabee said at 64 million. The majority of recipients, about 43 million, are over age 65—we’ll get to this group later. Of the remaining beneficiaries, in 2013, Social Security constituted at least half of the income for 61 percent of disabled recipients and for 44 percent of non-disabled beneficiaries (survivors of deceased workers and early retirees), according to a Social Security Administration spokeswoman. The latest data from the Social Security Administration show that Huckabee got the second number right, if we assume by ""seniors"" he meant those over age 65. In 2012, Social Security constituted 90 percent or more of income for 36 percent of that age group.  Huckabee’s source, however, may be flawed. Some experts say the Social Security Administration’s definition of income—which only includes recurring flows like monthly benefits -- doesn’t take into account sporadic sources like money siphoned out of an IRA or 401k, typically on an as-needed basis. Leaving these out could mean discrepancies as wide as $18 billion versus $220 billion, according to a study at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. Just how many people have these plans and how much cash is in them? The U.S. Government Accountability Office broke it down by income quintiles for retirees age 65 to 74: Bottom Second Third Fourth Top Percent with savings (401k/IRA) 9% 33% 48% 65% 84% Median savings amount (no reliable estimate) (no reliable estimate) $104,000 $144,000 $468,000 Without factoring in the savings plans, the SSA probably overstated Social Security’s share of retirement income, especially for wealthier retirees, experts say. In 2008, the estimate for Social Security’s slice of the total income pie was 20 percentage points more than what tax filings showed, according to a study in the Journal of Retirement. ""Huckabee is probably technically not correct since the numbers he relies on are flawed, though he’d have no real reason to know this, "" said Andrew Biggs, who used to run the SSA’s policy office during the George W. Bush administration and now researches Social Security reform at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Biggs has written extensively on this topic. Here’s the catch to the catch: Half of Americans don’t have retirement savings at all, according to the GAO. This means that estimates for the people who rely the most on Social Security (low- and middle-income households) may only be marginally off. So Huckabee is correct, experts agree, in his point that many Americans rely heavily on Social Security (too heavily, to the point that middle- and upper-income families are not saving enough on their own, said Biggs). Most people who receive Social Security need the safety net, said Melissa Favreault, an expert on retirement and social programs at The Urban Institute, a public policy think tank. For many recipients, it’s ""absolutely vital income,"" she said. AARP spokesperson David Bruns told us the same thing. ""There are very substantial number of people who are disproportionatelyfemale, disproportionatelyminority, disproportionatelyblue collar, for whom Social Security is critical,"" he said. ""I’ve run the math for myself: 40 percent of our retirement income will come from Social Security and I have a government pension. My wife and I have saved as hard as we can for all of our lives. We are not the only ones."" Our ruling Huckabee said, ""60 million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income."" Huckabee’s numbers reflect official statistics, though slightly lowballed: About 64 million Americans receive Social Security benefits and about 36 percent of seniors depend on it for 90 percent of their income, according to the Social Security Administration.  Some take issue with those statistics, saying they understate the importance of irregular sources of income and therefore may overstate the importance of Social Security. However, experts agree with the gist of Huckabee’s idea: Broadly speaking, Social Security beneficiaries need the cash to make ends meet.

Gretchen Carlson: Most polls show world has 'lower regard' for U.S. now under Obama than under Bush
","Fox News host Gretchen Carlson called out President Barack Obama for trying to spin the accomplishments of his presidency in a recent White House speech. Carlson claimed Obama is overstating the positive influence he’s had on world affairs. Here’s what Obama said: ""People don’t remember — when I came into office, the United States in world opinion ranked below China and just barely above Russia. And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth."" PolitiFact rated Obama’s claim Half True. Carlson, in her own on-air fact-check, sounded like she thought the rating should have been worse. ""The president said he believes he’s helped improve the United States’ standing in the world,"" she said on The Real Story on June 2, 2015. ""But right now it appears that statement isn't totally accurate since most polls show foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S. now than they did before Obama's time."" That’s a different claim than Obama’s. Obama said the United States is the most respected country, while Carlson said the nation’s standing has actually dropped since Obama took office. Is Carlson closer to the truth than Obama? Not really. While you wouldn’t say the United States is beloved everywhere on the world’s stage today, it generally is in a better position than when President George W. Bush left office. We’ll walk you through three different polls. Spokespersons for Fox News did not respond to requests for comment. BBC polling In April 2008, the BBC World Service/Globescan released its annual Country Ratings Poll asking respondents about various countries’ ""influence on the world."" Almost 25,000 people  rated 16 countries and the European Union on whether their world influence was ""mostly positive"" or ""mostly negative."" In 2008, an average of 35 percent of people said the United States’ world influence was ""mainly positive"" and 47 percent said it was ""mostly negative."" This was a slight improvement over previous years of serious souring on the United States. How have things changed since Obama’s tenure? The United States’ influence was seen more favorably in the early years of Obama’s presidency, coinciding with an improved national economy. But the U.S. reputation retracted in more recent years. The BBC attributes the backlash to U.S. government surveillance programs, particularly in Spain, Germany and Brazil. Still, in the most recent BBC survey, which covered December 2013 to April 2014, 42 percent of people said the United States’ influence was ""mostly positive"" — an improvement of seven points from 2008. And 39 percent said the U.S. influence was ""mostly negative"" — eight percentage points less than in 2008. Whatever you make of the recent dip, the BBC ratings are still better for the United States than they were in 2008. Pew Research Center Pew Research Center measures the favorability of the United States in its Global Attitudes Survey. A thousand respondents in each country are asked in face-to-face and phone interviews to say whether they have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of the United States. Richard Wike, Pew’s director of global attitudes research, emailed the following chart showing favorable ratings of 19 countries surveyed in 2008 and 2014. New findings from 2015 surveys will be released this summer.  In 13 of 19 countries, the view of the United States improved from 2008 to 2014. The improvement was biggest in France, Germany, Indonesia and Spain.   In four countries — Russia, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon — the United States’ favorable ratings fell. The largest drop was in Russia, a 23-point difference. In Poland and Pakistan, there was no significant change. So Pew also does not back up Carlson’s point. Gallup The most recent data we could find is from a periodic survey by Gallup about the five major world powers: the United States, Russia, China, Germany and the European Union. The headline does little to help Carlson’s claim: ""Russia Receives Lowest Approval in World; U.S. Highest."" The most recent poll, released April 21, 2015,  is based on face-to-face and phone interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, age 15 and older, in each of more than 130 countries. It shows the median approval rating of the United States is 45 percent, more than any other world power and greater than the 34 percent approval rating of the country’s leadership in 2008.  U.S. leadership approval peaked in 2009, Obama’s first year in office, at 49 percent. It dropped to 41 percent in 2012 but picked up the next year. ""America’s image began to rally in some nations and to soar by the end of the decade following the election of Barack Obama, at least in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America,"" Pew wrote in 2014. ""After slipping a bit again in the first years of this decade, brand U.S. has stabilized and even recovered in a few nations in 2014."" Our ruling Carlson said, ""Most polls show foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S. now than they did before Obama’s time."" We’re not sure how she got to most. The consensus among three polls shows the United States generally in higher regard today than Bush’s last year in office. The outliers would be the views of people in a few countries, including Russia, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. It’s misleading to say ""foreign nations have lower regard for the U.S."" and it’s inaccurate to say ""most polls"" show that. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2015/jun/04/gretchen-carlson/gretchen-carlson-most-polls-show-world-has-lower-r/

Marco Rubio claims no abuse of bulk metadata collection program
","After weeks of political hand-wringing, the Patriot Act is out and the USA Freedom Act is in. But despite substantial support from both parties, the sweeping national security reform is not without critics. Chief among them is Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who unsuccessfully lobbied to extend bulk metadata collection authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The metadata program, which allowed National Security Agency officials to collect phone data such as call length and the phone numbers involved, started in 2006 and was kept top-secret until Edward Snowden famously exposed it and other NSA information-gathering initiatives in 2013. The USA Freedom Act, meanwhile, forces the NSA to subpoena phone records from phone companies instead of collecting the data directly. Rubio argued to keep the metadata program as is in a USA Today op-ed May 10.  ""There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program,"" Rubio wrote. ""Internet search providers, Internet-based email accounts, credit card companies and membership discount cards used at the grocery store all collect far more personal information on Americans than the bulk metadata program."" The metadata program has not produced a single case of abuse? That’s a strong claim. Does it withstand scrutiny? Well, sort of. It depends on how you define ""abuse."" There are two factors at play here: the actions of the NSA officials enacting the program and the legality of the program itself. First, we’ll discuss those who oversaw the program. Did they ""abuse"" their power? There were certainly glitches in the program, at least. Declassified 2009 documents enumerate a list of what the NSA called ""non-compliance"" instances. In one case, 3,000 phone numbers were found to have been listed as approved under the ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" (RAS) standard without having gone through the proper regulatory channels. In another, phone numbers were automatically added to an alert list without meeting the standard. Although PolitiFact Florida was able to find dozens of such instances, none of the documented cases appeared to demonstrate willful negligence of regulations. Most were corrected almost immediately, and the vast majority involved mishandling technology. As the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) wrote in its 2014 appraisal of the metadata program: ""None of these compliance issues involved significant intentional misuse of the system. Nor has the Board seen any evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of any government officials or agents involved with the program."" ""This is one time in my life when I am going to agree with Marco Rubio,"" said Molly Bishop Shadel, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Center for National Security Law. ""You've noted compliance issues, but that's not the same thing as intentional abuse."" Stephen Vladeck, a professor of Law at American University, says he sees the non-compliance issues differently. ""If one defines ‘abuse’ to require intentional malfeasance, then it’s a lot harder to show that the phone records program was ever ‘abused,’ "" he said. ""But that’s certainly not how dictionaries define that term or how I have to imagine it’s commonly understood."" A quick look at Webster’s shows ""abuse"" to mean, ""A corrupt practice or custom; improper or excessive use or treatment.""   We found no evidence of corruption but did find evidence of improper treatment. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, noted that the secretive way the metadata collection program was set up could have allowed for some willful abuses to go unreported. Put simply, there could be some abuses we don't know about. The second question circles around the metadata program itself. Could the bulk metadata program be seen as one big ""abuse"" of Section 215 of the Patriot Act? Rubio’s writes in his op-ed that, ""Despite recent court rulings, this program has not been found unconstitutional, and the courts have not ordered a halt to the program. This program has been found legal and constitutional by at least 15 federal judges serving on the FISA Court on 35 occasions."" These claims are true, but don’t tell the entire story. According to the Second District U.S. Court of Appeals, the metadata program was not permitted under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The U.S. government tried to argue the program was permissible under the ""relevance"" standard of evidence collection because even seemingly immaterial phone data could have theoretically led to relevant information or become relevant in future investigations. ""We agree with appellants that such an expansive concept of ‘relevance’ is unprecedented and unwarranted,"" the court wrote. ""The statutes to which the government points have never been interpreted to authorize anything approaching the breadth of the sweeping surveillance at issue here."" The district court said it didn’t feel the need to rule on the constitutionality of the bulk metadata program because it ruled it was not legal according to the original legislation. The court allowed the program to continue only because of the future congressional debate that could ""profoundly alter the legal landscape."" Even the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board -- which found that the program was ""operated in good faith"" -- said there was no legal basis for the bulk collection of data. ""Because the program is not statutorily authorized, it must be ended,"" the board wrote. Our ruling Marco Rubio said, ""There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program."" Rubio’s office did not respond to a request for comment. There are plenty of documented cases of misuse of the metadata collection program. It just depends whether that misuse is what you or Rubio have in mind when you think of abuse. We found no example of intentional misuse of the program. At the least, Rubio should have been more clear in in his op-ed to help readers understand the complexities of the metadata collection program. Rubio’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/jun/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-claims-no-abuse-bulk-metadata-collecti/
