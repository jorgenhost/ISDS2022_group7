Grapefruit comes with some risks, but no evidence it’s fatal with antidepressants
","A Facebook post claims that eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice presents a known deadly risk for people taking antidepressants. ""Since grapefruit season is coming up soon, this is a friendly reminder that you CANNOT eat grapefruit if you're on antidepressants. It can cause a fatal overdose,"" the widely shared post states. The use of ""reminder"" indicates it’s been established that there is some occurrence of such fatalities. We found no evidence of that with antidepressants, though grapefruit can potentially cause a dangerous reaction if you’re taking certain medications.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""I am not aware of any evidence of fatality,"" said University of Nebraska Medical Center pharmacy professor Ally Dering-Anderson. ""That doesn’t mean that patients won’t be very uncomfortable, even hospitalized from very high levels of antidepressants. But I am not aware of any reports of death from grapefruit and antidepressants. There are reports of death with other drug classes."" The Food and Drug Administration said it ""has no data to support the claim that consuming a combination of grapefruit and antidepressant medication, when used as labeled and absent any other underlying medical issues, could be potentially fatal.""  Grapefruit juice blocks an enzyme in the body, making it easier for a medication taken orally to pass from your gut to your bloodstream, according to an article on Harvard Medical School’s website. Levels of medication in the blood will rise faster and higher than normal, and in some cases, the abnormally high levels can sometimes be dangerous. For example, interaction with  calcium channel blockers, which are not antidepressants, can lower your blood pressure or slow your heart rate excessively. The article says medications that are ""substantially boosted"" in this way by grapefruit juice include diazepam (brand name Valium), triazolam (Halcion) and midazolam (Versed), which are prescribed for anxiety or insomnia; and neurological and psychiatric medications such as buspirone (BuSpar), sertraline (Zoloft) and carbamazepine (Tegretol). Janice Hermann, a nutritional sciences professor at Oklahoma State University, said ""grapefruit does not interact with the whole class of antidepressants, it’s only specific ones such as buspirone."" Dering-Anderson also said some antidepressants ""are fine with grapefruit while others can get to dangerously high levels in the blood. The best way to know is to ask your pharmacist."" A Healthline article written by a Mayo Clinic doctor also stated that most antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs are safe to use with grapefruit. Several mood medications, including buspirone, diazepam and midazolam, do interact with grapefruit juice, the article says.  Eating grapefruit while taking the mood-related medications ""can result in heart rhythm changes, excessive sleepiness and other drug-specific effects,"" that article said. The Harvard and Healthline articles, as well as an FDA article, say nothing about any potential fatal risk of ingesting grapefruit while on any medications. The FDA told PolitiFact that grapefruit and grapefruit juice can   interfere with how well certain medicines work. As a result, the FDA has required that some prescription and over-the-counter drug labels include warnings against drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruit while taking the drug.""  Two other fact-checkers have identified flaws with the claim about grapefruit causing fatal overdoses from antidepressants. There are potential health risks, but there’s no evidence that they are fatal. We rate the claim False.","[('Facebook, post, Dec. 12, 2021', 'https://archive.md/RkZo2'), ('Email, Ally Dering-Anderson, clinical associate professor, University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Pharmacy, Dec. 17, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email, Food and Drug Administration press officer April Grant, Dec. 20, 2021', 'https://www.truthorfiction.com/grapefruit-antidepressants-overdose-warning/?fbclid=IwAR0VSZooO-4DdNE_msgOWnxJZvvEm6j2l_pLe2Aw0RfMJEJcFLwmZuuAmD4'), ('Truth Or Fiction, ""Grapefruit Antidepressants Overdose Warning,"" Dec. 13, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email, Janice Hermann, nutritional sciences professor at Oklahoma State University, Dec. 21, 2021', 'https://hoax-alert.leadstories.com/2021/12/fact-check-no-evidence-that-mixing-grapefruit-and-antidepressants-can-cause-fatal-overdose.html'), ('Lead Stories, ""Fact Check: NO Evidence That Mixing Grapefruit And Antidepressants Can Cause Fatal Overdose -- Combo MAY Cause Other Adverse Effects,"" Dec. 16, 2021', 'No link'), ('Healthline, ""Grapefruit Warning: It Can Interact with Common Medications,"" May 7, 2020', 'https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/grapefruit-and-medications?fbclid=IwAR04LdDBXX67pen3RQNmZSk-Ab41cVy3z8hRad8hR9Ic5O-omuLX1qNc7c0'), ('Food and Drug Administration, ""Grapefruit Juice and Some Drugs Don\'t Mix,"" July 1, 2021', 'No link'), ('Harvard Health Publishing, ""Grapefruit and medication: A cautionary note,"" March 30, 2021', 'https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/grapefruit-juice-and-some-drugs-dont-mix?fbclid=IwAR04LdDBXX67pen3RQNmZSk-Ab41cVy3z8hRad8hR9Ic5O-omuLX1qNc7c0')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/21/facebook-posts/grapefruit-comes-some-risks-no-evidence-its-fatal-/

No, 5G technology does not cause COVID-19 symptoms
","Since the beginning of the pandemic, various attempts to connect COVID-19 with 5G technology have circulated across social media. We've fact-checked several of these false claims. Another iteration of these problematic assertions resurfaced in the form of a paper published on Sept. 29, 2021, in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Research. ""Their analysis revealed a clear overlap between the effects of wireless communication technologies on the human body and the symptomatology of COVID-19 disease,"" a blog post on the paper said. ""In other words, the electromagnetic radiation from wireless technologies, including and especially 5G, can cause the same symptoms as COVID-19!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) 5G, or the fifth generation of cellular networks, refers to a new standard for the internet that promises higher internet connection speeds and quality. Concerns about 5G and wireless technologies stem from exposure to the radio frequencies that allow these technologies to work. The authors of the paper, however, cherry pick studies that support their claim, and acknowledge that their findings do not prove a link between 5G and COVID-19 symptoms. The paper also underwent a biased peer review process conducted by vocal anti-5G advocates. Longstanding fears about wireless technology and its potential health risks are difficult to quell, in part because research is still ongoing. The World Health Organization, which has been investigating the potential health impacts of radio frequency exposure since 1996, states that there is no proven causal link between adverse health effects and wireless technologies. ""It’s important for people to realize that the ultraviolet waves from the sun are many thousand times higher frequency than 5G,"" said Theodore Rappaport, a professor of electrical engineering and radiology at New York University, in an interview with USA Today. ""People should be more concerned about wearing sunscreen outside than using their 5G cell phones."" As for 5G's effect on COVID-19 infections, the World Health Organization and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, which evaluates the health risks of radiation exposure from devices like cell phones, both have issued statements dispelling this false link. The authors of the study are an adjunct professor in the mind-body medicine department at Saybrook University and a radiologist not currently affiliated with an academic institution. They proposed a hypothesis that exposure to ""wireless communications radiation,"" including 5G, may have increased the severity of COVID-19 infections. To prove their theory, the authors compared select studies on the biological effects of wireless communication radiation exposure with studies on COVID-19 disease progression. They claim that observed symptoms shared by the two conditions — such as blood clotting, inflammation and irregular heart rate — imply a potential link between them. However, the authors of the paper state outright that ""none of the observations discussed here prove this linkage."" They go on to say, ""Specifically, the evidence does not confirm causation. Clearly COVID-19 occurs in regions with little wireless communication. Furthermore, the relative morbidity caused by (wireless communications radiation) exposure in COVID-19 is unknown."" Even one of the papers they cited on COVID-19 and 5G said, ""The fact is that there is no link be­tween the COVID-19 virus and 5G cell phone technology or 5G base-station communication towers. These are to­tally different constructs; they are not even close."" The authors of the paper also acknowledge that they only selected sources that supported their theory, ignoring papers that showed negative results. ""We did not make an attempt to weigh the evidence,"" they wrote. Of the over 30,000 research reports on radiofrequency radiation exposure the authors note are available in the literature, they only cited 90. One of them is an anonymously published 2014 paper by one of the authors, which is not peer reviewed. Eight others are authored by the peer reviewers who evaluated their paper. Notably, of the 10 listed reviewers, two of whom requested anonymity, half are vocal public opponents of 5G. They include vaccine skeptic Ronald Kostoff; Martin Pall, whose own theory about a connection between 5G and COVID-19 was shared on social media by actor Woody Harrelson; and David O. Carpenter, whose efforts at circulating inaccurate data on the health risks of wireless technology stoked fears over 5G. Two other reviewers signed a 2017 petition urging the European Union to stop the rollout of 5G. We reached out to the editors of the journal but did not hear back before publication. There are other signs that the study wasn’t credible or rigorously reviewed, even though it was published in a journal that could be accessed through the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s research database. This paper was indexed in PubMed Central, an archive of open access papers from biomedical and life science journals managed by the NIH's National Library of Medicine. While distinct from PubMed, a search engine for the NLM's MEDLINE database of journals, articles from PubMed Central are also indexed in the search engine. The Journal of Clinical and Translational Research is currently indexed by PubMed Central, but not MEDLINE. While both PubMed Central and MEDLINE screen journals before they are indexed, the review standards for MEDLINE are considered to be far more rigorous. PubMed includes citations from around 30,000 journals; MEDLINE has around 5,200. Journals seek to get indexed in PubMed because it increases their credibility and exposure. Some of these journals, including predatory journals that publish low-quality articles and financially exploit scholars, use PubMed Central as a backdoor method of getting indexed. Other academic databases also face similar issues in screening for journals with flawed peer review processes. ""If a predatory journal is confined on its website, which is often of low-quality, the chance that patients or scholars will read and cite these articles is very low,"" said Andrea Manca, a professor of physiology at the University of Sassari in Italy, in an interview with The Scientist. ""The problem is that when they are displayed in the most popular biomedical database that we have, there are many (people) who think if a journal is on PubMed, then it is fine — which is not true, unfortunately."" Researchers have called for more stringent standards for journal acceptance in PubMed and PubMed Central. But until these standards are raised, both scholars and lay people will need to approach all papers with a critical eye. A blog post claims that a study found clear evidence that 5G technologies can cause COVID-19 symptoms. The authors of the paper, however, themselves acknowledge that they cherry-picked studies supporting their own theory and state that their findings do not prove any potential link between 5G and COVID-19. Though the paper was indexed in a reputable research database, this does not mean that the research is high quality or underwent an ethical and rigorous peer review process. Correlation does not equal causation — but even these correlations are suspect. We rate this claim False.","[('PolitiFact, Fact-checking a conspiracy theory about 5G and the coronavirus, Apr. 3, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/03/facebook-posts/fact-checking-conspiracy-theory-about-5g-and-coron/'), (""PolitiFact, No evidence that coronavirus was faked to cover up ‘5G Syndrome', Mar. 9, 2020"", 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, No, COVID-19 vaccines do not contain nanoparticles that will allow you to be tracked via 5G networks,\xa0 Mar. 12, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/09/facebook-posts/no-evidence-coronavirus-was-faked-cover-5g-syndrom/'), (""PolitiFact, Link between a COVID-19 variant and a firm that works in 5G?

Kellogg’s tweet about striking workers is fake
","Days before the striking Kellogg's workers in four states approved a new contract to end a weeks-long dispute, a fake tweet purportedly from the food manufacturing giant spread online.

Contorted claim of children killed by COVID-19 vaccines is Pants on Fire
","A man who promotes himself as an entrepreneur and technology expert claims that federal data led him to make this statement: ""They've now killed close to TWICE as many kids from the vaccine as have died from COVID."" The statement, the headline on a blog post, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ve rated a previous claim by the blog writer, Steve Kirsch — that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine ""kills more people than it saves"" — as Pants on Fire. His new statement falls into the same category. MIT Technology Review describes Kirsch as a tech millionaire who ""went from COVID trial funder to misinformation superspreader,""  as he boosted unproven COVID-19 drugs and campaigned against vaccines. Kirsch accurately cites federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on deaths involving COVID-19 among children (age 0 to 18).  The latest data, published Dec. 15, three days after Kirsch’s post, showed 771 deaths. Then Kirsch’s analysis goes off the rails. To calculate what he calls vaccine deaths, Kirsch says he uses data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an open system for accepting unverified reports about possible vaccine side effects. It is run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. But the actual VAERS database requires users to agree to a disclaimer that says in part that ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness."" What Kirsch cites is an alternative portal that does not require agreeing to the disclaimer. That portal is offered by the National Vaccine Information Center, an anti-vaccine advocacy group. Kirsch’s contortion alleges that based on a figure of ""excess"" children deaths, and his own claim that VAERS data is ""41 times underreported,"" there are 1,312 children deaths ""that are highly likely to be caused by the vaccine."" There is no confirmed evidence of a COVID-19 vaccine causing the death of even one child. More than 485 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Dec. 13, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 10,483 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. But reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. Anyone can submit a report of an adverse event but the reports themselves are not verified.  The CDC says a review of reports indicates a causal relationship between the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and TTS, a rare event that causes blood clots with low platelets, with a total of nine deaths of adults causally associated with that vaccine. The youngest was 28. ""Nationally comprehensive vaccine safety monitoring systems administered by both FDA and CDC have found no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination is causing or contributing to deaths in children,"" a CDC spokesperson told PolitiFact. ""Specifically, no deaths in children after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System where conclusive evidence demonstrated COVID-19 vaccination caused the patient’s death."" The CDC said it is reviewing the deaths of two girls within days of vaccination, both of whom had ""complicated medical conditions."" They are a 5-year-old whose underlying conditions included spastic cerebral palsy and seizure disorder; and a 6-year-old whose conditions included hypoxic encephalopathy and spastic cerebral palsy. In the wake of the news over the blood clots, the CDC on Dec. 16 recommended the Pfizer and Moderna shots over Johnson & Johnson’s, citing ""the latest evidence on vaccine effectiveness, vaccine safety and rare adverse events."" Kirsch claimed: ""They've now killed close to twice as many kids from the vaccine as have died from COVID."" Federal data show 771 deaths involving COVID-19 among children. Nine deaths have been associated with one of the COVID-19 vaccines, but none were children. The claim of nearly twice as many children being killed by COVID-19 vaccines — 1,312, when none have been confirmed —  is false and ridiculous.

No, public health officials aren’t passing off common cold as omicron variant
","In February 2020, as the earliest COVID-19 cases cropped up in the U.S., the late conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners there was no need to worry. ""The coronavirus is the common cold, folks,"" he said, pushing a false claim that would soon be repeated widely online. Nearly two years later, and after millions of people have died worldwide from the coronavirus and its variants, social media users are still taking up the refrain. ""People catch colds more often during the winter months,"" said one Dec. 20 Facebook post about the latest coronavirus variant of concern, omicron. ""Maybe they’re just calling the common cold or an RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) infection the omicron variant."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The omicron variant isn’t the same as the common cold, and public health officials aren’t ""just calling the common cold"" omicron to scare people, the CDC and five experts told PolitiFact.  ""Both RSV and the common cold are very different than the omicron variant of the SARS CoV-2 virus,"" said Cindy Prins, clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. ""The suggestion that public health officials are ‘just calling the common cold’ the omicron variant is totally off the mark,"" added Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, who said the coronavirus and its variants are ""genetically distinct"" from the flu and other viruses ""much like humans and cows are distinctly different."" The World Health Organization designated the omicron variant of the coronavirus as a variant of concern in late November. Officials were alarmed by the strain’s more than 50 mutations, and by preliminary evidence that showed some worrying trends, including high transmissibility. Four days later, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed suit. ""The omicron variant is not the common cold,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement to PolitiFact. Some early evidence out of South Africa provided hope that the omicron variant may cause a more mild disease than other strains, but many patients there were younger, making them less likely to develop severe illness to begin with. Scientists in London, meanwhile, said they’ve seen no evidence so far that the variant causes milder illness than the delta strain before it.  In the U.S., the CDC followed up with 43 people infected with the omicron variant, more than three-quarters of whom were fully vaccinated, and one-third of whom had also received a booster shot. The agency posted the results on Dec. 10.  Their survey found that only one person had been hospitalized, no one had died, and the most common symptoms were cough, fatigue, and congestion or runny nose. But the CDC report noted that most severe outcomes don’t usually show up right away, and that symptoms are expected to be tamer in people who got vaccinated or had prior infections.  CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Dec. 17 that the agency believes the omicron cases among the vaccinated and boosted ""are milder or asymptomatic because of vaccine protection.""  Overall, there is still much scientists are racing to determine about the variant and its ability to spread, evade existing immunity and trigger severe disease. But experts said that while more time is needed, it should not be taken lightly. ""The virus causing omicron is an offshoot of SARS-CoV-1, which has killed millions of people, so I would not compare it to the common cold,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The common cold is not a specific virus, but an infection that can be caused by several viruses, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and Security. Rhinoviruses are the most typical cause of the common cold, according to the CDC. A common cold can also develop from several other viruses, including the four less serious coronaviruses that circulate seasonally among humans, which are distinct from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and the other more dangerous strains, like SARS and MERS, Prins said. That’s one possible reason for the confusion online. But scientists can distinguish COVID-19 and its variants from other viruses, including the seasonal coronaviruses, through testing.  ""SARS-CoV-2 cases are only reported if there was a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case, not just reported symptoms, either through a PCR or rapid antigen test,"" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Another potential reason for confusion among social media users: a preliminary study from a Massachusetts firm said that the omicron variant may have picked up some of its genetic material from another virus that causes the common cold.  However, one of the study’s authors told Reuters that despite the firm’s findings, the claims that the omicron variant is really just the common cold are inaccurate. ""The identification of new variants of COVID are confirmed using genetic analysis, so there’s no way to confuse the new variant with anything else,"" Watanabe said. A Facebook post said, ""Maybe they’re just calling the common cold … the omicron variant."" Scientists are still studying the severity of the disease caused by the omicron variant of the coronavirus.  But the variant is not the same as the common cold, and public health officials are not trying to pass one off as the other, either.

Sen. Manchin wrong on income limits for child tax credit extension in Build Back Better
","Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., threw ice cold water on President Joe Biden’s hopes for passage of his signature Build Back Better Act when he told Fox News that he was a ""no"" vote on the current $1.75 trillion package.  The next day, Dec. 20, Manchin told West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval that he simply couldn’t live with the increased spending when the federal debt stands at $29 trillion. Biden says the plan would have no impact on deficits because higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy cover the cost, but there’s political debate on that point. Beyond the possible impacts on the national debt, Manchin said he also thought the bill failed to target aid to the poorest households. He gave the example of the child tax credit, a tax break for parents that would be expanded in the Biden-backed proposal. ""There’s no work requirement, no means testing,"" Manchin told Kercheval, referring to the rules for basing benefits on income. ""People making $200,000 and $400,000 would still get the child tax credit, the same as someone making $50, $60 or $70,000 that really needs it,"" he said. Manchin has talked before about making sure at least one parent is working before they can claim the child tax credit. But here, his focus is on means testing. The bill does not treat wealthy households the same as much poorer ones. People making as much as about  $400,000 can take advantage of the tax credit, but that’s under an older law, not the expansion offered in Build Back Better.  We raised that issue with Manchin’s press staff, and they said they had no comment. The child tax credit is a nearly 25-year-old tax break meant to help parents pay for raising kids. Before the pandemic, the credit was worth as much as $2,000 for any child under 17. In 2021, Democrats made the program more generous. For children up to age 5, the credit rose to $3,600. They also added more money and one year of eligibility for children over 5; for each child between 6 and 17, the amount went up to $3,000. The increases were turned into fully refundable tax credits, which meant that even people who didn’t make enough to use all of the tax credit would still get the full amount. These changes only lasted through 2021. The Build Back Better Act would extend those increases for an additional year, through 2022. But here’s the relevant part where Manchin’s claim is concerned: These benefits phase out with rising income. It’s a little complicated, but for the bump in payments to either $3,600 or $3,000 (depending on the child’s age), that portion would start coming down for single parents making over $112,500, and for couples making over $150,000. Those income levels are higher than for typical aid programs like temporary cash assistance and housing assistance, but they are still a form of means testing. Then there’s the $2,000, the amount of the credit before the pandemic. That would start coming down for single parents making $200,000 and for couples making $400,000. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, found that the hike delivered by the Build Back Better Act would be gone for a typical married couple by the time they made about $200,000. After that, they would be back where they were under the pre-pandemic rules. Source: Congressional Research Service Every analysis finds that the provisions in the Build Back Better Act would reduce child poverty. There are different opinions over how big a reduction would come, but the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that advocates for government aid to poor and working families, estimated that it would lift 4.1 million children out of poverty. Part of this stems from the bill’s aid to the very poorest households. By making the program fully refundable, it delivers the biggest increases to those who didn’t make enough to qualify for much if any benefits under the old rules. ""Anyone with yearly income under $2,500 used to get zero child tax credit,"" said Elaine Maag, principal research associate with the Urban Institute. The benefit rose slowly — 15 cents on the dollar — but even with that, Maag said families making less than $25,000 were unable to take full advantage of the program. If Manchin meant that people making as much as $400,000 could get some money from the program, he would have more of a point. But his comments apply to the program as it stood before the pandemic, not to the changes in the Build Back Better Act. Under the old rules, benefits for the original $2,000 begin to fall at $200,000 and $400,000 of income for single and married couples, respectively. By about the $440,000 mark, all benefits are gone. The value of the tax credit for those wealthier households is less than for people making $70,000, but they still get some money. Manchin said that the Build Back Better Act has no means testing for the expanded child tax credit. He said people making as much as $400,000 ""still get the child tax credit, the same as someone making ($50,000, $60,000) or $70,000 that really needs it."" The increases offered in the Build Back Better Act begin to fall starting with single parent families making over $112,500 and couples making over $150,000. By the time a household makes $200,000, those benefits have disappeared. Under the pre-pandemic rules, less generous benefits continue for married couples making as much as $440,000. But that exists totally apart from the Build Back Better Act. Under any reading of the concept of means testing, the Build Back Better Act uses that approach. A household making $70,000 would see higher benefits than a comparable household making over $200,000. We rate this claim Mostly False. ","[('Voice of West Virginia, Talkline interview with Sen.

No, Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine does not contain ‘wireless nanosensors’
","COVID-19 vaccines have different volumes. The first dose of the Moderna shot has 0.5 mL, while the booster has 0.25 mL. Other manufacturers make their mixtures in slightly different quantities. But the liquid always equals just a few drops of water. That would be hard to believe considering everything they are rumored to contain.  According to false online claims, COVID-19 vaccines come with graphene oxide, 5G nanoparticles, living organisms, ""transhumanism nanotechnology,"" aluminum, aborted fetal tissue, formaldehyde, bioluminescent markers, and parasites. PolitiFact has previously shown that the vaccines contain none of those things, but the list of invented ingredients just keeps on growing. The latest addition, which is as false as the others, is ""wireless nanosensors,"" which are also identified as ""biochips."" Stew Peters, a conservative radio personality who has spread conspiracy theories about COVID-19, claimed in a recent episode of his online show, published on Dec. 3, that a Spanish doctor had found those components in COVID-19 vaccines. He then claimed that show guest Ariyana Love, a naturopathic practitioner, found evidence in Moderna’s patents that confirmed the claim. ""They’re called biochips,"" Love said. ""They’re in the patents."" A video of the interview was posted on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The eight patents related to Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine published by the company do not mention ""wireless nanosensors"" or ""biochips,"" according to a word search carried out by PolitiFact, which included those specific terms and variations. Some patents mention ""lipid nanoparticles."" But those are small particles that carry and protect the active ingredient of the vaccine, as previously described by PolitiFact. They are not sensors or chips. One patent mentions ""micromixer chips."" But as the document explains, they are electronic devices, produced by companies like Harvard Apparatus and Dolomite Microfluidics, used to make a component of the vaccine. They are not ingredients themselves. ""These claims about wireless nanosensors are completely false,"" says Alison Hunt, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the vaccines in the U.S. The COVID-19 shots approved by the FDA, including Moderna’s, simply do not contain those components, according to the agency. A guide published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine contains three groups of ingredients: the messenger RNA molecule (mRNA) that causes the immune response that eventually protects the body against COVID-19; lipids that carry and shield the mRNA as it moves inside our body; and salts, acids, and sugars that preserve the mixture while the vaccine is being produced, frozen and stored. The CDC says that the vaccine does not contain manufactured products (like microelectronics), nanostructures (like carbon nanotubes or nanowire semiconductors), or metals (like iron, nickel, or cobalt). A video shared on Facebook claims that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine contains ""wireless nanosensors"" or ""biochips,"" and that evidence of their existence can be found in the patents of the vaccine. The eight patents published online by Moderna make no reference to those components. When they use the term ""nano,"" they are not referring to sensors. And when they mention ""chips,"" they are not naming an ingredient of the vaccine.

No, Barack Obama’s birth certificate isn’t a fake
","In the year 2021, more than four years since former President Barack Obama left office — more than 13 since he was first elected president — we are still encountering claims questioning his U.S. citizenship and his birth certificate.  Over more than a decade, PolitiFact has fact-checked 30-some statements about Obama’s birthplace. Here’s one more. A Dec. 14 blog post that’s spreading widely on social media retreads familiar territory.  ""Probe,"" the title says. ""Obama certificate a fake."" It goes on to claim that ""an exhaustive forensic investigation into President Obama’s birth certificate has concluded that it is a fraudulently created document, which was represented as an official copy."" The probe, according to the post, was led by Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., ""chief investigator Mike Zullo and two forensic experts.""  Arpaio did gather reporters with Zullo, a member of the sheriff’s Cold Case Posse, to announce that after investigating Obama’s birth certificate, they concluded that the document was forged.  But that was in December 2016. This is not new, and it’s been thoroughly debunked.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Back in 2016 Arpaio, then still sheriff, summoned journalists to a press conference to talk about Obama’s ""fake, fake birth certificate.""   The Arizona Republic reported on the hour-long event, writing that ""in exacting detail, Zullo explained how a careful analysis of the document’s typed letters and words, as well as the angles of the date stamps, proved forgery.""  ""According to the theory,"" the Republic said, ""the birth certificate presented to the public was created after copying and pasting information from the legitimate birth certificate of a woman born in Hawaii"" named Johanna Ah’Nee.  Zullo later told the Republic that he had gotten Ah’Nee’s birth certificate from a man named Jerome Corsi, who wrote a 2011 book making ""the case that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president.""  How did Corsi get the birth certificate? Zullo didn’t know.  ""I have to be honest with you, that’s a really good question,"" the Republic reported he said. ""Because either that’s an unbelievable coincidence or there’s something else going on.""  Here is what’s going on.  In June 2008, the Obama campaign responded to rumors about his citizenship and released a copy of his ""Certification of Birth"" from Hawaii, posting the document online. That fueled even more claims, this time that the document was fraudulent.  FactCheck.org reporters even went to Chicago, where Obama’s campaign headquarters was based, to hold the document and examine it closely. They concluded that it was legitimate.  In October 2008, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued a statement saying that he and the registrar of vital statistics ""who has the statutory authority to oversee and maintain these types of vital records"" had personally seen and verified that the health department had Obama’s original birth certificate on record.  Janice Okubo, a spokesperson for the health department, told us that birth certificates evolve over the decades, and there are no doubt differences between what Obama’s looked like when he was born and the documents issued today.  And if there was a plot to forge a birth certificate so that Obama could run for office, it went back decades — to the month he was born in 1961.  Will Hoover, who wrote a 2008 story for the Honolulu Advertiser about Obama’s childhood in Hawaii, told PolitiFact that he reviewed microfilm archives and found two birth announcements for Obama. One was in the Honolulu Advertiser on Aug. 13 , 1961, and the other was in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: ""Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4,"" and they were both submitted to the newspaper by the health department — not Obama’s family. ""Take a second and think about that,"" PolitiFact reported in 2009. ""In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States.""

No, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin didn’t refuse COVID-19 vaccine for safety reasons
","The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech has been available for nearly a year. And yet, a Twitter user claims, the CEO of BioNTech is still refusing to get vaccinated.

But both the edited and original versions show Sahin’s answer when he was asked on Dec. 22, 2020, why he could not take the vaccine yet. He said: ""Because you know there is a priority. The vaccine is not allowed to be taken outside of this priority list. We were even not allowed to participate in clinical trials because of law. It is not possible to include company people in such trials.""  At the time of the interview, Germany had not begun vaccinating anyone. The country began vaccinating the elderly on Dec. 27, 2020, and like many countries that had limited supplies early on, it followed a priority list that determined who could get vaccinated first.  The country has since removed its priority requirements, and anyone is eligible to get the vaccine.  A spokesperson for BioNTech said Sahin has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  Sahin told Britain’s The Times in September that his concerns about getting the vaccine when it first became available were related to ethics, not the safety of the vaccine, and that he ultimately decided to get the shot in January 2021.  ""I had general concerns about having the vaccine at the beginning,"" he said. ""Was it not better ethically for me to wait until my age group’s turn to get vaccinated? But everyone told me to go ahead and do it. We had no side effects. Our vaccine’s safety profile is similar to the others. So it is a perfectly fine vaccine."" A tweet claims BioNTech’s CEO refuses to get vaccinated for safety reasons. The post included an edited version of an interview with Sahin from DW News in which he explained why he had not been vaccinated.  Sahin was vaccinated against COVID-19 in January. The video interview is from December 2020, before Germany began vaccinating people, and the video does not support the claim that Sahin refused the vaccine for safety reasons. Sahin said in a subsequent interview that he was initially concerned about receiving the vaccine before it was his turn under Germany’s priority list for vaccination.  We rate this claim False.   ","[('Twitter post, Dec. 5, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/AnonCitizenUK/status/1467525765474443264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1467525765474443264%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Ffact-check%2Fceo-biontech-refuse-vaccine%2F'), ('Youtube video, Dec. 22, 2020', 'No link'), ('Deutsche Welle (DW) News, ""COVID: German regulations on who gets vaccine first,"" last accessed Dec. 15, 2021', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOT8ElNBbo4'), ('Reuters, ""Fact Check-BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin has been vaccinated against COVID-19,""\xa0', 'No link'), ('Associated Press, ""Posts cite old interview to falsely claim BioNTech CEO isn’t vaccinated,"" Dec. 6, 2021', 'https://www.dw.com/en/covid-german-regulations-on-who-gets-vaccine-first/a-55987647'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/20/facebook-posts/no-biontech-ceo-ugur-sahin-didnt-refuse-covid-19-v/
"['Voter ID Laws', 'New York', 'Lee Zeldin']","
Poll shows support for voter ID across groups, with one exception
","Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Long Island Republican running for governor, claims most New Yorkers support voter identification laws.  New York generally does not require voters to show photo identification when they vote. But Zeldin has called for a law to change that, and he launched a petition in support.  ""Voter ID is supported by an overwhelming majority of NYers, from all across the state, walks of life, & political parties,"" Zeldin tweeted on Dec. 8.  Given the debate about election security across the nation, we wondered if he is correct.  We reached out to Zeldin’s campaign, and spokesperson Katie Vincentz provided us with a screenshot from a private poll of 600 New York voters from September, conducted by McLaughlin and Associates on behalf of the Conservative Party of New York. The screenshot included a single question: Do you support or oppose requiring photo ID to vote whether in-person or by absentee mail-in?  The results indicate that 600 likely general election voters responded. Of those, a majority, 57.3%, said they ""strongly support"" voter identification requirements and 12.5% said they ""somewhat support"" such requirements. Overall, 69.8% of  respondents expressed some level of support for requiring voter identification.  The poll showed 27.7% of respondents opposed it. Of those, 20.5% said they ""strongly oppose"" and 7.2 % said they ""somewhat oppose"" it. The rest of those polled said they didn’t know or refused to answer. Polls done for candidates, parties and lobbyists can be problematic. Pollsters may bring a perceived point of view to the polls, which can color everything from how questions are asked to how responses are weighted.      We spoke with pollster John McLaughlin, who said the poll included more Republicans and Conservatives than are reflected in New York’s voter rolls, but added it was adjusted for actual voter turnout in a general election.  Among Republicans, 98% supported it. Among non-affiliated voters, 82% supported it. Among Democrats, 49% supported. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points, so support among Democrats could be 53%, or it could be 45%.  Support for the measure was strong upstate and downstate. Majorities of all racial groups polled also supported it,  ranging from 91% in support among Asian respondents to 58% among Black respondents.   Thirty-seven percent of poll respondents live upstate, and 63% live downstate. Respondents were a mix of party affiliations: 31% percent Republican, 52% percent Democratic or Working Families, and 18% non-affiliated or who refused to answer. Seventy-two percent of respondents were white, 10% were Hispanic, 12% were Black, and 4% were Asian.  We also sought out other recent public polls of New York voters, but came up empty. Representatives from three major polling organizations: Siena College Research Institute, Marist College Institute for Public Opinion and Quinnipiac University said that they had not polled this question.  In New York, a voter’s identity is verified when they register to vote. If their identity cannot be verified during the registration process, they are asked for identification the first time they vote, according to the state Board of Elections registration form. In August, PolitiFact looked at new voter identification laws and found broad public support for voter identification laws, even among Democrats. PolitiFact also found nuance in the debate, and that asking people whether they support or oppose these laws obscure these aspects. These include voter identification requirements already in place, the low risk of voter fraud, and the support even among voting rights advocates for voter identification laws that are flexible enough to accommodate all voters. States set their own rules on voter identification. Some are strict, and others less so, accepting many different forms of identification to vote.   Recent national polls show broad support for voter identification. A Monmouth University poll from June of 810 adults showed that 91% of Republicans, 62% of Democrats and 87% of non-affiliated voters support requiring photo identification to vote. In April, the Pew Research Center polled 5,109 people and asked whether photo identification should be required to vote: 76% of all respondents said they support the requirement. A majority in both parties support it: 93% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats. In March, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 72% of respondents strongly or somewhat favor requiring photo identification to vote.  The Economist/YouGov polled in March and found 64% of respondents support photo identification requirements for in-person voting. Analyzed by region, support was lowest in the Northeast, with 53% in favor. Only 46% of Northeast voters supported it for absentee voting.  Our ruling Zeldin claimed voter identification requirements are supported by an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers, from across the state, walks of life, and political parties. Zeldin backs the claim with a private poll of 600 New Yorkers conducted for the Conservative Party of New York. A majority of poll respondents, 57.3%, said they strongly support voter identification requirements for voting in-person or casting absentee ballots while 12.5% said they somewhat support the requirements. The poll showed majorities of each racial group, geographic group, and political affiliation support the requirements, with one exception. Support among Democrats in the poll was at 49%, with a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points.   The requirements are broadly supported across the country, and according to a single private poll, in New York state as well.  We rate this Mostly True. ","[('Twitter, tweet, @leezeldin, Dec. 8, 2021.

Old claim about nurse swapping 5,000 babies at birth has been debunked
","In June, a couple in Tennessee with a newborn child was surprised when a hospital nurse mistakenly brought them the wrong baby from the nursery.  ""Just a panicked look on her face, she was like just breathing heavily and just flustered,"" the father told reporters when the hospital swapped the babies back.  The incident made both local and national news.

Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz supports legal status and work permits for 'illegal' immigrants
","Florida’s Marco Rubio, asked by a reporter if Texan Ted Cruz is perhaps more serious about stopping illegal immigration, shot back that the freshman senators competing for the Republican presidential nomination share common ground. Rubio, who helped propel Senate approval of an immigration overhaul in 2013 that included a path to citizenship for immigrants already living here, replied at a South Carolina event Nov. 12, 2015: ""Ted is a supporter of legalizing people who are in this country illegally."" That’s kind of a head-snapper. Among presidential hopefuls, Cruz holds himself out as tougher than the rest against giving ground to people living in the U.S. without legal authorization. In September 2015, PolitiFact rated Mostly True Cruz’s claim that he alone among 10 candidates (including Rubio) at the CNN Reagan Library debate never backed ""amnesty"" for immigrants. Research suggested he was the only one who had never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or another form of legal status. But Rubio suggested in South Carolina that when the Senate was debating its plan, Cruz was on board with giving immigrants legal status. ""In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed,"" Rubio said, Cruz ""proposed legalizing people that were here illegally. He proposed giving them work permits. He’s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He's supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500 percent increase. So, if you look at it, I don't think our positions are dramatically different."" Cruz has called for expanded legal immigration. In 2013, he unsuccessfully offered amendments to the Senate plan to quintuple H-1B visas, which are open to foreign workers with certain specialties, and to step up the number of green cards, which permit foreign nationals to live and work here permanently. The Cuban American lawyer talks up similar goals on his campaign website where his immigration proposals are preceded by this poke at the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" immigration effort that was joined by Rubio in 2013: ""When Establishment Republicans teamed up with Democrats to reward millions of illegal immigrants with amnesty,"" Cruz says, ""I engaged millions of men and women across the country. Together, we defeated President Obama’s attempt to pass amnesty."" So, is Rubio right that Cruz supports giving a legal status to people living here illegally — and even proposed work permits for them? Rubio camp cites Cruz’s comments at hearing Rubio spokesman Alex Conant, asked to explain how Rubio reached his conclusions, told us Cruz’s comments during the 2013 discussion about the immigration bill show he favors giving illegal immigrants living here some kind of legal status. By email, Rubio’s camp said an amendment offered by Cruz during the 2013 Senate deliberations demonstrates Rubio’s point. Ultimately, that’s not how we interpreted Cruz’s actions and statements during the 2013 debate that involved the Senate advancing an immigration plan that died without action in the House. Cruz’s actions, comments in 2013 Senate deliberations Let’s walk through what Cruz proposed, what he said about his proposal and whether he has otherwise embraced a legal status for immigrants living here without legal authorization. On May 21, 2013, Cruz issued a press release saying that he’d offered amendments to the Senate measure that day to ""ensure that illegal immigrants are not given a path to citizenship, and modernize, streamline and expand legal immigration by reforming the green card program."" In the release, Cruz’s office provided video of Cruz talking about his amendments during that day’s meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Per his unsuccessful proposal to remove the plan’s ""path to citizenship"" provisions, Cruz said at the hearing that in his view, for immigration reform to credibly fix ""the problem,"" border security should be toughened, legal immigration should be elevated, and ""there should not be a pathway to citizenship for those who are here illegally."" Cruz further said that if the path to citizenship were eliminated from the Senate plan, as he proposed, some 11 million residents living ""in the shadows"" would ""still be eligible for RPI status."" The Senate plan ultimately provided that immigrants in the country without legal authorization could apply for an envisioned Registered Provisional Immigrant program, which would result in a work permit also enabling a successful applicant to travel outside the U.S. and return. A person with RPI status for 10 years would be eligible to apply for permanent residency, as in a green card. Cruz continued: ""They would still be eligible for legal status and indeed, under the terms of the bill, they would be eligible for"" green card ""status as well so that they are out of the shadows, which the proponents of this bill repeatedly point to as their principal objective, to provide a legal status for those who are here illegally to be out of the shadows,"" Cruz said. Other Cruz comments According to a Bloomberg News story posted the day after Rubio commented on Cruz in South Carolina, the Texan said he laughed on hearing the ""false"" idea that he supports giving work permits to people living here without legal permission. On the other hand, Rubio's campaign pointed out news stories that it described as demonstrating Cruz was amenable to giving immigrants legal status. In June 2013, Cruz told NPR News that if senators embraced his proposal stripping out the path to citizenship option, the ""11 million who are here illegally would be granted legal status once the border was secured — not before — but after the border was secured, they would be granted legal status. And indeed, they would be eligible for permanent legal residency. But they would not be eligible for citizenship."" Later, Cruz was described in September 2013 by the Texas Tribune as supportive of giving immigrants living here legal status--though not a way to citizenship. The story said: Asked about what to do with the people here illegally, however, he (Cruz) stressed that he had never tried to undo the goal of allowing them to stay. ""The amendment that I introduced removed the path to citizenship, but it did not change the underlying work permit from the Gang of Eight,"" he said during a recent visit to El Paso. By phone, Brian Phillips, a Cruz campaign spokesman, told us that each example of Cruz mentioning work permits in the Senate plan amounted to Cruz simply explaining what would remain in the Senate plan if the path to citizenship element were yanked--and, Phillips said, Cruz never said he would vote for the plan, regardless. Other analysts Separately, Mark Krikorian, who advocated against the 2013 bill, told Bloomberg News that Cruz’s amendment to remove the path to citizenship element was a legislative tactic. ""You often introduce measures you hope will be poison pills if you're trying to kill a piece of legislation,"" said Krikorian who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. We asked Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, an advocacy group that promotes reduced immigration, about Rubio’s claim. Chmielenski, who closely monitored the Senate during the immigration debate, said by email he doesn’t think Cruz ""was ever willing to support legalization"" of immigrants living here ""before enforcement"" of border security. ""That's a different position from Rubio,"" Chmielenski said. By phone, Chmielenski said that there also was no Cruz amendment proposing to give work permits to people living here without legal authorization. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz ""is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally"" and ""proposed giving them work permits."" To the contrary, we found no sign of Cruz proposing to give work permits to immigrants living here without legal permission and no record of Cruz explicitly saying he favored giving such residents legal status.

Fox News analyst exaggerates car incident at Homecoming Parade
","Concerned Student 1950 has been thrust into the national spotlight after playing a role in ousting the leaders of MU and the University of Missouri System. The activist group, originally made up of 11 black students, drew attention to its cause with protests, a hunger strike by graduate student Jonathan Butler and a boycott by the football team. But before that, the group started by blocking the university's Homecoming Parade on Oct. 10, linking arms in front of the red convertible carrying then-UM System President Tim Wolfe and delaying the parade for about 10 minutes. Juan Williams evoked that incident during ""The Five"" on Fox News Channel, explaining why he thought it was best for Wolfe to resign.   ""What happened was the students at some point wanted his attention. They wanted the adult, the man in charge to talk to them, to deal with their dissatisfaction. Apparently a car ran through the students, hit one of them — and that's Butler, apparently."" Did Wolfe's driver mow down the protesters? Not according to the police or video of the scene. Parade halt When Concerned Student 1950 blocked Wolfe's car, it did it at a bend in the parade route. The rest of the parade was eventually able to cut through a Domino's Pizza parking lot to circumvent the protesters, but each time Wolfe's driver tried to turn into the parking lot, the protesters rearranged themselves to block the car's path. (Although 11 students in matching shirts started the protest, some parade spectators joined them in the street and helped block the car.) It was during this constrained maneuvering that Wolfe's car made contact with Butler. How hard did it hit him? Neither Butler nor Concerned Student 1950 responded to a request for comment. But he wasn't hospitalized, according to police. Demonstrators' video of the parade shows that Butler remained standing and continued protesting. And video from the Columbia Missourian shows that he continued blocking Wolfe's car until police cleared the street. MU Police Major Brian Weimer told PolitiFact Missouri it was ""incidental contact."" People at the parade also described the contact between Butler and the car as accidental, though they said the driver seemed impatient and was revving his engine. Butler did file an incident report with MUPD, and Weimer said police ""looked at all the video we could find"" before closing the case and declining to arrest or cite the driver. ""It was nothing intentional,"" Weimer said, adding that sometimes cars move a little bit when switching gears, which the driver was doing to try to get around the protesters. The car ""wasn't trying to drive over them,"" he said. Even if the incident didn't affect Butler's physical well-being, it did emerge as a subplot in the protests that eventually removed Wolfe and then-MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. After the Homecoming Parade, Concerned Student 1950 sent a letter and a list of demands to Wolfe. The page-long letter doesn't mention the car contact. But the first demand included it among the grievances for which they wanted an apology: ""We want Tim Wolfe to admit his gross negligence, allowing his driver to hit one of the demonstrators, consenting to the physical violence of bystanders, and lastly refusing to intervene when Columbia Police Department used excessive force with demonstrators."" And in the days after the parade, Butler routinely cited it on Twitter.   Some media outlets, such as Breitbart, have claimed Butler walked into the path of Wolfe's car and made contact with it himself. That website edited the video to show the sequence in slow motion while a narrator asserts that Butler walked into the car. It's clear that Butler was approaching the car before the contact took place, but it's inconclusive on whether Butler was moving or stationary when the contact occurred. It is clear, though, that the collision was minor. Williams didn't respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Williams said a car driving Wolfe ""ran through the students, hit one of them."" This is an exaggeration of what happened. A group of protesters blocked the path of Wolfe's vehicle during the Oct. 10 Missouri homecoming parade. At some point, Wolfe's vehicle made contact with Butler — but the incident didn't require Butler to receive medical attention, or even stop protesting. Police reviewed the incident and described it as ""incidental contact."" Williams' statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","[('Interview with MUPD Major Brian Weimer, Nov. 12', 'http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/in-homecoming-parade-racial-justice-advocates-take-different-paths/article_24c824da-6f77-11e5-958e-fb15c6375503.html'), ('""In Homecoming Parade, racial justice advocates take different paths,""\xa0Columbia Missourian, Oct. 10', 'No link'), ('""The Five,""\xa0Fox News, Nov. 10', 'https://www.iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=350d5b9f-1e9b-406e-bad6-f18ba4ea9e8c'), (""Concerned Student 1950's list of demands, @_JonathanButler's Twitter timeline"", 'No link'), ('""Protest stops parade"",\xa0Columbia Missourian\'s Vimeo account', 'https://twitter.com/_JonathanButler/status/654057859999633412')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/18/juan-williams/fox-news-analyst-exaggerates-car-incident-homecomi/

On Oct. 1, 2015 she tweeted this: ""71% of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. #JustFixIt"" In Wisconsin’s budget battles over infrastructure, few deny the need for road maintenance. But is Shilling right about how bad the situation is? Digging into the numbers Shilling’s team directed us to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation that cited the same statistics as the tweet -- that 71 percent of roads in Wisconsin are in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of bridges are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. So, the report is quoted accurately. But what about the numbers themselves? The two statistics were drawn from different sources of data. The data on road conditions came from the 2013 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. The report, the most recent available, is put out by the American Society of Civil Engineers, a trade and advocacy organization. By the group’s tally, Wisconsin is one of just six states with at least 70 percent of roads rated in poor or mediocre condition, meaning our roads are in worse shape than the national average. But experts caution that the report card can overstate the amount of need for road repairs. First, the report uses a small source of data for each state and then extrapolates that data to the entire state roadway system. Ashwat Anandanarayanan, director of transportation policy for the environmental group 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, said the civil engineers’ reports also conflate new roadway construction and maintenance, resulting in what appears to be greater need.   ""Lots of roads need to be fixed,"" he said. ""Not a lot need to be expanded.""   So then, what is a better measuring stick? The Wisconsin Department of Transportation collects its own data on road conditions that is used in the Highway Performance Monitoring System by the Federal Highway Administration, which is considered the gold standard of transportation information. According to these figures, the percentage of Wisconsin roads in poor or mediocre condition is much lower -- 38 percent of the state highway system falls into those categories.   That doesn’t mean the state will fare better in a national comparison by that measure. In fact, the state lags behind the U.S. average in most indicators of roadway quality. As for bridges, Shilling said 14 percent of Wisconsin’s bridges were in disrepair or functionally obsolete. This statistic, which is accurate, came from WisDOT data submitted to the Federal Highway Administration. But while Shilling cites the number as evidence of the state being behind, Wisconsin does pretty well here in a national comparison. Only three states — Arizona, Minnesota and Nevada — reported a smaller percentage of bridges in disrepair. Our rating Shilling said ""71 % of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete."" The report she cited from the federal Department of Transportation backed up her figures, but the numbers used for her road statistic aren’t the most accurate available. By another measure, the percentage of roads in poor or mediocre condition is far smaller. There was no dispute on the bridge number, though on that front the state actually fares better than most others. We rate the claim Mostly True.  ","[('U.S. Department of Transportation, Road and bridge data by state, July 9, 2015.', 'https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/grow-america/road-and-bridge-data-state'), ('Phone interview with Ashwat Anandanarayanan, director of transportation policy, 1000 Friends of Wisconsin.', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Joe Peterangelo, senior researcher, Public Policy Forum.', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/dot-puts-breaks-on-5-major-road-project-in-budget-crunch-b99586812z1-329959171.html'), ('Email exchange with Tony Palese, Office of Senator Jennifer Shilling.', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, DOT puts brakes on 5 major road projects in budget crunch, Sept. 29, 2015.', 'http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wisconsin/wisconsin-overview/'), ('Email exchange with Olivia Wolfertz, media relations, American Society of Civil Engineers.', 'No link'), ('American Society of Civil Engineers, Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, 2013.', 'http://reason.org/news/show/21st-annual-highway-report-states#WI'), ('Email exchange with Patty Mayers, director, Office of Public Affairs, Wisconsin Department of Transportation.', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Baruch Feigenbaum, transportation policy analyst, Reason Foundation.', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-to-vote-wednesday-on-additional-highway-borrowing-b99609695z1-340130011.html'), ('Email exchange with James Corvetti, associate professor of civil engineering, Marquette University.', 'No link'), ('Reason Foundation, 21st annual highway report’s state-by-state results, Sept. 18, 2014. \xa0', 'https://www.northeastern.edu/voters/research/documents/R44_Applicability_of_the_IRI_as_a_Predictor_of_Asphalt_Pavement_Condition.pdf'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Lawmakers OK additional highway borrowing, Nov. 4, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Journal of Transportation Engineering, Applicability of the international roughness index as a predictor of asphalt pavement condition, December 2007.', 'http://usa.streetsblog.org/2013/03/20/is-the-asce-failing-to-tell-america-to-spend-wisely-on-infrastructure/'), ('StreetsBlog USA, Is ASCE failing to tell America to spend wisely on infrastructure?, March 20, 2013.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/18/jennifer-shilling/jennifer-shilling-71-state-roads-rated-poor-or-med/

Obama: U.S. is largest donor for displaced persons, refugee relief
","With nearly two dozen U.S. states now saying they won’t resettle Syrian refugees, President Barack Obama took a moment during the G20 meeting to acknowledge the pressures faced by other countries at the gathering. ""The United States, as the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Turkey, Europe, and others in trying to help those who need help right now, even as we hope to reduce the flow of migrants because of the situation inside of Syria,"" Obama said. We wanted to know if America in fact is the largest provider of aid for displaced people and refugees. If we simply look at the dollars spent on international assistance, the numbers largely back up Obama. (We asked the White House for comment but didn't hear back.) But the dollars don’t tell the whole story. Any country that houses refugees incurs costs apart from its support for international aid agencies. The dollars Development Initiatives is a British organization focused on gathering data to help reduce global poverty. It reports that in 2012, the United States provided more humanitarian aid than any other nation. The U.S. government spent $3.8 billion, representing nearly a third of all aid from donor countries. The second highest donor was not a single country but agencies of the European Union with about $1.8 billion in humanitarian aid. From the Development Initiatives report, here are the top 10 donors in 2012: Donor Amount Share of total United States $3.8 billion 29.4% EU $1.88 billion 14.5% United Kingdom $1.16 billion 9.0% Turkey $1.03 billion 8.0% Sweden $784 million 6.1% Germany $757 million 5.9% Japan $606 million 4.7% Canada $512 million 4.0% Norway $509 million 3.9% Australia $442 million 3.4% The United States ranks first, but it also represents the largest national economy. As a percentage of Gross National Income (the research center’s economic yardstick), Luxembourg and Sweden are the top donors giving 0.16 percent and 0.14 percent respectively. This table shows the line-up, again using Development Initiative data: Donor Share of GNI Luxembourg 0.16% Sweden 0.14% Turkey 0.13% Norway 0.10% Denmark 0.09% Ireland 0.08 Finland 0.07% UK 0.05% Netherlands 0.05% Switzerland 0.05% Belgium 0.04% Canada 0.03% Australia 0.03% New Zealand 0.03% United States 0.02% We should note that these donations go toward problems that range beyond refugees and people displaced by conflict. This humanitarian aid also provides food when people are starving and shelter when a flood or other disaster drives them from their homes. To get a slightly different angle, we looked at the donors to the UN High Commission on Refugees. That’s the UN lead agency for refugee assistance. Again, the United States comes out on top with $792 million given in 2012. The next highest was Japan. Susan Fratzke is a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a research center in New York City. Fratzke said the donor numbers only take you so far. ""Not all the refugee aid goes to the UNHCR,"" Fratzke said. ""Some governments also give to big nonprofits, like the International Rescue Committee."" But Fratzke said specific to Syria, America has been the largest donor to help people fleeing that conflict. She said she’s comfortable that all told, the United States most likely is the largest donor across the board. Hosting refugees There’s another way to look at providing aid, though, and that’s by looking at how many displaced persons are residing in a country. According to the UNHCR, in 2014 no country dealt with more refugees than Turkey. More than 1.5 million Syrians fled their war-torn country to find safety in Turkey. Not only is Turkey the fourth largest donor of humanitarian aid, it shelters the greatest number of refugees within its borders. Data from UNHCR produces this table: Country Refugees Turkey 1,587,345 Pakistan 1,505,516 Lebanon 1,154,024 Iran (Islamic Rep. of) 982,025 Ethiopia 659,510 Jordan 654,116 Kenya 551,336 Chad 452,877 Uganda 385,498 China 301,047 Afghanistan 300,421 Sudan 277,818 Iraq 271,137 United States 267,174 Cameroon 264,102 Yemen 257,632 France 252,228 South Sudan 248,152 Egypt 236,050 Russian Federation 235,717 It is difficult to put a dollar value on such efforts, but the hosting of refugees represents another form of providing assistance. Our ruling Obama said that the United States is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees. We found that America gives more humanitarian aid than any other country, and it ranks first in supporting the UN’s lead agency in helping refugees. While the numbers are a bit inexact, an expert we reached said all the numbers point toward the United States being the top donor. While other countries give more relative to the size of their economy, the total volume of dollars matters most in terms of being able to provide more food, shelter and medical care. However, countries that host refugees also provide humanitarian assistance in ways that are not so easily tallied. Those efforts should factor into an assessment of each nation’s level of aid. Obama was likely thinking in terms of financial support and in that regard, his statement holds water. But it’s important to acknowledge that other forms of assistance matter. The statement is largely correct but it requires a bit more information. We rate it Mostly True.","[('White House Press Office, Remarks by President Obama and President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey after Bilateral Meeting, Nov. 15, 2015', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/15/remarks-president-obama-and-president-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-after'), ('Development Initiatives, Global Humanitarian Assistance Report, 2013', 'No link'), ('UNHCR, Total contributions to UNHCR in 2012, 2013', 'http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GHA-Report-2013.pdf'), ('Interview, Susan Fratzke, policy analyst, Migration Policy Institute, Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/17/barack-obama/obama-us-largest-donor-displaced-personsrefugee-re/

Viral graphic says Japan keeps out radical Islam through strong restrictions on Muslims
","Amid rising concerns about terrorist attacks by ISIS, we’ve seen an uptick in chain emails and viral images about Islam. One viral image points to Japan as an example of a country that keeps out radical Islam by cracking down on all forms of Islam and its adherents, implying that this is a good model for the United States to follow. The graphic is a simple black-and-white block of text with the headline, ""Japan keeps Islam at bay by putting restrictions on Islam and ALL Muslims."" The graphic then mentions a variety of ways in which Japan supposedly keeps tight control over the Muslims in its midst: • ""Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims"" • ""Permanent residency is not given to Muslims"" • ""Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned"" • ""In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taught"" • ""Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries"" • ""One cannot import a ‘Koran’ published in the Arabic language"" • ""Muslims must follow Japanese law and language"". • ""The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim laws"" • ""Muslims cannot even rent a house in Japan"" • ""There is no sharia law in Japan"" We wondered whether the graphic is accurate. To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, ""permanent residency is not given to Muslims,"" the ""propagation of Islam"" is banned, ""one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,"" and ""Muslims cannot even rent a house.""  We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect. ""The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood,"" said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions. Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong. He said Japan doesn’t discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that ""propagation"" of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported. As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said there’s no specific animus toward Muslims. These four claims ""are totally unfounded,"" said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. ""It is disturbing that such an email is circulating,"" she added. ""These claims are simply ridiculous."" Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked. For instance, the graphic claims that ""Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries."" Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, there is nothing in Japanese nationality law that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of ""upright conduct,"" the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion. As for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo. Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear Japan’s respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps. ""I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,"" Abe said. ""I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence."" Our ruling The graphic says that in Japan, ""permanent residency is not given to Muslims,"" the ""propagation of Islam"" is banned, ""one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,"" and ""Muslims cannot even rent a house."" Each of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base.

Hillary Clinton: 3,000 killed by guns between Nevada and Iowa Democratic debates
","At the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more gun control. ""Just think about this -- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns,"" she said. The Iowa debate took place Nov. 14, and the Las Vegas debate happened on Oct. 13. Really? Were 3,000 people were killed by guns in just one month? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign for evidence, they directed us to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2013 -- the most recent CDC tally -- 33,636 people died in gun incidents. If you divide that by 12, it comes out to 2,803 -- or nearly 3,000 people a month. But Clinton was talking about 2015, not 2013. More recent data doesn’t seem to exist. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said the CDC is the best source on this topic. A CDC spokesman told us that 2014 data will come out in December. The only alternative we could find is the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit organization that keeps a running tally of gun deaths by combing through police blotters and news media, among other sources, daily. The Gun Violence Archive’s numbers aren’t comprehensive, though. In 2014, the group counted 12,500 gun deaths in 2014 and 11,500 so far in 2015 -- both less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. This is largely because the count doesn't include suicides, which make up more than half of all gun deaths.  The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, said Mark Bryant, the archive's executive director. He said that their total number of gun deaths could triple when that data is added in. So Clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas. Still, we wanted to know if it was possible Clinton’s claim is accurate for this year, so we ran her number by some experts. ""My call is that Clinton’s claim is not necessarily proven, but it is well in the range of possibility,"" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor who studies violent crime at the University of Central Florida. In fact, the total for 2015 might be higher than 2013, as gun suicides are up, said Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun violence at the University of California Davis. Homicides are up, too, which would contribute to a higher number of gun deaths this year, Corzine noted. One final note on Clinton’s phrasing: Some could interpret her description of gun deaths -- ""killed by guns"" -- as violence inflicted upon one person by another. However, more than 60 percent of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, according to the CDC. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns."" We found a few problems with her statement. First, we don’t actually know how many people have died in the last month. Clinton’s statement is based on 2013 data from the CDC, which tallied nearly 3,000 gun deaths per month that year. There’s not more recent data available. Experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than 2013, so Clinton’s claim is probably not too far off. But we can’t know for sure. Also, it’s likely that at roughly half of these deaths are due to suicide. It could be even higher. Clinton’s phrasing obscures that point. Clinton used very specific language even though she’s actually extrapolating from old data. Overall, we rate her claim Half True. Editor's note: The Gun Violence Archive got back to us after publication, and we've updated the piece to include their comments.","[('CDC, ""Deaths: Final Data for 2013,"" 2014', 'http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf'), ('Gun Violence Archive, ""Number of Deaths in 2015,"" accessed Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, Nov. 16, 2015', 'http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/number-of-gun-deaths'), ('Email interview, Garen Wintemute, physician at UC Davis, Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-3000-killed-guns-between-nevada-an/

Here's a toast to some very bad information on booze and dementia
","A story making the rounds on social media raises hopes about raising glasses. A ""new"" study, the headlines cheer, shows drinking champagne — three glasses every week or every day depending who is posting the story — could prevent Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. But before deciding to make three-hour brunches the new healthy workday, PolitiFact Georgia did some checking. We didn’t find the new breakthrough study that some might have been expecting. Rather, we discovered social media abuzz about a study from May 2013 by scientists at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. Those researchers found that drinking  champagne might counteract age-related memory loss and help delay the onset of degenerative brain disorders, such as dementia, according to a press release at the time. Rats, not humans, were subjects in the research. For reasons still unclear, the study’s headline findings went viral on social media and cracked Facebook’s list of trending topics this month, nearly three years after the study. ""Three glasses of champagne ‘could help Alzheimer’s disease’"" was the headline on The United Kingdom’s Evening Standard’s Facebook post Nov. 9. News outlets picked the story up from social media. Most but not all pointed out that the study was not brand new. The attention prompted Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) to issue a statement Nov. 9, declaring that there’s ""no hard evidence champagne can prevent dementia."" The agency explained that the University of Reading’s 2013 study was small — it involved three groups of eight rats. n a six-week period, the rats had champagne, non-champagne alcoholic drink, or an alcohol-free drink. Each rat was assessed on its ability to find treats in a maze before and after this period. The main finding: rats given champagne were better at remembering how to find the treat than those given the alcohol-free drink. They found the treats roughly five times out of eight, compared with four times out of eight in rats given the other drinks, NHS said. The agency recommended that the study be repeated with a larger sample of rats and pointed out that ""this research has limited direct applicability to humans. ""The fact that rats may have performed slightly better in a maze, or demonstrated some protein changes related to nerve adaptability, does not mean champagne definitely reduces the risk of dementia in humans."" Ginny Helms, vice president of chapter services and public policy for the Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, said the 2013 study was very limited ""and not at all conclusive on how champagne or other forms of alcohol can help prevent Alzheimer’s. ""No one should drink champagne or other alcohol as a method of reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia based on this study,"" she said. ""Some studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but other studies had contradictory results."" Absent a cure or major breakthrough, the association suggests a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, socialization and exercise of the mind as the best way to protect the brain, Helms said. Managing critical numbers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, also is highly recommended, she said. The buzz on champagne started just days before the association released a major report that includes some staggering statistics on the rising financial burden to states of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Currently, Medicaid programs in 11 states — New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan and North Carolina – pay more than $1 billion a year on individuals 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, the association reports. Fast forward 10 years to 2025, and the association estimates that 20 states — Georgia included — will be in this boat. Alzheimer’s and other dementia costs the Peach State’s Medicaid program $989 million this year. But, in 10 years, costs are expected to increase 61 percent to $1.59 billion by the association’s estimates. Our ruling Social media recently resurrected an old study Stories were posted  suggesting that drinking champagne could help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. The study is from 2013, not new, as some posts suggested. It was based on testing in a small group of rats, which the National Health Service in Britain says would need to be repeated in a larger sample. And it still might not have any implications in humans. To imply otherwise is very misleading. We rate the statement False.","[('""Scientists reveal drinking champagne could improve memory,"" press release, University of Reading, May 7, 2013', 'https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR503596.aspx'), ('""No hard evidence champagne can prevent dementia,"" NHS United Kingdom, Monday, Nov. 9, 2015', 'No link'), ('""Drinking three glasses of champagne per week could help stave off dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease,"" Daily Mirror, Nov. 9, 2015', 'http://www.nhs.uk/news/2015/11November/Pages/No-hard-evidence-champagne-can-prevent-dementia.aspx'), ('Phone interview with Ginny Helms, vice president of chapter services and public policy for the Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association', 'No link'), ('""Will drinking champagne stop me getting dementia?

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders' comments on climate change and terrorism
","The Democratic debate in Iowa began with a moment of silence for the victims of the Paris terror attacks before pivoting to a discussion on how to address terrorism. Bernie Sanders, who vowed to ""rid our planet"" of ISIS in his opening statement, also said at a previous debate that the greatest threat to national security is climate change. A day after the terrorist attacks, did he, asked moderator John Dickerson, still believe that? ""Absolutely. In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism,"" Sanders said on Nov. 14. ""If we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you’re gonna see countries all over the world — this is what the CIA says — they’re going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you’re going to see all kinds of international conflict."" A day later on CBS’ Face the Nation, Sanders doubled down on his statement, elaborating, ""When people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaida and ISIS are using right now."" We were curious about the link between climate change and terrorism that Sanders highlighted. While there is a body of literature backing his broader point that climate change contributes to the growth of terrorism, Sanders is overstating the ""direct"" connection.   A complicated relationship The Sanders camp referred us to statements from President Barack Obama and leaders of the defense community, as well as a Defense Department report that suggests indirect links between climate change and terrorism: • Obama in a May 2015 speech: ""Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram."" • The Defense Department in a 2014 report: ""In our defense strategy, we refer to climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’ because it has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today — from infectious disease to terrorism. We are already beginning to see some of these impacts."" • Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, then-commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in 2013 that the significant upheaval related to the warming planet ""is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen … that will cripple the security environment."" We found a few other federal and academic reports naming climate change a threat to national security, but that’s not the same thing as ""directly related to the growth of terrorism."" That’s not to say that climate change isn’t contributing to existing problems. Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley used more accurate language when he said, ""One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis."" We rated his comments Mostly True. Sanders was more sweeping in his comments, though. ""I wouldn’t have said it as strongly, but (climate change) is an accelerant to conflict and helps produce instability,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the national security think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Within the national security sphere, more and more see climate change as a real problem. They would agree with the broader point."" Climate change, however, is not ""hermetically sealed from other risks,"" writes Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell of the Center for Climate and Security in a blog post. ""The impacts of climate change interact with other factors to make existing security risks worse."" That’s why experts and the Pentagon prefer the term ""threat multiplier."" Here’s how: Climate change can lead to food and water scarcity, which may in turn increase poverty, the spread of disease, and mass migration — in short, instability. In places with already weakened governments, this breeds the conditions for terrorism to thrive. Factors that contribute to terrorism Of course, there are myriad conditions that motivate terrorism. Ideology and political interests are much more direct factors, according to Michael Doran, who served on the National Security Council and in the Defense Department under President George W. Bush. The latest Global Terrorism Index report lists political, nationalist and separatist movements as well as weak political systems and a lack of political legitimacy as main drivers. It found that countries with high levels of terrorism share three ""statistically significant factors"": •  Hostility between different ethnic, religious and linguistic groups; •  State-sponsored violence such as extrajudicial killings, political terrors and high levels of group grievances; •  Violence from organized conflict, demonstrations and crime, and perceptions of criminality. According to the Global Terrorism report, 66 percent of deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013 were caused by four extremist groups: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban and al-Qaida. Their commonality is, obviously, religious extremism. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism."" We couldn’t find any evidence of a ""direct"" relationship between climate change and terrorism, though many reports have noted an indirect link. There are, of course, many other factors that contribute to terrorism, including religious and ethnic tensions and political repression. We rate Sanders' claim Mostly False.  ","[('Email interview with Warren Gunnels, spokesperson for Bernie Sanders, Nov. 14, 2015', 'https://www.nexis.com/results/enhdocview.do?docLinkInd=true&ersKey=23_T23008022206&format=GNBFI&startDocNo=0&resultsUrlKey=0_T23008022209&backKey=20_T23008022210&csi=8104&docNo=1'), ('Interview with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Nov. 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email and phone interviews with Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, Nov. 14 and Nov. 16, 2015', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/20/remarks-president-united-states-coast-guard-academy-commencement'), ('Email interview with Keith Proctor, senior policy researcher at MercyCorps, Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Francesco Femia, director of the Center for Climate and Security Studies', 'https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/03/09/admiral-samuel-locklear-commander-pacific-forces-warns-that-climate-change-top-threat/BHdPVCLrWEMxRe9IXJZcHL/story.html'), ('Email interview with Solomon Tsiang, professor of public policy at UC Berkeley, Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link'), ('Federal News Service, ""Remarks by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta,"" May 2, 2012', 'http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/225475-panetta-climate-change-hits-national-security'), ('White House, ""Remarks by the President at the United States Coast Guard Academy Commencement,"" May 20, 2015', 'No link'), ('Boston Globe, ""Chief of US Pacific forces calls climate biggest worry,"" March 9, 2013', 'http://www.scribd.com/doc/242845848/Read-DoD-report-2014-Climate-Change-Adaptation-Roadmap'), ('The Hill, ""Panetta warns climate change having \'dramatic impact\' on national security,"" May 4, 2012', 'No link'), ('Dept. of Defense, ""2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap,"" Oct. 13, 2014', 'http://climateandsecurity.org/2015/11/16/is-climate-change-the-biggest-security-threat-is-still-a-bad-question/'), ('Center for Climate and Security, ""‘Is Climate Change the Biggest Security Threat?’ Is Still A Bad Question,"" Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Fact-checking the link between climate change and ISIS,"" Sept. 23, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/23/martin-omalley/fact-checking-link-between-climate-change-and-isis/'), ('Institute for Economics & Peace, Global Terrorism Index 2014, Nov. 18, 2014', 'No link'), ('The Guardian, ""How Isis came to be,"" Aug. 22, 2014', 'http://static.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Terrorism%20Index%20Report%202014.pdf')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/16/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-comments-climate-chan/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Baby Got PAC']","
Democrats, Clinton campaign afraid of Rubio, new super PAC says
","A Republican millionaire with an apparent fondness for '90s rap has thrown his support behind U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. California winery owner John Jordan’s new super PAC released a one-minute commercial before the Nov. 10, 2015, GOP primary debate. The political action committee is cheekily named Baby Got PAC, a reference to the 1992 Sir Mix-a-Lot magnum opus Baby Got Back. In the ad, reportedly written by Jordan, a narrator explains the PAC is pulling for Rubio over the rest of the Republicans because the Floridian is the one that Democrats fear most in the general election. ""It’s a tough choice. So you know who we asked? Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,"" the ad said while flashing three lines as proof of their point. ""For once, they told the truth. They admitted there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that’s Sen. Marco Rubio."" Cue Sir Mix-a Lot: Now, we like checking campaign statements, and we cannot lie! But is this a charge Democrats just can’t deny? (Sorry, we just had to get that out of the way.) We should note we didn’t find any instance of Hillary Clinton saying she was afraid of Rubio or any other candidate, and her campaign did not return our requests for comment. That’s important to keep in mind, since the ad mentions her by name. Saying ""there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton"" implies her campaign is unconcerned with the rest of the GOP field, which likely is not the case. A November 2015 story from the Daily Beast included Democratic donors and strategists saying Clinton’s campaign was until recently more occupied with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and is now focusing on Rubio as Bush fades. Florida-based Republican media consultant Rick Wilson produced the ad and confirmed with PolitiFact Florida where each of the three lines featured in the commercial came from. Let’s take them one at a time: ""A Hillary Clinton match-up with Marco Rubio is a scary thought for Democrats."" — the New York Times: On May 22, 2015, the New York Times published an article about Democratic strategists discussing Rubio, who announced his candidacy in April. The commercial’s quote is the headline word for word. Every source in the story at least acknowledged Rubio was a candidate worth addressing, while some said he would be a tough opponent. That’s not to say Rubio is the only candidate they are worried about, which the ad comes close to implying, but the article highlighted his strengths in contrast to Hillary Clinton. For example, the New York Times piece said Clinton is working harder on winning the Hispanic vote. The story included comments from 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle; Democratic strategist Christopher Lehane; former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and his millionaire donor John Morgan; former Florida House Democratic leader Dan Gelber and more. Crist, who lost a Senate race to Rubio in 2010, called Rubio’s story of a blue-collar upbringing ""compelling,"" while Gelber said Rubio could make ""young women swoon, old women pass out, and toilets flush themselves."" The New York Times also interviewed Steve Schale, formerly Barack Obama’s Florida campaign director, who had written a blog post about the state’s Hispanic voters the same month the paper published its story. In that blog post, Schale wrote: ""Marco Rubio scares me. I’ve been pretty consistent on this one. If you are a Democrat, he should be the one you don’t want to face, because I do think, if he is the nominee, he is the one who could significantly change the Hispanic math in Florida and the Latino math out west. Why? I truly believe he will benefit from the same identity politics that galvanized African American voters behind Obama."" That brings us to the next piece of evidence ... ""Marco Rubio scares me … If you’re a Democrat, he should be the one you don’t want to face."" — Obama strategist to Cokie Roberts: This quote from Schale’s blog post appeared in one of Roberts’ syndicated columns with her husband, Steven. The headline on the column was ""Why Rubio scares the Democrats."" Now, we must note Schale didn’t say this to Roberts, as the PAC ad claims, and Schale told us he hadn’t spoken to her. She only quoted him and linked to his post. Roberts pointed to Rubio’s personality, storytelling ability and defense of his Hispanic heritage as strengths. ""Rubio is the best storyteller in the Republican field. The tales he tells — of his father the bartender and his mother the hotel maid — send a powerful message: I know what your lives are like. I'm just like you,"" Roberts wrote. That jibed with what Schale thought, and still does. ""I definitely did say I'm scared of Marco, and I still think he's our party's biggest threat,"" Schale told PolitiFact Florida. Keep in mind, however, that Schale worked for the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC to convince Vice President Joe Biden to run for president. He thinks Rubio is a threat not just to Hillary Clinton, but to any Democratic hopeful. ""I believe he is their strongest candidate,"" he said. ""Bill Clinton believes Marco Rubio is Hillary’s biggest threat."" — Fox News: The ad is referring to author Ed Klein’s Oct. 14, 2015, appearance on Fox & Friends. After the first Democratic primary debate, Fox interviewed Klein, who wrote the book Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary. During the segment, Klein described an anonymously sourced story from the book, in which Bill Clinton allegedly said Rubio was his wife’s greatest challenger because of Rubio’s age and appeal to Hispanic voters. (Fox News’ online headline was ""Author: Bill Clinton Believes This GOP Contender Is Hillary's Biggest Threat."") Klein’s description of the incident in his book quotes Bill Clinton thusly: ""He’s young, Hispanic, and a good speaker. He’d pose a generational challenge (to Hillary, who will turn 69 in 2016) and a challenge for the Hispanic vote, which we need to win…. We’ve got to destroy him before he gets off the ground."" The author previously had written very critical books about the Clintons and the Obamas, and has faced criticism from both liberal and conservative camps over thin sourcing and sensational allegations. Bill Clinton’s office told us it questioned Klein’s credibility, and therefore the claim. A Clinton spokesman called Klein’s version of events an ""alternate reality."" Baby Got PAC is putting a lot of faith in one anonymously sourced anecdote for its ad. The story also doesn’t constitute asking either Hillary or Bill Clinton directly whether they feel Rubio is a threat. But Klein insists the former president made the comment. ""I stand by the quote, which was related to me by a very reliable source who was in the room and heard Bill Clinton talk about Rubio,"" Klein told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Baby Got PAC’s ad said Democrats ""admitted there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that’s Sen. Marco Rubio."" There’s no actual statement from Hillary Clinton saying as much, so that part of the commercial is a stretch. The commercial does share some sources that quote Democratic politicians and operatives, and leans heavily on former Obama campaign director Schale, who wrote a blog post expressing some anxiety about Rubio. Schale, it’s worth noting, favored Biden over Hillary Clinton initially. Baby Got PAC further puts a lot of faith in an anecdote involving Bill Clinton that is largely unsubstantiated. With those caveats, it’s still clear Rubio’s campaign is a concern to strategists on the left. We rate the statement Half True.","[('Baby Got PAC, ""All We Need To Know,"" Nov. 10, 2015', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntsUy502_D4'), ('New York Post, ""Smear for profit,"" June 22, 2005', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Eine Kleine Biographie,"" June 23, 2005', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20060418220703/http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/48801.htm'), ('Politico, ""Ed Klein\'s Obama book debuts at #1 on Times list — knocks Caro to #2,"" May 24, 2012', 'No link'), ('Salon, ""Ed Klein’s new hack job: A credibility-vacant opportunist strikes again,"" March 16, 2015', 'https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122487008765067079'), ('Steve Schale, ""So What\'s New With Hispanics In Florida?,"" May 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""A Hillary Clinton Match-Up With Marco Rubio Is a Scary Thought for Democrats,"" May 22, 2015', 'http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/05/ed-kleins-obama-book-debuts-at-1-on-times-list-knocks-caro-to-2-124515'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Democratic Strategist Steve Schale Joins ‘Draft Biden’ Effort,"" Aug. 19, 2015', 'No link'), ('Fox News, ""Author: Bill Clinton Believes This GOP Contender Is Hillary\'s Biggest Threat,"" Oct. 14, 2015', 'http://www.salon.com/2015/03/16/ed_kleins_new_hack_job_a_credibility_vacant_opportunist_strikes_again/'), ('Cokie and Steven Roberts, ""Why Rubio Scares the Democrats,"" Oct. 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""Rubio gives up on Senate: ‘He hates it’,"" Oct. 25, 2015', 'https://steveschale.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/14/so-whats-new-with-hispanics-in-florida.html'), ('Edward Klein, ""Who Can Beat Hillary?,"" Nov. 10, 2015', 'No link'), ('Daily Beast, ""Marco Rubio Is Hillary Clinton’s New Enemy No. 1,"" Nov. 10, 2015', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/us/politics/prospect-of-hillary-clinton-marco-rubio-matchup-unnerves-democrats.html'), ('Politico, ""GOP millionaire launches pro-Rubio super PAC with new ad,"" Nov. 10, 2015', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""New Marco Rubio Backer Bankrolls Ad and Writes It, Too,"" Nov. 11, 2015', 'http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/19/democratic-strategist-steve-schale-joins-draft-biden-effort/'), ('Interview with Steve Schale, former Obama Florida state campaign director, Nov. 11, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview with Edward Klein, Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary author, Nov. 11, 2015', 'http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/10/14/author-ed-klein-bill-clinton-believes-marco-rubio-hillarys-biggest-threat'), ('Interview with Angel Urena, Bill Clinton spokesman, Nov. 11, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview with Rick Wilson, GOP media consultant, Nov. 12, 2015', 'http://www.uexpress.com/cokie-and-steven-roberts/2015/10/14/why-rubio-scares-the-democrats')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/16/baby-got-pac/democrats-clinton-campaign-afraid-rubio-new-super-/

McAuliffe says he 'inherited large deficit' and turned it into a record surplus
","It’s a rags-to-riches story that Gov. Terry McAuliffe loves to tell. ""When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit,"" McAuliffe, a Democrat, said during a Nov. 2 interview on MSNBC’s ""Hardball With Chris Matthews."" ""You know what? We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history."" He made similar statements during Aug. 26 and Oct. 28 interviews on WTOP radio in Washington and in a July 9 speech to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. And during a July 21 interview on WRVA radio in Richmond, McAuliffe added some details. ""I did announce a nice surplus the other day - $553 million,"" the governor said. ""I remind you, when I became governor I inherited a $2.4 billion deficit. It wasn’t my budget, I wasn’t even governor yet, and we worked in a bipartisan way to work that out."" We decided to fact-check McAuliffe’s claim, wondering how he could have inherited a deficit from his predecessor, Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, when the state constitution requires a balanced budget. We examined the two elements in the governor’s full statement: 1)  that he inherited a deficit and, 2) that it was turned into a record surplus. The inheritance Virginia has a two-year budget cycle. Prior to the start of the first year, the legislature approves and the governor signs a biennial plan. After that, the governor and lawmakers negotiate budget amendments based on the needs and finances at the time. The state constitution requires that total expenditures not exceed revenues at the end of the two-year period. McDonnell, in one of his last acts as governor, presented two budget bills to the General Assembly on Dec. 16, 2013. The first bill put his finishing touches on the outgoing two-year budget, set to expire June 30, 2014. The proposal, called the ""caboose budget,"" anticipated $35.4 billion in general fund revenues for the budget cycle and $34.9 billion in expenses. The second bill was McDonnell’s proposal for the coming two-year budget, which began July 1, 2014. He anticipated almost $37.8 billion in general revenues and proposed $37.7 billion in spending. In other words, when McAuliffe took office on Jan. 11, 2014, McDonnell left two balanced budget bills sitting on his desk. So why does McAuliffe say he ""inherited a large deficit?"" Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, noted that the state’s economy slowed that winter and spring, causing tax revenues to fall below expectation. The McDonnell administration ""left behind a budget that had a forecast that was too optimistic for our financial situation,"" he told us. ""They supported a spending threshold that was too high."" Does that mean McDonnell should have seen the economic slowdown coming? ""With the benefit of hindsight, some signs could have been detectable and some may have not,"" Coy said. The slowdown was caused by two factors: •Tax cuts ushered in by former President George W. Bush expired in 2013 and the capital gains tax rose. As a result, there was a surge of people cashing in capital assets before the new rates took effect, followed by a lull after the levy went up. The lull caused a steep decline in non-withholding tax receipts in Virginia in 2014.   •Federal spending cuts hurt Northern Virginia, the state’s largest economic engine. McAuliffe sensed the problems shortly after taking office, but he underestimated their severity. On Feb. 12, 2014, he reduced the revenue estimate in the coming two-year budget McDonnell proposed by $140 million. ""Although our underlying economic forecast has not changed,"" McAuliffe said, ""it is clear that the current revenue receipts warrant attention."" In May, the shortfall exploded to an estimated $1.5 billion. The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by making about $800 million in spending cuts and drawing $700 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Seven months into his term, on Aug.15, 2014, McAuliffe estimated the shortfall at $2.4 billion and ordered additional cuts to keep the new two-year budget balanced. In a speech to the General Assembly’s money committees, the governor said that out of caution, his forecast was deliberately ""pessimistic."" The surplus The second part of McAuliffe’s statement is that the shortfall was ""turned"" into the ""largest surplus in Virginia history."" That stems from McAuliffe’s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. The figure slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year that ended in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990.  But it should be noted that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest. Some people hearing McAuliffe’s statement might conclude that Virginia’s budget has made almost a $3 billion rebound during the last year - from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. That’s not the case. McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state’s economic problems in August 2014 when they adjusted the two-year budget to a ""pessimistic"" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe cites. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. … We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history."" The simple fact is that McAuliffe inherited balanced budget proposals from McDonnell. Perhaps, as the governor’s spokesman suggests, McDonnell should have seen approaching clouds and proposed a more conservative spending plan. But that’s hindsight and financial projections are tricky. When McAuliffe sensed an economic slowdown during his first weeks in office, he made a modest $140 million cut to McDonnell’s revenue forecast. Six months later, McAuliffe was projecting a $2.4 billion shortfall. McAuliffe is hardly the first governor to accuse his predecessor of leaving behind a financial mess. But evidence shows the brunt of the economic slowdown, though not McAuliffe’s fault, occurred during his watch. This year’s $550 million surplus is a state record in terms of raw dollars, although not in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the surplus does not mean there’s been a record turnaround in Virginia’s economy. It means that the revenue shortfall is turning out not to be as steep as projected in 2014. On the whole, we rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.","[('Gov.

What Barack Obama said about ISIS being contained
","Last week, President Barack Obama said the Islamic State is ""contained"" -- a comment that has been scrutinized in the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris that have been attributed to the terrorist group. But has Obama’s comment been taken out of context? ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos presented White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes with a list of politicians criticizing Obama for his Nov. 12 remarks. Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said Obama sees the world ""as a fantasy."" Rhodes said Obama was talking about a particular aspect of containment that in no way dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks in the West. ""The president was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria,"" Rhodes said, using another acronym for the group. ""A year ago, we saw them on the march in Iraq and Syria, taking more and more population centers. The fact is that we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria. At the same time, that does not diminish the fact that there is a threat posed by ISIL, not just in those countries but in their aspirations to project power overseas."" This reminded us of a prior fact-check, when Obama said he didn’t specifically describe ISIS as a ""JV team"" -- a statement we rated False because he was clearly talking about the Islamic State at the time. We decided to look back at Obama’s comments on containing ISIS to see his comments in their complete context. Rewind In the context of Obama’s Nov. 12 interview with Stephanopoulos -- the day before the Paris attacks -- it’s actually quite clear that when he says ISIS is contained, he is talking about ISIS’s territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq. Here are the relevant parts of the interview: Stephanopoulos: ""Some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like Fareed Zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough. Every couple of months you're going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down."" Obama: ""I think what is true is that this has always been a multiyear project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak, and there are none in Syria. And we don't have ground forces there in sufficient numbers to simply march into Al-Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out. And as a consequence, we've always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISIL's capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as we're putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance."" Stephanopoulos: ""And that's the strategy you've been following. But ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?"" Obama: ""Well, no, I don't think they're gaining strength. What is true is that from the start, our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria they'll come in, they'll leave. But you don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain. What we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures. We've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters."" When Obama said ""we have contained them,"" it’s within a plainly defined scope: ISIS’s territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. This context is bolstered by the fact that Stephanopoulos asks Obama about the ground efforts in those two countries. He wasn’t saying, as critics have shorthanded, that ISIS no longer presents a threat -- an assertion that the Paris attacks would have negated. In fact, in the same interview, Obama acknowledged that ISIS might have surpassed al-Qaida as the greatest terror threat in the world, adding that they are constantly looking for ""a crack in the system"" to exploit to carry out attacks. ""I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel,"" Obama said. Is ISIS contained in Iraq and Syria? The region Obama refers to is significant because it’s the epicenter of ISIS’s caliphate. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said Obama is accurate when he says ISIS hasn’t gained territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, though it does not give a full picture of ISIS’s global reach. ""It’s a choice of words that isn’t great, but what he is referring to -- as opposed to the way people have interpreted it -- is correct,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. While ISIS has captured a couple towns in the past few months, it has ultimately lost roughly a quarter of its Iraq and Syria territory overall. A good portion of the losses resulted from United States airstrikes but also from fighting with Iraqi forces and regional groups, Gartenstein-Ross said. This is a far cry from a year ago, when there was serious concern that ISIS would capture Baghdad. But even though they haven’t expanded territorially recently, ISIS continues to counterattack anti-ISIS forces in the region, noted Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. He added that ISIS has actually expanded globally -- with strongholds and cells in Libya, Yemen, the Sinai region, and Bangladesh, as well as establishing ties with other terrorist organizations in Africa. This November map from the Institute for the Study of War shows where ISIS has ties. The stars indicate where ISIS has a remote ""governorate.""  And, as we know from the Paris attacks, ISIS is able to flex their muscle in the West, too. ""They are being contained geographically by traditional military but they are leapfrogging over it using terrorism,"" said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. He added that Obama used ""your grandfather’s notion of containment."" Our ruling Rhodes said that when Obama said ISIS was contained, he ""was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria."" Looking back at Obama’s interview where he made this comment, it is quite clear that it’s within a narrowly defined scope: ISIS’s territorial expansion in Iraq and Syria. He did not rule out the potential for a terrorist attack, and he also made it clear that the United States’ anti-ISIS efforts are a work in progress.

Jeb Bush: 'It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States'
","A Syrian passport found on the body of a dead suicide bomber in the Paris attacks has prompted some to question President Barack Obama’s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees. Obama’s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes noted on Nov. 15’s Fox News Sunday that there are ""very robust vetting procedures for those refugees"" and said the administration will still continue to take them. But that’s ""untrue"" and, in fact, ""there’s virtually no vetting,"" according to Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who chairs the House Subcommittee on Terrorism. Elsewhere on the airwaves, Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush suggested that the vetting process was at least enough to distinguish between Christians — whom the United States should focus on, according to Bush — and everyone else fleeing Syria. ""It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States,"" Bush noted on CNN’s State of the Union. We were curious if that’s how long the refugee vetting process takes. We found that Bush is actually understating the duration, especially for those from Syria and other countries where terrorism is a concern. Let’s begin with an overview of the refugee admissions process. Before a refugee even faces U.S. vetting, he or she must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — or occasionally a U.S. embassy or another NGO — determines which refugees (about 1 percent) should be resettled through its own process, which can take four to 10 months. As we noted in a previous fact-check, once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee undergoes a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, ""cultural orientation"" classes, and one final security clearance. This all happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil. Karen Jacobsen, the director of the Refugee and Forced Migration Program at Tufts University noted that this intensive vetting process as well as U.S law on refugees and asylum seekers ""makes it difficult to quickly admit large numbers of refugees."" So how long does it take? Worldwide, about a year to 18 months, according to a State Department fact-sheet cited by the Bush campaign. A different page on the State Department website estimates an average time of 18 to 24 months. For refugees from Syria and similar countries, however, the process can span two years, a spokesperson for the State Department told the Voice of America in September. Experts confirmed that two years is the average review duration for Syrian refugees, which means that some wait even longer. ""It can actually take almost three years. (Bush) is being optimistic,"" said Lavinia Limón, the president of the advocacy group, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. ""The process for refugees is the most extensive security screening we have for visitors. It’s easier to come in as a tourist, a student, a businessman."" Even if they weren’t from countries where terrorism was a concern, refugees would be ""lucky"" if the process took less than a year, Limón said. She pointed out that since the refugee program for Central American minors was established a year ago, the United States has yet to admit one child. The length and thoroughness of the U.S. vetting system sets it apart from the ""chaotic, dangerous process"" for refugees fleeing into Europe by sea, said Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA. Refugees enter European countries as asylum seekers and are granted access into the country without a thorough vetting from the UN. Scrutiny comes later. ""No vetting process can make guarantees, but the population identified by the UN and vetted by both organizations has worked successfully in alleviating crises in dozens of other countries, including Iraq, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and the Central African Republic,"" Mock said. ""There’s no reason to believe Syria will be any different."" In other words, the process for admitting a Syrian asylum seeker into France is much simpler than the process for resettling a Syrian refugee into the United States. ""The U.S. refugee program is incredibly controlled. You can be 99.9 percent sure that guy wouldn’t have gotten here,"" Limón said. ""I understand the kneejerk reaction but you’re painting a very broad brush stroke. Refugees, by definition, are fleeing terrorism. What happened in Paris, they’ve experienced. They’ve seen family members slaughtered and their houses burnt and they’re running for their lives."" Our ruling Bush said, ""It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States."" Bush actually gave the low estimate for how long the refugee admissions process takes. The worldwide average is between a year to a year and a half. For Syrian refugees, it takes two years on average. Bush’s overall point is correct, and his estimate is in the ballpark if even low. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('CNN, State of the Union, Nov. 15, 2015', 'http://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/factsheets/2013/210135.htm'), ('Fox News, Fox News Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Matt Gorman, spokesperson for Jeb Bush, Nov. 15, 2015', 'http://www.state.gov/j/prm/ra/admissions/index.htm'), ('Email interview with Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International, Nov. 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Karen Jacobsen, professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, Nov. 15, 2015', 'http://www.unhcr.org/3bd58ce9a.html'), ('Interview with, Lavinia Limón, the president of the advocacy group, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Nov. 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('State Department, ""U.S. Refugee Admissions Program FAQs,"" May 31, 2013', 'http://info.unhcr.org.tr/faq.php?lang=1'), ('State Department, ""U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,"" accessed Nov. 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ""Resettlement Flow Chart,"" accessed Nov. 15, 2015', 'http://www.rcusa.org/uploads/pdfs/Refugee%20resettlement%20-%20step%20by%20step%20USCRI.pdf'), ('United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ""Frequently Asked Questions,"" accessed Nov. 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('Refugee Council USA ""Security Screening of Refugees Admitted to the United States,"" accessed Nov. 15, 2015', 'http://www.voanews.com/content/united-states-boosts-efforts-help-syrian-refugees/2946644.html'), ('Voice of America, ""US Boosts Efforts to Help Syrian Refugees,"" Sept. 3, 2015', 'No link'), ('Quartz, ""It takes the US two years to process a refugee application from Syria,"" Sept. 4, 2015', 'http://qz.com/495797/it-takes-the-us-two-years-to-process-a-refugee-application-from-syria/'), ('U.S. News & World Report, ""Why the U.S. Can\'t Immediately Resettle Syrian Refugees,"" Sept. 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Donald Trump says if you\'re from Syria and a Christian, you can\'t come to the U.S. as a refugee,"" July 20, 2015', 'https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/09/15/why-the-us-cant-immediately-resettle-syrian-refugees')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-it-takes-almost-year-refugee-be-processed/

Sanders: 'Significantly less than 10%' of defense dollars go to fight terrorism
","The Paris terror attacks put foreign policy front and center at the Democratic debate in Iowa. Each of the three candidates urged their own form of a robust response. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., underscored the need to rethink how the nation spends its counterterrorism dollars. ""This nation is the most powerful military in the world,"" Sanders said. ""We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military. And yet significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to fight international terrorism."" We decided to explore that ""less than 10 percent"" figure. The Sanders campaign told us that Sanders was talking about the budget to fight the Islamic State group, otherwise known as ISIS or ISIL. ""The president's request for the war on Islamic State group was just $5.3 billion for next year, or less than 10 percent of the war budget,"" spokesman Warren Gunnels said.  But international terrorism is broader than the specific fight against ISIS. The Defense Department includes its operations in Afghanistan as part of the fight against terrorism. The 2015 Defense Department budget puts total spending at $560 billion, of which the Pentagon says about$60 billion went toward operations aimed at combatting terrorism. That’s nearly 11 percent of the military budget. Almost all of that money, about $55 billion, was spent in Afghanistan ""with a focus on training, advising, and assisting the Afghan forces and carrying out counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda in coordination with Afghan forces,"" as the Pentagon budget writers put it in their 2016 budget request. The remainder went toward fighting the Islamic State group, otherwise known as ISIS. We should note that the country spends billions more to fight terrorism, but those dollars show up outside the military budget. The FBI’s Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Decision Unit spent about $3.3 billion in 2015. We don’t know how much was spent by the CIA and the National Security Agency. However, in 2013, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden pointed to over $16 billion in spending to combat terrorism. If we add in those amounts, then the total rises to well above Sanders’ figure. However, his comparison was solely in the context of defense spending. Brian Finlay is the president of the Stimson Center, a defense policy group in Washington. Finlay told us that Sanders’ focus on the direct attacks unleashed on ISIS misses a great deal of the action. More subtle operations through the Defense and State departments ""undercut the rationale for terrorism, erode their wherewithal to undertake operations, or otherwise prevent incidents from occurring,"" Finlay said. ""This side of counterterrorism operations is every bit as important as the ‘bang bang’ response."" Our ruling Sanders said that the country devotes ""significantly less than 10 percent"" of its military budget to fight international terrorism. A campaign spokesman told us that Sanders was only counting money spent against ISIS. However, according to the Defense Department budget, it spent a combined total of $60 billion on anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and in the battle with ISIS. This amounts to nearly 11 percent of total defense dollars, not significantly less as Sanders said. While you could argue that not all of the money going toward operations in Afghanistan is precisely aimed at counterterrorism, it is a great stretch to say that none of it should be counted. Sanders used an overly restricted definition that also ignores that a hefty amount of counterterrorism spending takes place outside of the Defense Department. We rate his statement Mostly False.","[('CBS News, Democratic debate - Iowa, Nov. 14, 2015', 'http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=468d5dc43334640650b81443f&id=5a63807399&e=6d7cef570b'), ('U.S. Defense Department, Fiscal Year 2016 budget request, March 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. Justice Department - FBI, FY 2016 Authorization and Budget Request to Congress, Feb.2, 2015', 'http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2016/FY2016_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf'), ('Pew Research Center, U.S. spends over $16 billion annually on counter-terrorism, Sept. 11, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. News and World Report, An Indefensible Budget Deal, Oct.27, 2015', 'https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/pages/attachments/2015/02/02/24._federal_bureau_of_investigation_fbi.pdf'), ('Email interview, Brian Finlay, president, Stimson Center, Nov. 14, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/sanders-significantly-less-10-defense-dollars-go-f/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says U.S. is only major country that doesn't guarantee health care as a right
","During the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Bernie Sanders returned to a health-care talking point that he has used often. In fact, he made it more than once in the debate. ""I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege,"" Sanders said. This is virtually identical to a statement by Sanders that we checked in June 2015. We’ll recap our research here. When we looked at the claim before, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, said the senator was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We’re not sure Sanders made that entirely clear (for instance the OECD doesn’t include China or Russia, which many people would consider a major country), but we’ll put that aside for the moment. Briggs directed us to a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lacking universal health care coverage. ""However, Mexico passed a law in 2004 with the goal of establishing universal coverage, and they're currently at 90 percent,"" Briggs said. ""The ACA was never intended to establish universal coverage, and according to the January CBO estimate, 90 percent is about as good as it's going to get."" We checked and Briggs is close on his numbers. In Mexico, as of 2013, public insurance reached about 86.7 percent of the people. That’s actually not much different from where America stood, if you combine public and private coverage. The figure in the United States was 84.9 percent. However, in 2015, the CBO estimated that 89 percent of American residents -- excluding undocumented immigrants -- have coverage. The number drops to 87 percent if you include undocumented residents. The median income in Mexico is so low -- about a third of that in the United States -- that some would not group it with the stronger OECD countries. But since Sanders’ spokesman included it, we thought it only fair to include it, too.   Beyond the raw numbers, Sanders’ statement highlights the tricky questions that come up when you start talking about a right to health care. Is it defined as universal coverage, or a legal right to care? The two are not identical. The gold standard Europe covers both bases. Nearly every European nation has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. That treaty’s section on health care casts coverage as a right. ""The system of health care must be accessible to the entire population. To that end, states should take as their main criterion for judging the success of health system reforms effective access to health care for all, without discrimination, as a basic human right."" Countries follow different paths to make good on that promise. Great Britain has its national health service where the government runs the hospitals and pays the doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complicated mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in America, a law that makes insurance mandatory for everyone. Those European nations score 100 when it comes to universal coverage. But so does Australia, and Australia operates under no legal claim that health care is a right. The government’s Attorney General’s Department posted on its website ""there is no Commonwealth legislation explicitly enshrining the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."" That doesn’t stop the Aussies from running an extensive system of public hospitals and a robust public health insurance program. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and it too lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a substantial body of Japanese health care law, but it has to do with creating various government programs and setting the rules of the game. A weak guarantee There are several international treaties and conventions that speak of the obligation of countries to provide for the health of their residents. The list includes the World Health Organization constitution and the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States signed and ratified the former, but it is literally one of a handful of countries that has not ratified the latter. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a landmark document that comes very close to asserting health care as a right. The treaty’s language is ambitious. It speaks of ""the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."" Countries that get behind it promise that they will aim to create the ""conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness."" But the convention’s legal heft is considerably less than its stated goals. It pushes no country to spend beyond its ""available resources,"" a quantity that could be whatever the leaders say it is. Lawrence Gostin is the director of Georgetown University’s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Gostin said the convention lacks teeth. ""These international obligations are vague and unenforceable so really don’t translate into a ‘right’ in all states,"" Gostin said. For Gostin, the test of a nation’s commitment should be measured by the facts on the ground. ""Does it provide even reasonably fair access to the entire population, and is there a way to enforce or implement the right?"" Gostin said. ""By those measures, the U.S. has many entitlements to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes there are many left out, but that is true in lots of countries, including China that provides a minuscule amount of health dollars to rural residents."" Whether China is an industrialized country of the sort Sanders mentioned is a matter of debate, but China helps illustrate the difference between a right in law and a right in practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On top of that, its Constitution commits the state to provide health services and facilities ""all for the protection of the people's health."" But the record of the world’s most populous nation is checkered to say the least. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy group, has written about the evolution of health care in China. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Blumenthal wrote that about 95 percent of the population has access to modest coverage. ""The government has decided to provide all Chinese some protection against the cost of illness, not necessarily as a matter of right, but as a matter of fact,"" Blumenthal told PolitiFact. Ake Blomqvist, a health care economist at Carleton University in Canada, has a dimmer view of the connection between China’s legal promises and what it delivers. China might have signed that UN convention but that has had limited effect. ""In reality the majority of people in China are at risk of not being able to receive even urgently needed health care if they are unlucky enough to require something that is expensive,"" Blomqvist said. A spokesman for Sanders, Warren Gunnels, told PolitiFact after the debate that Japan and Australia have created the right in practice even if it doesn't exist in law. He added that the Commonwealth Fund ranks the United States last in health care access among seven major nations. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn’t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America -- with the possible exception of Mexico -- stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. The question of a guaranteed right to health care is murkier. Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy has it. In reality, some do and some don’t. We rate the claim Half True.","[('PolitiFact, ""Bernie Sanders: U.S. \'only major country\' that doesn\'t guarantee right to health care,"" June 29, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-us-only-major-country-doesnt-guaran/'), ('Email interview with Warren Gunnels, spokesman for Bernie Sanders, Nov. 15, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-us-only-major-country-doesnt-g/

Income tax rates were 90 percent under Eisenhower, Sanders says
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wouldn’t reveal just how high he’d raise income taxes on the rich during the Iowa presidential debate, but he guaranteed it wouldn’t be as much as it has been in the past. In order to pay for making college tuition-free for Americans, Sanders said that Wall Street owed the middle class for bailing it out during the recent financial crisis. He said he would demand ""that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share."" ""Well, let’s get specific, how high would you go?"" CBS News moderator Nancy Cordes asked. ""You’ve said before you’d go above 50 percent. How high?"" ""We haven’t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent,"" Sanders answered. Was the top income tax rate under Eisenhower an astronomical 90 percent? We decided to check the ledgers on that figure. Before we go further, let’s review what the marginal tax rate means. It’s the tax rate that’s applied to the last dollar earned. The U.S. tax system is based on brackets. The top marginal tax rate applies to the highest bracket. Income is taxed at higher rates as more is earned. We turned to the Tax Foundation’s federal income tax rates history, which documents figures going all the way back to 1913, when the income tax began with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. During the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, from 1953 to 1961, the top marginal rate was 91 percent. (It was 92 percent the year he came into office.) What does it mean, though? For the duration of Eisenhower’s presidency, that rate affected individuals making $200,000 or more per year or couples making $400,000 and above per year. In 2015 dollars, that's roughly $1.7 million for an individual and $3.4 million for a couple. Today the tax brackets are adjusted for inflation, but are exceptionally lower than in Eisenhower’s day. The top rate in 2015 is 39.6 percent, applied to single people making $413,200 or more per year, or married couples filing jointly making $464,850 or more annually. If we went back to 1954, single people making the equivalent of $413,200 would be in a 72 percent tax bracket, while a couple making $464,850 would end up in a 75 percent bracket. What’s the highest income tax bracket ever put in place? In 1944-45, during World War II, couples making more than $200,000 faced an all-time high of 94 percent. Our ruling Sanders said income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent. A look through the records shows that top earners in the eight years of Eisenhower’s presidency paid a top income tax rate of 91 percent. It was even a bit higher before he took office. We rate Sanders’ statement True.","[('CBS News, ""Democratic debate: Bernie Sanders really isn\'t as ""socialist"" as President Eisenhower,"" Nov. 14, 2015', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-really-isnt-as-socialist-as-president-eisenhower/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Barack Obama says taxes are lower today than under Reagan, Eisenhower,"" Sept. 22, 2010', 'No link'), ('Tax Foundation, 2015 tax brackets, Oct. 2, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-taxes-are-lower-today-under-reag/'), ('Tax Foundation, historical table of individual income tax rates, accessed Nov. 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, historical inflation calculator, accessed Nov. 14, 2015', 'http://taxfoundation.org/article/2015-tax-brackets')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/income-tax-rates-were-90-percent-under-eisenhower-/

Pete Gallego says Will Hurd votes with House Republican leaders
","The next contest for the U.S. House seat representing Texas’ 23rd District is still a year away, but already incumbent Rep. Will Hurd is a target. Pete Gallego, an Alpine Democrat who represented the district before losing his seat to Hurd by a narrow margin in 2014, went on the attack, telling the Texas Tribune, ""One of my biggest disappointments in watching Will is that Will tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record. He’s a follower."" In much of Texas, loyalty to the GOP is hardly a liability. But the situation is a little more complicated in the 23rd, a swing district in the state, and the only one expected to see a real contest in the 2016 general election. Following a 2003 Republican redistricting that found the district be in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Supreme Court ordered the district to be re-drawn in 2006. Minority rights and civil rights groups have challenged a most recent 2011 Republican redistricting for congressional seats, claiming lines drawn in the 23rd dilute minority voting strength. The district stretches west from San Antonio almost to El Paso, incorporating a large swath of Texas’ border with Mexico. The competitive nature of the district has resulted in three representatives in as many election cycles. The non-partisan Congressional Quarterly and the Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report have both identified Hurd’s seat as one of the top 10 ""toss-up"" House seats up for grabs in 2016. In other words, the 23rd is a district in which blind partisanship could conceivably be an impediment to re-election. We were curious whether the 96 percent figure Gallego cited was literally true, or just hyperbole — and whether that number is unusually high — so we took a closer look at Hurd’s voting record. Anthony Gutierrez, the communications representative for Gallego, confirmed that the 96 percent figure was pulled from Hurd’s score by CQ Roll Call. The week Gallego’s comments were made, the number calculated by CQ was actually 96.4 percent, to be exact, although the number fluctuates constantly because it is based on numbers from the current legislative session. As of Nov. 6, 2015, it had fallen to 95.6 percent. It’s also important to put these numbers in context. During his term, Hurd has voted with the party a greater percentage of the time than the Republican average across the House over the same time period, 93.6 percent, but he diverges more often than 17 of his 24 fellow Texas Republicans, a group that has voted with the party an average of 97.4 percent of the time in party unity votes during the 114th Congress. Based on voting in the current legislative session, five of the 10 most party-loyal Republicans in the House are from Texas. Hurd was not among them. Across the aisle, the 11 Texas Democrats in the House have voted with their party 89.6 percent of the time during the 114th Congress, 92.1 percent of the time on party unity votes. If you average the percentage of the time each has voted with their party considering all terms, not just the current one, that number comes up to 92.6 percent. The spread in their voting records is also much bigger compared with the Texas GOP. The most loyal voter, the 35th District’s Lloyd Doggett, has voted with the Democrats 97.9 percent of the time in party unity votes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 28th’s Henry Cuellar sides with the party in only 69.5 percent party unity votes votes.  While it’s not strictly relevant to the truth value of Gallego’s claim about Hurd, all this begs the question of Gallego’s own voting record during his tenure in the House. During Gallego’s time in Congress, he voted with his party 81 percent of the time, according to Open Congress voting records. Of course, this number can’t be directly compared with the 89.6 percent average mentioned above for Texas Democrats in the House, because that figure is for the current session, not the one Gallego served. In the interest of comparing apples to apples, we calculated how frequently Gallego’s fellow Texas Democrats in the House voted with their party during his term. The average came out to a slightly more modest 86.2 percent. Gallego was the only one-term Democratic representative from Texas in the 113th Congress, which means that for every other representative, we can compare the percentage of the time they voted with the party during that term to the percentage of the time they voted with the party in all votes over the course of their multi-term career. If we do that, we see that all but one broke with the party more often than average that term.  So while Gallego still broke with the party more often than average, it was a Congress in which Texas Democrats in general voted with the party less consistently than usual. Responding by email, Hurd’s campaign manager Justin Hollis did not dispute the voting record. He leveled his own criticism of Gallego.  ""It took Pete Gallego losing in 2014 to finally become interested in the legislative process."" It’s worth keeping in mind that since CQ and Open Congress data don’t weigh votes by importance, the numbers don’t tell the full story as far as whether a representative’s votes against the party are on substantive issues or minor procedural matters. But then again, Gallego never claimed to have the full story. Our ruling Pete Gallego said Will Hurd ""tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record."" At the time of the statement, Pete Gallego’s claim and the percentage were consistent with Hurd’s voting record. We rate this claim True.

Sen. Ted Cruz says the Democratic Party is shrinking
","After the first Democratic presidential debate Oct. 13, 2015, Texas Republican Ted Cruz interpreted the crowd’s cheers for proposals to raise taxes as a reason for the decline of the Democratic Party. The day after the debate, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly asked Cruz how he could appeal for votes from Americans cheering on Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic nomination, who has stressed how much more the very wealthiest Americans have than the rest of us. ""Well,"" Cruz replied, ""it's why the modern Democratic Party is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. What does it say that they're having a hard time finding anyone to run for president who isn't nearly 207 years old? You're not getting new and fresh ideas."" Ahem: Sanders is 74; fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is 68. And while we’re not going to gauge how Cruz appeals for more Democratic support, we did wonder if the Democratic Party is shrinking, as Cruz said. Cruz’s campaign spokesman said Cruz based his statement on the losses the Democratic Party suffered in recent elections. ""Cruz is referring to all the Senate seats, House seats, governors and state legislative seats lost during this administration,"" said Rick Tyler, Cruz for President’s national spokesman. Democrats losing steam under Obama? Measuring the exact membership or size of either national party is difficult. Some states, including Texas, do not require voters to register with any party. As University of Texas-Austin government professor Brian Roberts, who studies American political institutions and interest groups, told us, there’s ""no easy answer."" But certain measures can give a relative sense of party size, despite variations in registration rules. University of Texas-Austin government professor Sean Theriault, who studies congressional decision-making and has published books on the power of the electorate and party polarization. He suggested three measurements for evaluating the size and strength of political parties: the party in the government, the party in the electorate and party organizations. The first component we looked at was the Democrats’ total electoral seats. That is what Cruz’s campaign spokesman said Cruz was referring to in his comment. During Obama’s administration, Democrats have lost 13 U.S. Senate seats, 69 House seats, 11 governorships, and 910 state legislative seats. Another way to look at a party's health is the number of voters who claim affiliation. Based on this data, the Democratic Party’s support in the electorate fluctuates, but generally is stable. A Gallup poll measuring trends in party identification since 2004 found that 29 percent of Americans identified as Democrats in October 2015. In January 2004, when the poll data begins, 28 percent of Americans identified as Democrats. The 11-year high was 38 percent in March 2008 and March 2009. The poll asks respondents, ""As of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent?"" For comparison, in October 2015, 25 percent of Americans identified as Republicans, and 42 percent identified as independents. Support for the Republican Party hit a high of 39 percent in September 2004. Each party’s voter demographics also suggest changes in size ahead. According to a 2014 Pew Research Center study, 51 percent of Millennials identified as Democrats in 2014, compared to their Republican peers’ 35 percent — the highest margin of any generation. The Democratic Party also claims more members among Generation X and Baby Boomer voters, by smaller margins. The only demographic in which Republicans have the advantage is the Silent Generation, with 47 percent identifying with the Republican Party, compared to 43 percent with the Democratic Party. That the country’s oldest voters are the only ones to lean Republican and that its youngest voters lean Democrat by a strong margin suggests growth for the Democratic Party, while the Republican Party’s strongest demographics are aging out. Party organizations, and their success in fundraising, are also a component of a political party’s health or size. In the 2010 off-year election cycle, the national Democratic Party raised $817.5 million. In the 2014 election cycle, the most recent available, the party raised $855 million, which suggests an increase of $37.5 million in the 2014 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Factoring in funds raised through the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other party organizations, Theriault said, ""the Democratic Party ""is getting bigger and is bigger than the Republican Party."" For comparison, the Republican Party raised $586,978,840 in 2010 and $665,608,564 in 2014. Our ruling Cruz said that the ""Democratic Party is getting smaller and smaller and smaller."" Democrats have lost a significant number of seats and federal and state offices throughout the Obama administration. The party as a whole, however, is stable or has grown both in terms of the electorate and its party organizations. Cruz’s claim is partly accurate, but leaves out important context about the Democratic Party beyond its elected officials. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
