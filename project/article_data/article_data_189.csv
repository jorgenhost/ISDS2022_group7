U.S. Constitution is not explicit on the right to vote, Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan says
","
There was news out of the U.S. Capitol on May 13, 2013 that U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, proposed to amend the Constitution to ... 
Guarantee the right to vote. 
Wait, what? 
Pocan hasn't been in Congress even half a year. But he knows we have the right to vote, doesn’t he? 
In presenting his bill, which is co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., Pocan said he wanted to make it more difficult for states to impose rules on voting, such as having to present a photo identification in order to cast a ballot. We won’t take up here what impact their proposed amendment might have. 
But Pocan gave us pause when he said on the House floor: 
The right to vote ""is so fundamental that most Americans, understandably, assume it is already enshrined in the Constitution"" -- but ""most Americans would be wrong."" 
""While the right to vote is inherent throughout our founding document, and there are amendments prohibiting discrimination, nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote. We, as Americans, possess no affirmative right to vote."" 
Words matter, and Pocan’s claim -- that ""nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote"" -- is precisely worded. 
Still, is he right? 
Pocan's evidence 
When we asked Pocan for evidence to back his statement, he told us to go read the Constitution. 
Just kidding. 
But we did wonder how he would try to prove that something doesn't exist. 
The existence of the 15th, 19th and 26th amendments, which prohibit discrimination based on race, gender and age, implies there is no explicit right to vote in the Constitution, Pocan spokesman Samuel Lau told us. 
He also cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bush v. Gore, which effectively resolved the razor-thin 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore. 
""The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote,"" the high court observed, according to Lau. 
But that was only the first part of the quote -- the rest is: ""for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College."" 
In other words, the Supreme Court declared that the Constitution contains no right to vote for president, Alexander Keyssar, professor of history and social policy at Harvard University, told us. 
That’s OK as far as it goes; let’s go further. 
Other evidence 
A number of other authorities who back an amendment like the one Pocan proposes have cited the lack of the guarantee he cites: 
-- Keyssar, author of The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States, told us: ""The basic fact is there is no affirmative right to vote in the U.S. Constitution. Never was."" 
-- FairVote, which seeks to reform elections, says that while constitutional amendments prohibit discrimination based on race, sex and age, ""no affirmative right to vote exists."" 
-- In a 2012 piece for Salon.com, Yale law professor Heather Gerken wrote: ""The Constitution does not guarantee Americans the right to vote. That always comes as a surprise to non-lawyers."" 
-- In 2006, University of Baltimore law professor Garrett Epps, critical of photo ID requirements, made almost the same statement Pocan did, saying: ""The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly guarantee a right to vote."" 
But what do other constitutional scholars say? 
Judith Best, distinguished teaching professor of political science at State University of New York-Cortland, told us the key phrase in Pocan’s claim is ""explicitly guarantees."" 
""It seems clear to me that the obvious intent"" of the Constitution, she said, ""is that the people are to choose their governments -- their representatives."" 
Similarly, Roger Pilon at the libertarian Cato Institute -- who doubts Pocan’s amendment would have much impact, if adopted -- told us that amendments to the Constitution make it clear there is a right to vote. 
""It’s so implicit as to be all but explicit,"" he said. 
But intending or implying aren’t quite the same as an explicit guarantee. And in Pocan's opinion, an explicit guarantee would make it more difficult to put restrictions on voting. 
We’ll leave the final word to scholar Hans von Spakovsky of the conservative Heritage Foundation and author of Who’s Counting?: How Fraudsters and Bureaucrats Put Your Vote at Risk. 
""It is correct that there is not an explicit provision in the Constitution guaranteeing the right to vote,"" he said, ""but several amendments guarantee the right to vote at age 18, free of racial discrimination, and protected by the Equal Protection doctrine."" 
Our rating 
Acknowledging that the right to vote is inherent in the Constitution, Pocan nevertheless called for amending the document and declared: ""Nothing in the Constitution explicitly guarantees our right to vote."" 
Whether adding such a guarantee would have much impact is debatable. But Pocan’s narrowly constructed claim is accurately stated. 
We rate it True.",/factchecks/2013/may/30/mark-pocan/us-constitution-not-explicit-right-vote-wisconsin-/

Steve King says Ronald Reagan’s 1986 ""amnesty act"" led to 15 million votes for Barack Obama
","
During a House floor speech, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, expressed frustration that one of his conservative heroes, President Ronald Reagan, had signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, a 1986 law that gave legal status to many illegal immigrants who were then residing in the United States. King is a leading congressional critic of efforts to legalize undocumented immigrants. 
""Ronald Reagan’s signature on the 1986 amnesty act brought about Barack Obama’s election,"" King said in the May 23, 2013, speech. 
King’s point was that a side effect of the 1986 law was to boost the numbers of Hispanic voters -- so many Hispanics were made legal by the law, he argues, that the number exceeded Obama’s margin of victory. 
In his speech, King didn’t say explicitly whether he meant Obama’s initial victory in 2008 or his 2012 re-election, but he did refer to the election in which Hispanics supported Obama by a 71 percent margin, which was the percentage in 2012. So we will look at the 2012 contest. In addition, we will look at Obama’s raw-vote margin, since King didn’t mention in his speech that he was referring to Obama’s margin in the Electoral College, and his office didn’t offer that as an argument when we conferred with them as we reported this story. 
King laid out a clear mathematical roadmap in his speech. 
King said that 3 million people ""received amnesty"" under the 1986 law. To that number, he added an additional five people for each newly legalized person, to reflect those legalized under family reunification policies. That means an additional 15 million people. If 71 percent of the combined 18 million Americans voted for Obama, King argued, then Obama benefited from nearly 13 million votes due to the act -- a number that’s a lot bigger than his margin over Mitt Romney of 4.7 million votes. The gap is large enough to cushion any decline due to deaths and departures among 1986 amnesty recipients, something King suggested was a reasonable adjustment to make. 
""Ronald Reagan’s signature on the 1986 amnesty act brought about Barack Obama’s election,"" King said. ""If ... we take 15 million people out of the rolls and say they wouldn’t have been here without the 1986 amnesty act, or at least they wouldn’t be voting, and if 71 percent of them voted for Barack Obama, then it’s clear to anybody that can do any kind of statistical analysis that Barack Obama wouldn’t be President of the United States without Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty act."" 
So, case closed? No. 
After sifting the data and checking with experts in immigration, demography and voting, we find King’s estimate too high. 
This is an oversimplification on several fronts. For starters, King didn’t account for the fact that many of the newly legal residents did not become citizens, and thus never earned the right to cast a vote. He also didn’t account for the low rates of voting participation among Hispanics who do have the right to vote. And most important, King’s estimate of five family members receiving legal status for every case of amnesty under the 1986 law is wildly high. 
Here’s our best attempt at a calculation: 
• The best estimates show that 2.7 million people received permanent residency in the United States as a result of the 1986 law. That’s slightly lower than the number King settled on, but not dramatically so. 
• It’s trickier to determine how many additional people these 2.7 million immigrants brought in through family provisions, but with expert assistance, we made some estimates. The best time span to look at is 1992 to 2012, since 1992 is when the immigrants legalized due to the 1986 law would have had their first opportunity to bring in relatives. 
According to Department of Homeland Security statistics, 12.2 million immigrants were given permanent legal status between 1992 and 2012 for family reasons. So right off the bat, King can’t possibly be right that the 1986 law led to 15 million family members being made legal. 
Moreover, it’s extremely unlikely that anything approaching 12.2 million family members were made legal as a result of the 1986 act, since legalizations from the 1986 act account for a small percentage of all legalizations since 1992. Specifically, the U.S. added 19 million new legal permanent residents between 1992 and 2012, of which 2.7 million -- or just 14 percent -- were made under the 1986 act. 
It’s hard to know whether 14 percent is the right number to use in our estimate, but it seems to be a reasonable starting point. And 14 percent of the 12.2 million family-related legalizations works out to 1.71 million stemming from the 1986 law. 
This means that every person who got amnesty from the 1986 law didn’t secure legal status for five more people, as King said. On average, each of them secured legal status for less than one additional person. 
A spokeswoman for King provided us with a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes looser rules for immigration, that expresses skepticism about the design and consequences of the 1986 law. However, this group estimated that only 743,000 people became legal for family reasons after the 1986 law -- an amount substantially lower than our estimate. 
So, using our estimate, here’s the subtotal so far: If you add 2.7 million and 1.71 million, you get 4.41 million additional permanent residents due to the 1986 law. 
• About 90 percent of immigrants legalized by the 1986 law were Hispanic. 
Subtotal: About 4 million of the newly legalized immigrants were Hispanic. 
• Only about 45 percent of those legalized by the 1986 law had become U.S. citizens by 2009. It’s now a few years later, so we’ll assume that by 2012 that rate has grown to 50 percent: 
Subtotal: About 2 million of the newly legalized immigrants were Hispanic and eligible to vote. 
• Some of the immigrants legalized by the 1986 law died in the interim. There are no good estimates for this factor, but normal death rates over a 20-year period would suggest perhaps a 10 percent decline due to death since the first amnesties were granted. 
Subtotal: 1.8 million of the newly legalized immigrants were Hispanic, eligible to vote, alive and living in the United States. 
• Among Hispanic citizens at least 18 years of age, only about 48 percent voted in 2012. 
Subtotal: 864,000 newly legalized immigrants who were Hispanic and eligible to vote actually did vote. 
• Hispanics voted for Obama at a 71 percent rate in 2012. 
Total: Using these calculations, we estimate that 613,440 Hispanic immigrants legalized due to the 1986 law voted for Obama in 2012. That’s far less than Obama’s 4.7 million vote margin that year. In fact, this sliver of the electorate counted for just 13 percent of Obama’s margin of victory. 
Just to be certain, we also did an alternative calculation. This calculation shows an even lower number. 
According to the Census Bureau, 3.1 million Hispanic voters in 2012 were immigrants. Let’s assume, using our number from above, that 14 percent of them (or 434,000) were legalized by the 1986 act. If 71 percent voted for Obama, then he would have received about 308,000 votes as a result of the 1986 act. This is even further below King’s estimate. 
In a statement to PolitiFact, King's office said, ""My point all along has been that Republicans should not be fooled into thinking that enacting another, much larger, amnesty will help advance the Republican Party. Open-borders Republicans can not disagree with my analysis of the 2012 election results because if they do they are refuting their own argument that the Hispanic vote is key."" 
Our ruling 
King said that when Reagan signed the 1986 act, he prompted such a growth in the Hispanic electorate that it accounted for Obama’s margin of victory in 2012. 
It’s no secret that long-term growth in the Hispanic population -- stemming from overall immigration policies, higher birth rates and other factors -- has aided Obama’s electoral prospects. However, very little of this growth stems from the law Reagan signed, and King’s estimate of the number of family members indirectly legalized by the law is far too high. The actual impact from the 1986 act is far more modest, adding potentially between 300,000 and 600,000 votes for Obama, rather than 4.7 million.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Bryan Long']","
Ballot claim hard to prove over 100 years
","
You can’t win if you don’t play. 
That mantra holds true for the lottery and for politics, or so says one Georgia politico. 
Bryan Long, executive director of the group Better Georgia, expressed this sentiment to the head of Georgia’s Democratic Party, Mike Berlon, last month during an Atlanta Press Club event. 
With retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat up for grabs, Berlon would rather the party support a single candidate for an uncontested primary. That doesn’t sit too well with some of the party’s leaders, who chided Berlon for not putting up Democratic candidates to run in some key 2012 state races. 
""When we ran the numbers, we saw fewer Democrats on the ballot in this last election than in more than 100 years,"" Long said. ""If your goal was to increase the turnout in all these counties, I’m not sure how by having fewer Democrats run would meet that goal."" 
One hundred years is a long time and a lot of races to count. We decided to check out Long’s claim and see whether old state ballots contained more Democratic candidates. 
Long left a public relations job to start Better Georgia, an affiliate of the ProgressNow network. Employees of the left-leaning group call themselves political troublemakers and highlight GOP policies with which they disagree. For full disclosure, Long is a former Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who has also reported for CNN. 
We first saw the exchange between Long and Berlon reported on the AJC’s Political Insider blog. Long also provided us with his full quote from the event. 
He also provided his research of the past seven statewide elections, from 2000 to 2012, with data compiled from the Georgia secretary of state’s website. Long’s chart showed the total number of Democrats on the general election ballot for the state House and Senate for those years. 
We reviewed his provided numbers on the state website and found that within a few candidates in some years, Long’s data were mostly accurate. 
Year        House        Senate        Total Democratic candidates 
2012        86        26        112 
2010        118        34        152 
2008        99        35        134 
2006        110        36        146 
2004        123        43        166 
2002        132        42        174 
2000        133        42        175 
""Even with the state’s increasing diversity, the number of Democratic candidates has decreased,"" Long told us. ""Demographics don’t win elections. It’s about putting candidates on the field to challenge for those seats."" 
Long did not provide 100-year data to support his claim. He based his statement on the decreasing number of Democrats on the ballot (with a minor exception in 2010) since 2002, when Sonny Perdue was elected governor. 
""Before that (2002) it’s an assumption because the Democrats were in control of everything,"" Long said. ""The Democrats were the majority party."" 
But the pure numbers don’t really mean anything in terms of candidates, Berlon told us. ""It’s problematic to run a candidate in every race when you are the party not in power,"" he said. ""... We’ve been targeting races we think we can win because we have a limited amount of resources."" 
We went further with our research, reviewing the numbers as far back as 1988, the earliest data available on the secretary of state’s elections website. Those figures -- with the exception of 1994 and 1992, which were not available online -- showed that Democratic ballot representation didn’t fall below the 171 candidates in 1998. 
But Long’s comment went back 100 years, and around here we aim to be totally accurate, so we also went back 100 years -- at least we tried to. 
We pored over all the volumes of the Georgia Official and Statistical Register from 1923 to 1990 for more information. The register included ballot information for 1980-1990, 1970-1974 and 1966. State legislative data for all other years was not included, and elections officials were researching whether the information was available elsewhere. 
For the years that were available, the Democratic candidates on the state ballots numbered in the 200s, up to 256 candidates in 1966. 
Until 2002, Democrats held about 60 percent of the state’s legislative seats, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, who tracks state political trends. In the 1980s Democrats held about 80 percent of the General Assembly’s seats. 
But it’s not uncommon for the minority party to have a harder time recruiting candidates, Bullock said. 
So does Long’s claim pass the test of time? 
He said that Georgia’s 2012 general election ballot included fewer Democratic candidates for the state House and Senate than in the past 100 years. 
State elections data that are available for the previous 46 years confirm Long’s claim. Data before this point were not readily available to check. And there is a 42-year gap when information is not available. 
Long’s overall point that 2012 was a light year for Democrats is correct. But he overreaches when he tries to stretch those numbers back a century. A lot of context -- and years -- are missing from his statement.

McAuliffe says state support per community college student has been cut $1,908
","Terry McAuliffe says students at Virginia’s 23 community colleges have taken a hit from state budget cuts. ""In our community college system, cuts have reduced funding per student by $1,908,"" the Democratic gubernatorial nominee says on his campaign website. We wondered whether McAuliffe’s figure is correct. McAuliffe’s website says state funding per community college student fell from $4,418 in 2008 to $2,510 in 2012 -- a $1,908 drop. Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe campaign spokesman, told us the numbers came from State Council on Higher Education for Virginia figures on instructional spending and the campaign adjusted them to 2012 dollars. The numbers reflect the amount spent per in-state community college student from Virginia’s general fund, which is raised from taxes. We found two glitches in McAuliffe’s calculation. First, his figures include Richard Bland College, a two-year institution that’s not part of the 23-school community college system. The second problem was that we could not reproduce McAuliffe’s calculations when we did our own math with SCHEV data. That’s because not all of McAuliffe’s numbers were adjusted to 2012 dollars, as Schwerin said. We learned that the campaign adjusted some of the data to 2014 dollars. So what are the real numbers? We got our own data from SCHEV and set all the figures in 2012 dollars. We found that adjusted general fund spending was about $4,275 per in-state community college student during the 2007-08 school year and $2,583 during the 2011-12 year. That’s a decline of $1,692 per student -- somewhat shy of McAuliffe’s $1,908 figure. Another part of McAuliffe’s statement also needs examination. He attributes the reduction to budget cuts, but that’s not the entire reason. State lawmakers, seeking to keep the budget balanced during and after the Great Recession, cut all major services supported by the general fund: education, health and public service. Appropriations for the community college system for instructional programs fell from $372.5 million for the 2007-08 school year to $316.2 million in 2011-12. During the same span, the number of people attending community colleges sharply rose -- from 101,889 full-time equivalent students during 2007-08 to 129,652 in 2011-12, according to figures from the Virginia Community College System. About 95 percent of the students were Virginia residents, according to Jeffrey Kraus, a spokesman for the system. Much of the increase, he said, was driven by the recession as workers entered community colleges to train for second careers and younger students sought a more affordable higher education than attending a four-year college. So state funding was falling while the student population was rising. The community colleges addressed the strain by raising tuition -- from an average of $2,390 for an in-state student during the 2007-08 school year to $3,556 in 2011-12. Finally, we should note that 2011-12 is the latest school year for which SCHEV has firm numbers for the number of people attending community colleges and the state’s support for each student. Our ruling McAuliffe said budget cuts reduced state spending per in-state community college student by $1,908 between 2008 and 2012. There are mistakes in his calculation that inflate his figure. The actual decline was just shy of $1,700 per student. McAuliffe’s statement attributed the reduction to state budget cuts. That’s a plausible contention because the General Assembly, combating an economic turndown, slashed community college funding by 15 percent during the years in question. But that’s not the entire story. What McAuliffe didn’t mention is that the budget cuts were compounded by a 27 percent increase in enrollment in community colleges and those two events combined to cause the steep drop in per-student funding. So McAuliffe’s statement needs clarifications but his gist -- that during an era of budget cutting, state funding per community college student significantly shrank -- holds up.

Mitch McConnell says HHS put a gag order on insurers about impact of Obamacare
","
Editor's note: This item was initially published May 24, 2013, as a Mostly False because of the limited supporting information we received Sen. Mitch McConnell's office. The office cited a letter sent to Humana, a government contractor for Medicare Advantage. We found that letter provided relatively little support for the senator's claim and rated it Mostly False. After the item was published, we received a note from Michael Cannon of the libertarian CATO Institute, who pointed out that we should have considered a 2010 letter from Sebelius to an insurance industry group. We found that letter actually provided more support for McConnell, even though his office had apparently been unaware of it. On May 28, we changed our rating to Mostly True and archived our previous fact-check here. 
Sen. Mitch McConnell says the Obama administration has created a ""culture of intimidation"" in Washington. 
One example: Obamacare. 
""Over at HHS back during the Obamacare debate, Secretary (Kathleen) Sebelius sent out a directive to help insurance companies telling them they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them."" McConnell, R-Ky., said on Meet the Press on May 19, 2013. 
A McConnell spokesman pointed us to a 2009 letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, often known as CMS, to Humana. The agency wrote the letter to respond to mailings that Humana sent to its nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. In bold type, Humana told its enrollees that ""millions of seniors and disabled individuals could lose many of the important benefits and services that make Medicare Advantage health plans so valuable."" 
In the letter, CMS told two Humana executives that CMS was concerned that ""this information is misleading and confusing to beneficiaries, represents information to beneficiaries as official communications about the Medicare Advantage program, and is potentially contrary to federal regulations and guidance."" 
The letter was relatively narrow in scope: It dealt with Humana, as a government contractor, and the information it was giving Medicare beneficiaries. 
It provides little support for McConnell’s claim because it said nothing about private insurance companies communicating with policyholders. 
It’s worth noting, too, that the Obama administration later clarified its rules saying Medicare Advantage contractors could communicate with Medicare beneficiaries about pending legislation as long as they did not use federal money to do so and they got permission from beneficiaries before sending them information about legislation or asking them to join advocacy efforts. 
Then another letter came to our attention. 
The AHIP letter 
Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, wrote to America’s Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, on Sept. 9, 2010, a few months after Obamacare became law. 
In the letter, Sebelius accused insurance companies of spreading misinformation by saying Obamacare was to blame for expected premium increases. 
""Given the importance of the new protections and the facts about their impact on costs, I ask for your help in stopping misinformation and scare tactics about the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, I want AHIP’s members to be put on notice: the Administration, in partnership with states, will not tolerate unjustified rate hikes in the name of consumer protections,"" Sebelius wrote. 
She said insurers would be required to justify any rate increases, that there would be state and federal reviews of increases that don’t appear justified, and insurers that have a record of unjustified increases would be excluded from the insurance exchanges set up by the law. 
Sebelius also disputed the insurance companies’ predictions that Obamacare would necessitate higher premiums and said any cost increases would be offset by savings built into the law. 
When the letter came out in 2010, Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, said Sebelius' letter was an attempt to ""intimidate those who say unflattering things about ObamaCare."" 
""What business does she have threatening insurers because they disagree with her in public?  ObamaCare gave the HHS secretary considerable new powers. Is one of those the power to regulate what insurers say about ObamaCare? Excluding insurers from ObamaCare’s exchanges is not a minor threat,"" Cannon wrote. 
An HHS spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter was in response to insurance companies using Obamacare as an excuse to raise premiums, and that the law gave the agency the authority to scrutinize excessive premium increases and require justifications from insurance companies. 
But we find Cannon's interpretation more accurate. The letter chastised the insurers for anti-Obamacare messages and threatened them with regulatory action. 
Our ruling 
McConnell said that Sebelius told insurance companies ""they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them."" 
Her letter to AHIP didn’t go quite that far, but Sebelius was definitely seeking to muzzle the insurers because she felt they were giving false, self-serving information. The letter sought to discourage them with a not-so-subtle threat of regulatory action. Although McConnell was exaggerating that the companies were prohibited from these communications, the talk of regulatory action was significant and could fairly be taken as an attempt to intimidate. 
We rate McConnell's claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/28/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-hhs-put-gag-order-insurers-ab/

Girl had to pay $500 federal criminal fine for rescuing woodpecker, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says
","
U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner went on national TV on May 9, 2013, to talk up the Over-Criminalization Task Force, a new venture praised by groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Heritage Foundation.   
Supporters say the work of the panel, created by the House Judiciary Committee, could lead to a reduction in federal regulations and a reduced federal prison population. 
Sensenbrenner, one of the two co-chairmen of the task force, told the Rev. Pat Robertson on ""The 700 Club"" that some of the roughly 4,500 federal crimes now on the books need to be eliminated. 
Then the Wisconsin Republican illustrated his point with this claim: 
""I think the FBI has got much better things to do, for example, than investigate an 11-year-old girl that ended up having to pay a $500 criminal fine because she found an injured woodpecker and put it in a cage to make sure that the bird was OK and that violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act."" 
That got high marks on our curiosity meter. 
But how does Sensenbrenner’s claim fare on the Truth-O-Meter? 
Woodpecker case 
We found news accounts and a news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service describing the following incident: 
On June 13, 2011, Skylar Capo, 11, rescued a baby woodpecker that she believed was about to be eaten by the family cat at her dad’s home near Fredricksburg, Va. 
Skylar’s mom, Alison Capo, agreed to let Skylar take the bird to their home for a day or two to make sure it was OK. 
On the way home, the family stopped at a Lowe's store, bringing the bird with them in a cage to spare it from the heat in the car. 
So, part of Sensenbrenner's claim is accurate: The girl took a woodpecker she thought might be injured and put it in a cage. 
Back to the story. 
Inside the store, a woman confronted the Capos, saying she was from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and that it was against the law to take or transport a woodpecker. 
Capo said that as soon as she and her daughter returned home, they released the bird and reported the release to the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
But two weeks later, on June 27, 2011, the same woman from the Lowe's store, accompanied by a state trooper, arrived at the Capos’ home. She had already drafted a citation for violation of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which protects woodpeckers and numerous other birds. Violation of the act is a misdemeanor and carries a fine, up six months in jail, or both. 
After the visit, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the agent determined no further action was necessary; and the next day, she canceled the citation she had drafted. 
Several weeks later, however, Capo received a letter of violation, notifying her of a $535 fine, the possible jail time and a date to appear in federal court. 
But no fine was ever paid. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued an apology, saying the citation had been processed ""unintentionally"" and should never have been issued.

Do raises line up with other cities?
","
A few lucky souls in a Gwinnett County city could see their paychecks rise by 50 percent. 
So how did they become so fortunate, and do they have any openings? 
Well, they voted themselves the potential raises. 
Norcross City Council members recently voted 4-1 to increase the pay for their positions from $5,400 a year to $8,100. The mayor’s pay will rise from $6,900 a year to $10,350. The increases will take effect in January, two months after the next municipal election. 
WXIA-TV recently did a story about the raises and criticism of the idea. The station reported that Mayor Bucky Johnson said the raises would bring Norcross in line with other liked-sized communities. Johnson told us a councilman made the initial claim. 
PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the officials are right. 
A Norcross official sent us a salary survey of elected officials in 43 cities in metro Atlanta. The annual pay for top elected officials ranged from $147,500 for Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed to Buford City Commission Chairman Phillip Beard, who doesn’t receive a salary. 
Atlanta, which has a population of more than 400,000 residents, isn’t necessarily the most appropriate city for such a comparison with Norcross, which had 9,116 residents in the 2010 U.S. census. The city's population rose to an estimated 15,000 residents in 2012 after Norcross an annexation, Johnson said. We looked at cities with similar populations. Since serving on the Norcross City Council is considered a part-time position, our second criteria was finding elected officials who are also part-time. 
Lilburn, the closest municipality to Norcross, has a part-time City Council and pays its elected officials slightly less than what Norcross approved. The population is slightly higher, nearly 12,000 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. That city’s mayor makes $5,000 a year and council members are paid an annual salary of $3,500, a Lilburn official told us. 
Another part-time City Council further east in Gwinnett County, Loganville, offers compensation to its elected officials that’s pretty close to Norcross. Loganville’s mayor is paid $12,000 a year while its council members make $6,000 a year. Loganville officials are part-time. The city’s population in 2010 was 10,458. 
We also looked at Doraville, which had 8,330 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. The mayor and council members receive annual salaries of $70,000 and $8,400, respectively, city officials say. The council voted in 2011 to cut their annual pay by $6,000 as City Hall grappled with across-the-board budget cuts, The Champion Newspaper reported. 
For three decades, Doraville’s mayor handled the city’s daily operations. Residents voted to put a city manager in charge of running Doraville on a daily basis and hired one in February 2012. 
In all, we looked at 10 cities in the region with populations that seemed reasonably close to Norcross’. The average annual mayoral salary was $19,418. The average yearly city council salary was $8,437. The salaries are higher than what Norcross adopted. 
But only six of those cities have mayoral salaries that are higher than what Norcross passed. Just four of those cities have city council salaries that are more than what Norcross approved. 
To sum up, Norcross officials claimed the salary increases for its mayor and City Council would put them in line with other liked-sized communities. If you consider the average salaries for 10 similarly sized cities, Norcross officials would still make less than their counterparts. If you examine each of those cities separately, the Norcross officials would make more in some cases and less in other instances. 
From what we’ve reviewed, Norcross has a pretty good argument here. The council will be in the middle of other liked-sized communities concerning pay. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2013/may/28/norcross-city-council/do-raises-line-other-cities/

Mark Warner says sequester has caused 70,000 children to lose Head Start slots
","
Faced with complaints about airport delays being caused by the sequester, Congress last month halted a furlough of air traffic controllers that had been part of its budget-cutting agreement. 
U.S. Sen Mark Warner, D-Va., recently wondered why members of Congress -- frequent fliers, themselves -- haven’t shown the same urgency to protect disadvantaged 3- and- 4-year-olds who also are being hurt by the spending cuts. 
""Everybody gets up in arms when people have to wait to get an airplane ride and Congress acts immediately because that’s visible,"" he said during a May 14 interview on WHRV-FM in Norfolk. ""What’s not visible is the 70,000 kids who have lost their Head Start slots..."" 
For several years, Warner has been seeking a bipartisan solution to the nation’s budget stalemate that includes spending cuts and tax increases. He has called the sequester, which began triggering automatic cuts to defense and domestic programs on March 1, ""the most stupid option on the table."" During his recent radio interview, he also lamented sequester-caused reductions in federal grants for college students and research at the National Institute of Health. 
We were struck by his claim that 70,000 children have lost access to Head Start, an educational program that prepares disadvantaged kids to start elementary school, and decided to see whether Warner is right. 
More than a million children --  from families that live below the poverty line or receive public assistance -- are enrolled in Head Start half-day or full-day programs. The federal government offers competitive contracts to public and private providers, so many groups may offer Head Start programs in a locality. 
As PolitiFact Florida recently noted examining a similar claim, Head Start enrollment hit record highs in recent years because the Obama administration nearly doubled the number of children eligible for Early Head Start, which serves eligible children up to the age of eligibility for Head Start. Congress then decided to spend more money on Head Start to maintain enrollment for those children. 
A month before the sequester began, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent a Feb. 1 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee detailing cuts to programs under her purview. Among them, she wrote, ""up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start services."" 
Warner’s statement went a step further, saying 70,000 children ""have lost their Head Start slots."" 
When we asked his office for an explanation, spokesman Kevin Hall emailed us two news releases and two news articles about the sequester that were written after Sebelius’ letter. He included a Feb. 8 White House fact sheet on the harm of the sequester. At the top of the list, it said ""70,000 young children would be kicked off Head Start …"" 
Hall also sent news articles written by NPRand Education Week and web postings from the National Head Start Association -- a group of the agencies that run local programs -- that, in varying ways, say a reduction of 70,000 Head Start slots may or will happen. 
Annual funding for Head Start is being cut by 5.27 percent. HHS spokesman Ted Froats said Sebelius’ estimate of losing up to 70,000 spots hasn’t changed. But he also said HHS does not know how many children have been dropped since the sequester began and that the agency is gathering that data and hopes to release a report in June. 
Each local program across the nation has the flexibility to determine how it will adjust to its budget cuts and news reports say many are exploring solutions that don’t involve reducing enrollment, such as switching from a full-year to a nine-month program, closing one day a month, or fundraising. 
For Virginia, the White House estimated that up to 1,000 children would lose Head Start or Early Head Start services before the end of the year. But state officials don’t yet know what the results will be. 
Maxine McKinney, executive director of the Virginia Head Start Association, wrote in an email that she thinks most state programs so far have been able to maintain programs because the sequester did not begin until well into their budget year, which runs from the start from July to the end of June. But she hasn’t received figures yet on how the local programs will cope with the coming budget year. 
""Many programs are reducing enrollment,"" she said. ""Others are able to absorb the cuts by eliminating non-mandated services, reducing staff, etc."" 
Of the 21 programs she’s heard from so far, 10 are reducing their slots by 263. But the 21 programs accounts for fewer than half in the state. 
Our ruling 
Warner said 70,000 children have ""lost their Head Start slots"" because of the sequester. He strains the limit of an Obama administration estimate that ""up to"" that number of children may lose out. 
There’s no doubt that many children will lose Head Start spots as the budget cuts sink in, but at this point, nobody knows how many already have. HHS is gathering that information. The White House estimate assumes that local Head Start organizations will respond to funding cuts by reducing slots, but that isn’t the only option. Many organizations are exploring different options, such as fundraising and reducing hours. 
Warner’s statement contains an element of truth in that some children already have lost Head Starts slots and others have less access to the program. But by and large, he assumes that a worst-case scenario for Head Start has already taken place.

Nearly 1 in 5 acres in Wisconsin is owned by the federal, state or county government and is used for conservation, state senator says
","If state Sen. Alberta Darling is correct, nearly one of every five acres of land in Wisconsin is owned by the federal, state or county government and is set aside for conservation. That’s open space for forests and parks, as well as for activities such as fishing, hiking, camping and snowmobiling. Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, uttered the statistic in the context of: When is enough, enough? With the Legislature considering a reduction in what the state spends on such land acquisitions, it’s time for a conservation conversation. Joint Finance and stewardship Darling is co-chairwoman of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, a 16-member panel of Senate and Assembly members that reviews all state appropriations and revenue -- most notably the state budget. Inevitably, the committee makes changes in the governor’s biennial budget proposal before the Legislature adopts the budget and the governor signs it into law. On May 15, 2013, in the thick of reviewing Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s 2014-2015 budget, the GOP-controlled committee discussed whether to spend less on the state stewardship program, which is one way government buys land for conservation. The money comes from borrowing and is repaid with tax dollars. At one point during the discussion, Darling stated: ""We've had a lot of people around the state tell us, you know, the stewardship program's a great program. We have a lot of very precious lands. But we have 18 percent of our land in our state right now is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes. A lot of our constituents are saying, What is the endgame here?"" So, let’s see where the 18 percent claim comes from. (By the way, Walker’s budget proposal kept stewardship spending the same -- $120 million over two years. After its discussion, Joint Finance voted to reduce that amount by $18 million. The state budget is supposed to be finalized by July 1, 2013.) Darling’s evidence Darling spokesman Bob Delaporte cited two sources to back Darling’s statement. 1. A January 2013 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It estimated that 5.89 million acres, or 16.95 percent, of Wisconsin’s 34.8 million acres were owned for conservation as of June 30, 2012. That includes the 1.5 million-acre Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in the North Woods; state forests, such as the 232,000-acre Northern Highland American Legion State Forest in Iron, Oneida, and Vilas counties; as well as county parks and forests. 2. A March 2013 email from the Department of Natural Resources to the Joint Finance Committee co-chairs, which quotes a higher figure: 18.5 percent. That email noted Wisconsin’s rate is higher than Illinois’ and Iowa’s, which are both below 3 percent; but lower than Michigan’s 22 percent and Minnesota’s 25 percent. Darling’s spokesman told us the senator ""went with 18 percent"" during the finance committee discussion because that figure is between the fiscal bureau’s estimate, rounded up, of 17 percent and the DNR’s estimate of 18.5 percent. Indeed, either figure, if accurate, would essentially back Darling’s claim, given that they are estimates. We talked with the authors of the fiscal bureau report and the DNR’s email, as well as other officials. One reason the DNR figure is higher is that it included federally owned properties such as military installations. Another reason the DNR’s figure varies from the fiscal bureau’s figure is the estimates were done at different times. So, we came up with the following breakdown to provide the best figures available. The county and federal acreage numbers are from the fiscal bureau, which the DNR agreed is the most up to date. And the DNR provided us its current figures for state-owned conservation land. (One note: The state figure includes conservation land owned only by the DNR and the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, not other agencies or the University of Wisconsin System.)   Unit of government Acres owned for conservation % of total acres in Wisconsin Counties 2,470,000 7.11 Federal 1,856,500 5.34 State 1,571,563 4.52 Total 5,897,816 16.97   So, rounding up, 17 percent is, in fact, the best available figure. To be sure, the total percentage of land in Wisconsin set aside for conservation is actually somewhat higher, because neither the fiscal bureau nor the DNR attempted to count how many acres of conservation land are owned by tribes, municipalities or private entities. But Darling’s claim was strictly on federal, state and county land. Our rating Darling said 18 percent of land in Wisconsin ""is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes."" The more up-to-date figure is 17 percent, but it is an estimate. We rate Darling’s claim True.",/factchecks/2013/may/26/alberta-darling/Nearly-1-in-5-acres-in-Wisconsin-is-owned-by-the-f/

Barbara Buono TV ad goes after Chris Christie on jobs, property taxes
","
Depending on who’s asked, everything in Jersey is just dandy or the state is on the brink of economic disaster. 
And the first TV campaign ad from likely Democratic gubernatorial nominee Barbara Buono is clear about where she stands. 
""To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine,"" Buono claims in the ad released online Wednesday. ""Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition."" 
The degree of accuracy for some of these claims is mixed and in some cases, significant details are missing. 
Let’s tackle the claims about unemployment and joblessness first. 
The ad is correct that New Jersey has about 400,000 people unemployed, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for April 2013. Not mentioned? That figure is more than 42,000 fewer unemployed since Christie’s first full month in office, Feburary 2010, BLS data shows. 
In the ad Buono says that New Jersey has one of the worst jobless rates in the country, but text in the ad also claims the state ranks 44th nationwide in job creation. We’ll look at both. 
In terms of unemployment rates as of April, only six states have higher rates than New Jersey’s 8.7 percent: California (9%), Illinois (9.3%), Mississippi (9.1%), Nevada (9.6%), North Carolina (8.9%) and Rhode Island (8.8%). 
If we measure jobs in all 50 states and Washington, DC from February 2010 to February 2013, New Jersey ranks 21st for job creation, according to BLS data. 
But from December 2010 to December 2011, the state ranks near the bottom, in 48th place. 
So New Jersey fares better in job creation when we look at broader time frames. 
Economic experts from both the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, and Georgetown University, have told us that year-over-year comparisons are very common ways to evaluate employment trends. 
Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner could not be reached for comment about what timeframe the campaign used to determine New Jersey’s 44th place ranking for job creation, or other concerns we had about the ad. 
Now let’s look at property taxes and tuition costs. 
Buono is right that working and middle class families have seen costs soar, but what she doesn’t say is that those increases started long before Christie got to the governor’s office. 
The ad cites an article from the online web site NJ Spotlight, which claims property taxes increased nearly 19 percent during Christie’s first three years in office compared with his predecessor Democrat Jon Corzine’s final three years in office. 
One of the reasons: Christie severely curtailed rebate payments and limited eligibility for certain tax cut programs. 
And while those rebate program limitations may have caused tax increases, property taxes in New Jersey were rising before Corzine became governor. In fact, we determined in previous fact-checks that property taxes spiked about 70 percent across three Democratic administrations in the first decade of the 2000s. 
Finally, let’s look at college tuition costs. 
Christie cut funding for county colleges by 10 percent in 2010, a year that also saw record enrollment increases at the state’s two-year schools. As a result, tuition increased an average of 4.4 percent. 
Tuition and fees at 24 of the state’s four-year colleges and universities also rose faster than the rate of inflation in 2010, according to a Star-Ledger analysis that year. 
""Barbara Buono has relied exclusively on negative campaigning and misleading attacks because she simply doesn't want to talk about her own record of voting 154 times for higher taxes and fees, property taxes that doubled on New Jersey families on her watch, and 240,000 private sector jobs lost,"" Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. ""She opposes the Governor's bipartisan, middle-class tax relief plan and has consistently stood against reforms to lower the cost of government and deliver real savings to property taxpayers, and even to strengthen higher education for the future."" 
Our ruling 
A new Buono TV ad claims, ""To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine. Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition."" 
Buono is right that nearly 400,000 New Jerseyans are out of work, but fewer people are unemployed now than when Christie became governor. Also, the state is faring better in job creation when employment gains are analyzed across the bulk of Christie’s time in office. 
Property taxes and college tuition have both soared, as the ad claims, but we can’t ignore how much property taxes skyrocketed across three Democratic administrations prior to Christie’s. Still, the governor’s aid cuts in 2010 to help close budget gaps resulted in higher tuition at two-year and four-year schools in the state. 
There are degrees of accuracy here, but given the significant context issues with this ad we rate it Half True.

Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island says half of hospitalized seniors are suffering from severe malnutrition
","
In Rhode Island and around the country, Meals on Wheels gets food to elderly people who cannot  get it for themselves. The elderly, especially those on a constricted budget or unable to get to a store or a pantry, are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. 
A recent fundraising letter sent out by Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island included this statement making note of the problem:  ""In fact, half of all hospitalized seniors are suffering from malnutrition so severe that it either caused their illness or it prevents them from getting better."" 
A reader who received the letter wondered about that claim and forwarded it to us, asking: ""Is this true? If yes, it is an appalling statistic."" 
We found the statistic disturbing as well, and decided to check it out. First, we contacted Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island. Its executive director, Heather Amaral, said the letter was written by an outside firm. Amaral checked with the firm and got back to PolitiFact, providing us links to several sources. 
One was an undated article in the Journal of Nursing -- published post 2010 -- that said ""malnutrition is becoming increasingly more common among the elderly population"" and ""about 60 percent of hospitalized older adults (age 65 or older) … are experiencing malnutrition."" It cited as its source a 2006 article in the Journal of Gerontological Nursing. 
The Journal of Nursing article also stated that ""malnutrition impacts morbidity, mortality, hospital length of stay, functional disabilities, and physical complications. Malnutrition can cause increased infection, electrolyte imbalances, altered skin integrity, anemia, weakness, and fatigue."" 
Another source provided by Meals on Wheels was an online information sheet by the National Resource on Nutrition, Physical Activity and Aging, called ""Malnutrition and Older Americans,"" which, according to the online sheet, was based at Florida International University in Miami. 
It said that ""as many as 65 percent of the elders in hospitals may be malnourished.""  The sheet said ""studies have shown that older adults at nutritional risk tend to make more visits to physicians, hospitals and emergency rooms,"" have hospital stays twice as long as well-nourished patients and are re-admitted more frequently. 
The website, which was partially supported by a grant from the federal Administration on Aging, did not give a source for its information. And phone numbers listed for the organization no longer work.  A call to the university in Florida found that it no longer has the National Resource on Nutrition, Physical Activity and Aging. 
A third source was a July 1995 New York Times article that said ""one half of elderly hospital patients are malnourished,"" though the article did not list a source for the figure and did not address whether malnutrition caused their sickness or kept them from recovering. 
None of the sources supported the key part of Meals on Wheels’ claim that half of hospitalized seniors have such severe malnutrition that it either caused their illness or prevented them from getting better. Those strong assertions go well beyond the information Meals on Wheels provided. 
On our own, we found several studies and medical journal articles about malnutrition in hospitalized elderly people. They showed malnutrition is more common in that age group, but they offered varying estimates for the extent of the problem. 
Ellen Furman, an assistant professor of nursing at American International College, in Springfield, Mass., pointed us to what she said was some of the most current literature on the subject -- a 2010 article in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. That study used a pool of about 4,500 people, with a mean age of 82 years old. It found that about 40 percent were malnourished. 
""What is so frustrating when trying to quote prevalence rates for undernutrition in hospitalized older adults is that every study has different rates dependent upon setting and population samples,"" Furman said by e-mail. 
We also contacted experts who worked on a ""consensus statement"" about adult malnutrition, published in 2012 by a joint research group for two national nutrition organizations. The statement said there is a wide range of estimates of malnutrition among adults. 
We reached out to Rhode Island Hospital and Lifespan, the state’s biggest hospital group (which includes Rhode Island Hospital.) Spokeswomen for both said they couldn’t confirm the 50-percent rate cited by Meals on Wheels. But they said nutritionists for the hospitals agreed that malnutrition leaves patients vulnerable to other illnesses. 
We also contacted state and federal agencies that deal with health care and the elderly but none had firm statistics on the extent or severity of malnutrition in the hospitalized elderly. 
Our ruling 
Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island, in a fundraising letter, said: ""In fact, half of all hospitalized seniors are suffering from malnutrition so severe that it either caused their illness or it prevents them from getting better."" 
To determine a ruling, we broke the statement into three parts. 
First, are half of all hospitalized seniors suffering from malnutrition? 
We found papers and studies that included malnutrition rates among hospitalized elderly of about 40 percent to 60 percent, either at admission to the hospital or during their stays, in the range that Meals on Wheels cited. (Other studies and papers, many of them conducted in Europe, gave a wider percentage range). 
Second, is the malnutrition so severe it caused their illness? We found nothing to support this. 
Third, is their malnutrition so severe it prevents them from getting better? 
We found research showing that malnutrition can make someone susceptible to other illnesses and contribute to longer hospitalization. But we found nothing to support  the claim that the malnutrition prevented them from recovering. 
Malnutrition among the elderly is clearly a serious problem. But this statement goes beyond what the evidence shows. The judges rule it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/26/meals-wheels-rhode-island/meals-wheels-rhode-island-says-half-hospitalized-s/

Sander Levin says IRS’s inspector general said there was ‘no political motivation’ and ‘no outside influence’ to target tea party groups
","
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree: The IRS screwed up, big time, when it watched for phrases like ""tea party"" to trigger extra scrutiny of groups seeking tax-exempt status. 
But there’s a partisan disagreement over whether it was merely an ill-conceived time-saver for overworked Ohio staffers or a sinister White House plot to hamstring conservative groups before an election. 
(""It's the IRS targeting-gate!"" said New York Republican Tom Reed.) 
Rep. Sander Levin, a long-serving Democrat who’s the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, said after a May 17 hearing that evidence is on Democrats’ side. 
""My view is that the criteria were very inappropriate,"" he told MSNBC host Chris Matthews. ""There was terrible mismanagement. I think there was very terrible oversight. ... 
""But the IG, the inspector general, when asked, Was there any political motivation for the people who were in the exempt organization in Cincinnati, the lower-level people who were working on this, he said no. Was there any outside influence? And he said no."" 
The inspector general for tax administration is charged with independent oversight of the IRS. 
Did he say there was no ""political motivation"" or ""outside influence"" driving the agency’s inappropriate behavior? 
‘Inappropriate criteria’ 
The latest round of congressional hearings — and there will be more — kicked off after the May 14 release of a mildly titled audit from the inspector’s office: ""Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review."" 
It asked whether the IRS: 
• Targeted groups applying for tax-exempt status. 
• Delayed processing of targeted groups’ applications. 
• Requested unnecessary information from targeted groups, such as donor lists. 
It found that Cincinnati employees did all of those things, beginning in early 2010. 
A ""determinations unit"" there reviews applications for tax-exempt status for various kinds of organizations — such as charities and nonprofit schools and hospitals. 
It ran into trouble with applications for 501(c)(4) status — a designation that allows a tax-exempt group whose primary activity is social welfare to engage in political activity without disclosing its donors. In theory, a group whose primary activity was actually political activity — such as supporting candidates for office —wouldn’t qualify. 
So IRS employees developed criteria to identify and group applications from organizations likely to engage in political activity for a deeper look. But regulations don’t define how to measure a group’s ""primary"" activity. So, according to the report, amid confusion, three ""inappropriate"" things happened. 
• For months, employees used phrases such as ""tea party,"" ""patriots,"" ""9/12"" and political-sounding names such as ""we the people, or ""take back the country"" to group applications for special review. 
The criteria got more generic in 2011, then more specific again in mid 2012, including ""political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government, educating on the constitution and bill of rights, social economic reform/movement."" 
• Most of those applications languished for more than a year as employees sorted out how to handle them. 
• Then it sent lengthy, probing questionnaires to many applicants, requesting detailed responses, such as lists of all donations and donors, whether any leaders or donors had run for office or would in the future, and lists of all issues important to the organization and its position on those issues. 
The basic result was that while none of those groups had their applications denied, more than half of them waited more than 200 days — and some as long as three years, across two election cycles. 
Some are still awaiting decisions. 
Auditors asked various IRS leaders and employees in Cincinnati and Washington whether anyone outside the IRS influenced the ""inappropriate"" criteria. They found the opposite: that one problem was insufficient high-level oversight. 
""Specifically, only first-line management approved references to the tea party,"" the report said. 
However, interviews with employees in the Cincinnati office didn’t turn up exactly who had been involved in creating the criteria, the report said. 
Inspector general 
Since the audit, lawmakers have repeatedly brought in the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, J. Russell George, to testify about the findings of his auditors. 
Levin’s staff pointed us to this exchange before Ways and Means, when the congressman asked George to clarify the audit’s results on outside influence and political motivation: 
Levin: On page 7, Mr. George, of the IG report it states and ""all of these individuals stated that the criteria were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS."" Is that correct? 
George: That is the information we received, correct. 
Levin: Did you find any evidence of political motivation in the selection of the tax exemption applications? 
George: We did not, sir. 
It’s important to note that George is careful to say that information gathered during the audit didn’t point to outside influence or political motivation — not that he was certain it had been ruled out. 
He was similarly careful in his responses that day to Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and later, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis.: 
McDermott: The inspector general report says that no one acted out of malice or political motivation. Mr. George, I want to know, do you still stand by that? 
George: We have no evidence at this time to contradict that assertion, sir. ... 
  
Kind: ""According to your report, you found no bias or partisanship behind the development and the use of the criteria for selecting applications in the Cincinnati office. Is that right? 
George: That is correct, sir, but we did find gross mismanagement in the overall — 
Kind: Right. And that's clear in your report, too. Did you find any evidence that anyone outside of the IRS was involved in the development and review of — 
George: Not at this time, sir. 
Kind: Not the White House or Treasury? 
George: That's correct, sir. 
Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., pointed out that day that George’s office had conducted an audit, but not yet an investigation. 
""There's a reason you don't know who came up with this. You didn't investigate that,"" he said. 
Indeed, George clarified for lawmakers in the days after Levin’s MSNBC interview that auditors didn’t ask directly about White House involvement, because no evidence pointed that direction. 
He also distinguished between an audit — designed to uncover systemic problems — and an investigation, which focuses on misconduct by specific people.

Barack Obama says since he took office, “there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States”
","
President Barack Obama talked about terrorism and drones in a major speech on May 23, 2013. 
At one point, Obama said ""there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States"" since the start of his presidency, adding, ""Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11."" 
We wondered whether he was accurate when he said ""there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States"" since his presidency began. 
We were particularly interested in this question because we recently rated a claim by Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that ""in barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama,"" compared to zero ""in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush."" We gave Cotton’s claim a Mostly False, but that statement has important differences in wording that led us to take a look at Obama’s claim as well. 
We see two terrorist attacks during Obama’s tenure that could be considered ""large scale."" 
One is the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect and is now awaiting a military trial. 
The other incident is the bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, that killed three and injured more than 260. Officials are still determining the extent of the role played by Islamic extremism in the accused bombers’ motivations. (We aren’t including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya, because it didn’t take place on the U.S. mainland.) 
The White House argues that Obama is accurate because neither Fort Hood nor Boston qualify as coordinated attacks on the scale of the 9/11 attacks. The White House also notes that Obama mentioned both attacks elsewhere in his speech. 
Since the definition of ‘large scale"" is in the eye of the beholder, we reached out to terrorism experts for guidance. They saw two key yardsticks for determining whether an attack is ""large scale."" 
Was the plot connected to a broad terrorist network? 
A plot can be ""large scale"" if it is logistically complicated and draws in resources from many directions. 
Prior to the Fort Hood shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida. Hasan sought out al-Awlaki for support and inspiration, but other than that, there is scant evidence that the incident was planned and carried out by an international terrorist network. 
As for the Boston attack, investigators are still trying to determine how much assistance, if any, either of the Tsarnaevs got from other terrorists. But for now, at least, no hard evidence has emerged. 
In general, then, both Hasan and the Tsarnaevs are considered more akin to ""lone-wolf"" terrorists who self-radicalized, rather than people who carried out a terrorist attack devised by a larger terrorist gang. 
""Without the direct involvement of a more organized group and in view of other elements, they are more difficult to qualify as large scale,"" said Mathieu Deflem, a sociologist specializing in terrorism at the University of South Carolina. They both involved ""lone-wolf perpetrators who lacked direct connections or instructions from an organized group."" 
How many were killed? 
The attacks in Fort Hood and Boston both caused more deaths than several other terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, including a 2002 shooting at the Los Angeles airport  (two killed), a 2006 vehicular attack at the University of North Carolina (injuries only) and a 2009 shooting at a U.S. Army recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark. (two killed). But they were far less than the 9/11 attacks or other major attacks of recent years.

Indeed, two non-terrorist-related school shootings, at Virginia Tech (32 dead in 2007) and in Newtown, Conn. (27 dead in 2012), left more than twice as many dead as Fort Hood and about 10-times as many as were killed in Boston. 
""If you use mass shootings as a baseline, then (Obama) is accurate,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 
Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that Obama is ""on solid ground here,"" adding that ""it's important to keep in mind the sort of predictions about large-scale attack that were common after 9/11. All sorts of people predicted recurring if not regular mass casualty attacks that killed many hundreds,"" and that hasn’t happened. 
On the other hand, the Boston bombing did result in many more injuries than either school shooting, and we think that most people would think an attack that indiscriminately injures 260 people, many with lost limbs, would qualify as ""large scale."" 
Indeed, the definitions of ""large-scale"" are sufficiently vague that there’s a lot of room for Obama, or his critics, to either burnish or damage the administration’s record on terrorism. 
There’s also a question of how much Obama can take credit -- or be blamed -- for the number of terrorist attacks on his watch. ""Why would thwarted attacks not count?"" said Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""That's like being a hockey goalie who has stopped lots of shots and then says, ‘Gee, they haven’t scored, so I guess the game must be over.’""  
Our ruling 
Obama said that since he has taken office, ""there have been no large-scale attacks on the United States."" 
Two attacks on Obama’s watch that might qualify as ""large scale"" -- the Fort Hood shootings and the Boston Marathon bombing. They caused substantially fewer deaths than the biggest terrorist attacks of recent years, and they are believed to have been carried out by ""lone wolf"" attackers with limited connections to large-scale terrorist networks. But where to draw the line between small, medium and large attacks is open to interpretation. Obama's formulation is plausible, but not the only one. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-took-office-there-have-been-n/

No evidence Michels personally pushed for gas tax increase, despite ties to groups that did
","With just a few days until Wisconsin’s Aug. 9, 2022, primary, the top two Republican gubernatorial candidates are taking shots at each other to try and set themselves apart.  Tim Michels, a multimillionaire who owns Michels Corp., one of the nation’s largest construction companies, and Rebecca Kleefisch, who served as lieutenant governor under former Gov. Scott Walker, were virtually tied in the most recent Marquette Law School poll on the race, released June 22, 2022. Michels pulled a hair ahead of Kleefisch, with 27% and 26% backing, respectively, well within the margin of error.  It’s no surprise, then, that in recent weeks the two have turned up the heat.  On July 6, 2022, Kleefisch’s campaign released a TV ad criticizing Michels by name. In the ad, she fills up a minivan with gas and bemoans skyrocketing prices – blaming them on President Joe Biden and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers — then focuses on Michels. ""Tim Michels pushed for years to raise our gas tax,"" she says.  Around the same time, the campaign released another ad where Walker praises his former second-in-command and also claims that Michels ""teamed up with … those lobbying for a gas tax increase.""  Michels’ campaign swiftly pushed back against the accusations.  So what’s the real story? Let’s dig in.  When asked for evidence to back up her claim, Kleefisch’s campaign cited several connections between Michels and a gas tax increase, many from a June 27, 2022, piece from the conservative news outlet Wisconsin Right Now.   ""Tim Michels — because of his role in directly funding campaigns to increase the gas tax in other states, sitting as president of a board that supported a gas tax increase, and his company’s (the one he is vice president of and takes credit for their 8,000 jobs on the campaign trail) leadership in other associations that supported increases in the gas tax — supported raising the gas tax,"" campaign staff wrote in response.  Breaking it down, though, that assessment skips a few steps. The connections the campaign cites are each a few steps removed from Michels himself, who has said publicly he does not support raising the gas tax.  Chief among the connections cited are Michels’ ties to the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, the Construction Business Group and the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin. He served as WTBA’s board president from 2007 to 2008 and was previously a member of the TDA’s executive committee. Michels Corp is a TDA member, and a Michels Corp. staffer sits on the board of WTBA.  Indeed, the groups have advocated for higher gas taxes.  Michels’ response: He doesn’t always agree with the advocacy efforts of the trade groups he and his company have belonged to.  He does have a point there. Having served on boards of organizations that have sought to increase the gas tax isn’t the same as pushing for it himself — which is what the Kleefisch ad claims.  In a way, it’s similar to how we treat votes on those megabills in Congress that cover hundreds upon hundreds of initiatives. Voting for the package does not signal support for every last line item in it — especially when there is evidence to the contrary. And, in this case, Michels has said repeatedly he does not back a gas tax increase. The Wisconsin Right Now piece also points out that Michels Corp. subsidiaries have donated to groups in other states that have favored raising gasoline taxes.  Again, that’s a few steps removed from Michels himself.  It’s worth noting that Michels has provided similar explanations for other actions by organizations he (or his company) was a member of that conflict with usual conservative positions, including a coalition that opposed the state’s right-to-work law and WTBA’s opposition of an anti-immigration bill.  Kleefisch’s campaign staff seemed to have anticipated the explanation, writing in a response, ""That’s a cop-out … Michels has not proven anything to show that he or his company contradicted any of the trade association positions at the time."" It remains to be seen what Michels would do with the gas tax if elected governor. But right now, the burden is on Kleefisch’s camp to prove her claim that he personally pushed to increase it — and there’s no evidence of that.  Kleefisch claimed Michels ""pushed for years"" to increase Wisconsin’s gas tax.  Michels does have ties to groups that have had that aim, and this isn’t the only time he’s tried to distance himself from what they’ve been involved in.  Still, there’s no evidence that he was personally the one pushing. And he has explicitly stated the opposite on the campaign trail: That he will not increase the gas tax. A rating of Mostly False means the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  That fits here.",/factchecks/2022/aug/05/rebecca-kleefisch/no-evidence-michels-personally-pushed-gas-tax-incr/

Image makes false claims about monkeypox and wasn’t shared by BBC News or the WHO
","The Biden administration declared monkeypox a public health emergency on Aug. 4, but leading national and international health organizations haven't made sweeping changes to the way they classify the virus and illness, despite alarming claims made by an image circulating online. An image shared in a Facebook post on Aug. 3 suggested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization made major changes to their available monkeypox guidance and information. The screenshot (embedded below) purports to be from a BBC News article and features its logo. A headline reads, ""What you need to know about monkeypox,"" and makes the following claims: CDC has now classified this disease as airborne and anybody within 15 ft can catch it  This disease is now classified as a form of herpes The illness typically last 2-4 months. If you have symptoms avoid going outside  Monkeypox can lead to being paralyzed The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Facebook.) The BBC confirmed the image was not a real graphic and urged people to check the veracity of stories on the BBC News website.  A search for the screenshot’s headline on the BBC News website turned up no matching results. On Aug. 2, BBC News published a story about monkeypox with the headline, ""What is monkeypox and how do you catch it?"" The article cites the World Health Organization and the UK Health Security Agency and doesn’t make any of the claims shared in the screenshot.  In addition, reverse image searches for the purported screenshot on Google Image, TinEye, Bing and Yandex returned no matching results. Searches for the exact phrases shared in the image also returned no results, further demonstrating that the image is fake and was not shared by BBC News. Amid the current outbreak, some monkeypox questions are still being researched. But available information contradicts the points made in the screenshot. First, monkeypox does not spread through the air. It is a rare disease caused by infection of the monkeypox virus, according to the CDC.  It spreads from person to person ""through close contact with someone who has a monkeypox rash, including through face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-skin contact,"" the WHO reported. This includes sexual contact. Monkeypox can spread through direct contact with monkeypox rash, scabs or bodily fluids from someone infected with the virus; touching objects, fabrics and surfaces that someone with monkeypox has used; and contact with respiratory secretions, according to the CDC. Someone who is pregnant can spread the virus to the fetus through the placenta, and people can also get monkeypox from infected animals. There’s no evidence the CDC classifies monkeypox as airborne or has said it can spread to people who are 15 feet away from someone who is infected.  ""Airborne transmission occurs when small virus particles become suspended in the air and can stay there for periods of time,"" the CDC said. ""These particles can spread on air currents, or sometimes even infect people who enter a room after the infected person has left. In contrast, monkeypox may be found in droplets like saliva or respiratory secretions that drop out of the air quickly.""  Airborne transmission of monkeypox has not been reported, the CDC said in June.   This image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) shows a colorized transmission electron micrograph of monkeypox particles (orange) found within an infected cell (brown), cultured in the laboratory. (NIAID via AP) Second, and contrary to the content in the fake image, monkeypox is not a form of herpes. The disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, the WHO reported. Genital herpes, meanwhile, is a sexually transmitted disease caused by two types of viruses: herpes simplex virus type 1 and herpes simplex virus type 2, according to the CDC. Monkeypox is ""not considered a sexually transmitted infection,"" according to the CDC’s monkeypox FAQ page.  The WHO says that ""while close physical contact is a well-known risk factor for transmission, it is unclear at this time if monkeypox can be transmitted specifically through sexual transmission routes. Studies are needed to better understand this risk."" Third, monkeypox does not typically last two to four months. The WHO and CDC report that symptoms typically last about two to four weeks.  Finally, the WHO does not list paralysis as one of the main complications of severe monkeypox cases. Some severe cases of infection can lead to medical complications including secondary infections, pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, confusion and infection of the cornea, which can cause vision loss, the WHO reported. Historically, between 1% and 10% of people with monkeypox have died. Monkeypox can also cause encephalitis, or the inflammation of the brain, which can sometimes cause severe symptoms, including seizures, memory problems, personality changes, paralysis and hearing or vision problems, according to Mayo Clinic.  A fake BBC News screenshot claims the CDC has classified monkeypox as an airborne form of herpes that typically lasts two to four months and can lead to paralysis.  The CDC and WHO haven’t changed how they classify monkeypox. The virus does not spread primarily through airborne transmission, is not a form of herpes, does not last two to four months and rarely leads to paralysis.

There’s no evidence that radiation emitted from Apple AirPods will cook your brain
","Will playing your tunes on AirPods damage your brain? Experts say no, but unproven claims that Apple’s popular wireless earpieces AirPods are dangerous because they emit high levels of radiation close to your brain are cropping up on social media. ""A lot of people ask me why I wear these headphones that have a cord instead of wearing AirPods,"" a man says in a video posted on Instagram Aug. 2. ""The answer is quite simple, because AirPods are essentially microwaving your brain."" ""They emit extremely high levels of EMFs,"" he goes on to say. ""These EMFs release radiation. And the last place you want to release radiation is in your brain. That’s essentially what you’re doing by wearing AirPods."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) To bolster his case, the video’s narrator cites a 2019 article with a headline that reads, ""​​More than 250 scientists warn EMF from wireless devices such as Apple's AirPods poses cancer risk.""  That article refers to a letter that a group of scientists sent to the heads of the United Nations and World Health Organization, expressing safety concerns about increased human exposure to electromagnetic fields from electronic and wireless devices. The letter was originally sent in 2015 and updated in 2019 to add signatories and change the names of addressees. Neither letter mentions Apple AirPods, which were introduced in 2016. We found no evidence that scientists have declared AirPods health hazards. We also found that AirPods emit levels of radiation far below government-established limits and far less than cellphones.  The video’s ""frightening claim is grossly inconsistent with views of health agencies,"" said Kenneth Foster, a professor emeritus of bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, who said he has studied radiofrequency energy’s health effects since the early 1970s.  Electromagnetic fields, or EMFs, are a combination of electric and magnetic fields of energy, or radiation, which are produced by electricity, according to the National Cancer Institute.  This radiation is categorized as high-frequency EMFs, or ionizing, which is produced by things like X-rays and gamma rays, and low-to-mid frequency EMFs, or nonionizing.  Wireless devices such as Bluetooth devices, wireless headphones, laptops and cellphones emit nonionizing EMFs as radiofrequency radiation, or RFs. Although prolonged exposure to ionizing EMFs could harm humans, low-level EMFs are thought to be harmless, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Services.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that ""scientific consensus shows that nonionizing radiation is not a carcinogen and, at or below the radio frequency exposure limits set by the (Federal Communications Commission), nonionizing radiation has not been shown to cause any harm to people."" ""There have been arguments — and overheated statements by activists — for many years about possible hazards of cellphones,"" said Foster. ""But health agencies have repeatedly reviewed the scientific literature and found no clear evidence for hazards from RF exposures from cellphones, and, by extension, Apple AirPods."" The National Institute of Cancer said that cellphones have not been proven to cause cancer in humans and notes that there has not been an increase in brain or central nervous system cancers since cellphones entered wide use. The World Health Organization said on a webpage dated in 2016 that ""based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research."" There is some evidence that radiation from cellphones can cause cancer in rats, according to studies published in 2018 by the National Toxicology Program. However, the animals in those studies were exposed to radiofrequency radiation over their whole bodies at much higher levels than the limits set for human exposure, so extrapolating risks for humans is difficult, it said. The American Cancer Society acknowledged that Bluetooth earpieces like AirPods emit radiofrequency radiation, and that ""possible health effects from these devices cannot be ruled out completely at this time."" Corded earphones, like the ones worn in the Instagram video, emit ""virtually no RF waves,"" it said, and could be an alternative for people wishing to limit exposure to these rays, The society said it has no official position on whether radiofrequency radiation can cause cancer. The Federal Communications Commission said that all wireless devices sold in the U.S. must meet guidelines on radiofrequency radiation exposure in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR), defined as a measure of the rate that RF energy is absorbed by the body. The allowable limit from wireless devices, it says, is 1.6 watts per kilogram, averaged over 1 gram of body tissue. The FCC stressed that there is no evidence of any health risks from wireless devices, but notes for concerned users that the small amount of RF energy released by wireless earpieces is much lower than from a cellphone, thus reducing total exposure to a person’s head. Apple did not return a request for comment, but told Reuters fact-checkers in 2021 that AirPods and AirPod Pros ""meet all applicable radio frequency exposure guidelines and limits"" and that they are ""more than two times below applicable limits for radio frequency exposure."" FCC reports of tests from the latest AirPod earbuds, left, and right, in 2021 support Apple’s assertion. An Instagram video alleges that AirPods are ""essentially microwaving your brain"" by emitting high levels of electromagnetic radiation. But the electromagnetic fields, or EMFs, the devices release as radiofrequency radiation are far below limits set by the government and much less than the cellphones they are used with, experts say. Although some researchers have expressed safety concerns about long-term exposure, there is no scientific evidence to link the low-level EMFs emitted by cellphones — and, by extension, wireless earpieces like AirPods — to cancer or other health problems in humans.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/aug/04/instagram-posts/theres-no-evidence-radiation-emitted-apple-airpods/

A GOP talking point suggests birth control is not at risk. Evidence suggests otherwise.
","Republicans who oppose abortion have new talking points — birth control will remain easily available following the Supreme Court’s decision overturning the federal right to abortion, and when Democrats say otherwise, they are just trying to scare voters. Variations on this claim were made by a series of Republicans on the House floor July 21, during debate on a bill that would add a right to contraception to federal law. Democrats advanced the bill as a way to ensure birth control’s availability before some abortion opponents can see whether the Supreme Court will overturn that right, too. ""This bill is completely unnecessary,"" said Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., a co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. ""In no way, shape, or form is access to contraception limited or at risk of being limited. The liberal majority is clearly trying to stoke fears and mislead the American people, once again, because in their minds stoking fear is clearly the only way that they can win."" We reached out to Cammack’s office to inquire about the basis for this statement, but received no response. Similar claims were made in the Senate as it declined to take up the House bill on July 27.  ""This idea that we ought to spend scarce time here in the Congress, which we have in limited supply, reaffirming rights that already exist is a clear political narrative designed to divert the American people’s attention from things that really are at risk,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. However, a review of documents and efforts in some states to change laws indicates there is significant evidence that birth control — or at least some forms of it — may be at risk legally. So, we dug in. The cornerstone for this concern can be found in Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade’s guarantee of access to abortion. Thomas suggested that having found no constitutional right to abortion, the court should next ""reconsider all of this court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold."" That is a reference to Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 case that established a right for married couples to use contraception (single people were granted that right in a separate case in 1972). In Griswold, the court found that the 14th Amendment’s due process clause protects the right to privacy. Thomas represents only one vote on the court, and the number of his fellow justices who share his opinion that the birth control case should be reversed is unclear. But the Supreme Court has already allowed some employers to decline to offer their workers contraceptive coverage based on their opposition to abortion.  At issue in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case, for example, was the religious belief of the craft store chain’s owners that some forms of contraception — including the ""morning-after"" pill and two types of intrauterine devices — could produce early abortions by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg. The court decided the government could not force the contraceptive coverage requirement from the Affordable Care Act on employers with those beliefs. Scientific evidence suggests that neither the morning-after pill (which is a higher dose of a hormone used in regular birth control pills) nor IUDs stop the implantation of a fertilized egg and therefore do not cause abortions. Still, the court ruled that the owners’ religious beliefs trumped the government’s interest in workers getting contraceptive coverage. ""That legal blurring of distinct scientific boundaries between abortion and birth control threatens contraceptive access in the United States,"" wrote professors Rachel VanSickle-Ward and Kevin Wallsten in The Washington Post. They predicted that some states ""will probably ban some forms of contraception outright, using the discredited idea that contraceptives act as abortifacients."" Confusion about how some forms of contraception work has led to efforts in several states to ban certain types of birth control. The most frequently targeted form of birth control is the morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy if taken within a few days of unprotected sex but which cannot interrupt an established pregnancy. It is not the same as the abortion pill, a regimen of two other medications that do end a pregnancy up to 10 weeks of gestation. And even if the birth control methods did prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman’s uterus, that would not be an abortion, at least not according to the medical community. Although many religious groups and abortion opponents argue that human life begins when the egg is fertilized, there is a consensus among doctors, scientists, and legal experts that pregnancy begins at implantation. And, they point out, an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. Roughly half of all fertilized eggs never implant. Even before Roe was overturned, lawmakers in Idaho called for hearings to ban emergency contraception, and Missouri lawmakers tried to bar Medicaid from paying for the morning-after pill and IUDs. Anti-abortion groups are pushing the idea. ""Plan B is Capable of Causing an Early Abortion,"" said a fact sheet from Students for Life of America, referring to the name of a brand of the morning-after pill. Model legislation from the National Right to Life Committee would ban abortion from the moment of fertilization, not implantation. The bottom line, wrote professors VanSickle-Ward and Wallsten before the decision overturning Roe was even final, is that ""the court doesn’t have to formally end legal protection for contraception use."" ""If it allows plaintiffs to call contraception abortion, and Dobbs ends legal protection for abortion, then contraception is at risk."" It is true that, so far, no state has banned forms of contraception. But the threat appears very real. And the absolute nature of Cammack’s statement — saying there’s ""no way, shape, or form"" that access to contraception is at risk — is not accurate. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2022/aug/04/kat-cammack/gop-talking-point-suggests-birth-control-not-risk-/

GOP claim on tax hikes in Democratic bill doesn’t factor in subsidies, savings
","Soon after Senate Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Chuck Schumer of New York announced an agreement on a bill that offered a pared-down version of President Joe Biden’s remaining policy agenda, Republicans cast the legislation as a big tax hike. The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page pointed to a study by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation that found that ""average tax rates will increase for nearly every income category in 2023 under the bill. This gives the lie to Democratic claims that no one earning under $400,000 will pay more taxes under the bill, a promise Mr. Biden also made in his campaign. The reality is that the Schumer-Manchin bill is a tax increase on nearly every American."" GOP officeholders and candidates echoed this line of attack on the bill.  Adam Laxalt, the Republican challenging Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., for a U.S. Senate seat, tweeted July 30 that the bill will ""increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket."" The latest reckless tax-and-spend proposal from Senate Democrats (mislabeled the “Inflation Reduction Act”) will increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket.It’s clear that a vote for @CortezMasto is a vote for more taxes and less money in your pocket. Laxalt communications director Courtney Holland confirmed that the tweet was referring to the same Joint Committee on Taxation analysis. However, the committee’s analysis tells only part of the story because it looks at the burden of tax increases under the bill without looking at other elements of the legislation intended to negate the added tax burdens. The bill Manchin and Schumer announced, which includes both new spending and new taxation, can pass the Senate with only Democratic votes in the evenly divided Senate because of a procedural status known as ""reconciliation."" The tax provisions are aimed at wealthy money managers and big companies. One of the two big tax elements would significantly scale back a tax code provision known as ""carried interest,"" which lets money managers pay taxes on much of their income at capital-gains rates, which are lower than the regular rates for personal income. The other provision would make it harder for companies reporting at least $1 billion in profits to escape corporate income taxes. Such companies would have to pay at least 15% in such taxes, which many currently do not. On the spending side, the bill would offer a mix of programs to curb climate change. It is far more limited than the Green New Deal, a climate-change policy blueprint supported by progressive Democrats that never advanced in either chamber of Congress. The bill would also allow Medicare for the first time to negotiate prices with drugmakers and extend for three years certain subsidies to Americans who get their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also allocate additional funding to the Internal Revenue Service to improve tax compliance; this provision is expected to bring back to the Treasury an amount greater than the added spending.  Here are some aspects of the bill that Laxalt and others didn’t mention. The critics have a point in saying that the Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found higher taxes, on average, in every income bracket.  Overall, the federal tax burden for all Americans would rise by 1.4%. For those earning between $30,000 and $100,000, the increase would be less than 1%; for those earning less or more, the increase would exceed 1%. (An individual household’s tax burden may go up or down; the 1.4% figure is an average.) ""I think it is fair to say this tax plan impacts these households,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. But there’s an important caveat: The joint committee looked only at the tax side of the bill, not at spending provisions that could cancel out those tax increases. The study ""is informative but not comprehensive,"" wrote the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors deficit reduction and has been skeptical of many of Biden’s legislative efforts, citing their cost. ""In particular, it’s important to note that the (bill) does not raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 per year. It will indirectly affect those households in a number of ways, but even then, the net effect is likely to be to increase their real disposable income."" For instance, the bill’s climate provisions would offer tax credits to people who buy electric vehicles and implement energy-efficiency improvements, and to companies that make renewable energy equipment. Of even greater importance to Americans on the lower end of the income spectrum are subsidies for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies would be extended for three years rather than ending by the close of this year. Also important for a broad range of Americans would be the drug-negotiation provision for Medicare, although the impact might take longer to land than for the other provisions. ""Before relitigating the debate over President Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on households making less than $400,000 a year, it’s worth keeping these missing pieces in mind,"" wrote William G. Gale and John Buhl for the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that the $64 billion in health insurance subsidies alone ""would be more than enough"" to erase the tax increases for people earning less than $400,000 under the Joint Commission on Taxation’s analysis. The group said the bill overall would provide a net tax cut starting in 2027, once higher tax compliance and lower drug costs begin to make a significant impact. The bill’s effects on average taxpayers will not be felt in the same way as income and payroll taxes. Rather, the rise in tax burdens stems from the increase in corporate taxes. Corporations tend to pass the cost of these tax increases to regular people through lower returns for investors and lower wages for workers. The Tax Policy Center and other groups that study tax policy use mathematical models to project how changes in the tax code, including corporate taxes, would affect taxpayers of varying income levels.  In the Tax Policy Center’s model, 80% of the corporate tax increase would be borne by corporate shareholders. The remaining 20% would be borne by workers through reduced wages. This is close to the breakdowns used by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some households could be hit by both impacts. For instance, members of a household might see lower returns on the stock investments in their 401(k) retirement plans and lower wages. But because these effects don’t show up on a person’s tax returns or receipts for gasoline, some experts say it’s unfair to call them a ""tax hike."" Five former Treasury secretaries — Hank Paulson (who served under President George W. Bush), Robert Rubin and Larry Summers (who served under President Bill Clinton), and Tim Geithner and Jacob Lew (who served under President Barack Obama) — signed a statement in which they supported the bill and rejected the argument that its provisions represent a tax increase. ""Taxes due or paid will not increase for any family making less than $400,000 a year,"" they wrote. ""And the extra taxes levied on corporations do not reflect increases in the corporate tax rate, but rather the reclaiming of revenue lost to tax avoidance and provisions benefitting the most affluent."" Laxalt said the Democratic bill would ""increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket."" An analysis by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation did find that every income group would lose ground from the bill’s tax changes — approximately 1%. However, this analysis didn’t factor in the ways ordinary Americans would gain from the bill, including subsidies for energy efficiency and clean energy, the continuation of expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and lower drug prices because of Medicare negotiations. Independent experts expect these benefits to cancel out, or reverse, the bill’s tax impacts. Characterizing the bill as a blanket tax hike obscures how the prescribed taxes would be levied directly on very large corporations and high-earning money managers. The impact on ordinary Americans comes from difficult-to-measure secondary effects. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2022/aug/03/adam-laxalt/gop-claim-tax-hikes-democratic-bill-doesnt-factor-/

Proposed assault weapons ban won’t turn gun owners into felons overnight
","Democratic leaders and President Joe Biden have hailed an assault-style weapons ban that the House of Representatives has advanced to the Senate as a way to address the epidemic of gun violence in America. But an Instagram post from the day before is framing the proposed legislation as a way to criminalize gun owners. The now-deleted July 28 post features a manipulated image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., holding a crumpled copy of the U.S. Constitution. ""Thanks to gun-grabbing radicals, Nancy Pelosi now holds the fate of your second amendment rights in the palm of her rotting hand,"" text that's superimposed over the image read. A caption that was with the original Instagram post claimed the assault weapons ban would ""turn 150 million Americans into felons overnight."" But the post is being hyperbolic. The proposed assault weapons ban would allow current gun owners to keep the semi-automatic weapons they already have, they just wouldn’t be able to buy new ones.  Similar claims about gun owners potentially being turned into felons because of the proposed ban have been shared elsewhere on social media.  The offices of Reps. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and David Cicilline, D-R.I., confirmed that existing gun owners will not be penalized under the bill and would not become felons overnight, as implied in the Instagram post. Nadler is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which advanced the bill to the House floor; Cicilline sponsored the measure. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) H.R. 1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022, was proposed after a spate of mass shootings, including ones in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, that were perpetrated by men wielding AR-15-style rifles. It would make it illegal to manufacture, sell, transfer, import or possess semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. The U.S. previously passed an assault weapons ban in 1994, but it expired after 10 years. Although the bill passed the House with a 217-213 vote and near unanimous support from Democrats, it’s not expected to advance in the Senate, as it’s unlikely to get the 60 votes needed to overcome an expected Republican filibuster. If the measure passes the Senate, it would prohibit semi-automatic rifles, shotguns and pistols that can use a detachable magazine and have at least one type of military feature, such as a pistol grip, folding or detachable stock or threaded barrel. Rifles and shotguns made specifically for sporting or hunting are not a part of the ban.  Certain law enforcement efforts and authorized tests are exempted from the bill as are any actions related to securing nuclear materials. Also, retired law enforcement officers would be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. Any semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines made after the bill takes effect would be required to display their manufacturing dates and serial numbers; no such requirement currently exists. People who lawfully own semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines would have their ownership grandfathered in, provided the guns are securely stored in a way that prevents them from being accessed by another person. If people sell or transfer grandfathered weapons, the bill would require them to check the backgrounds of the people receiving them. Also, someone who had high-capacity magazines could keep them, but wouldn’t be able to sell or transfer them. The bill would also allow funding for state and local governments to buy back semi-automatic weapons or high-capacity magazines from people who own them. The Instagram post’s claim of 150 million Americans is also questionable. There is no national gun registry and federal law prohibits using the background check system to create one. So, the true number of gun owners in the country is unknown. Surveys may provide a rough estimate. Gallup found around 32% of adults it surveyed in 2020 said they own at least one gun. The 2020 U.S. Census counted 258.3 million adults 18 and older living in the United States. Thirty-two percent of them would be 82.6 million. A survey by Centiment in 2021 found results similar to Gallup’s. The company found that 31.9% of people surveyed reported owning a firearm and concluded that at least 81 million U.S. adults are gun owners — nowhere near the 150 million implied in the Instagram post. An Instagram post claimed the proposed assault weapons bill being considered by Congress will turn 150 million gun owners into felons overnight. The bill includes a provision that would allow lawful owners of semi-automatic weapons to keep them, but not sell or transfer them. The bill would also prohibit them from buying additional semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.   Also, because no national gun registry exists, it’s unknown how many gun owners there are in the country. However, a recent survey estimated there are about 81 million Americans who are gun owners, not 150 million, as the post implies. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/aug/03/instagram-posts/proposed-assault-weapons-ban-wont-turn-gun-owners-/

Oz distorts Fetterman’s position of ending mandatory life sentences for certain murders
","John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor and the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, has advocated for ending mandatory life sentences for what is known as felony murder. But he has not called for eliminating life sentences for all murders, despite a claim in a TV ad by physician and former TV talk show host Mehmet Oz, the Republican Senate nominee. ""Failed liberal policies are making us less safe,"" the narrator says in the ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and approved by Oz. ""Yet John Fetterman wants to release one-third of prisoners and eliminate life sentences for murderers.""  PolitiFact rated Oz’s claim about releasing one-third of prisoners Mostly False. Fetterman has not called for that; he did highlight what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s former corrections secretary that the state’s prison population could be reduced by one-third without a risk to public safety. Oz’s new claim about Fetterman wanting to ""eliminate"" life sentences for murders is similarly distorted. The Nov. 8 matchup between Oz and Fetterman is rated by campaign watchers as ""tilts Republican"" and a toss-up. The outcome could decide which party controls the Senate, which is split 50-50. A national report highlighted Pennsylvania as one of nine states that mandate life-without-parole sentences for what is known as felony murder.  Felony murder is holding a person liable for murder if the person participated in a felony that resulted in someone’s death. For example, if two people participated in a robbery in which a person was shot and killed, the person who did not do the shooting could be convicted of felony murder. The March report from The Sentencing Project, a group that advocates against extreme punishments, found that more than 1,100 people in Pennsylvania were serving life-without-parole sentences for felony murder, which is classified as second-degree murder in the state. In making the claim about life sentences, the Oz ad refers to a June 1, 2021, article in the Pennsylvania Capital-Star, which describes itself as a news source on state government that also offers progressive commentary. The article notes Fetterman’s position in favor of eliminating life sentences for second-degree murder and quotes him at a town hall with reform advocates saying: ""These folks are not Hannibal Lecter. These are individuals that may have been involved in a bad decision, terrible mistake, or something that they had no idea was going to occur."" The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not offer more information to back the ad’s claim. Fetterman repeatedly said in 2021 that the Pennsylvania law should be changed. He wrote about commissioning a report he said ""clearly spelled out the need to abolish Pennsylvania's horrible and immoral practice"" of mandatory life sentences for  second-degree murder.   The law ""ruins lives that could be rehabilitated while costing taxpayers billions and leaving them no safer as a result,"" he said when the report was released. The report said that, as of Sept. 30, 2019, 1,166 people were in Pennsylvania prisons serving life-without-parole sentences for second-degree, or felony, murder. The accomplice in such cases ""could have stood outside a convenience store as the lookout to a robbery that escalated into a death, driven the ‘get-away’ car, or helped to plan the felony with no idea that a gun or other weapon would be involved,"" the report said. Fetterman’s campaign noted that a March 2020 York Daily Record news article paraphrased Fetterman as saying there are people who should die in prison because they've committed heinous crimes. He was quoted in that article saying, ""Justice isn't giving somebody the equivalent sentence who was sitting outside in a getaway car to the individual that made the decision to shoot an innocent person."" The campaign also cited Fetterman’s votes on Pennsylvania’s Board of Pardons, which he chairs, to deny clemency to people who sought a commutation of their life sentences.  Oz said in an ad that Fetterman wants to ""eliminate life sentences for murderers."" Fetterman has not called for eliminating life sentences for murder. He has called for reversing Pennsylvania’s law that mandates life-without-parole sentences for second-degree murder, or so-called felony murder, for defendants who are accessories in a killing. In those cases, the defendants are involved in felony crimes, such as robbery, that result in a death, but they were not directly responsible for the killing.  Oz’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.  RELATED: Fact-checking ads in the 2022 election campaigns RELATED: Pennsylvania fact-checks",/factchecks/2022/aug/03/mehmet-oz/oz-distorts-fettermans-position-ending-mandatory-l/

Actually, internet, the sun, moon and stars are not 'out of place'
","Is your weather forecaster lying to you? According to a viral Facebook post, yes.  And it’s about more than impending rain. This time, it's about the cosmos.  ""The Sun is out of place, the Moon is out of place and the stars are out of place. The compases are off,"" wrote a Facebook user on July 29, 2022.  The post goes on to suggest other meteorological abnormalities are being covered up, as well, like ""electrified neon double rainbows,"" ""Blood red fiery sunrises and sunsets,"" and skies ""glowing abnormally red, orange, purple, yellow, (and) green."" The post claims that the cause of all this drama is an impending ""Global Pole Shift Cataclysm"" that is a mere 22 weeks away.  And the grimmest warning, misspelling meteorologists: ""These metrologists are going to comfort you with lies until it's too late."" It makes for a great intro to a sci-fi novel, but otherwise, this claim is entirely invented. Experts confirm that the position of the sun, moon and stars has not moved in unexpected ways, and there have been no dramatic changes in either the magnetic or geographic poles.   (Screenshot from Facebook) The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) To understand the claim fully, let’s go back to science class.  The apparent position of the sun and moon is constantly changing, said Shannon Schmoll, director of Michigan State University’s Abrams Planetarium. This is because of the Earth’s tilt relative to the sun — the same tilt that causes changing seasons and longer or shorter days throughout the year. The tilt of the moon’s orbit can also affect where the moon appears in the sky. Even stars, over thousands of years, can shift because of their motion around the galaxy, but these changes require sensitive telescopes and are often imperceptible, said Schmoll. ""All of these (movements) are highly predictable,"" Schmoll said. ""We have been tracking these regular changes for much of human history."" Schmoll is not aware of any recent anomalies in the position of the sun, moon or stars and said, ""There are folks outside, amateur and professional alike, who are out almost every night and would notice something off.""  ""Astronomers are actively engaged in the measurement of the dynamic universe,"" said Dominic Benford, NASA program scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. ""Daily observations result in the measurement of millions of objects, and these data are made available to the worldwide astronomical community.""  Physicists frequently study the motion of the sun and moon, and their movements are well understood, Benford said. ""Any significant anomalies in the positions of these would be quickly seen and followed up by the thousands of scientists, and would become well-known. The lack of such announcements is not merely consistent with, but likely predictive of there being no unexpected anomalies in the motions of solar system or Milky Way objects."" So, if the sun and moon aren’t moving, perhaps we are? The Facebook post claims that the freak astronomy is because of a shift in the North and South poles. Good news for polar bears and penguins, this claim is also false.  The Earth actually has two North and South poles: the geographic poles around which the Earth rotates, and the magnetic poles, where our compasses point.  The magnetic North and South poles exist because of Earth’s liquid, metallic core, which creates a geomagnetic field that surrounds our planet. This ""magnetosphere"" is incredibly important for life on Earth, protecting us from solar winds, particle radiation and cosmic rays that would erode our atmosphere.  And because of ""convective flows and magnetohydrodynamic waves"" within the Earth’s liquid core, our magnetic poles drift, said Arnaud Chulliat, a senior research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the lead developer of the World Magnetic Model. For three centuries, the magnetic North Pole wandered around the northern part of Canada, but Chulliat said that between the late 1980s and early 2000s, the drift rate accelerated from about 15 kilometers/year to about 55 km/year and began moving toward Siberia. Chulliat said that drift speed has since plateaued and even slightly decreased according to recent models. (A kilometer is 0.62 miles)  The magnetic poles can even flip, causing our compasses to point south. On the geologic time scale, it is relatively common. Over the last 20 million years, flips have occurred about every 200,000 to 300,000 years, with the last flip happening around 780,000 years ago. Flips are not instantaneous; they take place over hundreds or thousands of years.  Both Chulliat and geophysicist Ciaran Beggan at the British Geological Institute said there have been no unexpected or concerning changes in the constantly monitored magnetic field, and despite online claims, Beggan said there is ""no evidence of an immediate or imminent reversal.""  The geographic poles are much stabler. According to researchers, during the 20th century, the geographic poles drifted 4 inches a year, totaling 11 yards of shift by the turn of the century. Recently the drift rate has accelerated, and some researchers have linked it to climate change and melting ice caps, which can alter Earth’s mass distribution. But since 1980, the poles have still drifted only 13 feet, reported USA Today.  Lastly, because of a tidal-force-induced bulge at the equator, the Earth wobbles slightly as it rotates. The process is called axial precession, and the Earth behaves like an off-kilter spinning toy top. But the wobble occurs over a 26,000-year cycle, and its effects are not noticeable in our lifetimes, said Schmoll.  Our solar system has many moving parts. Even the core of our big blue marble is in motion. But there is no evidence that the sun, moon or stars are ""out of place"" or moving differently than what astronomers would expect.  There is also no evidence of a current or impending shift in either the magnetic or geographic poles. They both move, but slowly.  Conclusion? You can probably trust your weather forecaster.  We rate this claim Pants On Fire!",/factchecks/2022/aug/03/facebook-posts/actually-internet-sun-moon-and-stars-are-not-out-p/

B12 found in children’s vitamins is safe — here’s why
","Chewable Flintstones vitamins have been around for generations, outliving the popular cartoon TV show for which they were named. But a video shared on social media claims the childhood supplement is potentially deadly. ""The Toxic Ingredient in Your Kids Vitamins,"" read the words across the top of the July 28 Facebook video that shared a clip from a podcast. In it, guest Gary Brecka warns against the vitamin B12, which he says is an ingredient in Flintstones and other supplements. ""The most common form of B12 in the world is entirely synthetic. We make it from hydrogen cyanide,"" said Brecka, who describes himself in his LinkedIn profile as founder of a Florida-based health business. ""It’s called cyanocobalamin. It’s a cyanide-based B12. I mean it’s hard to believe that we’re allowed to make vitamins out of hydrogen cyanide in this country, but we are. Flintstones vitamins have cyanocobalamin.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Is it true that children’s vitamins have synthetic cyanide? We reached out to Brecka to ask for more information to support his statements, but did not receive a response in time for publication. Flintstones vitamins do contain cyanocobalamin, which is man-made B12. But the video’s claim that the ingredient is toxic is wrong.  The Mayo Clinic describes B12 as a vitamin that ""plays an essential role in red blood cell formation, cell metabolism, nerve function and the production of DNA, the molecules inside cells that carry genetic information.""  According to the National Institutes of Health, B12 is naturally present in some foods, notably animal products, and dissolves in water. It’s also added to foods or given as a supplement, the agency wrote. In The synthetic form, cyanocobalamin, is usually given to people who have low levels of B12. NIH’s fact sheet for health professionals says B12 has a ""low potential for toxicity."" The agency notes that cyanocobalamin is also safe — no overdosage occurs.

""Even at large doses, vitamin B12 is generally considered to be safe because the body does not store excess amounts,"" read the fact sheet. A separate NIH fact sheet, written for consumers, also states that B12 supplements are safe, even at doses higher than recommended — and for the same reason: ""the body absorbs only a small percentage of it,"" it says. Dr. Herman B. Gray, chair of Wayne State University’s Department of Pediatrics, told PolitiFact that for most people, eating a balanced, healthy diet provides enough B12, and taking a supplement is usually unnecessary. But, he said, ""it is safe to take in prescribed dosages, including for children."" Cyanocobalamin is not the same as the poison cyanide, Gray said. Cyanocobalamin has only a molecule of cyanide, which is not enough to cause poisoning.

In an article on B12 supplements, the science and technology news site Gizmodo explained it this way: ""Don’t panic. The body can deal with small amounts of cyanide, usually by using sodium thiosulfate, converting the cyanide ions to thiocyanate, which you then excrete. Cyanocobalamin is safe, and found in food additives, health supplements and the injections that doctors give patients with anemia.""  Gray concurred, noting that B12 has been used safely for decades. ""Vitamin B-12 or cyanocobalamin is not toxic,"" he said.  A video on a Facebook post claims that the synthetic form of B12 found in children’s vitamins  is toxic.  Cyanocobalamin is man-made B12, but health organizations and pediatricians say it’s safe to consume.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2022/aug/02/facebook-posts/b12-found-childrens-vitamins-safe-heres-why/

Chinese commentator, not government, made threat about Pelosi flying to Taiwan

Kleefisch off the mark with claim linking worker shortage and medical assistance enrollments
","In a recent Republican gubernatorial debate on WTMJ-TV, Rebecca Kleefisch put a different spin on unemployment and the state’s workforce. Here is how her staff relayed the comment in a July 24, 2022 tweet, issued even as the debate continued: ""There is absolutely no reason why Wisconsin should be facing a worker shortage to the level we are when there are 123,000 more able-bodied childless adults on BadgerCare since the pandemic. We need to get Wisconsinites off welfare and into work that pays!""  Kleefisch, a two-term lieutenant governor, was joined in the GOP debate by businessman Tim Michels and state Rep. Tim Ramthun, R-Campbellsport. The primary election is Aug. 9, 2022, with the winner facing Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat. We were interested in whether Kleefisch had her numbers right — but also whether it’s as simple as putting any able-bodied adult on BadgerCare into an available job. Spoiler alert: It’s much more complicated than that. When asked for backup for the claim, Kleefisch staffer Mattias Gugel pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Department of Health Services statistics on Medicaid.  Those numbers show that in February 2020, just before the pandemic,  total Medicaid childless adult enrollment was 152,046. In June of 2022, enrollment was at 277,939 — an increase of 125,893.  Gugel said Kleefisch was using May numbers, when the increase would have been 123,311.  He also argued that the use of the phrase ""to the level"" meant Kleefisch ""doesn't believe this was some cure-all to fix the worker shortage.""  Fair enough. But that was the thrust of the argument — that those able-bodied people on Medicaid could make a big dent in the worker shortage. Indeed, Gugel also told us that, in Kleefisch’s view, Evers and President Joe Biden are ""refusing to remove individuals from Medicaid who should no longer be eligible. The availability of government benefits is a disincentive to work, therefore a contributing factor to the worker shortage problem."" So, that framing — the way it is being presented to voters — makes a difference in our analysis, and causes us to give more weight to that side of the equation.  Elizabeth Goodsitt, a Department of Health Services communications specialist, said the claim — and the way Gugel says Kleefisch is framing it — relies on two faulty premises: ""One, the state could simply remove individuals from BadgerCare Plus at any time, and two that working and being on BadgerCare Plus are mutually exclusive. Both are inaccurate."" On the removal front, Goodsitt said federal law ""effectively bars states from changing or terminating Medicaid coverage until after the (COVID) public health emergency ends."" At this time, that is not set to expire until Oct. 13, 2022. On the working front, she said historically more than 45% of those childless adults are employed, adding: ""They enroll in BadgerCare Plus because they are underemployed and do not have health insurance available through their jobs."" What’s more, although there is a worker shortage in many areas, Kleefisch in her claim neglects to recognize that employment in Wisconsin has reached historic highs — and unemployment is near record lows. ""The state’s ‘labor force participation rate’ (measuring the share of the working-age population in the labor force) is 66.5%,"" Laura Dresser, associate director at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Center on Wisconsin Strategy, told us via email. ""That’s higher than it was before the pandemic and substantially higher than the national rate of 62.3%.  Jennifer Sereno, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development’s communications director, pointed to similar statistics and noted they ""would appear to undermine the assertion that participation in BadgerCare is affecting employment and labor force participation""  Finally, worker shortages are about more than the Medicaid benefits. Sachin Shivaram, CEO of Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc, laid out his perspective in a May 2021 opinion piece that ran in USA Today Network-Wisconsin newspapers. ""Since the start of the pandemic, the labor force in America has shrunk by about 4 million people,"" he wrote. ""This does not include workers on unemployment, because they are technically considered to be in the labor force."" He also pointed to demographic issues: ""Our overall population grew by just 7% in the past 10 years while the economy grew by 50%. Add to that, baby boomers are retiring in droves."" There are other factors, too, including slower rates of immigration and the mismatch between skills that employers seek and the skills job seekers have.  ""The pandemic displaced millions of low-skilled workers in economic sectors like hospitality and retail,"" Shivaram wrote. ""But the jobs that are in highest demand now are in sectors like manufacturing and truck driving that generally require specific training."" So, the picture is far, far more complex than Kleefisch suggests. In other words, there are reasons — many of them — behind the worker shortage, ones that go far beyond the number of able-bodied childless adults on BadgerCare.  Kleefisch claimed, ""There is absolutely no reason why Wisconsin should be facing a worker shortage to the level we are when there are 123,000 more able-bodied childless adults on BadgerCare since the pandemic.""  She was on target with the 123,000 figure, but is off the mark when she links the number so strongly to the worker shortage. First, many of those 123,000 may already be working. And they may not be able to step into many of the open jobs without additional training. What’s more, the claim greatly oversimplifies the economy and the factors helping create the workers shortage, from baby boomers retiring to lower immigration to the mismatch between worker skills and open jobs.  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2022/aug/02/rebecca-kleefisch/kleefisch-mark-claim-linking-worker-shortage-and-m/

No, pens provided by Arizona election officials aren’t part of a plot to rig state primary
","Remember Sharpiegate, the baseless 2020 election fraud claim that made Maricopa County, Arizona, an election night social media sensation? Viral videos claimed that ballots marked with Sharpie pens were being invalidated. We found that False. RELATED VIDEO As voters head to the polls again for Arizona’s Aug. 2 primary, a similar claim is raising election skeptics’ ire, this time about the Pentel felt-tip pens Maricopa is providing. One Twitter user suggested the pens were a tool to rig elections by Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican.  ""#SharpieGate all over again in AZ. Bring your ball-point pens. Make sure that there’s no bleed-through on your ballot to avoid adjudication,"" wrote one person on Twitter. ""@stephen_richer is hoping you trip up the rigged election software so he and his TREASONISTS can rig the primaries."" Another Twitter user advised voters to ""use your own pen."" State Rep. Shawnna Bolick, a Republican primary candidate for secretary of state, and Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers, also suggested there is something problematic with Maricopa’s pens. We’ll get right to the point: We found no evidence that the pens are a plot to rig the elections.  Maricopa County has used Pentel felt-tip pens as the preferred ballot marking pen for decades, said Megan Gilbertson, spokesperson for Maricopa’s elections office. In 2020, the county moved to Sharpies because the ink was recommended by the election equipment manufacturer, Dominion Voting. While claims that the pens caused ballot invalidation were wrong, Richer told PolitiFact Sharpies ""caused more bleed-through than we like."" So the county tested out the Pentel pens and decided to use them instead. ""Because you are feeding your ballot directly into the tabulation equipment after voting, the ink needs to dry quickly so it doesn’t leave any residue that can build up inside the tabulator and necessitate cleaning midday,"" Richer said. ""Ballpoint and gel pens leave more residue.""  Anything that causes election workers to stop and clean up the machines could slow down the process of voting. Another problem with slow-drying pens: They can smudge ovals that a voter doesn’t intend to mark. Voters who cast a mail ballot can use any blue or black pen because the ink has time to dry before it arrives and goes through a tabulator, Richer said. Most of the primary ballots are one-sided, so there isn’t typically an issue with bleed-through to the other side, Richer said. For any ballots with two sides, the columns are offset so that any bleedthrough wouldn’t interfere with tabulation. Maricopa created a one-minute video showing the pens they provide to voters and how other pens can create problematic smudges. If voters show up on Election Day and insist on using their own blue or black pens, they will be allowed to do so. But poll workers have been advised to notify voters that the pen provided by the county is the best option, and if they use their own, they should allow it to dry.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology political science professor Charles Stewart, an election technology expert, said there is no worry about pens with respect to security, but there are concerns when it comes to accuracy. ""It has been known for decades that smudging is a problem with ballots, both the printed ballots themselves and the pens used to mark them,"" Stewart said. ""The Maricopa County video is 100% accurate in what it states. Voters ignore the advice at their peril."" We sent Maricopa’s video to two other experts on elections, Judd Choate, Colorado’s state election director, and Jennifer Morrell, a former election official in Utah and Colorado and a partner at The Elections Group, which consults on election administration. Both backed Maricopa’s explanation. The claims about bleeding pens might sound amusing, but they are part of a never-ending stream of misinformation about elections that threaten the democratic process. The Arizona Republic reported that in the days surrounding the pen misinformation, Richer faced death threats.  Richer has tried to debunk the misinformation on social media. ""It's a primary,"" Richer tweeted. ""What the heck do you think we get out of giving people a special pen other than a smooth functioning election? Do you think we're just asking you to use the Pentel pen to be funny? Good lord people."" Social media users have suggested there is something wrong with the Pentel pens provided by Maricopa elections officials and that they are part of a plot to rig the Arizona primary Aug. 2. The county tested the pens and found they dry quickly, which helps during in-person voting when voters feed their ballots into the tabulation machine. If voters use a pen that doesn’t dry quickly, it can smudge the ballot or muck up the tabulation machine, requiring cleaning and slowing the voting process. We found no evidence the pens are part of a nefarious scheme by election officials.  We rate this statement False.

Fact-checking Blake Masters: Mark Kelly voted to legalize abortion ‘up until the moment of birth’
","In the abortion debate, Republicans have long claimed that Democrats support abortion without limit. During a Trump rally in his state, Arizona Republican and U.S. Senate hopeful Blake Masters deployed a version of this barb against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. ""He voted to legalize abortion up until the moment of birth,"" Masters said July 22. Arizona’s primary election is Aug. 2, and polling puts Masters in the lead for the Republican nomination.  Masters’ campaign told us he was referring to Kelly’s vote for the Women’s Health Protection Act. ""The legislation, which Kelly also co-sponsored, mandates abortion on-demand until the moment of birth as federal law,"" said Masters campaign adviser Katie Miller. ""It also removes nearly all existing state-level guardrails around abortion."" Masters’ claim fails to align with the facts for several reasons, most of them rooted in his focus on the very end of a full-term pregnancy. In a May 2022 vote — before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — Kelly backed the Women's Health Protection Act as a way to affirm the legal right to an abortion. It barred states from passing laws that prohibited abortion ""after fetal viability when a provider determines the pregnancy risks the patient's life or health."" The bill failed on a 46-48 vote. Contrary to what Master’s campaign said, the bill’s text does not mandate abortion on demand ""until the moment of birth."" The woman would play a key role in any decision, but a plain reading of the text places equal responsibility in the hands of the physician. That fails to meet the commonly used definition of ""abortion on demand."" ""‘On demand’ means whenever I want, for whatever reason, or no reason,"" said Drexel University law professor David Cohen.  Requiring the provider’s agreement to the procedure is ""the polar opposite,"" Cohen said. Dr. Nisha Verma is a fellow at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a practicing OB-GYN in Delaware. Verma said that Masters’ claim is based on the false premise that pregnancies are being aborted in the very final weeks in the absence of a lethal fetal anomaly, or a health crisis. Generally, women who carry a pregnancy to that point, she said, want to keep their babies. ""I have cared for people who do receive terrible fetal diagnoses,"" Verma said. ""For example, that their baby has not developed a brain and will not survive after birth, or who face life-threatening medical conditions and who need abortions in the third trimester.""  Verma said these situations are rare. At the national level, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks abortions by the weeks of gestation. Terminations that take place at 21 weeks or later account for about 1% of all abortions. Arizona’s department of health services doesn’t have this data on its website, but slightly more granular information can be found in Texas. Texas data shows abortions that occur at 26 weeks or later. From 2008 through 2021, those represented about 0.01% of abortions.  Verma emphasized that when the woman faces a health crisis, abortion is far from the first option. ""I counsel my patients about the options, and in many situations, based on my patient's wishes, proceed with an induction of labor or C-section that aims to protect both the patient and the baby,"" Verma said. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology sees signs that fear of strict abortion penalties has pushed doctors to delay medical treatment for pregnancies with severe complications. The Women’s Health Protection Act can’t legalize something that is already legal. There are health exceptions in state abortion laws, and civil liability laws support medical intervention in grievous circumstances. Teresa Collett, law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, has argued in favor of abortion restrictions and served on the Roman Catholic Pontifical Council for the Family.  ""Every state has an emergency exception in their general civil liability laws, and every state law limiting abortion to certain gestational ages or methods has a more specific emergency exception,"" Collett said. A century of civil liability legislation has given doctors a legal responsibility to give the best possible care.  It is a complex legal framework, hugely driven by the facts of each individual situation. Maxwell Mehlman, law professor and co-director of the Law-Medicine Center at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said that generally, in these settings, physicians must intervene. ""The doctor has a legal duty to take reasonable steps to preserve the life and health of the patient,"" Mehlman said. ""If they don’t, in the most egregious situations, this has led to criminal prosecutions."" Anti-abortion laws complicate this legal guidance, Mehlman said. Even with an exception for the life and health of the woman, they create a legal hazard for hospitals and doctors. Under liability law, providers should intervene. Under a state’s abortion statute, they could face criminal sanctions. ""The doctor is between a rock and a hard place,"" Mehlman said. The bill Kelly supported would did not have changed how current laws would apply to abortions in the final weeks of pregnancy. But it would have prohibited states from criminalizing abortions. Abortion opponents say that under the Women’s Health Protection Act, the definition of ""the patient's life or health"" is vague. Collett at the University of St. Thomas said past court rulings on abortion show how broadly those terms could apply. ""The health exception, without any statutory qualification, includes psychological health and other non-physical aspects including age and familial status,"" Collett said. ""Such a broad interpretation is probable given the rules of interpretation contained in the Women’s Health Protection Act."" In theory, the bill could allow an abortion that is not strictly because of physical health. The question is, do such cases exist?  We did not find data on abortions taking place very late in pregnancy in the absence of a physical, medical crisis. We asked Collett whether she knew of an instance when a non-health issue has led to an abortion so late in pregnancy. She said she did not. We asked the National Right to Life Committee for the same information. They pointed to testimony in the mid-1990s from a doctor who performed abortions. The doctor said pregnancies after 26 weeks were ""interrupted because of maternal risk, rape, incest, psychiatric or pediatric indications."" The last term applied to teenage pregnancies. The committee’s press office said that reasons such as psychiatric and teenage pregnancies are evidence that a broad definition of health would apply to the Women’s Health Protection Act.  But when we asked for an example of an abortion taking place in the final weeks for anything other than a clear medical crisis, the committee provided none. Masters’ claim presented a legal conundrum for which there’s no evidence. Additionally, the testimony from the mid-1990s covered a different time span than the final weeks of pregnancy that Masters spoke about. Masters said that Kelly voted to ""legalize abortion up until the moment of birth."" Kelly voted for the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would have prohibited states from banning abortion of a viable fetus when the life and health of the woman are at risk. It also would have prevented the criminalization of abortions. Abortion in the last weeks of pregnancy are exceedingly rare. Abortion opponents we reached cited no example where abortions ocurred so late without a clear medical reason. Also, state civil liability laws — in place to ensure medical providers give patients the best treatment possible — already permit abortions in certain medical circumstances. The bill Kelly supported did not change that. We rate this claim Mostly False.

National Republican group falsely claims Spanberger backs defunding police
","Repeating a successful strategy from 2020, the National Republican Campaign Committee is accusing Democratic congressional candidates this year of seeking to defund police departments. Among the targets is Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., who has been one of the most outspoken Democratic critics of the ""Defund the Police"" movement that was rekindled after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The movement calls for reducing funds going to police forces and investing them in community resources, such as social services, youth services and public housing. The NRCC said Spanberger has been dishonest on the issue and the proof is that she accepted a $3,000 contribution in June from Planned Parenthood, a women’s health organization that supports defunding the police. ""Abigail Spanberger is raking in thousands from defund the police groups because she supports defunding the police,"" the NRCC blogged on July 18.  We fact-checked the committee's claim that Spanberger backs defunding police and found it contrived. We emailed the committee, and a spokesperson declined to answer our questions. Spanberger is in a competitive race this fall against Republican Yesli Vega, a Prince William County supervisor and an auxiliary deputy in the Prince William County Sheriff’s Office. They’re running in the recently redrawn 7th Congressional District that now contains population centers in Fredericksburg and Southern Prince William County. Spanberger, an advocate of abortion rights, has received $5,000 in campaign contributions this election cycle from Planned Parenthood’s PAC — $2,000 in September 2021 and $3,000 in June. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the organization’s lobbying arm, issued a statement endorsing the defund movement in July 2020. ""Instead of investing in systems that brutalize Black communities, we demand that elected officials prioritize public-health approaches that strengthen Black communities,"" the group wrote. The fund does not, however, mention defunding police on a nine-item list of ""issues we’re fighting for"" now posted on its website. Those items pertain to abortion rights, birth control and other matters centered around reproductive health care. The fund also scores members of Congress on how they voted on ""key legislation related to sexual and reproductive health rights."" None of the votes listed since 2018, when Spanberger first ran for Congress, concern police funding. Members who score 100% on the scorecard, such as Spanberger, are eligible to receive donations from Planned Parenthood’s PAC, according to Khadijah Davis, press secretary to the president of Planned Parenthood.  Jaqueline Ayers, senior vice president of the fund, sent us a statement calling Spanberger ""a champion for sexual and reproductive rights.""  Spanberger, a former CIA agent, distanced herself from the defund movement during her 2020 campaign. She stressed that she’d supported appropriation bills that maintained or increased federal spending on local police. She also noted that she had voted for an unsuccessful bill that would have limited legal protections for police in cases of misconduct and banned use of chokeholds by them.  Democrats lost seats in the U.S. House in the 2020 elections. Days afterward, Spanberger made national headlines by blaming some of the poor performance on Democrats’ use of defund rhetoric, which became fodder for Republicans. She said Democrats should avoid using the phrase ""defund the police"" in the future and explain their positions on public safety, point by point. This year, Spanberger is chief co-sponsor of a bill that would nearly triple funding for the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services’ grant program for rural police departments, bringing its annual appropriation to $1 billion. She has endorsed President Joe Biden’s recently announced ""Safer America"" proposal that would provide $13.5 billion in new grants during the next five years to help localities hire and train 100,000 additional police officers. Spanberger called the proposal ""long overdue."" In a January interview with TV host Dan Abrams, Spanberger said police departments are overstressed. ""It comes down to an issue of funding the police, so that they can bring their best selves, they can ensure they have the full complement of officers necessary to really serve, ideally, the communities in which they live,"" she said. The NRCC has linked 27 Democratic candidates this year to the defund police movement based on third-party contributions they’ve accepted. The NRCC said, ""Abigail Spanberger is raking in thousands from defund the police groups because she supports defunding the police."" Here’s the Republican group’s logic: The lobbying arm of Planned Parenthood, which said in 2020 that it supports defunding the police among many other policy goals, has given Spanberger’s campaign $5,000. Therefore, Spanberger supports defunding police.  What the NRCC ignores is that Planned Parenthood’s publicly posted scorecard tracking key votes in Congress does not include defunding the police. Planned Parenthood officials said their organization backs Spanberger because she has consistently voted for bills that would expand access to abortion and reproductive health care.  Moreover, the NRCC ignores that Spanberger has been a leading Democratic critic of the defund movement and has supported a number of bills and proposals that would substantially increase federal funding for local police departments. We rate the NRCC’s claim False.  ",/factchecks/2022/aug/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/national-republican-group-falsely-claims-spanberge/

Fact-checking Rep. Miller-Meeks claims that Democratic bill would allow abortion up until birth
","Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, state and national lawmakers have scrambled to introduce legislation that either restricts or secures access to abortion. Some Iowa Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Marianette Miller-Meeks, stand firmly against the procedure.  In a July 17 newsletter that addressed several topics, Miller-Meeks wrote: Here, we’ll focus instead on whether or not the abortion bill that was passed by the U.S. House — and sent to the Senate, where it is considered unlikely to secure the required 60 votes — would allow abortion through delivery. The bill, H.R. 8296, titled ""Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022"" and proposed by Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., says states would not be able to keep health care providers from offering abortions before fetal viability, which generally is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. It adds that states could restrict health care providers from providing abortions after fetal viability, but only ""when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health.""  The House approved the bill 219-210. Miller-Meeks joined all of her fellow Republicans and one Democrat — Rep. Henry Cueller of Texas — voting against the bill.   Miller-Meeks spoke during a July 15 House debate on the bill, in which several other Republicans — though not Miller-Meeks — called the bill an ""abortion on demand until birth act.""  Miller-Meeks said legalizing abortion should be left up to states ""while recognizing the sanctity of life. This concept is so novel and repugnant to the Democrats that they would put forward a radical and extreme abortion bill that would permit abortion even up until birth for any reason.""  A reading of the bill shows that H.R. 8296 permits abortion up until delivery, but only if it is deemed necessary to protect the life of the patient. It does not explicitly require states to keep the procedure legal in all cases past the point of fetal viability.  Republican officeholders previously have said, in slightly different phrasings, that Democrats want to allow abortions until the moment of birth, but PolitiFact has often found these to be misleading. In this instance, the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022 would allow abortions only if medical professionals believe in good faith that delaying to do so would produce a risk of life or health for their patient. Miller-Meeks’ newsletter comment has a point that the bill ""would permit abortion up until delivery."" However, she glosses over a crucial qualifier: The bill would allow such abortions only under extreme circumstances, in which medical professionals determine that the mother’s life or health is at risk. It’s worth noting that late-term abortions — the kind that would need to be approved under these circumstances — are rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in its latest count from November 2021 that of the 629,898 abortions performed in 2019, almost 93% of them were at or before 13 weeks of pregnancy. About 6% were performed between 14 and 20 weeks, and less than 1% were performed at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy.  The figures are based on reports by health agencies throughout the U.S., although California, Maryland and New Hampshire did not report.  Miller-Meeks’ office did not respond to requests for comment on this story. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said the Democrats’ Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022 ""would permit abortion up until delivery.""  The bill, which passed the U.S. House but is considered unlikely to win approval in the Senate, would permit abortion up to delivery, but only in limited cases — when medical professionals determine that an abortion is necessary to save the life or the health of the mother. Such situations account for a tiny fraction of all abortions, federal data shows. Ignoring this qualifier is misleading.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/aug/01/mariannette-miller-meeks/fact-checking-rep-miller-meeks-claims-democratic-b/
