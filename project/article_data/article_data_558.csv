Perdue omits detail in Cash for Clunkers claim
","Some Republican candidates are having to fend off criticism in this year’s elections for backing one or more of President Barack Obama’s more controversial initiatives. That’s true in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race, where Jack Kingston, a 22-year veteran of the U.S. House, is vying in the July 22 primary runoff to be the Republican nominee to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Kingston’s runoff opponent, wealthy businessman David Perdue, has attacked Kingston on YouTube and in television ads for voting for Obama’s ""Cash for Clunkers"" program. Each man is billing himself as the ""true conservative"" in the race. PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out whether Kingston voted for Cash for Clunkers and, if so, whether that makes him less of a fiscal conservative. .The Car Allowance Rebate System, commonly referred to as Cash for Clunkers, was a federal voucher program that encouraged consumers to replace less-fuel-efficient vehicles with newer, more-fuel-efficient models. Officials said the goal was to boost auto sales and stimulate the economy while the program ran from July 1, 2009, to Aug. 24, 2009. It makes sense that Perdue would criticize a vote for Cash for Clunkers. Though the program was touted as a means to bolster Detroit’s carmakers, it unintentionally increased the market share for Japanese and Korean automakers, according to a Reuters report in 2009. An October analysis by the Brookings Institute’s Ted Gayer and Emily Parker found that the program provided a short-term boost in vehicle sales but was extremely inefficient in increasing jobs and decreasing total emissions. Georgia residents requested $70 million in vouchers under the program, the 13th-highest participation rate in the nation, according to the Brookings Institute report. Congress originally appropriated $1 billion to the program but added an additional $2 billion when it ran out of money within a month. And Cash for Clunkers became a good-intentioned but runaway government program that conservatives love to rail on. But did Kingston vote for Cash for Clunkers? It’s more complicated than a straight yes or no answer. It’s No. And yes. Kingston did not vote to fund Cash for Clunkers initially, according to the legislative tracking service GovTrack. He cast ""No"" votes on bills on June 9 and June 16 that carried the framework of the program in 2009. But he voted in favor of putting the extra $2 billion into the program a month later when it was clearly foundering. We asked Greg Dolan, a spokesman for Kingston, for an explanation. ""Once the program was authorized, Rep. Kingston approved moving funds from the grant program that spawned Solyndra to the slightly-less-wasteful Cash-for-Clunkers,"" Dolan wrote in an email. Solyndra was a solar energy company that drew public ire after going bankrupt despite taking a $535 million loan guarantee under the president’s 2009 stimulus program for ""commercially available technologies,"" according to FactCheck.org. The $2 billion increase in Cash for Clunkers came from the same pot of money that had previously funded Solyndra — the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. So from Kingston’s perspective, he was voting to move money from one fiscal evil to a lesser evil. Dolan added in another email that there was no House vote that would have allowed the money to return to the general fund or go to a more efficient program. In summary: Kingston, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, did vote to provide $2 billion to Cash for Clunkers after it ran through $1 billion in its first month. But Kingston did not vote for the program initially. His office says that the decision to further fund Cash for Clunker was made to cut funds from a more wasteful government program. We rate Perdue’s statement that Kingston voted for ""Obama’s Cash for Clunkers"" as Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFC1EC0>],/factchecks/2014/jul/14/david-perdue/perdue-omits-detail-cash-clunkers-claim/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Rick Santorum']","
Santorum: Obama said that if illegal immigrants come, 'you’re going to be able to stay'
","As children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras continue to arrive at America’s border, the political finger-pointing has started. President Barack Obama said the problem could be dealt with if Congress approves his emergency funding request. Republicans charge that the president’s own policies have fueled the surge. As the panelists on NBC’s Meet the Press batted this back and forth, Kim Strassel of the Wall Street Journal noted an unusual feature of the latest trend. ""People are not coming here to sneak over,"" Strassel said. ""The kids are coming up here saying, ‘Take me in, too. Take me into detention.’ "" Former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum laid that at the president’s feet. ""That’s because we have a president who said, ‘Hey, if you come, you’re going to be able to stay, because we’re not going to enforce the law,’ "" Santorum said. For the record, Obama did not say those words. This fact-check focuses on whether Obama expressed the view that people who come today would be allowed to stay. We tried to contact Santorum to clarify his meaning and did not hear back. Children from Central America are currently allowed to stay in the United States and receive a hearing before potentially being deported as part of a 2008 human trafficking law signed by President George W. Bush. But Republicans have tried to pinpoint blame on Obama, pointing to Obama’s directive aimed at young undocumented immigrants in August 2012. That move, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, did change the administration’s practices. The question is, does it apply to the kids showing up today? Immigration lawyer and Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr says it does not. ""Among other things, the kid must have arrived before June 15, 2012,"" Yale-Loehr said. The deferred action details A few months before the 2012 election, Obama issued an executive order that allowed certain young people without legal immigration status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. That deferral could be extended, and anyone who was accepted would also gain the ability to work in this country. Generally speaking, it targeted people who had come across the border with their parents when they were little and had lived in the United States for many years. The move came after Republicans rejected a bill, the DREAM Act, that would have put these people on the path to citizenship. The Homeland Security Department summarized who qualified: You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday; You have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time; You were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; You entered without inspection before June 15, 2012, or your lawful immigration status expired as of June 15, 2012; You are currently in school, have graduated or obtained your certificate of completion from high school, have obtained your general educational development certification, or you are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; You have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat. As Yale-Loehr noted, no child arriving at the border today would meet those criteria. Santorum claimed that Obama said, ""If you come, you’re going to be able to stay."" That would not follow under Obama’s deferred action memo, nor his public statements about the situation.  A related talking point is that this move from Obama triggered the influx. However, based on numbers from the Homeland Security Department, the rapid rise began in 2011, well before Obama announced his policy. That is not to say that the policy definitively played no role. In an open letter distributed in key Central American countries, Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson underscored that Obama’s memo did not apply to new arrivals. The fact Johnson had to write a letter suggested that Central Americans did draw hope from Obama's executive order. A broader interpretation of Obama’s policies It is possible that Santorum had other administration immigration policies in mind. David Martin, professor of law at the University of Virginia, said by 2011, the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement established centralized priorities for removal proceeding actions. Priority is given to people with criminal records, recent border crossers, those who had come back after having been sent home before, and a few other groups. Martin said this is a good way to use limited resources but it could have a downside. ""Undocumented people with an otherwise clean record who have been here for three or four years fall outside the priorities,"" Martin said. ""If they know these details, they may feel somewhat reassured."" That said, Martin thinks this is a charitable view of what Santorum was thinking. ""That scenario is miles away from the current controversy,"" Martin said. In addition, there has been debate over how aggressively the administration has sent undocumented immigrants out of this country. By some measures, the government has expelled 2 million people, a much higher number than any other president, but some critics say the pace has fallen off. As Anna Law, professor of constitutional law at CUNY Brooklyn College wrote in a recent article in the Washington Post, the available deportation statistics are muddy. There are people who are caught inside this country and sent home and people who are stopped at the border and turned back. If you use both figures combined, Obama looks tough. But use the first and not the other, and he looks less aggressive. (To make matters worse, the official categories have changed over time, making it difficult to compare administrations.) Kevin Johnson, law professor and dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis, said at the end of the day, the numbers don’t support the argument that lax enforcement has anything to do with the latest problem. ""(It) seems far-fetched,"" Johnson said. Santorum said that Obama drew the influx of children at the border by saying, ""If you come, you’re going to be able to stay."" The closest thing we could find to support Santorum's point is an open letter by the Homeland Security secretary to Central Americans. That letter acknowledged there could be a connection between Obama's executive order and the influx of children from Central America -- even though the executive order would not apply to the children approaching the border today.  Obama's deferred action policy applies only to people who had lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007. The targeted enforcement policies would provide no advantage to the children showing up at the border, and the administration has sent millions of people back to their home countries. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC928880>],/factchecks/2014/jul/13/rick-santorum/santorum-obama-said-if-illegal-immigrants-come-you/
"['National', 'Supreme Court', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Texas Democrat: Obama 'offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president'
","Lately, President Barack Obama has emphasized his willingness to take as much action as he can without congressional approval, much to Republicans’ chagrin. For example, at the end of June, Obama announced that he would do as much as he could by himself to address immigration reform -- an issue magnified by the recent influx of an estimated 52,000 undocumented child immigrants from Central America. He painted House Republicans as unwilling to move forward with critical legislation. ""I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing,"" he said. ""America cannot wait forever for them to act. And that's why today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress."" Republicans are saying his actions are brash and unconstitutional. Some, like former vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, say it’s grounds for impeachment. The topic came up on the Sunday talk shows amid discussion of immigration legislation and House Speaker John Boehner’s plan to sue Obama over his decision to delay the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, stood up for Obama and his use of presidential power. ""This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history,"" said Beto, who is from El Paso. We decided to check it out. Obama’s place in executive order history Earlier this year, we looked into how many executive orders Obama had signed compared to previous presidents. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he did use an executive order recently to raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour. The use of executive orders picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder. The current record holder is Franklin Roosevelt, who issued 3,522 executive orders throughout his time in office. Here’s what we found for the past 10 presidents, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara: President Number of executive orders Obama 182 George W. Bush 291 Bill Clinton 364 George H. W.  Bush 166 Ronald Reagan 381 Jimmy Carter 320 Gerald Ford 169 Richard Nixon 346 Lyndon Johnson 325 John F. Kennedy 214   So in the past 50 years, Obama has so far signed fewer executive orders than every other president except two -- Gerald Ford (who finished Richard Nixon’s second term) and George H. W. Bush (who served one term). And he’s signed fewer per day than every president back to Grover Cleveland, according to research by the Brookings Institution. But O’Rourke said ‘actions’ O’Rourke is on solid ground had he said ""executive orders."" But he said ""executive actions."" That’s a different and tougher to prove statistic. Executive action is a hard-to-define and broad category that encompasses any unilateral presidential action -- including the executive orders listed above, pardoning criminals, amending the internal structure of the executive branch, issuing signing statements, writing letters and memoranda, and more. The White House recently released a document touting 45 solo actions Obama has taken this year alone. The list includes his executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal employees. It also talks about his recently unveiled Environmental Protection Agency plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent, which is not an executive order. And there are smaller measures, like creating working groups and encouraging local leaders to commit to end veteran homelessness. John Woolley, a political science professor at University of California Santa Barbara, outlined three types of executive actions: Woolley noted, though, that while the federal register catalogs executive orders, there is not a consolidated tally of all executive actions. This makes comparing Obama’s use of unilateral action to other presidents’ difficult, said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""There is no single metric you can point to and say, ‘This president has executed more unilateral actions than other presidents,’ "" Mayer said. Additionally, some scholars and politicians might disagree on what counts as unilateral presidential action and how important that particular action is, he added. But based on his research, Mayer said Obama has done nothing exceptional in terms of unilateral actions, compared to other presidents. Similar criticisms have been thrown at presidents from the opposing party for centuries, starting with George Washington’s decision to proclaim neutrality in the war between England and France. But unless agencies or scholars start to tally and examine all executive actions, not just orders, it may be impossible to quantify a president’s use of unilateral power. ""People who say Obama has issued fewer (or certainly no more) executive orders than his immediate predecessors are correct,"" Woolley said. ""However, the claim that he has directed fewer executive branch discretionary actions is far less certain. For the record, O’Rourke’s office provided us evidence about executive orders, not executive actions. Our ruling O’Rourke said, ""This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history."" People often point to the number of a president’s executive orders to indicate his use of unilateral action, and by that metric, Obama has a lower record than most presidents in recent history. That’s likely what O’Rourke meant when he said ""executive action."" But executive action includes much more than just orders, and there’s no way to definitively calculate how many Obama has carried out in order to compare him to other presidents. O’Rourke is right when it comes to one type of executive action -- executive orders -- but the rest of the record is unclear. As such, we rate, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB37740>],/factchecks/2014/jul/13/beto-orourke/texas-democrat-obama-offered-fewer-executive-actio/
"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Gary George']","
Gary George says he created private school choice program
","In the history of Wisconsin’s groundbreaking private school choice program, as told by journalists and scholars, Democrat Annette ""Polly"" Williams is the godmother of the movement and Republican Tommy Thompson the godfather. But Gary George is bluntly rewriting those accounts as he attempts to resurrect his political career through a challenge to US Rep. Gwen Moore, another Democrat from Milwaukee. ""I created the school choice program, which ushered in not only an era of educational reform in Wisconsin, but really throughout the nation and around the world,"" George, a former state senator, told newsman Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" show July 6, 2014. Who deserves the title of creator? The word has several meanings, including ""to cause to come into being,"" or ""evolved from one’s own thought or imagination."" How it passed George pointed us to the final amended bill that became law in 1990, when it was signed by Thompson, who was governor at the time. That bill allowed poor Milwaukee parents to use publicly funded vouchers to send their children to private, non-religious schools of their choosing. It was a scaled-down version of a Republican plan that sought to include religious schools. To become law, the bill had to clear Joint Finance, the powerful committee that George co-chaired with Milwaukee Democrat Walter Kunicki. It was part of a multi-issue budget bill. As heads of the committee, George and Kunicki were listed as authors of the bill. George brokered several changes, getting the support of Williams and others. George’s role was ""crucial"" in winning passage, wrote James Carl, a scholar of urban education reform, in his book, ""Freedom of Choice: Vouchers in American Education."" Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the same: ""I give him his props. We couldn’t have gotten that bill passed without his help."" Other participants agreed. Howard Fuller, a Milwaukee Public Schools critic who went on to become superintendent, told us that ""if Polly had not come to an agreement with Gary, it would not have passed."" So George can lay claim to a significant role in the legislation that created the choice program. But there’s little doubt that the final product was largely drawn from an earlier bill drafted by Williams, then a state representative, and educational activist Larry Harwell. Indeed, George appears to have had little if any role in the decades-long legislative battles that came before the measure finally passed. And in his book, Carl flatly calls Williams ""the state representative who authored the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program."" Further back in history Williams and Harwell were among the varied and sometimes competing forces -- some liberal Democrats, religious leaders, conservatives, business leaders -- who began pushing in the late 1960s for choice and independent community schools in Milwaukee’s central city. Some legislation was considered and voted on in the 1970s and into the 1980s but the partisan political obstacles were many. The decisive action, put in motion by Thompson, came during the Republican governor’s first term in the late 1980s. The reform-minded Thompson was rebuffed in 1988 when he sought a voucher program in Milwaukee that included religious schools. George did not favor the plan and Joint Finance deleted it from the state budget, amid teachers union opposition to the governor’s move. Thompson tried again in early 1989 with a similar result, but momentum built when Milwaukee Public Schools leaders put forward their own choice plan. George’s policy adviser, Walter Farrell, started warming to the bill, Carl recounted in his book. At that point, Williams, who opposed the MPS plan, authored her own, but it fell in the state Assembly. She redrafted new legislation in mid-1989 and worked to get bipartisan support. The governor, as well as Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, got behind it. Teachers union opposition faded. Williams ""helped persuade (George) to support their legislation,"" Carl wrote in his book. ""After meeting with community residents and Thompson, George eventually came down on Williams’ side."" The Williams-authored bill easily passed the Assembly, but was bottled up in a Senate committee until George attached it to a budget bill and made changes that Williams agreed to. It worked. Senate and Assembly passage followed, and Thompson signed it in April 1990, winning praise from President George H. W. Bush. In news accounts at the time, Thompson credited Williams for the plan, and George offered a cautious comment:  ""We’ll see if this is an experiment that works."" Today, Fuller sees Williams as deserving of the most credit, despite George’s crucial late work. George told us: ""Polly Williams, she had the concept, but you have to legislate it. It’s legislation, so there’s no parentage."" Williams says now she is bitter at what she sees as a misguided Republican expansion of choice beyond Milwaukee and to wealthier families in recent years. But she’s proud of what she did and politely disagreed with George’s comments. ""He didn’t create it,"" she said. Thompson told PolitiFact Wisconsin he sees it this way: ""It was my idea, and both Williams and George had a lot to do with it. Our rating George told an interviewer: ""I created the school choice program."" Clearly the former senator helped give birth to choice, steering it through the Senate with crucial changes and granting his crucial support. But George didn’t conceive of the idea. And his account crowds out the long leadership -- and more prominent role -- of both Williams and Thompson, not to mention Williams’ authorship of the bill George modified. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC849340>],/factchecks/2014/jul/13/gary-george/gary-george-says-he-created-school-choice-program/

R.I. Speaker Nicholas Mattiello says the legislature didn't really have a final late-night session
","Some things in life are a certainty -- death, taxes and members of the Rhode Island General Assembly staying up until the early morning hours to pass a flurry of legislation on the final day of the session. On the edition of WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers"" program that aired July 6, 2014, reporter Tim White was talking to House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello about the assembly session that had just ended. He noted that legislators were passing bills as late as 4 a.m. White questioned whether they had time to fully consider them before voting and asked, ""Is this how you think the legislative process should happen?"" Mattiello argued that the House really didn't have an all-night session this year. ""We kept to our curfew every night of the last week of (the) session,""  he said. ""Most of the business, even on the last night of the session, was concluded by, I think, roughly 11 o'clock."" ""The session went late because of negotiations with the Senate over a Newport Grand gambling bill. So there was that one bill,"" Mattiello said. ""Most of the business, and I don't want to be fact-checked, but I think by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill."" (He was referring to legislation, later signed by Governor Chafee, authorizing referenda on whether table games should be allowed at the slot parlor.) Mattiello may not have wanted to be fact-checked, but we couldn’t resist, because we had a very different recollection of a legislative day that didn't officially end until 4:06  Saturday morning. The last vote was at 3:48 in the morning. So was 95 to 98 percent of the business done by 11 p.m.? Was only one bill at issue? And did the House not really have a late-night session? When we contacted Mattiello's office, spokesman Larry Berman said in an email that ""There were 126 votes taken by House members on the final day of session (June 20). Of those, 87 were made before 11 p.m."" That's 69 percent, not 95 to 98 percent. However, Berman said, Mattiello was referring to new business. Most of those after-11-p.m. votes don't count, he argued, because all but one of those issues had already been debated before by the House. That's a distinction the speaker didn't make on Newsmakers. The remaining votes did consist largely of cleaning up language so House and Senate versions were identical on bills that allowed optometrists to prescribe the opiate drug hydrocodone; regulated music therapists; authorized special license plates for Olympic medal winners, and eliminated the so-called master level that provides for straight-party voting. But those are still final votes on important issues. Those votes are not insignificant. And when you don't leave the building until after 4 a.m., that's a late night. Our ruling Nicholas Mattiello said that ""by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill."" It's true that one issue -- Newport Grand and its associated bills -- was holding things up on the last night of the session. It's much less true that 95 percent of the business was done by 11 p.m. And Mattiello's suggestion that you shouldn't call a 4 a.m. adjournment a late-night session simply because most votes involved legislation that members had seen before strikes us as Pants On Fire ridiculous. His statement contains just enough truth -- the fact that one bill was at issue -- to escape having his slacks scorched. We rule it False.

Details missing in endorsement claim
","Political candidates are practically expected to lob more accusations at their opponents as the number of days before Election Day decreases. That’s why it is no shocker that the tight Republican runoff for the 10th Congressional District is heating up. The surprise is Jody Hice, a former minister and radio talk show host, is taking exception to businessman Mike Collins’ claim of a newspaper endorsement. Newspapers! How quaint. Collins took to Twitter to crow. ""Another great endorsement! Barrow Journal explains the difference between me and Jody Hice,"" Collins wrote in a June 23 tweet. The post links to a June 20 column by Chris Bridges, editor of the weekly community newspaper. The problem, the Hice campaign says, is the newspaper does not endorse candidates. Any claim of an endorsement would be false, said Hice’s communications director, Clarke Brannon, who contacted PolitiFact Georgia for a fact check. ""We’re trying to keep all of the facts on the table,"" Brannon said. ""It’s not the paper that has endorsed him, just a personal column by the editor."" Journalists love to debate the merits of endorsements almost as much as they love extolling the innate deliciousness of election night pizza. But if you’re not in a newsroom, and couldn't care less about PolitiFact’s poor dining choices, you likely need a quick primer on endorsements. Political endorsements are the public declarations from well-known people and organizations in support of a specific candidate. The goal is to use the name recognition and star power – not to mention money and connections – to boost one candidate in a race. Collins’ campaign has won that sort of an endorsement from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Hice’s campaign has earned an endorsement from Georgia Right To Life. Similarly, newspapers have long endorsed candidates from local, state and national races on their editorial pages. But a growing number of publications have backed away from endorsements in recent years, worried that the practice threatened journalistic independence of the news pages. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution still endorsed candidates in 2008 but began phasing it out a year later. A column before the May primary put it this way, ""In an era when information on candidates is widely available, you don't need us to tell you how to vote."" The Barrow Journal feels the same way for its official pages. It has not endorsed a candidate since its launch in 2008, editor Bridges said. Bridges said his column is meant to be his opinion alone. Neither campaign contacted him to clarify on his piece about the race, but he said he could see how the practice could be confusing to people outside a newsroom. ""Most people don’t have a clue how it all works,"" Bridges said. ""It’s my opinion, so if it’s taken as an endorsement at all, it’s my personal endorsement, not anything from the paper as a whole."" Collins spokesman Brandon Phillips said the campaign understood the distinction. That’s why the tweet referenced an endorsement and the paper, without claiming an official endorsement. By contrast, the campaign’s Twitter feed clearly stated former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel had endorsed Collins on Monday. Phillips said Handel was also making calls on behalf of Collins, as Gingrich had done earlier. ""When we roll out an endorsement, you know it’s an endorsement,"" Phillips said. Knowing is one thing. Caring is another issue altogether. A 2012 Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll found that most Republican voters didn’t think endorsements mattered in the presidential matchup. Whether the support was from specific figures such as Donald Trump, community leaders or, you guessed it, newspapers, the majority of the 1,000-person sample said endorsements did little to help and could even hurt a candidate. With all of that in mind, it appears Collins did refer to an endorsement and link to a newspaper column. But he did not claim a specific endorsement – which needs some explaining to understand.  It’s that additional information that moves it down a bit on the AJC Truth-O-Meter.

Nancy Pelosi says Supreme Court is 'five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal'
","More than 10 days after the Supreme Court decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the landmark case was still sending shockwaves through Washington and the political world. In the decision, a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for four kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act, the law proposed and signed by President Barack Obama. At her weekly press conference on July 10, 2014, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., referenced the decision with a note of alarm. ""Really, we should be afraid of this court,"" Pelosi said. ""The five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal. Let's not even go there."" Several readers asked us to scrutinze whether Pelosi was right to say that the Supreme Court was deciding which contraception methods are legal, rather than whether some corporations must pay for them through their employees’ health insurance plans. Later that day, Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly took the media to task for not immediately shooting down Pelosi’s assertion. ""I’ve seen the media rush to clarify Ms. Pelosi’s misleading remarks … Oh, no, I have seen none of that, except on Fox News,"" Kelly said sarcastically. ""When you’ve got somebody in such a powerful a position as Nancy Pelosi, in a position to influence so many people on such a platform, come out and tell blatant falsehoods, there should be some fact-checking. Where is PolitiFact on that? Where is the mainstream media calling her to account?"" Well, here we are. We can eliminate any reader suspense by sharing the response Pelosi’s office sent PolitiFact after we inquired: ""She misspoke,"" spokesman Drew Hammill acknowledged. ""Obviously the impact of the court’s decision is not to make these four contraceptive methods illegal – i.e. no longer allowed to be sold."" Hammill went on to explain that Pelosi’s ""overriding point"" was that the decision ""does in fact limit access … which is the key point Pelosi made."" He pointed to portions of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent in which Ginsburg notes that IUDs are expensive and that removing company support for them could leave some female employees without the ""most effective"" medical option for their needs. Indeed, one of Pelosi’s later comments from the news conference -- when she focused on the issue of who pays for contraceptives, rather than whether they remain legal -- seems to be on firmer ground. She expressed concern ""that five men could get down to specifics of whether a woman should use a diaphragm and (whether) she should pay for it herself, or her boss. It's not her boss' business. The business is whatever his business is, but it's not what contraception she uses."" We asked legal experts whether it was plausible to think that the Supreme Court would actually make certain kinds of contraceptives illegal, as Pelosi’s now-disowned comment suggested. The experts agreed that the scenario was farfetched. ""There is no reason to think the Court will ban any contraceptives,"" said Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University. ""Hobby Lobby involved the question of whether a company can, for religious reasons, refuse to pay for health insurance that covers certain contraceptives. Hobby Lobby does not relate to the legality of contraceptives at all."" Kurt Lash, a University of Illinois law professor, agreed. Pelosi’s original comment, he said, suggested ""either that the Supreme Court has started 'determining what contraceptions are legal,' or that recent decisions suggest that a majority might be heading in that direction. Neither is true, or even plausible."" As evidence, Lash cited solid legal precedent in favor of making contraceptives legal. Regardless of the court’s recent jurisprudence, Lash said, ""it is -- and will be -- ‘legal’ for employees to obtain contraceptives on their own. Employees have that right as a matter of constitutional law under the Supreme Court's 1965 decision in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case no one is challenging anywhere in the country and which is not implicated in any way in the ACA litigation."" In fact, he added, ""even if a majority of the the Supreme Court reversed Griswold -- something that will never happen under the Roberts Court -- this still would not make contraceptives ‘illegal.’  At most, it would leave the matter to the states to decide for themselves. And every state allows the distribution of contraceptives and has done so for decades, even prior to the Court's 1965 decision in Griswold."" Our ruling Pelosi said, ""We should be afraid of this court, the five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal."" This sweeping claim was a misstatement, her spokesman acknowledged to PolitiFact. The Hobby Lobby decision didn’t turn on whether certain types of contraception should be legal, but rather on the question of whether certain corporations could decide on religious grounds not to pay for specific types of contraceptives in employee health insurance plans. Experts say that there are solid legal precedents that would keep the Supreme Court from actually banning forms of contraception outright. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC18900>],/factchecks/2014/jul/11/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-supreme-court-five-guys-who-star/

Would the Rebuild America Jobs Act have cost the 'average American family' $1,000 a year?
","Monica Wehby, a Portland pediatric neurosurgeon, is seeking to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat. The jabs they’ve traded so far include who would do a better job managing the economy. Wehby, a Republican, took Merkley to task for recently reiterating his support for the Rebuild America Jobs Act. The bill, proposed in late 2011 by President Barack Obama, called for an immediate $50 billion investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. The act died when Democrats failed to rally enough votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. The claim: Wehby described Merkley’s vote for the act as ""typical of a Washington insider like Senator Merkley."" Then she added this: ""I would have voted no because this legislation would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact to fix our infrastructure and roads."" PolitiFact Oregon wondered about the cost figure and checked. The analysis: Wehby’s criticism of Merkley’s vote included the assertion that the ""nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s own analysis of the bill identified the cost of this legislation for every Oregon family to be $958.40 per year…"" We checked the CBO’s website to see if that’s what it found. No such figure appears in the CBO’s analysis of the Rebuild America Jobs Act. Instead, the one-page analysis estimated only that the act, if implemented, would have brought in $56.7 billion in revenues through taxes, while spending $56.5 billion for infrastructure projects. In other words, it would have been nearly revenue-neutral, according to the CBO. We emailed Wehby’s campaign. Her communications manager, Dean Petrone, wrote back saying that the $958.40-per-year figure ""is backed up by Jim Harper, director of Information Policy Studies at the Cato Institute."" We emailed Harper, who wrote that ""it appears very likely"" that Wehby got her number from WashingtonWatch, a policy analysis site he maintains in his spare time. (Harper, incidentally, said he considers WashingtonWatch to be a libertarian-leaning site.) Harper faulted Wehby’s claim on two counts. The first involved the $958.40 figure itself. In reality, he said, only half of that would come in the form of new taxes. The remainder really doesn’t count since it’s in the form of new spending. And while it could be argued that new spending amounts to a long-term debit, the CBO’s own finding that the bill was budget-neutral negates that point. His second point was that ""average families"" would not have borne the burden of any new costs because language in the bill made clear that it would be financed by a 0.7 percent surtax on millionaires. ""It’s important and relevant to many … that the incidence of the taxes would have been on relatively rich people,"" Harper wrote. ""The $500 in taxes would not have hit the ""typical"" American or Oregonian family."" The median household income in Oregon from 2008 through 2012 was $50,036, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In fact, only about seven percent of all Oregon households made more than $150,000 in 2012, according to the Oregon Employment Department. The ruling: Monica Wehby, in criticizing U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s support of a major transportation spending bill, said the legislation would have ""cost the average American family $1,000 a year…"" The source the campaigned relied on, Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, for the figure said only half that amount could be attributed to new taxes imposed on any household. The rest would come in the form of new spending for infrastructure projects. Harper acknowledged that the bill in question -- the Rebuild America Jobs Act -- contained language specifying that all costs would be financed by a 0.7 percent surtax on millionaires. Harper noted that any new taxes from the bill would not have affected the ""typical American or Oregonian family."" Wehby’s campaign attributed the original $958.40-per-year figure to the CBO’s ""own analysis."" When asked, the campaign said the figure actually came from a partisan political organization. The bill ultimately failed, but had it passed, it would not have cost the ""average American family"" a dime. We rate the claim False. Comments? Questions?

Did U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley co-sponsor the Rebuild America Jobs Act?
","U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s race against Republican challenger Monica Wehby is already featuring heated back-and-forths on an issue that could be pivotal in November -- the economy. As Oregon continues its recovery from the Great Recession, both candidates are making claims about what could have been done -- and what should be done -- to improve the situation. The claim: U.S. Senate Democrats, responding to a call from President Barack Obama, tried in late November 2011 to pass the Rebuild America Jobs Act. The bill called for an immediate $50 billion investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. Ultimately, the bill died when Democrats failed to muster enough votes to break a Republican filibuster. Merkley, in a recent position statement on jobs and the economy, reiterated his support for the bill, saying it would have created living-wage jobs for Oregon families and financed much needed transportation projects. He added, ""I co-sponsored the Rebuild America Jobs Act to do just that."" We wondered if that was true. The analysis: It’s old news that the act died along largely partisan lines, when Democrats were unable to round up the 60 votes needed to over the filibuster. So we focused on Merkley’s claim of co-sponsorship. We checked with GovTrack.us, a non-partisan website that draws from a number of sources to help people find and track bills in Congress. An overview of the bill, formally numbered S. 1769, showed it was introduced Oct. 31, 2011, by U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and reported to committee the next day. A secondary link showed that the bill had 17 original co-sponsors, ranging alphabetically from Sen. Mark Begich, D-AK to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. Six more senators, including Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell, signed on as co-sponsors in the following 10 days. Among those 23 senators, Merkley’s name was noticeably absent. Since that was at odds with his recent position statement, we emailed his office and asked about the discrepancy. Lindsey O’Brien, Merkley’s press secretary, acknowledged that listing the senator as a co-sponsor was incorrect. In an email, she attributed the error to an ""editing mistake."" She added, however, that he stands by the act’s intent. ""Sen. Merkley was a vocal supporter of the Rebuild America Jobs Act,"" O’Brien wrote. ""He advocated for it on the floor of the Senate, and was proud to support because it meant more middle-class jobs for Oregonians."" The senator’s position piece, she said, should have read: ""I was a vocal supporter of the Rebuild America Jobs Act to do just that."" In a floor speech, delivered Nov. 2, 2011, Merkley spoke at length in favor of the bill. Nowhere did he mention being one of its co-sponsors. The ruling: Merkley, in an ""issues"" statement on jobs and the economy, said his support for a major 2011 infrastructure spending bill was so strong that he signed on as one of the act’s co-sponsors. Merkley did deliver a floor speech promoting the supposed benefits of the failed Rebuild America Jobs Act, but nowhere does his name appear as one of the proposal’s 23 co-sponsors. His campaign staff admitted the assertion was a mistake and sent along revised language characterizing Merkley not as a co-sponsor of the act, but as a ""vocal supporter.""

Texas teen hunter Kendall Jones: Without hunting, 'no infrastructure for wildlife management'
","Texas teenage cheerleader Kendall Jones, the hunter who became the hunted, shot back at critics recently, defending her controversial big game hunts as conservation efforts. Jones made news by posting photos of her hunting trip to Zimbabwe on her Facebook page, posing and grinning next to her kills -- including a lion and other big cats. The pictures created an uproar among animal lovers and Jones was labeled the ""most eminently hateable person on the Internet right now.""  But the 19-year-old -- who counts more than 577,000 fans of her Facebook page -- says these outraged animal lovers are missing the point. ""Tanzania also has 15 photo-safari areas, which have been lauded as a non-consumptive alternative to traditional hunting tourism,"" Jones wrote in a July 2, 2014, Facebook post, quoting National Geographic magazine. ""Unfortunately, only 4 of the 15 photo-safari areas are financially viable. The remaining 11 are subsidized by hunter-generated funds. So without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management."" The point being, if people like Jones didn’t pay to hunt, then wildlife lovers wouldn’t have any animals to look at. We wondered: Is Jones really a misunderstood Artemis or just a wolf in sheep’s clothing? Falling prey to false facts A quick Google search confirmed that the quote Jones referenced is indeed from National Geographic, published Sept. 2, 2013. But it’s from an opinion piece titled ""African Lions Should Not Be Listed as Endangered,"" submitted to the magazine by Melissa Simpson of Safari Club International, a conservation group composed of hunters. Simpson wrote, ""The regulated hunters in Africa make a vital contribution to conservation efforts, primarily through the revenues their hunting expeditions generate for local communities and wildlife resource agencies."" Historically, game reserves in Africa were set up by colonial sport hunters when animal populations began to disappear in the 19th and 20th centuries from over-hunting by early European settlers, according to environmental historian John MacKenzie. But today, sustainable trophy hunting alone is not enough to protect wildlife and stop poachers, said African Wildlife Foundation spokesperson Kathleen Garrigan. It’s just one of a set of ""tools"" used to protect wildlife and habitats. And that’s only under good governance, at a low volume, and with social and economic benefits to local people, according to guidelines set by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), one the world’s leading conservation groups. Others share a similar view on game reserves. Both the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation and wildlife conservationists say that hunting tourism can do good for communities and wildlife, where alternatives are not possible. Photo tourism, which needs more capital and infrastructure to implement, won’t work for certain landscapes, says IUCN ecologist Rosie Cooney. ""There are areas with sufficiently low density of animals that no tourist is going to pay thousands of dollars a night to chase them around. In the Serengeti, people will line up two years in advance to see animals because there are scores of them but, in other parts, that’s just not the case,"" said mammal biologist Bruce Paterson. In these areas, especially where human populations are growing, trophy hunting can foot the bill for keeping natural landscapes natural. But assuring healthy animal populations requires hunting operators to be knowledgeable about population dynamics and reasonable about trophy quotas, the age of the animals hunted, profit margins, etc., Paterson said. There are only about 500 West African lions left, which are considered fair game because they’re mistakenly grouped with other African lions instead of their real family, endangered Asian lions. And when trophy hunting is successful in maintaining large wildlife populations and diversity, it’s well-managed, well-regulated, and often paired with other efforts. ""South Africa, through an aggressive conservation initiative that involved ecotourism, hunting, breeding, translocations, and other conservation efforts, was largely responsible for bringing the southern white rhinoceros back from the brink of extinction,"" Garrigan said. Trophy hunting doesn’t do it alone So while experts say trophy hunting can help wildlife management, they agree that it’s just one way to do so. As for which tool is the sharpest in the tool shed, the IUCN says it’s not trophy hunting. With the same level of management and regulation, the conservation results in hunting areas are lower than those obtained by the neighbouring national parks, the IUCN wrote in a 2009 report. In some places, without the proper oversight, the hunting industry is actually contributing to wildlife declines, Garrigan said. On top of that, there’s even less of a bite in the financial argument for trophy hunting. ""Sure, some element of (wildlife management) is happening with fees paid by hunters who go into fishbowls to shoot fish. But the major thrusts are governments and private managers of the photo tours,"" said environmental historian James McCann. Contrary to Jones’ Facebook claim, the non-consumptive tourism sector -- meaning you can look but you can’t touch -- is overall more profitable than trophy hunting. Botswana recently banned hunting in favor of high-cost, low-density ecotourism. Tanzania’s national park system actually receives about $11 million annually from just one photographic tourism area, whereas hunting revenue altogether averages $10.5 million, according to wildlife conservationist Peter Lindsey. ""Photographic ecotourism undoubtedly generates greater gross revenues than trophy hunting in Africa, and where large numbers of tourists visit, employment opportunities for local peoples can be higher than just  hunting,"" Lindsey wrote in a widely cited 2006 study that actually recommends trophy hunting. Hunting groups including Safari International, NGOs and academics alike report that the entire trophy hunting industry generates about $200 million in annual revenue, $100 million in South Africa alone.  But this figure, which comes from Lindsey’s study, is questionable, says the Economists at Large in their 2013 report. The $100 million figure, for example, was taken from an unpublished study by the Professional Hunters Association of South Africa. Whatever the number, trophy hunting revenue is a small slice of the pie. Altogether the IUCN reports that the hunters are contributing all of 1.3 percent of tourism revenue in the big game countries, and have created 0.0001 percent of the jobs (and most are part time). Averaged out over land used, hunting generates less than $2 per hectare -- about $1 if we exclude South Africa -- and moreover, local communities get just a dime of that. In Tanzania, where the financial contribution by game revenue is the highest, hunting contributes to about 0.3 percent of the national budget but uses about a quarter of land. Our ruling Jones, who has been criticized for posting photos of big game kills while visiting in Africa, claimed that, ""Without the financial resources provided by hunters to protect habitat and stop poachers, there would be no infrastructure for wildlife management."" First, while the quote was published in National Geographic, it was written as part of a pro-hunting opinion piece. Second, the claim is inaccurate. Experts agree that hunting reserves can help wildlife management in the right circumstances, but other efforts -- including ecotourism and photo tourism -- have a more significant impact. No matter the size of the contribution, it’s clear that wildlife management isn’t solely being supported by big game hunts. We rate Jones’ claim False. Correction: This report initially misspelled the name of African Wildlife Foundation spokeswoman Kathleen Garrigan.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAD4740>],/factchecks/2014/jul/11/kendall-jones/texas-teen-hunter-kendall-jones-without-hunting-no/
"['Medicaid', 'Poverty', 'Virginia', 'Kirk Cox']","
Kirk Cox says number of Americans in poverty is at historic high
","House Majority Leader Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, recently objected to Democrats’ claims of a moral high ground in their bid to expand the state’s Medicaid rolls. During a  floor speech, Cox laid out reasons for the House GOP’s refusal to make Medicaid available to as many 400,000 additional low income and disabled Virginians -- despite the federal government’s offer to pay almost all the costs. He said the expansion was a broadening of ineffective Great Society programs, including Medicaid, that began under President Lyndon Johnson in the mid-1960s. Despite Johnson’s goal of launching a ""war against poverty,"" Cox said blight persists. ""There are more than 46 million Americans living in poverty today -- the largest number in 54 years,"" Cox said. There’s been a lot written about whether Great Society programs have succeeded. Coming to a conclusion on that debate is beyond the purview of a single Truth-O-Meter. But we were curious whether Cox is correct in saying more Americans are living in poverty than at any time during the last 54 years. Kelly Gee, Cox’s legislative aide, pointed us to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. They show that in 2012, the latest year that figures were available, 46.5 million Americans lived in poverty. That’s the highest number going back to 1960, when 39.9 million lived below the poverty line. But several analysts told us economists typically measure poverty over time by examining the poverty rate -- the percentage of the population living in blight. While the number of people in poverty has risen, so has the nation’s population. In 1960, there were 179.5 million people in the U.S. and by 2012 that grew to 310.6 million. ""It is important to put any number in context,"" emailed Greg Acs, director of the Income and Benefits Policy center at the Urban Institute. ""If the population is growing, the number of people in any income category is likely to grow as well."" The 1960 poverty rate was 22.2 percent. Had it stayed at that level, there would be 70 million Americans in poverty today, said David Betson, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Notre Dame. ""Both numbers are important, but when looking at poverty over a long period when population is growing, poverty rates in my opinion are a better indicator than the number of people in poverty to judge whether we have made progress or not,"" Betson wrote in an e-mail. The poverty rate in 2012  -- the latest year available -- was 15 percent. While it has dropped since 1960, the rate is high compared to more recent years. The rate has has hovered at 15 percent for a three-year period beginning in 2010. That’s the longest stretch at or above that threshold since 1959-1965, when the poverty rate started at 22.4 percent and wound up at 17.3 percent. ""We are at very high levels of poverty, one of the highest streaks in recorded history,"" said H. Luke Shaefer, an assistant professor of social work at the University of Michigan. ""We’ve been high since the start of the Great Recession. We are also at some of the highest levels of deep poverty."" The average poverty threshold in 2013, the latest year available, is $15,156 annual income for a family of two and $23,836 for a family of four. Our ruling In arguing the Great Society programs have failed, Cox said more than 46.5 million Americans are living in poverty, more than at any time since 1960. Cox’s figures are correct, but offer an incomplete picture of the U.S. poverty over the last 54 years. What he fails to note is that the U.S. population has grown by 73 percent over that span -- or by about 131 million people. Analysts say a fuller measure is offered by poverty rate, which takes into account population growth. It shows that poverty has decreased, from 22.2 percent in 1960 to 15 percent in 2012 -- the latest year available. So Cox’s statement is accurate but, in its context of evaluating a half-century poverty trend line, needs additional information. That makes it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBBD4C0>],/factchecks/2014/jul/11/kirk-cox/kirk-cox-says-number-americans-poverty-historic-hi/
"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'David Perdue']","
Perdue pay raise claim falls short
","Veteran U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah and millionaire businessman David Perdue are stepping up their attacks as decision day rapidly approaches in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Kingston and Perdue are locked in what’s arguably the most contentious and closely watched Georgia contest on the July 22 primary runoff ballot. Charges and countercharges are flying. One of the charges being leveled by Perdue, the front-runner in the May primary, is that Kingston has wasted tax dollars on earmarks ""all while voting to raise his own pay seven times."" PolitiFact has already examined the claim about Kingston’s record on earmarks. Now, we’ll delve into the second part of the claim that’s currently airing on television and radio and answer the question: Did Kingston, a member of Congress since 1993, vote to raise his own congressional pay seven times? With public opinion of Congress in the tank, House and Senate members have been loath to raise their own pay. That’s likely why congressional raises are a campaign issue, not just this year and not just in Kingston’s race. That also may explain why fact-checking the claim is more complicated than simply pulling legislation and checking individual House and Senate members’ votes. First, a little history. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution requires members of Congress to set their own pay. From 1789 to 1968, members of Congress passed specific bills that raised their pay 22 times, according to a June 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service. Members of Congress were initially paid a daily rate -- $6 a day in 1789 -- and drew their first annual salary -- $1,500 -- in 1815. Forty years later, they were drawing $3,000 a year. But since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, members of the House and Senate have been eligible for annual raises without having to be on-record voting for them. The raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries. They are automatic each Jan. 1 unless Congress votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. According to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers have let their pay be increased automatically 13 times. They’ve also voted to decline or delay their raises during 11 years, including in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Kingston voted with the majority eight times. That is, Kingston voted to limit his pay, not increase it. In January 2009, congressional salaries went from $169,300 to their current $174,000. (And unless they vote again to decline a raise, lawmakers’ pay is set to increase 1.6 percent, or $2,800, in January, according to recent estimates.) So how can Perdue say that Kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in 1989 and Kingston’s only been in Congress since Jan. 3, 1993? Here’s the simple answer: Perdue’s not counting Kingston’s votes in favor of raising congressional salaries. Instead, Perdue’s counting procedural votes Kingston cast. Those votes blocked efforts to nix the automatic pay raises. PolitiFact checked a similar claim in 2011 when U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV came under attack by Republican rival George LeMieux in Florida’s U.S. Senate race. That was rated a Half True. Perdue’s claim, like LeMieux’s, is based largely on procedural votes. The votes by Kingston took place in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. We'll try to explain a complicated process as simply as we can. A member of Congress -- for years it was U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah -- pushes for an up-or-down vote on continuing the automatic pay raises. In most years, a procedural vote is used to effectively block that effort. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's then-spokeswoman, explained the procedural move to PolitiFact in 2011. ""Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question,"" she told Politifact in an email. ""Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered the amendment to deny the annual congressional pay raise."" Matheson was concerned ""that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries,"" Heyrend said. Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union and Foundation, said it’s important to understand that any efforts on the pay raises are always tied to larger bills dealing with appropriations. ""People of varying ideologies and causes would have numerous reasons for supporting or opposing the bill,"" Sepp said, meaning that votes for or against a bill could have something or nothing to do with the pay raise. In 1999, for instance, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R, Ky., argued that lawmakers shouldn’t take a $3,800 raise, boosting their pay to $145,000 a year, saying: ""I have a hard time voting to increase my pay when people in my district are earning an average income of $25,000 a year."" According to press reports from the time, Fletcher’s move was defeated on a procedural vote, 250-173. House journals show Kingston voting with the majority. The journals also show Kingston voting ""Yes"" with the majority on similar procedural votes in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Those votes blocked efforts by Matheson, Fletcher and others to put forth an amendment to stop the pay raise. And even if they had not been blocked, a majority would have still had to go along with their amendment, several congressional experts told us. So, did Kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise? No. He didn’t have to because the raises are automatic unless Congress votes to turn them down as they have for five years. Did he vote to stop a push for an up-or-down vote on accepting or rejecting the raises? Yes. He did that seven times. But he also voted with the majority to deny or delay the raises eight times. Greg Dolan, Kingston’s congressional spokesman, said: ""Representative Kingston was not ‘voting to increase his pay’ any more than he was voting against renaming the moon."" ""Just because a potential amendment may have been introduced, voting to get on with the work of the House is not equivalent to voting against any and all other extraneous issues,"" he said. Dickey, Perdue’s spokesman, said the pay raises were inappropriate and Kingston knew that as far back as 1992 when he told a Savannah paper that congressional raises should be tied to passage of a balanced budget Our ruling Congress has created a system that allows its members to receive annual raises without having to vote on them. Perdue is off base to say Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times. Kingston cast procedural votes -- with the majority -- that effectively allowed Congress’ automatic pay raises to stand in some years. Kingston did not cast direct votes to raise his pay as Perdue’s ads imply. When there was a direct vote to decline pay increases, Kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times. There’s a bit of truth to Perdue’s claim. But there’s even more context missing. We rate Perdue’s claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA0F2C0>],/factchecks/2014/jul/11/david-perdue/perdue-pay-raise-claim-falls-short/

Florida GOP says Charlie Crist raised taxes $2.2 billion
","The Republican Party of Florida was quick to respond to Charlie Crist’s first campaign commercial, released on July 7, 2014, with its own ad alleging Crist was not being honest with voters. The party’s ad replayed Crist’s ad with a virtual remote pausing the video and offering reaction. After Crist’s ad claims he cut taxes, the GOP responds: ""Fact: Crist raised taxes by $2.2 billion."" A voiceover says, ""Nice try, Charlie; Crist raised taxes on the middle class by billions of dollars."" We handled Crist’s claim about cutting property taxes here, but these stats don’t really match up. Could Crist have cut taxes and raised taxes like the GOP claimed? Time to tally the balance sheet. Budget crunch In the throes of the Great Recession and with home values in freefall, Florida faced a $6 billion budget gap in 2009. The Republican-led Legislature’s answer? Implementing $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees. The panoply of hikes included a $1-a-pack cigarette tax, increased court costs and fees on things like fishing at the beach or off bridges, plus the increase in auto tag fees the Legislature repealed in 2014. The jump in taxes and fees was a necessary evil, lawmakers said, to deal with the holes in the budget. Crist, who was a Republican as governor, signed the budget on May 29. The commercial says these were increases on the middle class, but that’s debatable, since more than just middle-class Floridians were affected by the moves. No definition of middle class is given in the ad, in any case. The commercial also implies that Crist somehow lied about cutting property taxes, when cutting property taxes was actually a separate budget issue in a previous year. Crist did sign legislation that cut taxes for low-income seniors and Florida homeowners. But the tax increases put Crist in critical crosshairs, since he had pledged no new taxes for Floridians while campaigning in 2006. You can’t totally blame Charlie for breaking his promise, however. Lawmakers tied the various increases to funding for schools and Medicaid, to make sure Crist wouldn’t take them out of the budget with a line-item veto. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, ""Crist raised taxes on the middle class by billions of dollars."" Crist did sign a budget in 2009 that included $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees, breaking a campaign promise that Floridians would not have to pay new taxes. But the ideas came from the Republican-led Legislature, who made it very difficult for their Republican governor to veto the hikes.

Greater Wisconsin Committee says state Supreme Court Justice David Prosser equals Gov. Scott Walker
","
A TV ad aims to help unseat conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser by comparing him to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who has become a polarizing figure in the wake of his efforts to reduce the power of public employee unions.

The commercial is produced by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which is also airing an ad critical of Prosser’s handling of a decades-old priest abuse case. We rated the claims in the priest ad Barely True.

With its ""Prosser will be rubber stamp"" ad, the committee’s calculation is that voters angry with Walker will vote for JoAnne Kloppenburg, Prosser’s opponent in the April 5, 2011, election.

The 30-second ad -- supported by a website called ProsserEqualsWalker.com -- shows pictures of Prosser and Walker. A narrator begins by asking, ""Can we trust David Prosser to be impartial?,"" and then makes five statements about Prosser and Walker. Those are echoed by messages on the screen.

In the end, the ads boil down to this equation: Prosser = Walker.

(Yes, that’s a theme in this election. We previously rated a claim that Milwaukee County executive candidate Jeff Stone = Walker as Mostly True.)

We’ll evaluate the ad’s five statements -- paying particular attention to those that cite Prosser’s own words -- in terms of how well they support the overall claim.

""In the Legislature, Prosser and Walker voted the same way 95 percent of the time.""

The ad cites votes in the 1995-1996 legislative session, when Prosser and Walker were members of the state Assembly. The Assembly was controlled by the GOP and Prosser served as the speaker.

Michelle McGrorty, the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s executive director, said the committee paid for a review of 1,048 roll call votes in which both men participated.

Prosser’s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, didn’t dispute the 95 percent figure. He said it isn’t surprising because ""a good majority party puts together a widely supported legislative agenda they can advance.""

Clearly, 95 percent is a big number and it’s a start in making the ""Prosser equals Walker"" case. But it is common for members of the same party to vote with each other the vast majority of the time and many of the votes are on minor matters.

Prosser and Walker both voted ""against the middle class.""

The ad cites Walker’s and Prosser’s votes against a 1994 bill to raise the minimum wage.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee also told PolitiFact Wisconsin that Prosser and Walker voted to allow banks to raise credit card fees; for a state budget proposal that included increases in vehicle registration fees; against making more people eligible for the Healthy Start program; and for a state budget proposal that would allow taxing the income of public employees who retired in other states.

In response, Nemoir cited Prosser votes for laws that froze school property tax levies and required the state to pick up two-thirds of the cost of public schools; required employers to give 60 days’ notice of a plant closing; and gave consumers protection against ""lemon"" vehicles. Nemoir said Prosser also sponsored a bill to allow public defenders to collectively bargain.

So, the second statement is very much a mixed bag.

""As a judge, Prosser has sided with corporations and against workers.""

The ad cites two Supreme Court cases in which Prosser voted against the majority of the court in cases involving workers with disabilities. The ad doesn’t mention Walker in this statement, but presumably he is viewed as against workers because of his collective bargaining bill.

In 2003, the Supreme Court affirmed that a Barron County employer discriminated against an employee with a disability because it refused to modify her job duties and her work space. In 2004, the court upheld affirmed that an Eau Claire County employer failed to make a reasonable accommodation so that an employee with a disability could continue to work there.

Prosser’s campaign countered by citing four decisions -- each authored by Prosser -- that were decided in favor of workers.

In 2000, the court ruled that a school district employee had the right to a trial to try to prove she had to quit her job because of harassment. And in three decisions in 2001, the court upheld a pension boost for public employees and retirees; upheld an award of more than $555,000 to a county employee who won a sexual harassment suit; and declared that a fired county employee has a right to a hearing before his vested pension benefits can be denied.  

This statement is another mixed bag -- some of Prosser’s rulings went against workers, others favored them.

""Now Prosser has promised to act as a complement to Walker.""

The ad cites a news release issued by Prosser’s campaign on Dec. 8, 2010, that called Prosser a ""common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature."" The statement was attributed to Nemoir, but at PolitiFact we attribute a statement from a spokesman as coming from the candidate, who is responsible for it.

The reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor in November 2010 but had not yet taken office, and Republicans who would take control of the Senate and Assembly in January 2011.

Weeks later, Prosser disavowed the statement. But it left the impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as teaming with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government to advance their agenda.

This statement supports the Prosser = Walker equation, though Prosser later disavowed it. That leads nicely to the final element.

Prosser’s ""views 'closely mirror' Walker's""

The ad’s fifth statement cites an e-mail sent Dec. 9, 2010 by Nemoir in response to criticism by Kloppenburg about the ""complement"" comment. The e-mail said Prosser’s ""personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature.""

So that statement also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim.

Of course, we’re not limited to the evidence provided by the group. Prosser has also made other comments that relate to himself and Walker.

Walker is regarded as a strong conservative. Prosser has in some instances described himself as a conservative, but at other times as a ""political moderate"" and ""in the political center."" It is clear, however, that he holds the swing vote in the current 4-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.

In a March 24, 2011, meeting with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Prosser said ""what I’ve tried to do is to step back from partisan politics.""

He cited a ruling he made that favored Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. In the same meeting, Prosser said Walker’s bill constricting the collective bargaining rights of most public employees ""is not necessarily legislation that I agree with.""

In response to the Prosser = Walker claim, Nemoir said Prosser ""recognizes his job on the court is to approach each case with impartiality. Had Prosser ruled favorably on a number of lawsuits advanced by the governor or against the governor, perhaps a case could be made.  Merely sharing the honor of representing the state as members of the Legislature is not evidence to support such a claim.""

That brings us to a final piece of context.

Even if Prosser and Walker share the same political beliefs, it does not necessarily mean Prosser would vote on the Supreme Court the way Walker would act as governor.

Justices must consider the law and legal precedent in making their decisions; and Prosser’s votes, in employment cases alone, show he has not consistently favored one side over another. Similarly, in a claim we rated Barely True, Kloppenburg said Prosser has prejudged matters likely to be heard by the Supreme Court, but she did not cite any specific examples.

Let’s assess where we’ve come.

In comparing Prosser and Walker, the Greater Wisconsin Committee cites votes the two men made in the Legislature and votes Prosser cast on the Supreme Court -- neither of which amount to strong evidence. Some of Prosser’s own statements, however, indicate a strong similarity between his beliefs and Walker’s.

Here is the PolitiFact definition for Half True: ""The statement is generally accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""

Here’s our ruling on the claim: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC838C80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/31/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-state-supreme-cou/

House Speaker John Boehner labels money in health care bill “slush funds”
","
Republicans and Democrats alike marked the recent anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s passage.

The White House issued a report listing benefits the bill had brought to Ohioans, like free wellness visits, mammograms and colonoscopies for Medicare beneficiaries, while Republicans like House Speaker John Boehner issued statements that said it destroys jobs and should be repealed.

""In the coming weeks, you’ll see more votes and more hearings in the House to take this law apart, step by step,"" Boehner promised in a press release and video disseminated to reporters on March 23 . ""That includes repealing the law’s mandatory spending slush funds.""

Boehner expounded more on the health care ""slush fund"" theme in a video released the previous week.

""Let’s look at Obamacare,"" Boehner said in the March 14 video. ""Its authors went to great lengths to protect their government takeover of health care from anyone attempting to repeal it. They funneled federal bureaucrats billions of taxpayer dollars to implement this job-crushing health care law. This isn't just some startup money that fell into the wrong hands. It's a series of slush funds, set up to stay on the books automatically, with little or no oversight.""

Asked for the rationale behind Boehner’s ""slush fund"" claims, his office provided a memorandum from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. It described the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as ""unusual in the sense that it provided mandatory spending for numerous newly created or established programs that would normally be considered discretionary in nature."" By way of explanation, it noted that ""discretionary"" government spending is allotted by Congress each year, while ""mandatory"" spending occurs outside the congressional appropriations process.

The document prepared for a March 9 subcommittee hearing cited as examples a program that allows the Health and Human Services Secretary to provide grants for states to set up health insurance exchanges, a separate $17.75 billion account the HHS Secretary could use for prevention and public health programs for nine years, and a third section of the bill that authorizes the Secretary to award $200 million in grants over three years to construct school-based health centers. Also targeted is a
""personal responsibility education program"" that would be funded with $75 million each year from 2010 through 2014, and $230 million in development grants for teaching health centers that would be issued between 2011 and 2015. The Energy and Commerce Committee is drafting legislation to eliminate those programs.

""This should concern every Member that we have a created a slush fund that the Secretary can spend from without any Congressional oversight or approval,"" health subcommittee chairman Joe Pitts, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in his opening statement at the hearing.

Democrats at the hearing said that when Republicans controlled Congress, they also put mandatory spending into bills that created new programs, such as 2003 legislation that created the Medicare prescription drug program. HHS spokesman Keith Maley noted that bipartisan legislation that Congress passed to create the Childrens’ Health Insurance Program did the same thing.

""Congress maintains its full oversight authority as it does in other instances in which it chooses to include a mandatory appropriation in a piece of legislation,"" Maley said in an email. ""Additionally, HHS maintains appropriate program integrity controls on the use of the funds.""

The health care bill provides several pools of money that the HHS Secretary can disburse for purposes designated by the legislation. Is it appropriate to call them ""slush funds?"" The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a ""slush fund"" as ""an unregulated fund often used for illicit purposes."" The money vexing Republicans is designated for programs specifically defined by the law, which hardly makes them illicit and unregulated. Congress also has the power to oversee the bill’s implementation, and Republicans have held several hearings on the subject already this year.

Boehner may object to the latitude the health care bill gives HHS. But as speaker, his words carry a lot of weight, and he should choose them wisely. His  ""slush fund"" label is not only inaccurate, but ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates a Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC837400>],/factchecks/2011/mar/31/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-labels-money-health-car/

AFL-CIO President Nee says public support growing for unions, collective bargaining
","
The spotlight was on public employee unions, their pensions and their very futures when two top union leaders appeared on Channel 12’s ""Newsmakers"" show March 20.

George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, and J. Michael Downey, president of Council 94, the state’s largest public employee union, talked about the budget crises in Wisconsin and other Midwestern states, where governors sought dramatic cuts from unions and proposed stripping their rights to collective bargaining.

In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker threatened to lay off as many as 1,500 state workers by the summer if public sector unions did not agree to roll back benefits and collective bargaining rights.

There was a stalemate for weeks as Democratic legislators fled the state to block a vote. Finally, Republicans found a way to approve a bill stripping the unions’ bargaining rights for all issues except pay.

Nee said national polls show that as a result,  ""public sentiment in favor of collective bargaining and in favor of the unions has actually gone up as these governors, I think, have overreached and gone too far and tried to destroy the labor movement.""

We wondered if public sentiment in favor of unions is actually growing, so we asked Nee what polls he based his observations on. Nee had the union’s communications director send over some recent polls.

A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll published Feb. 23 showed that 61 percent of Americans would oppose a law in their state similar to the Wisconsin proposal stripping much of employees’ collective bargaining rights.  A total of 33 percent would favor such a law.

A poll done by former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris and released Feb. 24, found 51 percent support Wisconsin Governor Walker’s ""reforms package,"" while 47 percent were opposed. Questioned on specifics, however, voters gave a mixed message. By margins of more than 3 to 1, they favored making state employees pay more for health insurance and pensions. But they opposed the governor’s efforts to limit collective bargaining by a margin of 54 to 41 percent.

A Pew Research Center poll published Feb. 28 asked respondents whom they favored in Wisconsin’s collective bargaining dispute:  42 percent sided with the unions, 31 percent with the governor, 9 percent chose neither and 18 percent said they didn’t know.

A New York Times/CBS News poll, also published Feb. 28,  found that 60 percent of Americans oppose efforts to weaken collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. (Only 33 percent of those surveyed viewed labor unions favorably, however, while 25 percent  viewed them unfavorably.)

A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll published March 2 reported that 62 percent of those surveyed said eliminating collective bargaining rights for public-sector workers over health care, pensions or other benefits would be either ""mostly unacceptable"" or ""totally unacceptable.""

The Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a nonprofit research institute that says it believes in limited government, published a poll March 6 showing that Wisconsinites opposed their governor’s planned cuts in benefits, wages and union bargaining rights by a margin of 51 percent to 46 percent.

The response to eliminating bargaining rights depended on how the question was worded. When framed as ""limiting bargaining rights to help local governments,"" 47 percent were in favor, 50 percent opposed. When framed as ""eliminating bargaining rights to ultimately dismantle public employee unions,""  58 percent were opposed and 32 percent in favor.

A nationwide Bloomberg National Poll published March 9 found 49 percent of respondents had a favorable view of public employee unions, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view.

In Rhode Island, Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy released a poll March 24 based on a random sample of 425 registered voters. The poll asked whether respondents favor or oppose taking away some collective bargaining rights from public employee unions. The response: 54 percent opposed, 40.6 percent in favor.  

We searched for polls or experts that might counter Nee’s assertion. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had none. Nor did the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank.

While all the polls Nee cited showed support for public employee unions and collective bargaining in the current disputes, none showed what Nee claimed: growing support since the Wisconsin battle.

We learned from Nee’s staff that Gallup has been polling for public attitudes about unions every August since 1936.

Those results showed that unions were much more popular decades ago, when a greater percentage of the private work force was unionized. Approval ratings ranged from 60 percent to as high as 75 percent in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1978, the approval rate dipped to 59 percent, where it has hovered until 2009, when it dropped to 48 percent. In 2010, public approval rose to 52 percent.

The union poll always asked the same question: Do you approve or disapprove of labor unions?

A more recent Gallup Poll, asked a different question: Whether respondents are more likely to say something negative or positive about unions. Results, released March 11, showed 34 percent would say something positive and 38 percent something negative.

That poll may provide insight into how the public views unions in light of the Wisconsin labor dispute, said Gallup spokesman Eric Nielsen, but Gallup won’t know  whether the public’s attitude overall has moved up or down until it does its annual union poll next August.

So where are we? The annual Gallup polls show public opinion about unions in general is lower that it has been historically, although there was an upswing last year. Other polls do show the public seems to be siding with unions in the battle with Governor Walker.  And the public supports the unions’ rights to collective bargaining.

Nee seems to be right that public sentiment favors the unions in the Wisconsin battle. And there is evidence that support for unions grew from 2009 to 2010. But Nee overreached when he said support has grown as a result of the Wisconsin battle.

"['National', 'Transportation', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Tim Pawlenty writes that NTSB ruled Minneapolis bridge collapse stemmed from 1960s-era flaws
","
In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential Republican presidential contender in 2012 -- addresses the 2007 collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. The collapse, on August 1, 2007, came during Pawlenty’s second term as governor, so questions were raised about whether his administration bore any responsibility for the collapse.

Pawlenty makes clear in the book that he believes his administration was vindicated.

""Ultimately, after an exhaustive investigation,"" Pawlenty wrote, ""the (National Transportation Safety Board) concluded the bridge fell because of an original design flaw dating back to the 1960s.""

We wondered whether Pawlenty characterized the findings correctly. So we turned to the NTSB report ourselves.

First, some background on the NTSB. It’s an independent federal agency charged with investigating transportation accidents and making recommendations based on its findings.

Pawlenty is certainly correct that the NTSB concluded that the ""probable cause"" of the collapse was a four-decade-old design flaw, specifically a flaw with ""gusset plates"" -- metal plates that secure several different pieces of the bridge’s truss (or structural support). The NTSB concluded that certain gusset plates in the I-35W bridge ""failed under a combination of (1) substantial increases in the weight of the bridge, which resulted from previous bridge modifications, and (2) the traffic and concentrated construction loads on the bridge on the day of the collapse.""

The NTSB also concluded that a ""contributing"" cause of the collapse was ""inadequate design review by federal and state transportation officials."" This would have happened during the design and approval phase, which was in the mid 1960s. (The bridge opened to traffic in 1967.)

In other words, the NTSB concluded that the most important factor and one of two contributing factors in the collapse were things that had happened four decades ago -- long before Pawlenty became governor.

However, while the report does largely exonerate state agencies from blame in the collapse -- and in fact notes that officials were inspecting bridges more frequently than required by federal guidelines -- other portions of the report are somewhat more equivocal about the state’s role.

The report found that another ""contributing"" factor was ""the generally accepted practice among federal and state transportation officials of giving inadequate attention to gusset plates during inspections for conditions of distortion, such as bowing, and of excluding gusset plates in load rating analyses.""

The NTSB noted, for instance, that there was significant corrosion on certain gusset plates. While the investigation concluded that this corrosion was not a factor in the collapse, the NTSB did express concern about how inspectors had treated that wear over the years. The report said the NTSB ""is concerned that the amount of corrosion … had not been documented in detail and had not been given particular attention during subsequent bridge inspections. Had the bridge remained in service, and had the corrosion and section loss continued to progress without mitigation, the ability of the gusset plates to safely carry loads would have continued to diminish, even if these particular plates had been properly sized.""

A more direct criticism by NTSB involved state officials’ role, or lack thereof, in guiding contractors on how to safely spread out construction materials on the bridge.

Construction was under way on the day of the collapse, and the contractor had placed a large amount of material on the bridge in preparation for its work. The NTSB concluded that if the material had been spread more widely, even the flawed gusset plates would have held. But the material was instead gathered into a smaller area to facilitate traffic and construction work, and as a result, the weight became too much for the bridge to bear.

The NTSB notes that the existing guidance by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials was silent on this particular risk. But the report also notes that on a previous occasion, contractors had asked the state agency to stockpile materials on the bridge and ""had been given a response that they interpreted as permission."" And while state officials told the NTSB that they would have denied the request that led to the collapse if the contractor had asked them, the report expressed some skepticism with that response, saying it was ""impossible to know with certainty"" that they would have denied the stacking request.

""In the absence of formal and specific guidance, decisions about the placement of construction materials may be made on an ad hoc basis ... and may not take into account all the considerations necessary to ensure that temporary loads do not damage the structure or possibly even exceed the load-carrying capacity of the structure at its most highly stressed location,"" the NTSB concluded. The NTSB added that following the collapse, the state agency revised its standards for the storage of construction materials on bridges.

A final note: Some outside experts believe the NTSB report underplays actions by state officials that could have contributed to the collapse. Barry B. LePatner, a New York-based lawyer whose practice specializes in engineering and construction, published a book in late 2010 -- Too Big to Fall -- that argues, among other things, that ""shoddy maintenance, ignored expert repair recommendations, and misallocated funding"" also helped cause the collapse. (In Pawlenty’s book, the former governor dismisses the notion that an unwillingness to spend money contributed to the collapse, writing, ""It was untrue and of course overlooked the reality that we were spending millions of dollars to improve the decking, railing, and lighting on the bridge when it fell."")

In any case, we’ll keep our fact-check tailored to the specifics of Pawlenty’s statement -- that ""ultimately, after an exhaustive investigation the NTSB concluded the bridge fell because of an original design flaw dating back to the 1960s.""

We conclude that he’s right that the most important factor the NTSB pointed to -- plus one of the two contributing factors it cited -- were design-related flaws dating from the 1960s. But Pawlenty’s summary doesn’t acknowledge other questions the NTSB raised about the performance of state officials during his tenure as governor. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCD60C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-writes-ntsb-ruled-minneapolis-bridge-/

Proposed EPA water quality standards draw ire of third-party group
","
Proposed rules to improve Florida water quality standards have spiraled into a political war of words pitting environmentalists and the federal Environmental Protection Agency against Florida's business interests and much of the state's political leadership.

Most of the fight -- about something called numeric nutrient criteria -- probably makes little sense to you, if you heard about it at all.

Here are the basics. Inhale ... Back in 1998, the EPA told all states that they had to develop limits on nutrient pollution in state waterways -- nutrients being pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorus that cause toxic algae blooms that can kill fish and cause respiratory problems and infections among swimmers, boaters and beachgoers. The states had until 2004 to come up with the limits. But 2004 came and went in Florida with no action. So environmentalists from groups like Earthjustice, Sierra Club, the Florida Wildlife Federation, the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and the St. Johns Riverkeeper sued the EPA. The state Department of Environmental Protection said it had been working on setting up specific nutrient limits since 2001 but had not yet finished because of the thousands of waterways in the state and the different ecological challenges they face. Anyway, the EPA settled the lawsuit with the environmentalists and said it would produce water quality rules for Florida, which it did (except for South Florida) in November 2010. Those new regulations, which set numeric limits on the nutrients allowed in all Florida and state inland waterways, take effect in March 2012.

What the exact limits are is of little consequence in that you'd have to be a scientist to understand them. Suffice it to say, they're strict enough that business groups are vexed that it will cost billions of dollars to clean up because so many Florida waterways are considered ""impaired"" -- meaning the water isn't safe for humans or where certain aquatic life could no longer live. In an economy with 11.5 percent unemployment, the ""billions"" has people worried -- particularly municipalities, businesses and farmers who are producing the pollution.

Enter a group calling itself Free Market Florida, which has begun a political campaign to stop the regulations from being implemented. The group's leader, Ryan Houck, was part of a business-backed group that successfully fought against a ballot initiative in 2010 known as Amendment 4 (the measure would have given voters final approval on major development proposals).

Free Market Florida launched a two-minute, 30-second web video that details the threat of the new EPA criteria to Florida's economy.

""Imagine that you own a restaurant, and the health department tells you that the floors on which you walk need to be as clean as the plates on which you serve food,"" Houck says in the ad, looking directly at the camera. ""Then you open the newspaper and find out that someone's suing a fast food restaurant because their 99-cent cheeseburgers aren't as good as a $40 steak at a fancy restaurant. That's crazy, right?""

The ad then cuts to Houck standing in front of a drainage canal.

""Now what if I told you taxpayers, businesses, farmers and consumers had to spend billions of dollars to make drainage canals like this one every bit as clean as the water here (video cuts to Houck in front of a river) in the Wekiva River ... It may sound absurd, but it's about to happen right here in Florida.""

Houck goes on to call the regulations debilitating, unscientific and costly, and says that it is all part of a plan by environmentalists not to curb pollution, but to stop development.

Of the many things worth fact-checking in the ad, one claim stood out to us -- Houck's suggestion that the EPA is requiring man-made drainage canals be every bit as clean as natural, flowing rivers.

We asked the four stakeholders in this argument -- Houck, the environmentalists, the EPA and the state DEP -- if that's right.

We got four very different answers.

""We went to great lengths to make sure the ad was accurate. We're glad you're checking it."" -- Ryan Houck, Free Market Florida.

""That characterization is simply false."" -- David Guest, lawyer for Earthjustice.

""There are likely circumstances where the same criteria that applies to the Wekiva River would also apply to a nearby canal."" -- Dee Ann Miller, DEP spokeswoman.

""This high level of protection is likely not required for any drainage canal, therefore, the drainage canal pictured is not required to have water 'every bit as clean as the water in the Wekiva River.' "" -- Davina Marraccini, EPA spokeswoman.

The differing answers at first had us puzzled -- until we had an epiphany.

The answers underscore just how complex these water regulations are.

Understanding the regulations

For starters, we need to understand just what the regulations are, and are not. The regulations affect lakes and inland rivers and streams. More generally, they affect the water we drink (categorized as Class I bodies of water) and water we use for recreation or that supports aquatic life (Class III). Class III waters would include drainage canals that link other flowing bodies of water. But the regulations wouldn't affect drainage ditches or retention ponds, necessarily.

The EPA set different requirements for lakes and rivers and streams. Lakes in the state are measured based on the color and alkalinity. Criteria for rivers and streams are divided into five geographic regions in the state. Each geographic region has its own criteria.

So while lakes across Florida would have the same pollution standards, rivers and streams would not. The different regions were created to account for natural phosphorus levels in some parts of the state relative to others.

Now, it's critical to note -- as we already have once -- that none of the rules in place apply to the areas in South Florida (roughly south of Lake Okeechobee). Those standards will not be proposed until November 2011. The rules also do not apply to estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands.

Another important point, especially for the sake of this fact check: South Florida is home to the predominant number of the state's canal systems, said Earthjustice's Guest. 
About 1,000 miles of canals exist as part of the ""Central and Southern Florida Project,"" a congressionally authorized project to control flooding and supply water for municipal, industrial and agricultural uses, and for prevention of saltwater intrusion. Many but not all of those canals are in the designated South Florida region and thus exempted from the proposed standards.

Comparing to the Wekiva

Houck told PolitiFact Florida that the canal pictured in the video is not in South Florida, and is classified as a Class III water.

If that's the case, the man-made canal would be regulated under the pending rules, and it would have to meet the same standards as natural rivers in the same geographic area.

But this fact check isn't that simple. Free Market Florida chose to compare the canal to the Wekiva River, a 30-mile-long river system that starts in Central Florida and runs into the St. Johns River. The Wekiva River has been designated an Outstanding Florida Water by the state, which means it receives the ""highest protection,"" according to state policy.

""OFWs are afforded higher protection, above and beyond normal requirements of a Class III water (that is, waters suitable for fishing and swimming), to maintain outstanding water quality and prevent degradation,"" the EPA's Marraccini told us. ""This high level of protection is likely not required for any drainage canal; therefore, the drainage canal pictured is not required to have water 'every bit as clean as the water in the Wekiva River.' ""

Houck argues that the levels of protection for Outstanding Florida Waters and the EPA numeric nutrient criteria counts measure different things, and therefore are immaterial. And Houck is correct that Outstanding Florida Waters are required to maintain the water quality standard that was in place in March 1, 1979 (Page 32 of these rules), not specific numeric nutrient criteria limits.

Proposed rule changes

There's another important and complex clarification to the pending EPA standards: The state is in the process of trying to change the rules so that many man-made canals might not have the same regulations as rivers.

The state's Environmental Regulation Commission has proposed creating a subset of Class III waters that would include man-made canals. Those waters would have to meet different and lower standards than regular Class III waters. The state provides a good visual explanation of the changes they are considering on slides 21-25 of this presentation.

""The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule does apply as the video states,"" said DEP spokeswoman Jennifer Diaz. ""This situation exists because Florida’s current classification of rivers and streams does not distinguish between artificially created waters and natural free-flowing waters. About a year ago, the Environmental Regulation Commission (ERC) approved the creation of a new class of waters for artificially created and significantly altered surface waters. Although adopted by ERC, the new classification is subject to approval by EPA before it can become effective in Florida. Until this new classification is approved by EPA, no waters in Florida can be classified with a lower use expectation. Therefore, the nutrient criteria adopted by EPA that becomes effective in March 2012 will apply equally to man-made ditches/canals and natural streams.""

More caveats

And yet, there are more complications. The EPA says that if the state can show -- based on a structured scientific assessment -- that a canal cannot meet its current designated use, the state could downgrade the use of the body of water and the numeric criteria counts would not apply.

""Factors considered in determining whether to downgrade a classification include naturally occurring pollutants and the physical conditions of the water body, as well as whether the pollution controls required would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact, among others,"" the EPA's Marraccini said.

Houck says this can lead to more lawsuits.

Lastly, we need to address the cost. While we're not fact-checking how much the remediation will cost, we think it's important to note there is wide disagreement on potential financial impact. The EPA says the cost to clean Florida's waters will be $135 million to $206 million a year. A private study pegged the costs astronomically higher -- anywhere from $1 billion to $8.4 billion annually.

Our ruling

We hope we didn't lose you in explaining these complicated requirements, and how they match up to the claim in Free Market Florida's ad. After weeks of studying this issue, we are more convinced than ever just how complicated the proposed rules to regulate Florida's water systems are.

The bottom line is Free Market Florida contends that man-made drainage canals will have to meet the same standards as pristine Florida river systems like the Wekiva River in Central Florida.

As the regulations stand now, it appears that drainage canals designated as Class III waters in Central Florida would have to meet the same numeric nutrient standards as the Wekiva River. But there are several caveats that could impact the validity of that claim. For one, rules haven't been implemented for South Florida (home to the many drainage canals). Two, all drainage canals wouldn't have to meet the water quality standards of the Wekiva, just the ones in the geographic area. Three, the state is proposing a change to the rules that could exempt many of the state's drainage canals. And four, the EPA also says it could exempt individual drainage canals based on scientific study.

Houck said his group made sure the drainage canal they showed is in the same region as the Wekiva, which in his mind explains away the first two caveats. The third and fourth caveats are possible changes that are not a sure thing.

Where does this all leave us?

Houck and his group are largely right based on all the evidence we reviewed. We wish he would have explained a little more of the nuance in the video, but we also are realists. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0F7680>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/free-market-florida/proposed-epa-water-quality-standards-draw-ire-thir/

Babur Lateef says unemployment up 150 percent since Corey Stewart became Prince William chairman
","
As Republican Corey Stewart contemplates a 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate, he also faces a re-election battle back home in Prince William County this fall for the chairmanship of the board of supervisors.

Because of Stewart’s statewide aspirations, his backyard challenge is being widely watched. He is being taken on by Babur Lateef, an eye surgeon from Woodbridge making his making his first bid for public office. Lateef, a Democrat, posted a YouTube video March 26 attacking Stewart’s record.

The video says that since Stewart was elected chairman in November 2006, unemployment is up 150 percent in the county, the average price on home sales is down $150,000, 47.4 percent of mortgages are now ""under water"" and the number of students per classroom in county schools has climbed 40 percent.  

That’s a lot to chew on, but we’ve got the choppers. This story will examine Lateef’s claims about unemployment and home sale prices. We’ll follow up with a second report.

Michael McLaughlin, Lateef’s campaign manager, told us the unemployment figures come from the website of the Virginia Employment Commission, which compiles jobs data for the state and localities.

Ann Lang, a VEC economist, helped us pull the numbers for Prince William.

In November 2006, the month Stewart was elected chairman and took office, VEC data show Prince William had a 2.2 percent unemployment rate. In January 2011, the most recent month for which statistics are available, the county’s unemployment rate was 5.7 percent. That’s an increase of 159 percent, slightly higher than the 150 percent cited in Lateef’s video.

We should include a note of caution here. Experts have often told us that politicians get too much credit and blame for the economy. They’ve said that even presidents and governors have limited effects in controlling economic trends.  

So it seems reasonable that a county board chairman would have an extremely limited impact over a region’s economic performance. Prince William’s economy is closely tied to that of the larger Washington, D.C. metro area, as well as to the state and national economies.

Lateef’s video suggests Stewart shoulders blame for the collapse of the financial system in 2008, the rise of oil prices that summer to $140 per barrel and the massive recession that took national unemployment to 10 percent.

While Prince William’s unemployment rate has certainly climbed, it remains below Virginia and national levels. In January 2011 Virginia’s unemployment rate was 6.9 percent and the national rate was 9 percent. CNNMoney, a joint project of CNN and Money Magazine, also said Prince William is 17th in the national list of counties that have seen the most job growth between 2000 and 2009.

Lateef based his claim about home sale prices on numbers from Real Estate Business Intelligence, which is part of MRIS, a massive realty listing service and database covering the mid-Atlantic.

The average price of a Prince William home sale was $414,714 in November 2006, while the median price was $376,000. By February 2011 the average sale price was $260,830 and the median sale price was $228,925. That’s a $153,884 drop in average sale price and a $147,075 drop in median sale prices, straddling the $150,000 decline Lateef mentioned.

But Stewart took office in an environment where home prices were already falling in the county. Between November 2005 and November 2006 the average sale price fell 8.1 percent and the median sale price dipped 6 percent, data show. Again, home sales are private transactions. They are not governed or controlled by the board of supervisors.

And the county was hardly the only place in America to see a drop in home values.  

Stewart has noted Prince William’s housing market is closely tied to overall demand and economic activity in the larger D.C. metro area. And the S&P/Case-Shiller Housing Index, a highly-respected source of housing prices, notes the entire Washington, D.C. metro area saw a 24 percent decrease in home prices between November 2006 and January 2011, compared to a 39 percent decrease in Prince William’s median home prices.

Let’s review our findings.

Lateef’s raw numbers are mostly correct. Unemployment in Prince William is up 159 percent since November 2006, when Stewart took office. But Lateef campaign video omits the facts that the county’s unemployment rate is well below the Virginia rate and even farther below the national rate. Workers in Prince William are much more likely to have a job than the average American.

Prince William housing sale prices are down during Stewart’s tenure by roughly $150,000. But prices were already dropping when Stewart took office, and he has little control over home sales. Prices also dropped sharply across the Washington, D.C. area

We rate this claim Half True. Lateef’s figures are fine, but he wrongly uses them to imply Stewart is responsible for financial problems that not only shook Prince William County, but the nation. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC738F80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/babur-lateef/babur-lateef-says-unemployment-150-percent-corey-s/
"['Candidate Biography', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Abele']","
Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele says opponent Jeff Stone = Scott Walker
","
A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means ""double walker.""

In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be ""double Scott Walker.""

Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double.

In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the ""unfair"" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has ""mismanaged"" Milwaukee County government.

""I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin,"" a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: ""Jeff Stone is Scott Walker.""

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB999AC0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/

Sen. Sherrod Brown says cuts proposed by House GOP could hurt police, terror prevention efforts
","
The House of Representatives passed a bill in February that would keep the United States government operating through this fiscal year while making a small dent in the federal debt. Democrats say it's a bad bill that slashes important programs; Republicans say the cuts are necessary.

We're not going to pick apart the bill’s merits or shortcomings. PolitiFact Ohio was interested in claims about the bill’s impact made on March 7 by Sen. Sherrod Brown and seconded by Cleveland's mayor, Frank Jackson.

Brown and Jackson, in a news release and at a news conference with public safety officials in Cleveland, said the spending cuts could harm public safety and security in Cleveland and across Ohio. Specifically, they spoke of cuts to grants that would affect local law enforcement.

""House-passed budget proposal could cut funding for programs that help keep local neighborhoods safe, slash more than $1.7 Million in anti-terror funds for Ohio,"" read a headline on Brown's news release.

This made us wonder: These cuts would be in grant programs. Many federal grants are awarded competitively, making it impossible for any city to count on getting one every single year. So how could Brown and the city of Cleveland consider the end of a grant to be a ""cut?""

Put it another way: If you get a bonus sometimes but not every year, can you really say your pay was cut in the years you didn’t get one?

In Brown's case, the answer turns out to be yes. Two of three programs he mentioned are funded by a narrow category of safety grants that Cleveland and Ohio have been guaranteed to get historically. These are what Brown was refering to as ""programs that keep local neighborhoods safe.""

As for the other program and potential cuts, Brown worded his concern cautiously and accurately. Let's take a look.

Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS grants

This Justice Department program for keeping neighborhoods safe is competitive. The program helps police departments get federal money to hire and train officers. But it has a stipulation: Cities must pick up the officers' salaries when their grants end. Critics question whether the program is effective.

The House was poised to eliminate COPS, but ended up retaining money for officer hiring and training. But the House bill would eliminate other programs under the COPS umbrella, such as those that have helped departments pay for technology and another that helps local police fight methamphetamine distribution. These latter two ""could be eliminated entirely,"" Brown said.

Brown was accurate by saying ""could."" And while some news reports left the mistaken impression that Cleveland patrol officers hired with COPS dollars are now at risk -- a fallacy that first caught our attention and prompted this very PolitiFact -- we see no evidence that Brown made that specific linkage.

Byrne Justice Assistance Grants

Cleveland has used the money from these grants for regional police dispatching, crime analysis, and task forces to combat violent crime and drugs. Ohio ""could"" lose more than $4.4 million under House budget cuts, Brown said.

The Byrne grants are largely based on a formula that factors in population and crime levels, according to information provided to us by Michelle Person, a spokeswoman in the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs. It is clear from the formula that if the funding for the federal program remained level, Ohio would still qualify. Brown was correct when referring to a possible ""loss.""

As for quantifying it at $4.4 million, Brown's office referred us to a state-by-state analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a liberal group that frequently examines the effect of spending cuts. The center's analysis was based on an estimate that the Byrne grants will be cut by about 29 percent. It is impossible to know the precise scope of Byrne cuts, if they occur, because they are part of a larger Justice Department grant pool that would be trimmed; it is unclear whether all grants would be cut equally.

Yet the 29 percent estimate is consistent with other estimates, and ""it certainly is assumed that Byrne would take its fair share"" among other programs, said Elizabeth Pyke, director of government affairs at the National Criminal Justice Association, which represents cities and states.

The COPS program and Byrne Justice Assistance grants are the two programs that Cleveland and Ohio historically have been guaranteed to get and both can impact policing in neighborhoods.

Urban Areas Security Initiative grants

The Department of Homeland Security gives these grants to help metropolitan areas plan for potential terrorist attacks and mass emergencies. Ohio could ""stand to lose more than $1.7 million"" if these grants were cut, and ""Cleveland alone could lose more than $500,000,"" Brown said in his news release.

These grants are awarded through a formula that factors in each metro area's population and its potential for a terrorist strike or mass emergency.  Sixty-three metro areas now get funding, according to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that believes that the program has expanded too far. The House spending bill would cut the amount of money available to the whole program, and Brown based his figures on a calculation of how that would affect Ohio’s portion, said Meghan Dubyak, Brown’s communications director. However, under an amendment to the House spending bill, only the top 25 metro areas -- measured by their perceived level of threat and related factors -- would qualify for money. No Ohio cities are currently in the top 25, so the loss to Ohio under this circumstance would be higher than Brown calculated.

Brown was correct, then, that Cleveland ""could"" lose ""more than"" $500,000.

All of his claims were based on a House bill that the Senate is expected to change. But the House bill sets the stage for whatever happens next; for now, at least, it is the bill the Senate must work with. And Brown was careful to say it ""could,"" not ""would"" when discussing all the proposed cuts.

We rate his claims as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEE7140>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-cuts-proposed-house-gop-cou/

Unions have little bargaining power in Georgia, education leader says
","
In recent weeks, elected officials and workers in several states have battled over issues such as collective bargaining and reducing employee pension and health care costs as state governments struggle to balance their budgets.

In Georgia, there’s been little debate of such matters. Protesters aren’t sleeping in the state Capitol, as was the case in Wisconsin. But there has been some conversation about labor issues here in the Peach State.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently published two divergent viewpoints on whether public sector employees should have collective-bargaining rights. Calvine Rollins, president of the Georgia Association of Educators, argued they should.

Here’s the line that piqued our interest: ""In Georgia, public sector employees don’t have a say in the conditions of their employment. We don’t have the right to bargain our contracts, negotiate our benefits or have a say in our working conditions.""

Do government employees in Georgia have that little say?

Georgia is a ""right-to-work"" state, meaning unions and businesses cannot force employees to join or financially support a union. The Georgia Legislature passed such guidelines in 1947.

We thought we’d break down each part of Rollins’ claim.

First, do public sector employees have a say in the conditions of their employment? GAE officials told us that teachers cannot negotiate salaries, benefits or class sizes. The Georgia Attorney General’s Office sent us a 1973 opinion, 73:56, on whether Fulton County’s Department of Family and Children Services can, in part, discuss working conditions or personnel policies with a union representing some of the employees.

""While state employees are prohibited from striking, they have the right to express complaints or opinions relating to the conditions of their employment,"" the opinion said.

The opinion also says ""there is no prohibition from the [DFCS] board having discussions with their employees or representatives on appropriate subjects.""

GAE officials argue the statute merely gives employees the right to speak out to their supervisors about employment issues, but not a real conversation.

""There is no negotiation there,"" GAE spokesman Kevin Pearson said.

Let’s examine the next part of Rollins’ statement: ""We don’t have the right to bargain our contracts.""

The attorney general opinion says the state and counties do not have to engage in collective bargaining. Georgia Code section 20-2-989 says collective bargaining is a no-no for teachers.

""Nothing in this part shall be construed to permit or foster collective bargaining as part of the state rules or local unit of administration policies,"" the statute says.

""Employees in general do not have a lot of job protection,"" said Kristine Orr Brown, an employment attorney who has worked for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators.

So what about the last part? Do public sector employees have a say in their working conditions?

Brown disagreed. She told us teachers and public sector employees can seek recourse for problems with their working conditions, particularly racial or gender discrimination, by filing a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Ben Mathis, an attorney who represents local governments and private employers, also disagreed with Rollins. He said employees can file grievance complaints. Mathis also said they have constitutional protections to publicly complain about working conditions that private sector workers do not enjoy.

""You’re taking a very complex issue and making a general statement,"" said Mathis, who has worked for school systems in Cobb, Douglas and Hall counties.

Pearson said Rollins was referring to issues such as class size when discussing working conditions. He said teachers have no say in such matters.

""That’s a realistic working condition for teachers,"" Pearson said. ""We have no control over class size.""

So where does this leave us?

The 1973 opinion from the attorney general’s office does give employees an avenue to discuss the conditions of their employment, so we have issues with the first part of Rollins’ comments. Georgia code and that opinion say state and local governments do not have to engage in collective bargaining, so we believe Rollins is right when she said employees can’t bargain their contracts.

The experts we spoke with about the third part of her statement disagreed with Rollins that public sector employees do not have a say in working conditions. It’s apparent that employees can speak out about working conditions, particularly under EEOC laws. It seems that the GAE has a point that employees may have little influence when they raise concerns about working conditions.

Rollins was trying to make a point that teachers and other public sector employees have trouble addressing their grievances and negotiating the terms of their employment with their bosses. But as Mathis suggested, it could have been more detailed.

One part of her statement was correct, the other two had deep holes in them. Her statement lacked some critical details, and under our guidelines, that rates as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBA4C80>],/factchecks/2011/mar/30/calvine-rollins/unions-have-little-bargaining-power-georgia-group-/

Michele Bachmann claims there has been just one new oil drilling permit issued since Obama took office
","
By most accounts, Rep. Michele Bachmann's slide show of numbers critical of the Obama administration got the most audience feedback among potential 2012 GOP presidential candidates addressing the Conservative Principles PAC Conference in Iowa on March 26, 2011.

Bachmann was particularly critical of Obama's energy policy, including his decision to put a temporary moratorium on new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill. During the moratorium, the administration enacted new safety and environmental requirements, including regulations for spill response and containment capability.

""Let's look at the number one. Number one,"" Bachmann said. ""That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office.

""Gee, maybe that has something to do with this next figure. Let's take a look, $1.83. That is the price that gasoline was the day before Barack Obama took office as president of the United States.

""Is it time for a change?""

Audience: ""Yes!""

""It is time for a change,"" Bachmann said. ""Absolutely, it's time for a change.""

 ""You cannot create jobs when you have a president that is unwilling to use American energy resources to solve our problems here in the United States,"" she said moments later.

Just one oil drilling permit approved during the entire Obama presidency? We recalled that in a March 11, 2011, press conference, Obama said, ""we’ve approved more than 35 new offshore drilling permits that meet these new safety and environmental standards."" And he was talking only about permits issued after the Gulf of Mexico moratorium.

So somebody's got to be wrong. 
We went first to the Department of the Interior press office, which sent us a link to a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE, report on the ""Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements.""

According to the report, 39 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect. Shallow water drilling operations were not affected by the deepwater drilling moratorium following the gulf oil spill. And there were lots more shallow-water well permits issued by the Obama administration prior to June 8, 2010. Remember, Bachmann's statement referred to permits issued ""under the Obama administration since they came into office.""

In addition, there have been six deepwater well permits issued since Oct. 12, 2010, when the gulf moratorium was lifted. Five of those were for projects that were under way prior to the moratorium. The operators were required to come back and meet the new, modified standards.

And last week, BOEMRE approved an ""exploration plan"" submitted by Shell Offshore Inc., for deepwater oil and gas exploration. It was the first new deepwater exploration plan approved since the gulf oil spill. According to a BOEMRE press release, ""An exploration plan describes all exploration activities planned by the operator for a specific lease or leases, including the timing of these activities, information concerning drilling vessels, the location of each planned well and other relevant information that needs to meet important safety standards. Once a plan is approved, additional new applications for permits to drill can be issued."" In other words, it's not a permit. Permits come down the road.

In all, BOEMRE has received 45 deepwater drilling permit applications that are subject to the new regulations. These include applications to drill new wells, bypasses, and sidetracks. Twenty-four of these permits have been returned to the operator with requests for additional information (most regarding subsea containment). BOEMRE has approved seven of these permits (for six unique wells), with 12 applications pending.
   
Again, these are deepwater permits issued after the moratorium. The Obama administration issued lots of deepwater permits prior to that.

In addition, BOEMRE has received 31 deepwater drilling permit applications for activities such as drilling water injection wells and drilling from a fixed rig with a surface blowout preventer that were allowed under the moratorium. BOEMRE has approved 28 of these permits.

According to Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, permit approvals have dropped 65 percent, post gulf oil spill. Prior to the gulf disaster, the Obama administration reported approving 217 new well permits (shallow and deepwater).

""The devil's in the details on these things,"" Radford said, noting that permits include a lot of different drilling activities.

But the pace of permitting is picking up, he said. ""We'll get to the new normal eventually.""

Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said there has been a ""molasses effect"" with permitting by the Obama administration. Even the 39 permits for new shallow water wells is dramatically lower than previous levels. And even with six deepwater permits issued in the last month, as well as the ones projected to be approved this year, permits for deepwater wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf oil spill. The permitting process has undeniably slowed, Hunt said, but as the numbers above show, Bachmann's statement -- at least the way she worded it -- is wrong.

""We are encouraging offshore exploration and production,"" Obama said in his March 11 press conference. ""We're just doing it responsibly."" 
Bachmann's press office did not return our call, so we are relegated to playing the ""perhaps she meant"" game to test whether there is a sense in which she might be accurate. 
Perhaps she meant permits since the moratorium, not since Obama administration came into office, as she said. (There were hundreds issued pre-gulf oil spill). 
Perhaps she meant just deepwater drilling, not shallow water drilling. There have been 39 shallow-water permits for new wells since June 2010. And many more before that. 
Perhaps she meant to exclude permits issued for projects that were under way prior to the oil spill (and which had to come back and meet the new, modified standards). Five of the six new well permits were underway prior to the moratorium. 
Perhaps she meant not permits, but exploration plans. The first exploration plan since the oil spill was approved last week. 
Perhaps. 
But that's not what she said. 
She said: ""One. That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office."" It's not even close, and the claim is ridiculously false.

Barack Obama says regime change in Iraq took eight years
","
During a March 28, 2011, address to the nation, President Barack Obama drew a comparison between his course in Libya -- where the United States and its allies are enforcing a no-fly zone against Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi -- and Iraq, where Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush, used military force to oust Saddam Hussein.

""The task that I assigned our forces -- to protect the Libyan people from immediate danger and to establish a no-fly zone -- carries with it a (United Nations) mandate and international support,"" Obama said in a televised address from National Defense University in Washington, D.C. ""It’s also what the Libyan opposition asked us to do. If we tried to overthrow Gadhafi by force, our coalition would splinter. We would likely have to put U.S. troops on the ground to accomplish that mission or risk killing many civilians from the air. The dangers faced by our men and women in uniform would be far greater. So would the costs and our share of the responsibility for what comes next.""

He continued by making a comparison to the Iraq War.

""To be blunt, we went down that road in Iraq,"" Obama said. ""Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops and the determination of our diplomats, we are hopeful about Iraq’s future. But regime change there took eight years, thousands of American and Iraqi lives, and nearly a trillion dollars. That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya.""

We wondered whether it was fair for Obama to say that ""regime change"" in Iraq ""took eight years"" -- which would mean that it’s still ongoing or that it recently ended.

Whether Obama is correct depends heavily on the definition of ""regime change."" Is it accomplished simply with the ouster of the old regime? Or is it accomplished with the installation of a new, stable government?

To investigate this question, let’s recap the chronology of the political situation in Iraq, starting with the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. To assemble the chronology, we’ve drawn heavily on a detailed BBC chronology of recent Iraqi history.

2003

May: U.N. Security Council officially backs U.S.-led interim authority. Baath Party and institutions of the former regime are abolished.

July: U.S.-appointed governing council holds its first meeting.

December: Hussein captured.

2004

June: U.S. turns over sovereignty to interim government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.

2005

January: Eight million votes cast in Transitional National Assembly elections.

April: Parliament names Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, president, and Ibrahim Jaafari, a Shiite, prime minister.

October: Voters approve a new, federal democratic constitution.

December: Iraqis vote for first full-term government and parliament since the invasion.

2006

January: Shiite-led United Iraqi Alliance wins election but falls short of a majority.

April: President Talabani asks Shiite compromise candidate Nouri al-Maliki to form a new government.

December: Hussein executed.

2007

August: A key Sunni bloc, the Iraqi Accordance Front, withdraws from the cabinet following a dispute over power-sharing.

2008

July: The Iraqi Accordance Front rejoins the government.

2010

March: No coalition wins enough votes for a parliamentary majority.

August: Iraq's two main political blocs suspend talks on forming a government.

November: Parliament reconvenes and reappoints Talabani as president and al-Maliki as prime minister.

December: Parliament ends deadlock and approves a new government, minus a few ministries where no agreement could be reached.

We see supporting evidence for either interpretation of ""regime change"" in this chronology.

On the one hand, Hussein’s regime was ousted quickly after the war began and was succeeded by a U.N.-sanctioned transitional government. In turn, the transitional government was succeeded by a democratically elected interim government and two subsequent rounds of democratic parliamentary elections, all supported by a voter-approved constitution.

On the other hand, Obama has a point that the process of establishing a new government has been, at best, imperfect and drawn-out. At various points, the process of forming a government has slipped into months of paralysis.

""Regime transition can take a long time, even a decade or more,"" said Marc Chernick, a foreign policy specialist who teaches at Georgetown University. ""What Obama stated was perfectly fair, indeed, even optimistic, as it is not clear to me that a new regime, especially a democratic regime, has been consolidated.""

And establishing democracy in Iraq required the presence initially of U.S. troops -- through August 2010, when the final U.S. combat brigades withdrew -- and now home-grown forces.

""The regime has relied on foreign forces to prop it up for eight years,"" said Robin Wright, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace. ""Especially during the 2004-2007 period, the U.S. secured the state from foreign fighters, al-Qaida and an insurgency. The regime change was arguably not viable until Iraqi troops could take over from the U.S.""

Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign policy specialist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, agrees that both interpretations are credible, though ""on balance, I think his point is fair. He was clearly describing the overall effort, not a particular phase of the campaign.""

Ultimately, we think both interpretations of the term ""regime change"" are credible. Obama has clearly staked out a position on one end of the spectrum, which experts tell us is a defensible approach. But we think it's also valid to point out that the Hussein regime is long gone, replaced by an internationally recognized successor government. While that government has been less than stable, other democratic countries have had periods of political volatility as well. We rate Obama’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF8B9C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-regime-change-iraq-took-eight-ye/

Karl Rove says that “American troops have never been under the formal control of another nation”
","During an appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News Show on March 23, 2011, Republican strategist Karl Rove addressed some of the issues surrounding U.S. involvement with its allies in enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya.

At one point, Hannity said: ""The United States is basically saying, ‘We're not going to lead this thing.’ So, France is actually proposing a political steering company to run the war.""

After some crosstalk, Rove said, ""Who is on that committee? American troops have never been under the formal control of another nation.Why should we start now?""

We wondered whether it was true that American forces had never been ""under the formal control of another nation.""  So we asked nine military historians and other experts in the field. And their view was unanimous.

""No, that’s not correct,"" said Brett Schaefer, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

""Absolutely false,"" concluded Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina.

""Rove’s comment is misleading and uninformed,"" added Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University.

""Coalition warfare and the leadership of foreign commanders has played a part in U.S. history since the War for Independence, when the commander of the troops of the predecessor colonies, George Washington, entrusted a key mission and command of 2,000 Continental soldiers to a French Major General, the Marquis de Lafayette,"" wrote the Congressional Research Service in a 2001 report. ""Since 1900, there have been at least seventeen military operations in which the United States has placed U.S. troops under a foreign commander.""

Our panel of experts pointed to a litany of historical examples:

• The Boxer Rebellion. U.S. forces took part in the ""eight-nation alliance"" sent to China after rebel forces known as ""boxers"" threatened westerners in the country. A 20,000-man force eventually captured Beijing, and the victorious powers imposed large reparations. According to the U.S. Navy, the first (and unsuccessful) offensive included 2,100 sailors and marines from the eight nations in the alliance -- Great Britain, Germany, Russia, France, the United States, Japan, Italy, and Austria -- under the control of British Admiral Edward Seymour.

• World War I. Vice Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly of the British Royal Navy oversaw an effort based in Queenstown, Ireland, to protect commercial ships off the coast of France and Great Britain. Among the assets under his control was a U.S. destroyer squadron commanded by Cmdr. J.K. Taussig.

Meanwhile, U.S. Battleship Division Nine, a four and later five-ship group commanded by Rear Adm. Hugh Rodman, became part of the allied Grand Fleet under the command of British Adm. David Beatty, based in Scapa Flow, Scotland.

Finally, the 369th Infantry Regiment (known as the ""Harlem Hellfighters"") became the first all-black combat unit sent overseas in World War I. There was no U.S. combat role available for black soldiers at the time, so Gen. John J. Pershing sent the 369th and its affiliates to join the French army. For their efforts, the soldiers were awarded the French Croix de Guerre.

• Russian Revolution. Three U.S. battalions joined British, Canadian, Italian, Finnish and Serbian units near Murmansk that were under the command of a British general during the Bolshevik Revolution, according to CRS.

• World War II. The commander of U.S. forces in the China-Burma-India theater was British, though the personnel varied. Initially it was Gen. Archibald Wavell, the commander-in-chief in India. Then in 1943, Adm. Lord Mountbatten was named Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia forces. Technically, U.S. forces in China were commanded by Chaing Kai Shek, the Supreme Allied Commander in China, though U.S. military leaders played an unofficial command role.

Meanwhile, British Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson succeeded U.S. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, ultimately receiving the title of Supreme Commander of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, which included Italy. Wilson was succeeded about a year later by British Field Marshal Harold Alexander.

During the Battle of the Bulge, the U.S. First and Ninth armies fell under British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. And British Adm. Bertram Ramsay was in charge of all allied forces taking part in Operation Neptune, the naval effort that paved the way for the the D-Day invasion. Ramsay said Neptune was ""probably the largest and most complicated operation ever undertaken.""

• Cold War. While the Supreme Allied Commander-Europe (or SACEUR) has traditionally been an American, NATO war plans put Americans under sub-commanders who were British or German. In fact, the general in charge of managing the defense of western Europe in the face of a Warsaw Pact attack was traditionally a German general, said Andrew Bacevich, a career Army officer who now teaches international relations at Boston University.

Meanwhile, the post of deputy commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, better known as NORAD, has been held by a Canadian since the 1950s. So if the commander is away, U.S. forces would be taking orders from a Canadian.

• Recent conflicts. The CRS report cites several recent examples of U.S. troops under foreign control. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a U.S. brigade was placed under operational control of a French commander. Beginning in 1992, the ground component of the U.S.-Republic of Korea Combined Forces Command was commanded by a South Korean general with a U.S. deputy. Hundreds of troops have served in the Multinational Force in the Sinai, which has been commanded by non-Americans, including a Canadian.

The Balkan conflicts of the 1990s offered several examples, according to CRS. The U.S. sent a 342-man Mobile Army Surgical Hospital to Zagreb, Croatia, for the use of a United Nations force under French command. In 1993, roughly 600 U.S. soldiers patrolled the Macedonian border under a Swedish commander. And at one point in the Kosovo conflict, 6,515 U.S. troops served under a French general in NATO’s Kosovo Force.

Finally, experts told PolitiFact that small American units regularly operate under the tactical command of allied leaders in Afghanistan.

""U.S. troops have served under tactical foreign command in a wide array of NATO and UN operations over the last 65 years,"" said Janda of Cameron University. ""However, it’s not the case that foreign commanders can do whatever they want with U.S. forces that are under their control. The United States contributes limited forces to specific commands for defined periods of time under stringent guidelines and operational limits, closely monitors their activity, and always has the right to withdraw them or countermand orders involving our troops at our discretion. Those are the same limitations every U.S. ally puts on their forces that operate under our command as well.""

Indeed, several of our experts emphasized that there is a difference between operational control and full command.

""In the legal sense, ‘control’ is just the authority to direct forces to do a mission, and we've done that since at least World War I,"" said James Jay Carafano, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""‘Command’ includes authority for military punishment, responsibility for logistics and so on. Nations hardly ever give command of their forces to other nations."" When we presented our findings to Rove, he conceded through a spokesman that he was in error. He said he ""had checked, quickly, for post-World War II (instances), but of course (PolitiFact is) right about World War I in which Americans were under foreign command, and it looks like there are instances in World War II where U.S. troops may have been under the operational command of British leadership.""

Ultimately, there are at leat 17 examples, stretching back longer than a century, in which U.S. forces have worked, mostly successfully, under foreign operational leadership. So we rate Rove's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD11D40>],/factchecks/2011/mar/29/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-american-troops-have-never-been-und/

Freshman House member says pill mill database isn't needed because one already exists
","
Republicans in Tallahassee are split on whether to implement a new database that would track the sale of some prescription drugs in order to better identify and prevent doctor shopping and prescription drug abuse.

The statewide drug-monitoring database would allow pharmacists and physicians to track the sale of prescription drugs and pain medication in order to prevent patients from going doctor to doctor to acquire prescriptions. Law enforcement officials could use the database to spot doctors who were over-prescribing drugs or people who are trying to abuse the system.

More than 30 other states already have some type of database. Florida approved its version in 2009, but the database has been stalled over a contract dispute over what private vendor would manage the system. That has given some Republicans a chance to second-guess the program.

A bill moving through the House at the behest of Speaker Dean Cannon (HB 7095) would eliminate the database. Rep. Robert Schenck, chairman of the committee that sponsored the bill, argues that the database merely tracks the problem and doesn't stop it. The House bill would instead require tracking drug wholesalers to identify unusually large distributions of narcotics. It also prohibits doctors from dispensing those medications, leaving that to pharmacists.

Gov. Rick Scott, meanwhile, has said he worries the database could be an invasion of privacy, and that he doesn't want Florida taxpayers to end up on the hook for a program that was established with the promise that it would never be supported by state money. Federal grants and private fundraising efforts have generated enough money to run the database for about two years. And Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has offered to pay $1 million to help fund the program. Scott also announced March 28 a statewide law enforcement response to try to halt criminal distribution and abuse of drugs in Florida.

A freshman legislator from Pinellas County, Rep. Larry Ahern, wrote a letter to the editor of the St. Petersburg Times with another reason to oppose the database: Florida already has one. Ahern, who runs a swimming pool remodeling business, was responding to an editorial from the Times urging Republicans to move forward with the database.

""The Florida House has it right, and the Times gets it wrong,"" he wrote in a letter published March 25, 2011. ""Pharmacies already have a database in place, and the transaction is recorded on the spot. They will question the person trying to fill another prescription so quickly, and not fill it or call the doctor.

""We don't need a separate database with one already in place. The House bill will close pill mills without hurting legitimate doctors' ability to help their patients.""

Is the database that's caused such a fight in the Legislature overkill?

Lori Weems, a lobbyist for the Florida Pharmacy Association, suggested we call a pharmacist to find out.

Ron Haines, a licensed pharmacist since 1961 who works at an independent pharmacy in Tarpon Springs, told us there is no database like the one Ahern is suggesting.

""I can't call the pharmacy across the street to ask if they filled a prescription for Mike Smith. They can't tell me.""

Records are kept by pharmacies, of course, but those records aren't shared, Haines said.

Every pharmacy keeps a record of what they prescribe to patients, Haines said, and pharmacy chains like Walgreens, CVS and Publix link into company databases. So a Publix pharmacist might know how many times a customer has been to a Publix pharmacy, and for what. But the Walgreens database doesn't sync into the CVS database, or vice versa.

Insurance companies also keep databases on their patients to track what insurance companies are being ask to help pay for.

But none of those databases were created with the idea of trying to find people -- doctors or patients -- who are abusing the system, Haines said.

""The databases we use store prescription records in the pharmacy. That's as far as it goes,"" he said. ""There is nothing aimed at targeting bad doctors and doctor shopping. That's what we're after."" 
Michael Jackson, CEO of the Florida Pharmacy Association, told us the same thing. 
""It is true that many of the major chain pharmacies have prescription databases that are shared under their corporate umbrella pharmacies however they are not interconnected with other pharmacies,"" Jackson said. ""For example I may be a pharmacist working at chain ""A"" and a patient brings in their prescription to me. I cannot determine if that patient had a prescription filled at my competitor chain ""B"" located across the street that same day.  In many cases I may ask the patient to provide me with their medication history and who has been their pharmacy providers but they may either not remember or for some reason elect to withhold that information from me.""

Ahern, in an interview, more or less conceded the point. He said what he was trying to suggest is that the state should explore ways to have the big pharmacies connect the already in-place databases together in a way that would allow law enforcement and pharmacists to look for trouble spots. He said using infrastructure already in place is better than creating a new system from scratch.

""That would, in essence, solve much of the problems,"" he said. 
Ahern also pointed out flaws in the statewide monitoring program -- namely that health care practitioners would not be required to access the database before prescribing anyone medicine. And that pharmacists have 15 days to enter drug purchases into the system. ""Where does that solve the problem?"" Ahern asked.

Ahern, for the record, is worried about privacy concerns in the database, and says he supports efforts to quell doctor-shopping. But he just doesn't think the statewide database is an effective tool in that fight.

He also claimed in his letter to the editor that a database already is in place. There are many private-sector databases that collect information on prescription drug purchases, but those databases are not interconnected and were not created with the idea of reducing prescription drug abuse statewide. These individual store or company databases don't address the problem. So we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9B8940>],/factchecks/2011/mar/29/larry-ahern/freshman-house-member-says-pill-mill-database-isnt/
"['Legal Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'Greater Wisconsin Committee']","
Greater Wisconsin Committee says Supreme Court Justice David Prosser mishandled allegation of sex abuse by priest
","
A new TV ad claims that in 1978, when Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser was a district attorney, he didn’t ask police to investigate an abuse case involving a longtime pedophile priest, then refused to file charges and participated in a cover-up.

The claims are made by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which frequently runs TV ads critical of Republicans. The group is also running an anti-Prosser ad linking the 13-year justice to Republican Gov. Scott Walker.

Both ads were released less than two weeks before Prosser faces challenger assistant state attorney general JoAnne Kloppenburg in the April 5, 2011, election.

The priest ad quickly sparked controversy partly because two brothers who were the victims in 1978 case repudiated it.

Here’s what the narrator says in the ad, which began airing March 24, 2011:

""A priest sexually abuses children for 30 years across Wisconsin. A mother tells DA David Prosser her two young sons were sexually assaulted. What does Prosser do? Prosser refuses to prosecute; doesn’t even ask the police to investigate. Instead, Prosser meets with the bishop. To avoid scandal, they send the priest to another community and the assaults continue. Tell David Prosser: Judges should protect our children, not sex offenders.""

A picture of Prosser is shown throughout the ad. A picture of the priest is shown briefly, along with two newspaper headlines revealing that Prosser had declined to file charges and was questioned about the decision.

The priest, the mother and her two sons are not identified by name. But there is no dispute that the ad refers to a May 1978 incident that Sharon Merryfield reported to Prosser, who was the Outagamie County district attorney at the time.

Merryfield told Prosser -- who said he attended middle and high school with her -- that Catholic priest John Patrick Feeney improperly touched her sons Todd, then 14, and Troy, then 12, at the family’s home.

A court summary in a later matter says Feeney, who worked at a church in Freedom, touched the boys in the chest area and moved his hand downward toward their penises but did not touch them there. Feeney also pinched one of the boys on the buttocks.

The incident -- as a result of a later investigation, in 2002 -- helped put Feeney behind bars.

Let’s see whether information in the ad backs up the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s central claims -- that Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate the two boys’ accusations against a longtime pedophile priest; that Prosser didn’t file criminal charges; and that he participated in a cover-up of the priest’s actions.

We’ll draw from evidence cited by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, news reports, court records and comments Prosser made during a 20-minute discussion of the case with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board on March 24, 2011.

The ad essentially makes three sets of claims. We’ll address them one at a time.

The incident involved a priest who had abused children for 30 years

The ad suggests that when the matter came to Prosser, he was aware Feeney had a long history of molesting boys.

But evidence that Feeney molested boys over some 30 years emerged 24 years later, in the 2002 investigation, which was conducted by the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Department. That investigation found Feeney had molested boys dating back to 1969, although no charges were filed in the older incidents because the statute of limitations had expired.

So, while the priest may have had an extensive history of sexual abuse, the ad takes it out of context to suggest this was known by Prosser in 1978.

Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate and refused to prosecute.

Prosser said in the editorial board interview that he interviewed both boys and found another Feeney victim, but that victim refused to testify. He did not ask a police agency -- in this case, the Sheriff’s Department -- to investigate, so the ad is correct on that claim.

It is an open question whether the Sheriff’s Department would have investigated the Merryfield boys incident and related cases more vigorously than Prosser did.

The ad is also correct that Prosser decided not to file charges against Feeney. But it provides no context as to why they were not pursued.

In his comments to the Journal Sentinel, Prosser cited several reasons.

Prosser said the case would have been difficult to prove at the time because Feeney had not indecently touched the boys, and because it would pit the credibility of two boys against the credibility of a priest. He also said the case would be hard on the family because it would become sensationalized, given that Feeney’s brother, Joe Feeney, was a regular performer on the Lawrence Welk network television show. And he said his office lacked experienced prosecutors.

So, this statement also leaves out key information.

Indeed, records show more details came out during the future investigations, which made the case against Feeney stronger. By that point, other victims had emerged.

Prosser and a bishop, ""to avoid scandal,"" sent the priest to another community and the assaults continued.

Prosser said that as part of his investigation, he told Green Bay Bishop Aloysius Wycislo that Feeney needed to be removed from the Freedom parish and that the bishop replied by saying, ""I will take care of it.""

Prosser said he related that information to the Merryfield family when he told them he had decided not to file charges.

""The family didn’t seem to be that upset at the time,"" told the editorial board.

Wycislo wrote a letter in 1978 saying Prosser had come to him ""to prevent unnecessary scandal."" He also wrote: ""I had to agree with the district attorney that the church would prefer to keep this out of court and out of the public eye and I was able to tell (Feeney) of our decision last week, with which he agreed.""

So, the ""avoiding scandal"" characterization is attributable to the bishop. Prosser says choosing not to prosecute had nothing to do with avoiding scandal.

What’s more,  Prosser would not have had any official role in moving Feeney, although it appears he and the bishop agreed that should be done.

Prosser said that, to his surprise, Feeney was not moved until more than six months later. By that time, Prosser had won election to the state Assembly and left his district attorney post. He had been campaigning for the job when Sharon Merryfield first came to him.

Prosser also noted that in January 1979, Sharon Merryfield filed a report with the Sheriff’s Department about the incident in her home, and that that report also did not result in criminal charges.

In 2002, the Sheriff’s Department opened another  investigation after another Feeney victim was discovered. News reports said Feeney worked in 18 parishes over 30 years in the Green Bay diocese before he left Wisconsin in 1983. The reports cited church documents in saying that Feeney left amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct with altar boys.

Authorities were able to charge Feeney in the 2002 investigation because he had left Wisconsin, which meant the statute of limitations had not expired.

That supports the point in the ad that says abuse continued.

That’s where the ad ends. But let’s finish the story about how Feeney ended up behind bars.

As the case summary shows, Troy Merryfield stated in the 2002 sheriff’s investigation that Feeney had grabbed his penis during a face-to-face confession one or two months before the May 1978 incident in the Merryfield home. Prosser said Troy Merryfield never told him about the earlier incident; and the appeals court noted that the earlier incident was not mentioned in the January 1979 sheriff’s report that had been filed by Sharon Merryfield.

So, Prosser did not have that allegation to consider when he decided not to file charges against Feeney.

The 2002 sheriff’s investigation produced five felony charges against Feeney for the two incidents involving the Merryfield brothers. The charges included attempting to touch the boy’s penises during the incident in their home.

Feeney was convicted of four of the charges and was sentenced in 2004 to 15 years in prison. Now 84, he could be released from prison in November 2011 on extended supervision, according to the state Department of Corrections.

Troy Merryfield issued a statement the day after the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s ad was released, calling the ad ""offensive, inaccurate and out of context."" The statement said the sheriff’s 2002 investigation resulted in charges because he and his brother were able to provide more detailed information about Feeney’s actions than they did when Prosser handled the case in 1978, and that, as adults, they were more comfortable about testifying.

In 2008, Troy Merryfield had been critical of Prosser, saying he should step aside when cases involving priest sexual misconduct come before the Supreme Court. ""He knows damn well what happened and what was said,"" Merryfield said about his own case in 2008. ""He dropped the ball, and he should recuse himself.""

Todd Merryfield told PolitiFact Wisconsin he stands by his brother’s statement condemning the ad and agreed it should no longer be aired.

So, where does all of this leave us?

The Greater Wisconsin Committee claims David Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate a mother’s report that a 30-year pedophile priest had indecently touched her two sons, then refused to file charges him and participated in a cover-up of the priest’s acts.

The committee’s TV ad uses generally factual statements to make its case, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. By using information that only became known later, it suggests more information was available to Prosser at the time than really was. For instance, Prosser didn’t know that the priest had a long history of molestation -- that came out 24 years later. And it wasn’t until 24 years later that one of the brothers made the most serious allegation against the priest.

Finally, the two brothers have condemned the ad as ""offensive, inaccurate and out of context.""

We rate the committee’s claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC837940>],/factchecks/2011/mar/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-supreme-court-jus/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', '  Young Americans for Liberty']","
Congress doing little to slow debt, student group says
","
Congress just doesn’t get it.

That’s the message from Young Americans for Liberty, a group of college students that is very worried about the growing federal debt, $14 trillion and counting.

Clayton State University has a chapter that is trying to raise awareness about the issue. Its main target is U.S. Rep. David Scott, an Atlanta Democrat whose district includes the Clayton State campus, located in Morrow.

Members of the group planned to place a sign on campus Monday announcing the size of the debt. The group offered some interesting statistics in a news release.

""Every taxpayer owes about $130,000 to pay off the national debt.""

Scary thought unless you’re the lucky son of a gun who won Friday’s $319 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot.

So is this debt estimate true?

Young Americans for Liberty said it got its numbers from a website called www.usdebtclock.org. The website has a page with numbers on federal government data that change by the second. It estimated the debt at close to $14.3 trillion and had the debt per taxpayer at $128,371. It says there are 111,087,453 U.S. taxpayers with taxable income. The people who maintain the website apparently divided the debt total by that 111 million figure to come up with that $128,371 total. We tried to ask them how specifically they came up with that total. The website had no telephone number. We sent them an e-mail and got an automatic response.

""Thank you for your comments,"" the message said. ""Although we can't respond to all emails we really appreciate your input and Thank You for your support!""

This left us to our own devices to figure this one out. If you divide the debt estimate by their estimate of taxpayers, that equates to about $128,000 for each taxpayer.

But is the information the group used to come up with that total correct?

According to TreasuryDirect, a federal website, the total public debt is about $14.2 trillion. About $9.6 trillion of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies, and state, local and foreign governments. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts.

According to the Internal Revenue Service, it will receive an estimated 140 million tax returns this year. The agency received an estimated 144 million returns for 2009. The IRS notes that some filers do not have taxable income because of various credits and deductions.

If you divide the $14.2 trillion debt estimate by 140 million taxpayers, that equates to about $100,000 for each taxpayer.

But is it best to use the total public debt? Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the federal government typically uses the debt held by the public, currently about $9.6 trillion, when it issues Treasury bonds. If you use that figure, the total per taxpayer is just under $87,000. That sounds better, doesn’t it?

So it is wrong to use the $14.2 trillion figure? ""You can argue it either way,"" he said.

Peuquet added, ""Ultimately, this $14 trillion figure is going to have to be repaid.""

Economists note that it is good for the government to have some debt, primarily because the global economy ""depends on some of that money floating out there,"" Peuquet said. Economists say the amount of public debt becomes a major concern once it grows to more than 90 percent of America’s gross domestic product. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that could happen in about 10 years, as health care costs rise and an aging population puts more demands on Social Security. The current public debt-to-GDP ratio is 69 percent, according to the CBO.

The debt is typically reduced when the U.S. economy improves, Peuquet said. A so-called ""Gang of Six,"" a group of U.S. senators that includes Georgia’s Saxby Chambliss, is meeting regularly to consider long-term solutions -- some suggested by President Barack Obama’s bipartisan committee -- to lower the debt.

Young Americans for Liberty used figures from a group that had most of its numbers right. The IRS uses a different standard to calculate the number of taxpayers. We’ll give the students the benefit of the doubt on whether it’s better to use the total debt figure or debt owed by the public.

Chris Abele says Milwaukee County Parks Director Sue Black has not received a pay raise in five years
","
Milwaukee County should be run more like a business. That’s one theme of first-time candidate Chris Abele as he seeks to replace Scott Walker as county executive in the April 5 election.

On the campaign trail, Abele often says one standard, business-like approach to government calls for rewarding employees who deliver -- especially on the revenue front. When making his point, he routinely singles out the county parks director.

He made the point during a March 22, 2011, appearance with challenger Jeff Stone before the Milwaukee Rotary Club.

""You’ve got parks where for five years in a row earned revenue is growing and you have a parks director who earns the gold medal national award for the best managed park system but (her parks budget) gets cut and (she) doesn’t get a raise for five years.""

Sounds like someone got a raw deal.

Let’s take a look at what Abele was discussing.

We asked Abele’s campaign for his backup.

Spokesman Brandon Lorenz sent us to Black, who he said told Abele about the money matter. Black didn’t return our calls, so we went to county records and other past news reports.

Walker hired Black to run the county parks in 2004. Previously, she had been the director of the Wisconsin State Park System. While working for the Walker administration, Black earned a reputation as being a fierce advocate for the parks, even with a boss whose mantra was to cut back on county government. She considered running to replace Walker herself, but in January 2011 discarded the idea.

In 2009, she won a national award, presented by the American Academy for Parks and Recreation and the National Recreation and Parks Association.

At the time of the award, Jim Goulee, executive director of the Park People, a local parks advocacy organization, praised Black’s performance. He said Black and her staff had managed the system well in the face of ""incessant budget cuts.""

Until recently, Black was paid $117,973 -- and it had been that way for a while.

After Walker was re-elected in the spring of 2008, he rewarded several county department heads with higher pay. He accomplished that by taking the unusual step of moving up their pay grades when they were reappointed to their jobs in July 2008. County supervisors voted on the re-appointments but not the actual raises -- a matter that some complained about later on.

Some examples: Airport Director Barry Bateman got an 11 percent bump, to $136,298; Department of Aging Director Stephanie Sue Stein got 4 percent, to $117,795; and corporation counsel William Domina got 8.3 percent, to $136,298.

Black, too, was reappointed to her job.

She got no increase.

So, to this point, Abele’s point is on, well, point.

Like all other county workers, Black received a 1 percent cost-of-living raise in October 2008, but beyond that her pay has remained the same. And since that was an across-the-board thing, it’s not a merit-based raise.

Enter Lee Holloway, who became acting county executive in late December 2010. Holloway served about a month in the job before handing over the position to Marvin Pratt, who is in the position until the winner of the April 5 election takes over.

Holloway included a $6,439 raise -- 5.5 percent -- for Black in a recommendation to the County Board’s Personnel Committee. The committee voted 6-0 to approve the report that included the raise, and it took effect Feb. 6, 2011, county records say. Black is now paid $123,931 -- well below the top pay possible for her position, $137,661.

So, Black did get a raise, but very recently.

Black’s unhappiness with her pay is well-known among courthouse insiders. Abele became aware of it after working with Black on several projects, including improvements to the Mitchell Park Domes and Bradford Beach, spokesman Lorenz said.

Lorenz was unaware that Black had received the raise when contacted by PolitiFact the day after the forum. He also learned from PolitiFact that it had been seven years rather than five.

Lorenz said someone with the campaign spoke with Black that day, and she said she had not seen the additional money. However, county records show her raise was reflected on a March 3, 2011, paycheck.

At a candidate’s forum that evening, Abele mentioned Black’s raise and noted -- correctly -- that she had gone seven years without a bump. Abele revised his time span after speaking with Lorenz. But the candidate didn’t hear about the recent raise until the following morning, according to Lorenz.

So let’s add this one up.

Abele says Black, the award-winning director of the Milwaukee County Parks System, hasn’t received a raise in five (or seven, depending on the statement) years. That talking point came from Black herself, but very recently it became no longer operative. While Black got nothing when some other department heads received bumps in 2008, Holloway gave her a raise recently. It was handled in a low-key manner; Abele apparently wasn’t aware of it.

The main thrust was good work should be rewarded, with Black -- who went seven years without a raise -- the example. He got some of the details wrong -- even after he moved to correct them. But on balance, this rates as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB99A4C0>],/factchecks/2011/mar/28/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-milwaukee-county-parks-director-s/
"['Georgia', 'Science', 'Joel Keehn']","
Daylight Saving health concerns valid
","Ahhhhhhhh. Two weeks into that yearly adventure in springing forward and sleep deprivation -- better known as daylight saving time -- and most of you have probably caught up on your sleep.

For all of  those still grousing about the time change, take heart. You are not alone.

Daylight saving time has inspired controversy for more than 100 years. Supporters tout the economic benefits. Detractors decry its effect on everything from religious worship to the natural rhythms of sleep cycles.

A political party was created in Australia’s Queensland in 2008 to promote the formation of a dual time zone. One portion of the Australian state would stick with standard time, and the other would spring forward for a portion of the year.

In the United States, the National PTA has lobbied Congress against daylight saving time. The PTA contends the time change presents a safety risk to children walking to school in the dark.

Earlier this month, Joel Keehn, a senior editor at Consumer Reports Health Blog, said: ""The hour of sleep you will likely lose ... might pose a few health risks, at least for a couple of days.""

Losing an hour of sleep is certainly annoying. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether these unnaturally early mornings were really putting people in harm’s way.

Keehn said the article couches statements about health risks using careful wording, and he made sure to also cite the benefits of daylight saving time. He focused on the health effects caused by the sudden time change and potential loss of sleep, he said, because he knew other studies have determined there are benefits to having more sunlight in the evening.

""What’s problematic is the switching back and forth all the time,"" Keehn said.

On his blog, Keehn said most Americans are already sleep-deprived. The extra hour of sleep they miss in the leap forward to daylight saving time can lead to an increased chance of a car accident or heart attack. Keehn did not cite a study concerning the increased likelihood of car accidents. He did cite a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concerning the increased chance of a heart attack following the switch to daylight saving time.

Keehn also pointed out in his blog that the extra hour of sunlight in the evening may encourage more people to exercise outside and can help people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder, often referred to as the winter blues.

There are many studies that support Keehn’s position.

Two Michigan State University graduate students found the number of accidents and severity of accidents in mines increased on the Monday after daylight saving time begins, according to their analysis of a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health database.

The study of mining accidents from 1983 through 2006 revealed that the number of accidents increased by 5.6 percent and the number of days lost to these accidents increased by 67 percent.

The authors drew a correlation between the increased accidents and lost sleep, finding mine workers lost an average of 40 minutes of sleep during the switch.

There was no such increase in the number of accidents during the switch back to standard time, the study found.

Other industries probably experience a similar increase in worker accidents, said Christopher M. Barnes, one of the authors and now an assistant professor of character development and research at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

Taken as a whole, Barnes said Keehn’s statement makes sense.

""It’s accurate for a few reasons,"" he said. ""As my study showed, there’s an increased risk of accidents, and as an article in the journal Science showed, there’s an increased risk for heart attacks.""

But there are also studies that show daylight saving time actually promotes safety in the long run.

A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an Arlington, Va.-based nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing the number of deaths and accidents on the nation’s highways, found the extra hour of daylight during the busier evening commute lowers the overall number of crashes.

In fact, the study concludes that using daylight saving time year-round could eliminate 900 fatal crashes, including more than 700 fatal crashes involving pedestrians. The extra hour makes cars and pedestrians more visible when the most people are traveling, said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the institute.

""The research on traffic safety is clear, and DST is a benefit, not a determent, to road safety, especially for pedestrians,"" Rader said.

A study by Stanley Coren, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of the book ""Sleep Thieves,"" however, came to a slightly more nuanced conclusion. Coren found disruptions of internal daily rhythms make people less attentive and prone to ""micro sleeps,"" which can be especially dangerous during the commute following the switch to daylight saving time.

Coren studied Canadian traffic data and determined there was a greater risk of traffic accidents on the Monday after daylight saving time begins. His analysis showed there was a lower risk of traffic accidents on the Monday after reverting to standard time.

Even so, he agreed that over the long run the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has a point.

""Ultimately, it’s for the good, but in the short term, because we’re chronically sleep-deprived, it’s not so hot,"" Coren said.

Along with increasing the chances of accidents, there’s evidence that the switch to daylight saving time also presents negative effects to the human body.

An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008 stated that the stress from changing sleeping schedules during daylight saving time increases the chance of heart attacks.

Dr. Imre Janszky and Dr. Rickard Ljung, both of Stockholm, Sweden, studied more than 20 years of Swedish data on heart attacks and found the number of heart attacks increased during the first three weekdays after daylight saving time begins.

""The most plausible explanation for our findings is the adverse effect of sleep deprivation on cardiovascular health,"" the doctors said in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. ""Our data suggest that vulnerable people might benefit from avoiding sudden changes in their biologic rhythms.""

So can Keehn sleep well after saying daylight saving time poses health risks?

Keehn said the hours of sleep likely lost in the transition ""might pose a few health risks"" only in the few days after the transition. He made sure to point out the potential positives as well.

Keehn cited one study to back up his positions, and there are others that do so as well. And while there is another study that shows how over the course of a year increased daylight prevents traffic accidents, these studies do not discount the temporary health effects caused by a sudden loss of sleep, nor do they attempt to.

The blogger was precise in saying it was the loss of sleep that would cause health risks for a few days.

We find Keehn’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF51500>],/factchecks/2011/mar/28/joel-keehn/daylight-saving-health-concerns-valid/
