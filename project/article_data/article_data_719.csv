Mitt Romney says federal law requires hospitals to provide free care
","
Responding to a question about health care at a Wolfeboro, N.H., town hall, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney defended the health care law he signed in Massachusetts, saying it was partly a response to people who took advantage of a federal law that allows them to get free emergency coverage.

The former governor told the crowd he expanded health coverage in the Bay State in part so citizens could ""take personal responsibility"" for their health care.

""We found that because of federal law, federal law requires that hospitals treat people whether or not they can pay. So someone (who) doesn’t have health insurance -- they can go to the hospital and get free care. And we found a growing number of people were dropping their insurance and going to the hospital if they got real sick.""

Whether hospitals were properly compensated for treating the poor was one of the issues the Massachusetts health care law tried to address. In this case, we wondered if Romney was accurately describing the federal law and whether it truly equates with free care.

His campaign told us he was referring to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act., which Congress passed in 1986. It says any hospital that receives Medicare dollars (and nearly 90 percent of hospitals in the United States do) must ""provide a medical screening examination"" for an emergency condition ""regardless of an individual's ability to pay.""

The American College of Emergency Physicians defines an emergency as ""a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the individual's health (or the health of an unborn child) in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of bodily organs.""

If the patient’s symptoms qualify as an emergency, the law says ""hospitals are required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients.""

So what does ""stabilizing treatment for patients"" mean in practice?

Matt Fenwick with the American Hospital Association says it means ""your condition has been stabilized. (Medical providers) have done everything they can do to make sure your condition is not getting any worse.""

But there’s no guarantee a hospital will provide some level of treatment, even if a person is really sick, says George Washington University health policy professor Sara Rosenbaum.

""For example, you bring a child who is running a fever and has a sore throat. They say that’s not an emergency. If it turns out the sore throat is very fast-moving strep, which can happen with little children, your child could be dead by night.""

Rosenbaum says whether a patient actually gets treatment can be a matter of lucky timing and whether they show up at the emergency room just as the medical concern has blossomed into a true emergency.

She said that even when a person receives some care, there often is a big gap between stabilizing a patient’s condition and providing them with treatment.

Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a health analyst with  the Rand Corporation, a policy think tank, echoes that sentiment. He says a patient ""will be stabilized and if necessary hospitalized. They are not entitled to primary care, they are not entitled to preventive care, they are not entitled to followup. That is more humane then letting people die in the gutter. But it is a ridiculous way to try to manage a health care system.""

Our ruling

Romney said that federal law ""requires that hospitals treat people whether or not they can pay. So someone doesn’t have health insurance they can go to the hospital and get free care.""

Experts told us that one aspect of Romney's argument has some validity: Many people rely on emergency rooms for care when they have nowhere else to go, which is expensive and a burden on the health care system and the larger society. And hospitals sometimes provide more free care than the law requires.

But Romney is wrongly suggesting more extensive treatment is required by federal law. He implies that hospitals are required to provide more free care than is actually mandated. In fact, the law just requires stabilizing treatment in an emergency. We rate his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-federal-laws-requires-hospitals-p/

Limited studies say teen curfews ineffective
","
In a May 31 news release, just as Atlanta’s teens were embracing the warm glow of summer vacation, city officials announced plans to enforce a long-standing juvenile curfew.

The rationale was safety.

""I want everyone in the City of Atlanta, especially our young people, to enjoy the summer months,"" Mayor Kasim Reed said in the statement. ""At the same time, it is vital that we keep everyone safe.""

But Mike Males, a researcher with the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story two weeks later that the mayor’s logic is flawed.

""There’s pretty much no question that [the ordinances] aren’t effective in either reducing crime or preventing harm to young people,"" he said.

That’s a strong position to take against a very popular crime-reduction tactic.

Curfews have been around forever, imposed by moms and mayors alike. In 1884, President Benjamin Harrison called them ""the most important municipal regulation for the protection of children in American homes from the vices of the street.""

Curfews fell out of favor in the mid-20th century and did not regain popularity until the Clinton administration.

By the mid-1990s, the U.S. Conference of Mayors found 70 percent of nearly 350 cities surveyed had some sort of nighttime curfew. The overwhelming majority of cities considered the curfew effective and a good use of police time.

Atlanta’s current curfew has been on the books since 1977, although enforcement has waxed and waned. The curfew says young people 16 and under cannot be on the streets unsupervised past 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. It includes some exceptions for work, school events and emergencies, making it similar to curfews in other cities.

Violation of the curfew nets a warning on the first offense and a $1,000 fine and possible jail time on subsequent violations, but it’s the parent or guardian who gets the punishment.

So we know that curfews are popular, but is Males right when he says they don’t work?

For the answer, we turn to ... Males. It turns out, he is one of the leading researchers in the effectiveness of teen curfews and his work is cited frequently in scholarly papers and the media.

In a widely referenced 1998 paper on the impact of curfews in California, Males and co-author Dan Macallair found curfews ""had no discernible effect on youth crime"" based on a statistical analysis of cities enforcing the laws. In some cases, curfew cities actually saw crime go up compared with cities that did not enforce a curfew, they found.

Males and Macallair said crime statistics in curfew cities ""suggest that solutions are more complex and multifaceted.""

In an interview this week, Males said curfews presuppose that all young people are equally likely to commit a crime. Since they aren’t, curfews become an inefficient tool for combating youth crime, perhaps wasting police resources, he said.

Males’ research is backed up by a popular survey of studies on curfews published in 2003 by criminal justice researcher Kenneth Adams, who also found scant evidence that the laws accomplished what most people believed they did.

""Studies consistently report no change in crime in relation to curfews,"" Adams wrote, although he indicated curfews likely would remain popular.

""The seduction of common-sense reasoning sometimes is too strong to be swayed by scientific evidence,"" he wrote.

While the researchers agree that curfews do not lower juvenile crime, they also admit their conclusions rest on relatively few studies. As a result, Adams allows that curfews ""may encourage parental responsibility,"" and he wrote there is some evidence a short-term curfew focused on certain high-crime areas does reduce crime.

But a more recent stab at measuring the effectiveness of curfews comes from University of California at Berkley economist Patrick Kline.

Using an economic theory called the substitution effect, Kline says there is evidence that curfews curb youth crime.

In consumer economics, the substitution effect holds that higher prices result in lower consumer demand. With curfews, Kline said the criminal penalties for curfew-breakers results in a decline in youth crime of up to 10 percent.

Kline’s paper has been picked up across the country by curfew advocates looking for a champion, but Males said the study has significant shortcomings. For example, Kline does not compare cities that have curfews with similar cities without curfews to see whether crime is declining generally.

In fact, juvenile arrests peaked in the mid-1990s and has been declining nationally ever since, along with arrests for lots of adult crimes. Males said Kline’s assessment does not take those larger shifts into consideration.

Males also said there are some problems with applying a theory governing how milk prices get set with criminal justice.

""The problem with economic substitution theory is that not all juveniles are equally likely to commit crimes,"" he said.

Kline’s paper has gone through several revisions, and according to his website, is awaiting publication in American Law and Economics Review.

So the weight of academic opinion sides with Males’ assessment that curfews do not reduce crime. But Kline’s interpretation suggests the question deserves more research.

Males saves himself with the qualifier ""pretty much,"" but at least some still are asking questions, leaving us with a ruling of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/22/mike-males/limited-studies-say-teen-curfews-ineffective/

Official says New Jersey police, fire pension systems ""far"" from bankruptcy
","
After years of controversy about the state of New Jersey’s pension systems, some good news about the status of their solvency might be welcome.

Dominick Marino, president of the Professional Firefighters Association of New Jersey, believes he has that news for at least one pension fund.

""The firefighter and police officer pension system is not headed for bankruptcy, far from it,"" Marino said in a June 6 column posted on PolitickerNJ.com. ""That’s because New Jersey first responders -- fire fighters and police officers -- have never missed making payments to the retirement system.""

Hardly a day goes by in New Jersey without someone criticizing the supposed failing status of the state’s pension systems, so PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check Marino’s claim. We found its accuracy depends a lot on how bankruptcy is defined.

First, let’s look at how pension systems work for New Jersey police and firefighters.

New Jersey has several pension funds: a joint retirement system for police and firefighters, and one each for state police, teachers and the judiciary.  All other state employees fall under the Public Employees Retirement System.

The state and municipalities are each required to make contributions to the police and firefighter fund, but in recent years municipalities have done a better job of making their contributions. For example, as of June 30, 2010 – the most recent date that the funds were certified by accountants, the police and firefighters pension was at 71 percent funding, or $19.8 billion, said Andrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state’s Treasury Department.

Pensions ideally should be fully funded, which means the pension has 100 percent of its required funds. Roughly, half the fund is financed by employee contributions, which come automatically from payroll deductions and the other half by employers, Pratt said.

As of June 30, 2010, the teachers pension was funded at 63.9 percent or $25.9 billion; the state police pension was 73 percent funded, or $1.7 bllion; and the judiciary pension is at 59.7 percent funded, or $265 million.

Police and firefighters had been paying 8.5 percent of every paycheck toward their pensions, and that climbed to 10 percent effective July 1 with the historic pension reforms signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie.

Next, let’s define what bankruptcy means in terms of pension funding. Bankruptcy is not when a fund reaches zero, Pratt said. It’s when taxpayers can no longer afford to keep the system maintained as designed, because bankruptcy will become inevitable, he said.

For now, Pratt said the police/firefighters fund is 70.8 percent funded. Marino put the figure at 72 percent. The pension is nearly three-fourths funded, but is it enough to escape bankruptcy or to be considered dangerously underfunded?

""In the pension world, that’s a pretty good place to be, 75 to 80 percent is good,"" Marino said.

Pratt agreed – to a point.

""It is more important to say that from the standard of pension funds, 70-percent funded is an inadequate number,"" Pratt told PolitiFact New Jersey. ""The law has determined that 80 percent is the minimum level actuaries would say the fund is solvent. The target is 80 percent with good reason. It is the long-term solvency of a system that is designed to provide benefits to police officers and firefighters not just over the next two or three years, but for the rest of their lives.""

An issues brief released in April 2010, ""The Funding of State and Local Pensions: 2009-2013"" by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence in Washington, DC, looked at the causes and possible solutions to repairing the problems with the nation’s state and local government pensions, and also reviewed 126 government pension funds across the nation -- including New Jersey’s.

The level of New Jersey’s police and fire pension funding dropped from 100.8 percent in 2001 to 70.8 percent in 2009, according to the study.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office also considers 80 percent an important threshold. While it doesn’t recommend 80 percent as a level of funding adequacy, the GAO considers below 80 percent ""potentially worrisome,"" said Barbara Bovbjerg, managing director of Education, Workforce and Income Security Issues for the GAO.

Iris J. Lav, a senior adviser at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, DC said public pensions should aim to be 100 percent funded, but noted that ""in a bad economic time, having 80 percent isn’t a crisis.

""It is true that an 80 percent funding threshold is considered adequate for public pensions opposed to private pensions,"" she said. ""Cities, counties and states are ongoing institutions. Businesses can go out of business, and the money on hand that day is supposed to be enough to pay the pensions promised.""

Making changes to deal with lack of contributions and underfunding can improve the situation, according to the findings in the issue brief by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence.

New Jersey’s recent pension reforms are one example of those changes. As part of the state’s new reforms, cost-of-living adjustments have been eliminated until the fund reaches a minimum 80 percent funding level.

Pratt emphasized that New Jersey’s new pension reforms are projected to significantly bring pension funds above the 80 percent funding threshold.

""Without reform, the funds were effectively bankrupt because they didn't contain enough money to pay the future claims of retirees, and without a stock market miracle, they never would have contained enough money to pay future claims,"" Pratt said.

Let’s review.

The president of the New Jersey Professional Firefighters Association says the joint police and firefighters retirement fund is far from bankruptcy and in better shape than other funds. While the funding level of that pension is higher than others in the state, several experts state that public pensions funded below a threshold of 80 percent -- the case for the police and firefighters fund, as well as other New Jersey pensions -- could be cause for concern. Bankruptcy might not be on the immediate horizon for the police and firefighters pension fund, but it’s not an impossibility, either. We rate Marino’s claim Half True.

Latest in West-Wasserman Schultz feud: She says he lives in her district
","
Most of the she-said, he-said, back-and-forth between South Florida Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Allen West has been good for political theater but bad for fact-checkers.

If you missed it, Wasserman Schultz -- a Democrat -- criticized West -- a Republican -- this week over his support for a plan to sharply reduce federal spending and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In a speech Tuesday on the floor of the U.S. House, Wasserman Schultz said the West-backed GOP plan would raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and that it was ""unbelievable"" for West to support it because he represents so many South Florida seniors.

West responded via e-mail. ""Look Debbie ... you want a personal fight, I am happy to oblige. You are the most vile, unprofessional, and despicable member of the U.S. House of Representatives. If you have something to say to me, stop being a coward and say it to my face, otherwise, shut the heck up.""

See? Not a lot to check in either statement.

But as the debate ballooned into cable news drama Wednesday and Thursday, Wasserman Schultz provided an interview -- and a sound bite -- to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that had us scratching our heads. 
Wasserman Schultz said she is West's elected representative to the House.

""He's a constituent of mine, and so I was dutifully doing my job and representing my constituents and taking to task someone who I think is really taking the wrong position when it comes to the people we represent in South Florida who badly need that safety net and make sure that we're not going to dramatically increase their costs, which that cut, cap and balance plan does,"" she said.

Blitzer stopped for a moment. ""So you're saying he lives in your district, he doesn't live in his own district?""

""Yes,"" Wasserman Schultz continued, ""Congressman West is a constituent of the 20th Congressional District, but represents the 22nd.""

To win a seat on the city council, you have to live in that city when you take office. To win a seat in the state House, or the state Senate, you also have to live in the district you represent. The obvious question is why would it work differently for Congress?

The U.S. Constitution, that's why. The requirements for U.S. House members are spelled out in Article I, Section 2: ""No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.""

We're not sure why the framers loved all the negatives, but in other words: U.S. House members need only live in the state they represent to be eligible for their seat.

""Remember back in 1789, things weren't like they are today,"" said lawyer Mark Herron, an elections expert based in Tallahassee. ""A state was a state. It was just a reflection of the times, and they tried to keep it as simple as possible.""

In fact, the Roanoke Times recently identified a handful of House members who lived outside their districts, including Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, California Democrat John Garamendi and Georgia Democrat David Scott.

And West does, too, it turns out.

West moved to Florida with his wife, Angela, and two daughters in 2004 after retiring from the Army. The former colonel lives in a four-bedroom, two-bathroom $200,000 home in the city of Plantation, Broward County property records show.

His zip code, when punched into the U.S. House of Representatives website, and his address, when entered into the St. Petersburg Times' MyLawmaker database, both show his home falling in Florida's 20th Congressional District, represented by Wasserman Schultz.

West has owned up to this before. Amid questions over residency requirements for several South Florida lawmakers in 2008, West correctly cited federal law to the Palm Beach Post and explained, ""I'm a distance runner, and I even do my 5 to 10 miles mostly in District 22.

""The U.S. Constitution says only that a person must live in the state in which he is running for Congress,"" said West, then a challenger to former Rep. Ron Klein. ""But I'm not trying to hide where I live. Yes, I live just outside the district. Part of Plantation is in District 22 and the other part in District 20. The dividing line is University Drive and I live about a mile from there.""

""They redistrict every 10 years anyway and what are you supposed to do, move all the time?"" West said.

We won't answer that. But on the matter at hand, Wasserman Schultz is correct that she can count West as a constituent. And it's okay, according to the U.S. Constitution. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/21/debbie-wasserman-schultz/latest-west-wasserman-schultz-feud-she-says-he-liv/

Obama's mother fought for disability coverage, not treatment, according to book
","
It's an anecdote President Barack Obama told several times while discussing the need for health reform.

""I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment. And by the way, this was because the insurance company was arguing that somehow she should have known that she had cancer, when she took her new job, even though it hadn't been diagnosed yet,"" Obama said at a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, 2009.

But a biography of Obama's mother and additional reporting by the New York Times have shown that a key point of that anecdote is incorrect. Obama's mother was fighting not for treatment but for payments from a disability insurance policy. 

A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama’s Mother by journalist Janny Scott documents the life of Obama's mother, S. Ann Dunham, an anthropologist who also worked on the issues of development aid and microcredit in Indonesia.

The book documents Dunham's final illness -- uterine and ovarian cancer -- in some detail. Dunham's illness became acute when she was working in Indonesia in 1994, and she was diagnosed in Hawaii early the next year.

Scott interviewed Dunham's doctor, family and friends for the book and had access to Dunham's correspondence and personal papers. According to Scott's account, Dunham's health insurance covered her treatment.

But Dunham also filed a claim for disability insurance. It was the disability insurance company that refused to pay because they said her cancer was a pre-existing condition, according to the book.  
A Singular Woman goes into detail about Dunham's financial situation at the time she became sick. Dunham made a modest salary and sometimes struggled to pay her bills, according to the book. She was worried about the costs of her treatment, and the disability insurance would have eased her concerns. 

Dunham filed several rounds of paperwork trying to convince the insurance company to pay the disability insurance, intended as a replacement for lost wages. At one point, Dunham told the insurance company that she would be turning the matter over to ""my son and attorney, Barack Obama."" Dunham died Nov. 7, 1995. 

Scott concluded that Obama's memories of the matter were faulty. ""Though he often suggested that she was denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition, it appears from her correspondence that she was only denied disability coverage.""

The book was published in May. In July, the New York Times reported that the White House finally responded to their repeated requests about the book's findings. (Scott, the book's author, was a reporter with the New York Times who left the paper to finish the book.) The White House chose not to dispute the findings.

""We have not reviewed the letters or other material on which the author bases her account,"" a White House spokesman, Nicholas Papas, told the Times. ""The president has told this story based on his recollection of events that took place more than 15 years ago.""

Papas also said the story was still relevant. ""She first could not get a response from the insurance company, then was refused coverage. This personal history of the president's speaks powerfully to the impact of pre-existing condition limits on insurance protection from health care costs,"" he told the Times. 
But as the Times story notes, disability insurance was not at issue during the health care debate. 
Normally, we steer clear of fact-checks about politicians' families or claims that are less than timely. But Obama used the anecdote to make a case for a significant change in the law that affected the national health care system. We find Scott's reporting and the New York Times story to be compelling evidence that he got a crucial detail wrong, and the White House did not dispute that. His mother was fighting for insurance payments as she was dying, but for disability insurance, not health insurance, as her son said he remembered. So we rate his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/21/barack-obama/obamas-mother-fought-disability-coverage-not-treat/

West, a retired Army colonel and favorite of the tea party movement, sent the e-mail July 19, 2011, after Wasserman Schultz criticized him in a floor speech for supporting the GOP's ""cut, cap, and balance"" plan to sharply reduce spending and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That plan, Wasserman Schultz said, ""would increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries, unbelievable from a member from South Florida."" Political blogs and talk shows got a lot of mileage out of West's subsequent outburst, in which he asserted Wasserman Schultz was ""not a Lady."" But on July 20, West told a Fox reporter that Wasserman Schultz and other Democrats have been attacking him ""for quite some time."" ""She's not a victim,"" he said.

The party crafted a mailer to Fort Lauderdale-area voters depicting a photo of an IRS document showing the tax lien. The Democrats redacted West's address and his wife's name but left visible his Social Security number and her Employer Identification Number (an Internal Revenue Service code used to identify West's wife's employer). ""I'm not yet sure the potential damage that might come to my wife and me, and it makes me sick to think of what could happen to my daughters,"" West said in a statement. ""My entire family is at risk of identity theft."" According to POLITICO, the Democratic Party chastised West for his ""paranoia"" but said the party would pay for two years of identity theft monitoring as a result of the ""oversight."" ""After making every effort to remove all of Allen West's private information, unlike West who refuses to apologize to Florida's taxpayers for not paying his taxes and his bills, we apologize for the oversight of not redacting this information from the public record included in the mailer,"" spokesman Eric Jotkoff said in a statement. West would proceed to defeat Klein in the general election, but not before using the Democrats' blunder to raise some money. ""Recently, incumbent Ron Klein's political cronies sent out a mailer revealing my Social Security Number. ... It makes you wonder what else Klein will do to me, or to you,"" West says in his video.

"['Redistricting', 'Wisconsin', 'AFL-CIO']","
Wisconsin AFL-CIO says Republican redistricting plans cut Democrat Nancy Nusbaum out of “her state Senate district by a half a block.”
","
Redistricting is required by law every 10 years to adjust districts to account for population shifts. In Wisconsin, the past several redistrictings have been done by the courts because legislators couldn’t agree on new borders.

This year is different because, for the first time in decades, one party controls both legislative branches and the governor’s office -- Republicans.

Democrats and their supporters say the GOP maps are aimed at protecting the party and undermining Democratic chances. What’s more, they say the new maps are being rushed through the Legislature in case the Senate flips hands during the August 2011 recall elections.
 
Under the Republican maps, 11 pairs of lawmakers in the two chambers from both parties wind up in the same district and will be forced to run against each other. Several key Democratic state senators -- or candidates in the recalls -- are drawn out of their current districts.

In a blog post, the state AFL-CIO cried foul:

""These maps are so ludicrous that Nancy Nusbaum (D) and Fred Clark (D) won’t even be in their districts any more if the changes go through. They cut off Nancy’s house from her district by half a block!""

The group adds that the new districts ""are rigged so that when the people of Wisconsin reclaim their democracy in the August recall elections, Republicans will be able to sneak back into office in 2012 via GOP-favored districts.""  

There have been plenty of instances where elected officials have been forced to choose between their seat or their house. Often it’s part of a downsizing of the legislative body -- such as when a state loses a congressional district or a county board slims down.

But what about the Nusbaum part of this claim? A half a block out of the district?

Looking into it provides some insight into the redistricting process.

Nusbaum is the Democrat challenging Sen. Robert Cowles (R-Green Bay) in the Aug. 9, 2011, recall election for the 2nd District seat. If the maps, as proposed, become law, Nusbaum would be a resident of a different senate district -- the 30th. That seat is now held by Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay), who prevailed in a recall election July 19.

In short, Nusbaum could win the battle with a victory over Cowles.

But she’d lose the war by having to either move or run against Hansen.

Nusbaum lives at 1319 N. Summer Range Rd. in De Pere, a suburb of Green Bay.

The new district’s border would be Webster Ave., a thoroughfare that runs just east of Nusbaum’s home. Her house is three homes from the intersection.

""I used to be right in the middle of this district,"" Nusbaum said, who has lived in the home for 26 years.

Nusbaum, a former mayor of De Pere and former Brown County Executive, said she was well aware of the politics of redistricting. She notes that the new map splits her city into two Senate districts, something that hasn’t sat well with local leaders.

""I think it’s because of me, and I’m sorry,"" she said. ""I think its blatant the way they cut me out of this district.""

We tried to reach Republicans involved in the drawing of the new Senate districts. Attorney Jim Troupis, whose office was involved in the work, didn’t return a call. Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), said the staffers involved in the redistricting would not comment on the advice of attorneys involved.

But Wellhouse added this observation: ""How can it be her present district?  She doesn't have a district.""

Indeed, Nusbaum doesn’t hold a Senate seat, as the AFL-CIO claim suggests, or any office. She left the county executive’s job in 2003.

By law, districts must be drawn to ensure that they have roughly equal-sized populations and, based on past cases, ensure that minority groups aren’t discriminated against.

Also, the complaints about the redistricting are -- at least in Nusbaum’s part of the state --  bipartisan. Freshman Assembly Rep. André Jacque (R-Bellevue), asked GOP leaders to reconsider the map because his home was drawn into a new district, held by another freshman, Rep. John Klenke (R-Green Bay).

""The party in power has a lot of leeway,"" said Rick Esenberg, a conservative blogger, attorney and Marquette University law school professor. Esenberg  testified before a state Senate committee July 13, 2011, that he thought the maps would survive a legal challenge.

""There just is no effectively enforceable legal obligation to avoid pairings or even to do it in a way that equally impacts Democrats and Republicans,"" Esenberg said in an email, referring to the incumbents who are forced to run against each other.

A 2007 report on the process to the Wisconsin Supreme Court touched on similar points.

""Redistricting is an inherently political process, one which defines the nature of
representative government. All of the stakeholders – political parties, incumbent
legislators, civil rights coalitions, interest groups, watchdog organizations, labor unions, even individual voters – seek to draw districts in a way that helps their allies and puts their opponents at a disadvantage,"" it said, in part.

The report noted that drawing lines to favor ones own party is a process that’s more than 100 years old in Wisconsin.

After the 1890 census, ""the Democrats were in power and made the existing apportionment so as to get out of it as many Democratic districts as possible. Previous Republican legislatures had set the example. ""

So where does that leave us now?

In criticizing the GOP maps, the state AFL-CIO says Nusbaum’s home would be carved out of ""her state Senate district by half a block."" She does live there and the map would fall the way the union claims. The maps may well face a legal challenge or even ultimately be redrawn by the courts. But that’s all in the future and not part of the claim at hand.

Gov. John Kasich touts Ohio's improvement in a CNBC business survey
","
""We're No. 23"" may not sound like a stirring claim, but Gov. John Kasich has been using one version of it to lead cheers for Ohio.

""We jumped 11 spaces since beginning this year in terms of being job-friendly,"" he said in an interview July 12, 2011, with former Fox News colleague Sean Hannity, crediting the improvement to ""probably the most massive comprehensive piece of legislation passed in modern times in Ohio.""

He was referring to the recently passed state budget, which he signed into law June 30.

He cited more accomplishments and some sources of information when he repeated the claim the next day with former House colleague Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC: ""My state was dying. It is my job to get us out of this. We jumped, according to CNBC, 11 places since I've become governor as business friendly in America.""

And Kasich got a third chance to tout Ohio July 17, 2001, on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" telling host David Gregory: ""Ohio was dying, and we are beginning to really become business-friendly. ... In Ohio, because we faced our $8 billion budget deficit and provide tax relief, what's happened? CNBC says we've jumped 11 points, 11 places in terms of business-friendly.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at the claim.

The governor’s office confirmed he was talking about CNBC's annual rating of ""America's top states for business,"" which the business channel released in June.

Ohio ranked 23rd. That is, in fact, an advance of 11 spots from last year’s list, which made Ohio the most improved state (followed by Florida and Pennsylvania).

CNBC said its study used input from business groups including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Council on Competitiveness to rank states in 10 categories: cost of doing business; workforce; quality of life; economy; transportation and infrastructure; technology and innovation; education; business friendliness; access to capital, and cost of living.

Ohio's biggest improvement came in the ""cost of doing business"" category, based on tax burden, including individual income and property taxes, and business taxes, particularly as they apply to new investments. Utilities, wages and rental space were also figured.

That specific improvement was hailed by the Ohio Business Development Coalition, which said, ""Ohio improved to 5th place from 29th place last year due to a multi-year effort to reform the state's tax structure, which took full effect in 2010.""

In April, the coalition noted, a report from Ernst & Young with the Council On State Taxation ranked Ohio as having the third friendliest tax environment in the nation.

Those tax reforms came before Kasich's watch, however; they started two administrations ago, under Republican Gov. Bob Taft and a GOP-controlled legislature in 2005.

Kasich can claim some credit in the category of economy, where the study measured each state’s fiscal health by looking at projected budget gaps or surpluses for the coming fiscal year. Ohio moved up 10 spots to 24th.

We think it's fair to allow the governor some license for salesmanship, but we don't think it's splitting hairs to note that the CNBC study did not give Ohio high marks for being ""job friendly"" or ""business friendly"" as he stated.

His underlying meaning is that Ohio’s business climate has improved, and his wording is similar to the name of the study, ""America’s top states for business."" But Ohio did not fare as well in some of the study’s 10 categories as it did overall.

One category specifically graded states ""on the perceived 'friendliness' of their legal and regulatory frameworks to business."" Ohio ranked 42nd in it.

The state was dead last in the ""workforce"" category. CNBC says states were rated ""on the education level of their workforce, as well as the numbers of available workers. We also considered union membership. While organized labor contends that a union workforce is a quality workforce, that argument, more often than not, doesn’t resonate with business. We also looked at the relative success of each state’s worker training programs in placing their participants in jobs.""

CNBC's list is one of many.

Chief Executive magazine annually rates the ""best/worst states for business,"" using input on ""overall business-friendliness"" from 550 CEOs. Ohio this year ranked 41st -- improved two places from last year but down 19 places from 2006, making the state one of the biggest losers over five years (with Illinois, Washington, Maryland and Pennsylvania).

The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation ranked Ohio 46th in its state business tax rankings for 2011.

But the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, a trade group that represents small businesses and advocates for less government regulation, annually issues a rigorous ""Business Tax Index"" that pulls together 18 different tax measures to rank the states from best to worst in terms of the costs of their tax systems on entrepreneurship and small business. The index for 2011, published in April, ranked Ohio 9th.

The SBE Council also has a ""Small Business Survival Index"" that evaluates states in 36 categories including  corporate and income taxes, gas and diesel taxes, government spending, health care and energy costs, inheritance taxes, and workers compensation costs. The latest, released in December, rated Ohio 9th in the nation, up from 11th a year earlier.

So where does that leave the governor’s claim?

He was correct that Ohio jumped 11 places in a study from CNBC, although he misstated the name of the study. The state didn’t fare as well in some catagories of that study, including one that specifically looked at perceived friendliness to business.

There also are several other rankings for business climate and tax burdens out there. In some of those, Ohio has shown improvement. Others, however, still have the state low in their rankings.

And some of the tax changes that boosted the state were put in place by previous administrations.

Kasich was trying to show progress in Ohio, selling both the state and his stewardship. In his claim, he was citing only one study. On that study his statement was accurate, but these other points help clarify the picture.

Newt Gingrich says Dodd-Frank law requires 20 percent down payments
","
With the 2012 election in their sights, Republican candidates spend most of their time trying to prove that President Barack Obama and the Democrats will make the economy worse.  

Presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently used this tactic in discussing housing and the new law to regulate the financial industry known as the Dodd-Frank Act. In a June 13, 2011, appearance in Concord, N.H., Gingrich said that Dodd-Frank ""establishes a mandatory 20 percent down payment to buy a house. So at a time when housing prices have dropped worse than the Great Depression, we’re now going to have a law that guarantees there’s no housing market for a generation?"" Gingrich said this was just one of many reasons to scrap Dodd-Frank entirely.

Not too long ago, a 10 percent down payment was generally the industry standard.  So we thought it would be important to know if Dodd-Frank in fact ""establishes a mandatory 20 percent down payment.""  

Some quick background on the Dodd-Frank Act., which is named after Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut who retired last year, and Rep. Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts. It changes many of the rules the financial sector must live by, from credit cards to derivatives trading. One of its targets is a practice that lies at the heart of the sub-prime mortgage disaster.  

When a bank gives someone a loan to buy a house, it almost never holds the loan. Instead, it bundles it with other mortgages and sells it to another financial institution or group of investors.  Before the meltdown, banks could sell the entire mortgage. If the loan went bad, the new owner of the mortgage was on the hook.

Selling the loan allowed banks to make bad loans and not suffer the consequences. Dodd-Frank tries to put an end to that by saying that banks, and other kinds of lenders, must hold on to at least 5 percent of the value of the mortgage so they are ""keeping some skin in the game.""

But the new law gave regulators the option to cut lenders some slack so they could sell 100 percent of certain mortgages if they were less risky.  That provision is the source of Gingrich’s statement about a mandatory 20 percent down payment. But we find he is not characterizing the law accurately.  

We went to the law (page 519 is where you’ll find the topic addressed) and found nothing about a requirement for a 20 percent down payment.

Asked to back up the claim, the Gingrich campaign cited this item in the Housing Wire, a news service for the mortgage market.  The June 22 article describes a bipartisan furor over a proposed rule from housing and finance agencies to implement Dodd-Frank.  The regulators did say the safest loans were those where the borrower put down 20 percent, and they proposed waiving the 5 percent requirement only for such highly rated mortgages.

But that was just a proposal -- and an unpopular one. Groups from the Mortgage Bankers Association to the National Association of Colored People to the Independent Community Bankers of America registered strong objections. The president of the National Association of Realtors, Ron Phipps, said ""as written, the proposed rule violates congressional intent, makes homeownership more expensive for millions of responsible consumers and jeopardizes the fragile housing recovery.""

Lawmakers also weighed in against the proposal, with 44 senators and 282 House members of both parties signing letters opposing it. The authors of the law said the proposal was not consistent with their intent for the legislation.  

An expert on the real estate industry told us Gingrich was wrong.

""It's totally incorrect to say that Dodd-Frank came up with the 20 percent down payment standard,"" said Ken Harney, a real estate columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. ""It just could not be further from the truth.  So whoever says that is just misinformed.""

Harney notes that after the firestorm of protest, regulators extended the comment period for rule making.  Harney’s assessment?  This is ""a proposal that I think has no chance of becoming reality.""

Two final points.  By June 22, Gingrich himself had backed off, acknowledging that the 20 percent rule was just a proposal.  And even the proposed rule would not make a large down payment mandatory.   
Our ruling:

Gingrich is not correct that the law mandates a 20 percent down payment. There is no such requirement. The only element of the law that even comes close to that is a provision that requires banks to hold on to 5 percent of the value of their mortgages so they will retain a stake in mortgages. There's also been a proposal by regulators to waive that requirement for highly rated mortgages, which would include those with a 20 percent down payment.  But that proposal has stalled and that's a long way from what Gingrich said, that 20 percent down payments are required.

"['Retirement', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Gov. McDonnell says Virginia state employees ""pay nothing"" toward their pensions
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell recently proclaimed Virginia’s retirement system needs change.

""We’re one of only four states in the country that the state employees pay nothing (toward their pension),"" McDonnell said in a July 13 interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box. ""We pay the employee and employer share.""

So state employees don’t contribute a dime to their own retirement?

A couple of our readers who saw the TV interview told us McDonnell’s is wrong. So we decided to look into the governor’s statement. 
The CNBC interview began with McDonnell -- widely mentioned as vice-presidential prospect for next year's Republication national ticket -- accepting praise for Virginia's sound financial condition. When asked about the state's pension, McDonnell acknowledged it has $18 billion in unfunded liabilities and blamed part of the problem on the General Assembly's reluctance to ask state employees to kick in money. 
Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said McDonnell’s claim was based on an October 14, 2008, report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that said Virginia was among five states that did not require its employees to make pension contributions.

Caldwell said the other four were Tennessee, Florida, Utah and Missouri. But he said Virginia is now one of four states without employee contributions because Missouri, as of January 1, 2011, began requiring new hires to contribute 4 percent to their plans.

There are major  problems with the governor’s claim, however.

State employees hired before July 1, 2010, recently began contributing 5 percent of their salary to their pension plans under a change that went into effect June 25, 2011 -- 18 days before McDonnell’s interview on CNBC. The new policy is contained in a well-publicized budget provision approved by the General Assembly earlier this year that gave state employees a 5 percent raise and simultaneously required them to contribute 5 percent of their salary to their pensions.

The governor was hardly a stranger to this development. He urged legislators to require state employees to pay into the pension fund during his State of the Commonwealth Address on Jan. 12. McDonnell signed a budget containing such a provision -- although more lenient than what he wanted -- on May 2.

The change reversed a deal made in 1983 when Virginia agreed to pay for its employees’ pension contributions instead of giving them a raise that year.

This year’s pension contribution deal only affected longer-serving workers. Newer workers, hired on or after July 1, 2010, had already been required to contribute 5 percent toward their pensions from the day they began work. That provision is part of a bill McDonnell signed on April 13, 2010.

McDonnell made his statement on CNBC four days after the pay period ended in which longer-serving state workers made their first contributions to pensions. New state employees had contributed for as long as a year, depending on their start dates.

Caldwell said Virginia is still paying the pension contribution for longer-serving workers, because the state gave employees the 5 percent raise in return for a 5 percent pension contribution.

""There was a requirement to pay in, but then the state paid employees to offset that,"" he said.

Caldwell offered no explanation how the governor’s statement could be true in light of the fact that newer employees have been paying into the system for as long as a year.

Those newer employees are not eligible for the 5 percent pay hike provided to longer-serving workers, according to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management’s website. The  newer employees received no salary boost to offset their pension contribution.

About 6,000 new state employees have been hired and started paying into their pensions during the past year, said Jeanne Chenault, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Retirement System. Another 84,000 veteran workers were affected by the 5 percent raise/pension contribution.

Ron Jordan, executive director of the Virginia Government Employees Association, said even with the raise, a burden for paying pension contributions has been placed on the backs of veteran workers. Next time there’s a raise, workers will pay the 5 percent contribution on a higher salary, Jordan said, meaning they will ultimately pay more towards their pension than what’s covered by the 5 percent raise given to them this year.

Jordan also took issue with the contention that veteran state workers’ immediate loss from the pension contribution was entirely covered by the 5 percent raise. He pointed to a document on the Department of Human Resource Management website saying some employees could see a drop in their take home pay after the pension contribution and raise go into effect.

Let’s review.

McDonnell, in a CNBC interview, said state workers pay nothing toward their pension and that Virginia makes the contribution for them. That was the case for several decades, but it is no longer true.

For more than a year, new state employees -- those hired on or after July 1, 2010 -- have been required to make pension contributions from the day they reported to work. About 6,000 new state workers now fall under the legislation.

Longer-serving bureaucrats also are being required to ante up. McDonnell’s interview on CNBC came 18 days after after well-publicized provisions went into effect requiring longer-serving state employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to Virginia’s pension.

The governor’s spokesman correctly points out that longer-serving employees were given a 5 percent raise to offset their pension contribution. Nonetheless, veteran state employees are now chipping in for their pensions and any future raises they receive will also increase their payments into the retirement fund.

The governor, in his interview, said Virginia is one of four states that foot the entire bill for pension contributions. But McDonnell removed a fifth state that had been on the list -- Missouri -- because at the start of this year, Missouri began requiring new hires to pay in.

So Virginia shouldn’t be on that list either. McDonnell’s claim goes beyond inaccurate and enters the realm of the absurd. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/jul/21/bob-mcdonnell/gov-mcdonnell-says-virginia-state-employees-pay-no/
"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Richard Codey']","
New Jersey Sen. Richard Codey claims “every president has raised the debt ceiling” during Fox News interview
","
As President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans wrestle over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, New Jersey Sen. Richard Codey (D-Essex) added his voice to the debate during a recent panel discussion on Fox News’ Hannity.

Sitting between a conservative writer and a former Miss America, Codey joined the ""The Great American Panel"" on July 13 and soon found himself sparring with host Sean Hannity. Hannity began the conversation by criticizing President Barack Obama for using ""seniors as a pawn in this...political chess game of his.""

But Codey, a former governor, told Hannity that Obama isn’t the first president to increase the federal debt limit.

""But Sean, every president has raised the debt ceiling,"" Codey said. ""George Bush did it seven times.""

PolitiFact New Jersey took a look at the nation’s history of borrowing money and discovered that Codey was mostly right. Since an overall limit on most federal debt was first set up in 1939, the debt ceiling went up during every presidency with the sole exception of former President Harry S. Truman’s.

Codey acknowledged the minor oversight in a phone interview and said his overall message was to show that previous presidents have contributed to the debt ceiling increases.

Now, let’s take a look at how we reached the current federal debt limit of nearly $14.3 trillion.

A statutory limit on federal borrowing was first established with the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which helped finance the nation’s entry into World War I, according to the Congressional Research Service. That act allowed separate limits for different forms of debt.

In 1939, Congress eliminated those separate limits and set up the first aggregate limit covering nearly all public debt. During the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the debt ceiling was raised annually between 1941 and 1945 to pay for the costs associated with World War II. The limit was increased to $65 billion in 1941.

Soon after the debt limit was increased to $300 billion in April 1945, Truman became president. The debt ceiling was reduced to $275 billion in June 1946, and the Korean War was primarily financed by higher taxes, not increased debt.

The debt ceiling would not increase until 1954, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president.

""It just went down and stayed down,"" said Bill Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, referring to Truman’s presidency.

But from Eisenhower to former President George W. Bush, the debt ceiling was raised during every presidency for a total of 68 times*, according to data from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Obama has raised the debt limit three times.

Here’s a breakdown of debt ceiling increases before Obama by presidency:

￭ Dwight D. Eisenhower (R): 4
￭ John F. Kennedy (D): 5
￭ Lyndon B. Johnson (D): 7
￭ Richard M. Nixon (R): 7
￭ Gerald R. Ford (R): 6
￭ Jimmy Carter (D): 6
￭ Ronald Reagan (R): 17
￭ George H. W. Bush (R): 5
￭ Bill Clinton (D): 4
￭ George W. Bush (R): 7

When Eisenhower left office, the debt limit was $293 billion. After Bush left office -- following seven increases to the debt ceiling, as Codey had said -- the limit was about $11.3 trillion. Barring significant changes to federal regulations, the amount of debt is projected to rise in the coming decade, according to the Congressional Research Service.

""Unless federal policies change, Congress would repeatedly face demands to raise the debt limit to accommodate the growing federal debt in order to provide the government with the means to meet its financial obligations,"" according to a July 1 report from the Congressional Research Service.

Asked why the debt limit has continued to increase over the past several decades, D. Andrew Austin, one of the authors of that report, said in an email: ""Over time (the) federal government has spent more than it received in revenues. Unlike (the European Union’s) Stability and Growth Pact, the debt limit is a fixed number, rather than a restriction tied to the size of the national economy.""

Back to Codey’s statement:

The former governor said during a panel discussion that ""every president has raised the debt ceiling."" Federal records show that since the overall limit was set up in 1939, Truman is the only president who didn’t have an increase in the debt ceiling on his watch.

We rate Codey’s statement Mostly True.

*Editor's Note: The total of 68 times failed to include all cases where the debt limit was temporarily increased or the expiration dates for temporary increases were extended. Factoring in those other instances, the debt ceiling was increased 86 times between the presidencies of Eisenhower and George W. Bush. Here is the revised breakdown: Eisenhower, 7; Kennedy, 8; Johnson, 8; Nixon, 9; Ford, 7; Carter, 9; Reagan, 18; George H.W. Bush, 9;  Clinton, 4; and George W.

Watchdog group critical of stimulus spending publishes a report listing purported projects in Rhode Island
","When the Ocean State Policy Research Institute (OSPRI) published The 2011 Rhode Island Piglet Book last month -- ostensibly a report on government spending in our state -- we jumped at the opportunity to examine one of the ""300 pork projects, bungled boondoggles, bad ideas and examples of abuse of power"" the group targeted.

We found that the authors erred in saying that the state prisons used $250,000 in federal stimulus funds to convert from analog to digital TV. In fact, no stimulus money was used, so we ruled the claim False.

That first look got us wondering about the 50 other projects that the Piglet Book highlighted as having benefited from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, more commonly known as the stimulus program. Did they actually get funded?

What we found raises serious questions about the quality of the Research Institute’s research.

For example, the report indicates the state spent $20 million from the stimulus program on ""renovations for legislative office space"" at 2 Capitol Hill, the building across Smith Street from the State House.

But when we contacted Larry Berman, spokesman for the House of Representatives, he said, ""The General Assembly has not done any improvements to any lawmaker offices."" And Laurie Petrone, who oversees stimulus spending for state agencies as the director of  the state Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment, said no stimulus money was used to improve the building.

What about another project with a hefty price tag -- $30 million to ""install modern cyberinfrastructure"" at Brown University?

The university did not receive that grant, said Mark Nickel, director of news and communications at Brown.

How about the Town of Smithfield? Did it receive ""an overpriced overhaul courtesy of the American taxpayer... $4,565,000 in stimulus funds to revamp and add on to the hockey and ice skating facility?""

Randy Rossi, Smithfield’s finance director, did undertake some improvements at the hockey rink. But Rossi, who was aware of the Piglet Book claim, said the town received no stimulus funds for the work.

In fact, we found that many of the stimulus projects OSPRI lambasted were never funded:

* $700,000 to plant 1,600 trees in Providence? ""The city did not receive any stimulus funds,"" said spokesman David Ortiz.

* $640,000 for new facilities at Goddard State Park, Colt State Park and the George Washington Management Area? ""Didn’t get funded,"" said Petrone.

* $300,000 for parking lot improvements on Capitol Hill?  ""No ARRA funds for that,"" Petrone said.

* $3 million for improvements at Charlestown’s Cross Mills Village, $50,000 to take aerial photographs of the town and $45,000 to repair a sheep barn at the town’s South Farm Preserve?  ""We haven’t received any money at all,"" said Town Treasurer Patricia Anderson. For the work that the town did undertake (the photography, for example, was never done),  ""we used our own money.""

The problem, as we first found in our report on digital TV at the prisons, is that OSPRI relied on documents listing requests for stimulus money, not approvals. One document that OSPRI shared with us when we questioned the prison TV project was clearly titled in red type: ""submitted requests under review.""

Petrone said the state compiled stimulus requests even before federal agencies wrote guidelines for the  program.

""We published every project that anyone had suggested for stimulus money. It was like the wish list,"" she said.

Some wishes came true.

Among the projects the Piglet Book listed under ""stimulus shenanigans"" were two at the University of Rhode Island. Spokesman David Lavallee directed us to documents confirming that the National Science Foundation gave $446,247 to URI for a six-week cruise to study the marine environment in the Arctic Ocean and $42,994 for an archaeological expedition to Iceland to excavate textile remains and study the role of women in early Norse culture.

We won’t get into whether either was worthwhile. Our mission is to examine the accuracy of the Piglet Book’s stimulus claims, not to judge whether the money was well spent.

A project at Rhode Island College also received SOME stimulus funding, but far less than the Piglet Book claimed.

Under a section titled ""frittering funds for fun,"" the OSPRI report said RIC received $12 million to renovate its recreation center. But spokeswoman Jane Fusco said that only $1 million came from the stimulus program, part of a $9.9-million grant to RIC to be used exclusively for fire-safety upgrades.

We checked on 20 of the 50 projects listed in the report. In most cases, we tried to contact purported recipients, but we also visited recovery.org -- since renamed recovery.gov -- a federal repository of stimulus information and projects.

Of the 20,  we could verify only five that received stimulus money as described in the Piglet Book -- the two at URI and three highway projects overseen by the state Department of Transportation. The DOT jobs totaled $11 million and involved replacing some signs along the state’s major highways.

Of the remaining 15 we checked, 13 of the purported recipients said they received no stimulus money whatsoever.

That leaves two others. We already noted that RIC received a fraction of what OSPRI reported. In addition, Roger Williams University said it didn’t get the $8.2 million that OSPRI claimed it was awarded to expand its shellfish research center. The project cost about half that and was largely funded through other sources, said director Timothy Scott. A small amount of stimulus funds may have been used, but it’s possible none were, he said.

The final tally: the Piglet Book was wrong on 15 of the 20 projects we checked.

When we told OSPRI what we found, the organization acknowledged its error, but downplayed it.

""The primary purpose of our Piglet report is to highlight the culture of out-of-control government spending that inevitably leads to waste, special-interest peddling and cronyism . . . ,"" it said in a statement.

""While OSPRI recognizes that our report inadvertently did not properly distinguish between requested federal stimulus projects and completed projects, it does not lessen concern about the tax-and-spend mindset that encourages or would even consider some of these unconscionable requests . . . ""OSPRI plans to submit an official record request to some of the entities in question and will publish an updated listing of the status of these projects on our website once the information has been gathered.""

In applying the Truth-O-Meter, we took into consideration that OSPRI said it made a mistake.

But that’s not going to save their bacon here. OSPRI is clearly on a mission to ridicule government spending. You can’t miss the recurring inflammatory language in the report anymore than the message conveyed by its cover -- a cartoon of a large pig playing a violin and wearing a coat that says ""R.I. Gov’t"" as a background map of the state goes up in flames.

OSPRI wants its 37-page report, with 411 footnotes, to be taken seriously. Yet the section that we examined, stimulus funding -- a controversial program whose merits should be debated based on facts -- is egregiously flawed.

The group says it wants to highlight ""out of control government spending,"" but most of the stimulus spending it cites never happened.

Because OSPRI got so much so wrong, we’re thrusting a spit through the Piglet Book’s stimulus section and roasting it. This little piggy is going ""Wee! Wee! Wee!"" all the way to a Pants on Fire!

"['Oregon', 'Bruce Hanna']","
Did tied Oregon House consider and approve as many measures as previous Legislatures?
","
The 76th Oregon Legislature adjourned on June 30, 2011, the first legislative session in which the Oregon House had been split 30-30 between Democrats and Republicans. Co-speakers Arnie Roblan, D-Coos Bay, and Bruce Hanna, R-Roseburg, appeared the next morning on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s ""Think Out Loud"" to talk about their accomplishments.

Host Dave Miller asked Hanna to address a concern raised by labor coalition Our Oregon: that the divided House let die a number of Senate approved bills because both committee co-chairs had to agree to move legislation forward.  What, asked Miller, could be done to get more bills, especially noncontroversial bills, to the House floor for an up-or-down vote?

Hanna objected to the claim that the tie in the House meant more bills were blocked. Plenty of measures, he said, left the House never to be taken up by the Senate, controlled 16-14 by Democrats.

But Hanna also said this: ""When you talk about the total number of bills that came through the House, we processed and dealt with and passed as many bills as any Legislature ever has.""

True? Did the 2011 Legislature keep pace with its predecessors?

For this, PolitiFact Oregon turned to Legislative Counsel, the nonpartisan office of lawyers responsible for turning legislators’ ideas into bills that may become law. The office has tracked the number of bills introduced by legislators and enrolled, which means approved by both the Senate and the House, since 1997. Here is the summary: 
  
You can see that the percentage of approved measures dropped this year to 27 percent, from 35 percent in 2009, when Democrats controlled both chambers. In fact, it’s the lowest clearance rate in the last decade, although not entirely out of line. The approval rate was 29 percent in 2005, when Democrats led the Senate and Republicans the House.  

More significantly, the number of bills approved -- 807 -- is the lowest in a decade.

Maybe a lot of the legislation that cleared previously was nonsense. Maybe all 807 bills that passed this session were good and meaty. Still, Hanna is not correct. The House and the Legislature passed fewer bills this session than in previous sessions. There’s no quibbling with those figures.

Angela Wilhelms, Hanna’s chief of staff, said her boss was trying to make the point that ""co-governance did not lead to inaction or gridlock as many predicted it would."" She’s right about that, as she also is correct to say that the Senate and tied House moved fairly heavy-hitting bills on redistricting, education reform, a remake of the Oregon Health Plan and a state budget.

Donald Trump did not congratulate Navy SEALs on Haiti assassination
","Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in his home on July 7. While the search for the suspects continues, an Instagram post claimed that former President Donald Trump congratulated the Navy seals for a ""perfect beautiful whack."" An Instagram post from July 7, 2021, included a headline it claimed was from the New York Times that said, ""In a now deleted Telegram post, Former President Donald Trump congratulated the Navy SEALs on a ‘perfect beautiful whack.’"" The post also claimed, ""President Biden fears the assassination spells the end of America’s centuries old policy of allowing the Haitian people to exercise absolute self-determination."" We decided to fact-check this claim. Moïse was killed in his home by multiple gunmen. Moïse’s wife Martine was shot and injured. The gunmen identified themselves as agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, before entering the property, Haitian ambassador to the U.S. Bocchit Edmond told Reuters. In a July 7 State Department briefing, spokesperson Ned Price condemned the allegations that the assasination was carried out by DEA agents. ""These reports are absolutely false. The United States condemns this heinous act,"" Price said at the briefing. ""These false reports are nothing more than that, just false reports."" Moïse was the source of much controversy in Haiti during his presidency. In recent months, protesters demanded Moïse’s resignation after disputes about when his term was set to expire. Moïse insisted that his term would end on Feb. 7, 2022, because of delays in his swearing in, while opponents pushed for his ousting. Moïse had ruled by decree since 2020 after the country failed to hold parliamentary elections.In February, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeffrey DeLaurentis emphasized ""the need to bring the current period of rule by decree to a swift conclusion."" International politics notwithstanding, there is no evidence that Trump sent out a Telegram post about the events in Haiti. President Trump has no history of using Telegram to relay messages to the public. We asked his office for a comment but have yet to receive a response. There is concern that the assassination can lead to instability in Haiti, but the headline highlighting Biden’s concern for Haiti’s self-determination was not published by the New York Times. The Instagram post was apparently doctored: When reached for comment, the New York Times said that it did not write or publish either of the headlines in the screenshot.  The suspected gunmen may have identified themselves as agents from the DEA, but there is no evidence that Navy SEALs killed Moïse. A spokesperson from the Navy said, ""Regarding the Navy SEALs, these claims are false. They are wholly fabricated without any basis in fact."" In a statement, President Joe Biden condemned the assassination, and said, ""The United States offers condolences to the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti."" An Instagram post claimed that former President Trump congratulated Navy SEALs on their ""perfect beautiful whack"" of the Haitian president.  There is no evidence that Trump said any such thing. There’s also no evidence that Navy SEALs had any role in Moïse’s death, and the post making the claim used doctored headlines.

Joe Biden’s boast on early job gains neglects timing, pandemic context
","When the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the United States had gained 850,000 jobs in June, President Joe Biden took to a podium in the White House complex to tout the achievement. ""Good morning, everyone — it is a good morning!"" Biden said July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today’s job news brought us something else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs."" Biden went on to say, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team."" Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do? Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed over some important context. The official government data shows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million. In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.) The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs.   Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context. Raw numbers vs. percentages. By choosing to highlight jobs gained as his metric, Biden has an advantage in a comparison with previous presidents. The U.S. population has grown, and so has the labor force. A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he’s not No. 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden’s 2.1%.   Comparison to the pre-pandemic level. The U.S. economy is still almost 6.8 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak — 145.8 million jobs in June 2021, compared with 152.5 million jobs in February 2020.    Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting aside subsequent increases in population).  Given the severity of the pandemic recession, that would be a significant bounceback — but it hasn’t happened yet.  The question of timing. Biden entered office during a recession (and a global pandemic), but while the economy was on the upswing. Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first few months go, so Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. Who gets the credit? Experts always caution that a president is not all-powerful in economic matters, since many factors beyond their control, from international oil supplies to changes in technology and demographics, can shape the health of the U.S. economy. That said, experts say that Biden does deserve some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Biden said, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history."" Biden is right on the numbers and on how they compare with his recent predecessors in the Oval Office. However, this talking point glosses over the reality that the U.S. economy remains almost 6.8 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, comparing presidents as Biden did is highly sensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration; Biden entered office during a deep recession, but he took over on the upswing, a situation that not all presidents have benefited from.

GOP tweet misfires in linking crime trends to Democratic policies
","Republicans see a winning issue in linking crime to Democratic policies. When homicides spiked in the second half of 2020, President Donald Trump wielded it as a campaign issue, saying Republicans would restore order to crime-ridden Democratic-led cities. He lost his race, but the GOP attacks continue. In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats. ""Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,"" Republicans tweeted June 29. Crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies. We asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase in fentanyl seizures at the border, high-speed chases in South Texas, and FBI director Christopher Wray talking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border.  The RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies. Homicides increased in 2020. It’s possible that the toll could have topped 19,000 last year.  But the RNC tweet is not narrowly about rising homicides. It encompasses several other claims that are flawed: ""Open-border policies"": The articles the RNC cited said nothing linking activity at the border to a spike in the national incidence of murders or other crimes. We found no independent research that argued that point. Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining. ""And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,"" Cassell said. ""So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious."" Historic highs: The RNC tweet talked about crime reaching levels not seen in decades. Not only do they lack the data to confirm that, but based on the FBI’s latest available data for homicides and other preliminary data, the U.S. is not on pace to reach the heights seen in the mid-1990s.  ""Defund the police"": The RNC tweet suggested that ""defund the police"" is a core Democratic policy. It is not. A handful of Democrats have spoken out for it, but during the 2020 campaign, candidate Joe Biden rejected the movement. And his 2022 budget requested an increase of $304 million for police to build ties within the communities they patrol. Some Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the 50 largest cities, police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021. The RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it’s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month. One problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn’t published the 2020 edition yet.  Other data sets lack the scope of the FBI’s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up. A preliminary FBI crime report for 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. The Major Cities Chiefs Association found a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report from Council on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter. The topline numbers don’t tell the whole story, however. For example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally — including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC’s broad-brush claim about escalating crime. The Council on Criminal Justice’s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 — from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021. That could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report’s authors say other unknown factors could be at work. The RNC’s claim that rising crime was a ""direct result"" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime. ""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. ""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves."" Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the economic downturn also mattered. ""Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,"" Ahlin said. ""Last year we saw both at play.""  On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd. Cassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence. ""Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,"" Cassell said. Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy ""dubious.""  Even the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the ""homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country."" Looking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn’t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn’t begin until late May. The Republican National Committee tweeted that ""crime is escalating to a level we haven’t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats’ defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies."" It’s not true that crime is rising to a level we haven’t seen in decades.  Homicides are up, but there’s no evidence that the trend is tied to a police defunding policy or Democrats’ border policies, let alone that it’s a ""direct result."" Experts say many other factors may have played a role, including racial-justice protests and disruptions caused by the pandemic.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/09/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-tweet-misfires-linking-crime-trends-democratic/

News outlets didn’t ignore a six-time Olympic medalist due to her stance on gun rights
","With the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games around the corner, an old claim has resurfaced online about Kim Rhode, a six-time Olympic medalist in the sport of shooting.

After her bronze medal win in 2016, Rhode became the first woman and first summer Olympian to medal in six consecutive Olympics. She didn’t qualify for the 2020 games. But it’s inaccurate to say that news organizations ignored Rhode’s success. Stories about the feat were published by multiple news organizations at the time, including CBS Sports, the Daily Mail, The Guardian, NBC, the New York Times, Reuters, SB Nation and USA Today. Outlets have also reported about her accomplishments and support of gun rights. It’s true that, in the past, Rhode hasn’t received sponsorships outside of the firearms industry and a hunters’ conservation group. But that appears to have more to do with shooting’s lack of fanfare compared to other Olympic sports, making it unattractive to big-name sponsors.  Shooters, including Rhode, have also suggested that the rise of gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S. has attached a stigma to the sport, and contributes to its sponsorship problems. ""When you look at the gun debate and the Olympics, there definitely is that stigmatism that’s attached to our sport due to all the negative publicity that guns get,"" Rhode told the Daily Signal in 2016. A Facebook post claims that Rhode was ignored by news organizations and sponsors because she’s an outspoken supporter of the Second Amendment. There is no evidence to support this. Several prominent news outlets have reported about Rhode’s Olympic accomplishments, as well as her support of gun rights. The sport of shooting often receives less big-name sponsors due to its lack of fanfare, and isn’t about Rhode specifically.

Tucker Carlson distorts Texas' smart thermostat energy conservation programs
","Summertime temperatures rose into the high 90s last month across Texas. It wasn’t an unusual heat for Texas in mid-June, but it did trigger the state’s grid operator to issue energy conservation alerts.  The alerts issued by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas asked residents to set their thermostats at 78 degrees in order to help maintain grid reliability. For some Texans, that adjustment was made automatically by their WiFi-enabled thermostats.  Weeks later, Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired a segment on his show focusing on those thermostats.   ""In Texas, the power companies have automatically raised the temperature of people's thermostats in the middle of a heatwave without their permission,"" he said. ""Woo. That's not creepy or anything.""  Carlson was referring to an energy conservation technique called demand response, in which electric utilities or third-party grid monitors will remotely adjust residents’ thermostats to reduce energy demand during periods of tight supply. It’s a practice that has been in Texas, and around the nation, for at least two decades. Initially, older thermostats were remotely controlled using a radio paging technology. Today, companies can tap into smart thermostats — like those manufactured by Google Nest, Ecobee or Honeywell — over the internet.   But are these adjustments being made without people’s permission, as Carlson claims?  There are several electric companies across Texas that offer demand response programs to customers. CPS Energy in San Antonio has had its program in place since 2003, and today the utility issues $85 reimbursements to customers who enroll in its WiFi Thermostat Rewards program.   ""During summer peak energy demand days, we may briefly adjust your thermostat settings by a few degrees,"" the program states. ""We’ll do this only as needed. Peak energy demand days are typically weekdays during the hot summer months. You can opt-out of participating in a peak demand event by manually adjusting your thermostat or through your thermostat’s app.""  Of the San Antonio utility’s 885,000 customers, about 150,000 are enrolled the program. During a period of tight energy supply, the company can adjust 150,000 thermostats to save 128 megawatts of power.  ""That's the size of some smaller power plants,"" said Justin Chamberlain, CPS Energy’s manager of energy efficiency and demand response. ""It can make a big difference on a peak day.""   The utility also does a fair amount of work to spread awareness ahead of when these periods are going to occur. They’ll send notifications to people's phones and thermostats, they’ll publish social media posts and make announcements on local news stations.   Austin Energy’s Power Partner program also offers rebates to customers who enroll under the condition that the utility can raise the temperature of their homes between 2 and 4 degrees for a three hour period during the summer months. Overriding automatic changes only requires a customer to adjust their thermostat back to their desired temperature.   The program has been in place since 2013. Of the utility’s 478,000 residential customers, about 33,000 households have enrolled.   ""Austin Energy does not and cannot remotely control devices that are not enrolled in the program,"" a utility spokesperson said.  But not all local utilities offer such programs. Customers who are hooked up to utilities that don’t can instead turn to programs offered by third-party providers of demand response management systems.   One popular provider is EnergyHub, which offers a program called Smart Savers Texas that customers sign up for through their thermostat manufacturer.   Under this program, customers are entered into a sweepstakes every time they undergo a demand response event for the chance to win $5,000 towards their energy bills. In exchange, customers agree to allow EnergyHub to trigger temperature adjustments (up to 4 degrees) during demand response periods two to 10 times per summer.   ""It's a really important time to have resources like this, because these really unique weather events require that the grid have some resources it can call on at peak in order to reduce demand,"" said Erika Diamond, vice president of customer solutions at EnergyHub.  The program also allows customers to opt-out of any single demand response event or from the program altogether via the thermostat menu or its associated app.  So if these types of programs require customers to opt-into these agreements, what is Carlson basing his claim on that these adjustments are occurring without people’s permission?  Carlson’s segment featured a conversation with Chuck DeVore, vice president of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. In the segment, DeVore criticized these programs for enticing customers with rebates or other incentives.  In an interview, DeVore said that while people are typically granting permission to power companies, they might not be fully aware of what they’re agreeing to.   ""You do have to sign up for it with the providers — you have to give them permission to do it,"" DeVore said. ""It's just that most people in today's day and age don't really spend a lot of time reading the small print."" He pointed to an example out of Galveston, in which a woman who was enrolled in the program was surprised by the automatic thermostat adjustments last month.  ""Not everyone's going to really know what they were signing up for,"" he said.  A spokesperson for Carlson’s show also pointed to a KHOU TV article in which one Houston family ""woke up sweating"" during the mid-June heat. Their thermostat, which was enrolled in EnergyHub’s program, had been unexpectedly kicked up to 78 degrees.   According to KHOU-TV, the thermostat had been installed in the family’s home as part of a new home security package. EnergyHub has partnerships with several home security dealers that include smart thermostats in their installment packages, Diamond said. But it's unclear why this family didn't know their device was enrolled in their program.  All of EnergyHub's customers are enrolled into the program via a sign-up process that is offered on the thermostat's app or the home security app.  ""They are asked, 'Do you want to join? Here are the terms and conditions,'"" Diamond said. ""It lets them know that they are legally signing a document telling them what the offer is, and then they complete that process digitally, and they get an email that says you've applied to this program. And then they get an email letting them know they've either been accepted or rejected."" Carlson said last month that power companies are automatically raising the temperature of people’s thermostats ""without their permission.""  Various demand response programs exist around the state, and thousands of customers have enrolled in them. Although social media posts and local news stations show that some people weren’t fully aware of the terms of the agreement, they had nonetheless granted permission.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/09/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-distorts-texas-smart-thermostat-con/

Fact-checking Kayleigh McEnany’s claim that ‘all of our main Founding Fathers were against slavery’
","Fox News host and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused others of ""getting the facts wrong"" about the Founding Fathers and slavery — all while getting some facts wrong herself.   ""The haters never take a day off from hating. That is clear. And they never take a day off from getting the facts wrong,"" McEnany said on ""Outnumbered"" July 6. ""We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers were against slavery, recognized the evils of it.""  Five historians who spoke with PolitiFact agreed that McEnany’s claim was an inaccurate oversimplification.  ""I think the most charitable thing you could say about her statement is that it reflects an utter ignorance of American history,"" said Paul Finkelman, the president of Gratz College in greater Philadelphia, who has written several books on American slavery. Some of the most celebrated Founders were more tolerant of slavery than McEnany claimed, and the majority of the signers of the Declaration of Independence owned enslaved people. ""The Father of the country, the Father of the Declaration, and the Father of the Constitution all remained lifelong enslavers,"" said Lorri Glover, a professor of history at Saint Louis University, in reference to Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.  This undated engraving shows the scene on July 4, 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was approved. (AP) The term ""Founding Fathers"" is typically used to refer to the revolutionary leaders who united the colonies, led the American effort for independence and structured the U.S. government.  Most discussions include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. ""After these big six, the list gets complicated,"" Glover said. There were leaders who supported the revolution and fought in the war, those who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and those who backed the Constitution in 1787. The historians PolitiFact consulted listed dozens of figures who could qualify as Founders. ""It's an ever-shifting group,"" said Todd Estes, professor of history at Oakland University.  A list of enslaved people at Mount Vernon written by George Washington around 1799 is seen on May 19, 2016. (AP) McEnany did not specify who she saw as the ""main Founding Fathers,"" but in the Fox News segment, she cited an article from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The article said the Founders ""unambiguously saw slavery as evil."" It specifically named John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, James Madison, and Thomas Jefferson. Among those, Adams was the most opposed to slavery. He never owned people and was ""staunchly antislavery,"" said Sean Wilentz, a Princeton University historian.  Franklin owned a few enslaved people but freed them later and became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.  Morris referred to slavery at the Constitutional Convention as the ""curse of heaven"" and pushed for emancipation in New York. And Jay, who helped write the Federalist Papers and became the first chief justice, signed a law to gradually end slavery in New York. But there was a struggle over slavery at the nation’s founding, Wilentz said. Other Founders had more complicated records — to the point that a British essayist wrote in 1775, ""How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?""  Hamilton, for example, was a founder of the New York Manumission Society, an anti-slavery group. But he married into a slave-owning family and may have owned at least two people himself. He also supported several Federalist Party slaveholders as presidential candidates. Three other prominent Founders — Washington, Madison and Jefferson — all wrote at some point of their lament for the institution of slavery, Glover said. But they also enslaved people. The article McEnany cited ""cherry-pick(ed) quotations ripped out of context"" and distorted the Founding Fathers’ complex lives and writings, Glover said. Washington, the nation’s first president, owned hundreds of enslaved people, though he ultimately freed them in his will. Thanks in large part to his friend the Marquis de Lafayette, Washington came to oppose slavery. He once said that he wished to see a plan for the abolition of the institution.  Madison, the principal author of the Constitution and fourth president, owned more than 100 people, and he also proposed to amend the Northwest Ordinance to allow slavery in the Indiana Territory, Finkelman said.  A statue of former President James Madison is shown in front of a mural of the Constitution in the education center at Montpelier, Madison's home, in Orange, Va., on Aug. 13, 2008. (AP) The Constitution protected the institution of slavery, Finkelman argued. It allowed slaveholders to capture runaways. It also required that a constitutional amendment be ratified by three-fourths of states to end slavery — a tall task for a nation with several slave states, and one that was achieved only after many of those states seceded. Then, there was Jefferson.  The nation’s third president ""said more antislavery things publicly than any of the other founders by 1787,"" but he also ""did more to spread and defend slavery than any other during the ensuing decades,"" said David Waldstreicher, a historian at the City University of New York. As the chief architect of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson wrote that ""all men are created equal,"" and he condemned slavery and blamed the king for the slave trade in a separate passage that was eventually cut from the document. He backed some legislation that chipped away at the institution of slavery and likened it to forcing tyranny on both the slaveholder and the enslaved.   At the same time, Jefferson enslaved over 600 people. He described Black people as racially inferior. He often sold people to punish them, Finkelman said, and when asked to speak against allowing Missouri to become a slave state, Jefferson refused. He and many other southern Founders were ""committed to the institution of slavery,"" Finkelman said.  Thomas Jefferson's home Monticello is seen in Charlottesville, Va., on April 22, 2009. (AP) Overall, McEnany’s claim about the Founding Fathers is ""contradicted by the lack of substantive action on the part of the Founders to end slavery,"" said Estes, from Oakland University. ""Many slaveholders claimed to hate the institution of slavery and the slave trade and decried their dependence on slave labor,"" Estes said. ""Yet, (they) did little or nothing to abolish the institution or even to reduce their and others’ dependence on slavery.""  ""In other words,"" Waldstreicher added, ""they tried to have it both ways.""  Other men who could be considered Founders were more adamantly pro-slavery, including southerners from Georgia or the Carolinas like Charles Pinckney, who signed and contributed clauses to the Constitution and later became South Carolina’s governor. During the Constitutional Convention, Pinckney said slavery was ""justified by the example of all the world."" Finkelman said, ""If the Founding Fathers thought slavery was wrong and was evil, why didn’t they end it?"" McEnany said, ""We know most of our forefathers, all of our main Founding Fathers were against slavery, recognized the evils of it."" Historians said that’s an oversimplification that ignores the lack of action among the Founders to get rid of slavery. Of the most eminent Founding Fathers, a few were against slavery. Others were lifelong slaveholders who showed some distaste for the practice in their lives and writings.  Of the broader group of people who could be considered Founders, there were also southerners who were vehemently pro-slavery. The majority of the signers of the Declaration of Independence owned enslaved people. We rate McEnany’s statement Mostly False. UPDATE, July 9, 2021: This fact-check was updated to clarify that Thomas Jefferson was not in Congress when asked to speak against Missouri becoming a slave state.",/factchecks/2021/jul/09/kayleigh-mcenany/fact-checking-kayleigh-mcenanys-claim-all-our-main/

Activated charcoal is unlikely to be effective in countering drugs used in sexual assaults
","Activated charcoal —  a processed form of carbon — has been touted widely for its purported health benefits, particularly its ability to absorb toxins. It has a spot on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines, it can be regularly found in emergency rescue service supply kits in some parts of the world, and can be purchased from a local pharmacy — or online — without a doctor’s prescription.  But social media claims on the ability of activated charcoal to counteract ""date rape drugs"" mix medicine with pseudoscience. A date rape drug is a broad label for various drugs and alcohol that can  impair someone’s ability to give consent to sexual activity. A Facebook post implores social media users to buy activated charcoal tablets and bring them to gatherings or night clubs. ""Should you feel like you aren't yourself or out of place, drink one tablet & it will counteract most date rape drugs,"" said the post, which dates back to 2019 and continues to be shared. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.)  Theoretically, a sufficient dose of activated charcoal could be effective if it is taken before the drug is absorbed by the bloodstream. But drugs commonly used to facilitate rape and other sexual assaults rapidly take effect — and it’s contrary to medical advice to ingest activated charcoal if someone is already experiencing symptoms, since by then the drug has already entered the bloodstream. Activated charcoal is produced when carbon substances are heated and then ""activated"" with steam or hot air. Because of its absorbent surface, activated charcoal can prevent some toxic substances from being absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract. If someone has overdosed, activated charcoal could gobble up some drug molecules before they are absorbed into the bloodstream, and possibly diminish the drug’s effect, said Dr. William Sullivan, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Indiana University.  To what extent activated charcoal can bind to toxic substances depends on the properties of the substance, like its particle size, solubility, and pH levels, as well as the contents of the stomach. Crucially, its effectiveness depends on how much time has passed since a drug or poison ingestion. Drugs used in sexual assaults can be tasteless, odorless and sometimes colorless. That makes them difficult to detect, especially if they are mixed with a drink. Most are rapidly absorbed in the bloodstream, meaning that their effects also take hold quickly. Common effects are reduced consciousness or coma. Sullivan explained that if you ""feel like you aren’t yourself or out of place,"" as the Facebook post suggests, the drug has already reached the brain and activated charcoal is unlikely to effectively counteract the drug. ""Charcoal only works in the [gastrointestinal] tract and will not pull the drug out of the blood or brain, so a charcoal tablet is not going to help at this point,"" Sullivan said.  Activated charcoal could reduce the severity of a drug’s effects if it is taken immediately after ingesting the drug — but figuring out that you’ve been drugged prior to the onset of symptoms is oftentimes unlikely, said Dr. Michael Eddleston, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Edinburgh. Rohypnol, GHB (gamma hydroxybutyric acid), and ketamine are drugs that are commonly used in sexual assaults. It takes about 30 minutes for Rohpynol and ketamine to enter the bloodstream, while GHB usually takes effect within five to 15 minutes. ""These drugs are sometimes called ‘club drugs’ because they are often used at dance clubs, concerts, bars, or parties,"" said the Office on Women’s Health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. People who use drugs or alcohol to commit sexual assault most often use alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs, the office said.  Mitchell Gomez, who directs DanceSafe, an organization promoting safety and health in the electronic dance community, also advised that if a person thinks they have been non-consensually given a drug, they should seek medical care and not rely on activated charcoal. ""The reality is, doses of many so called ‘date rape drugs’ are very small, and by the time you feel intoxicated, you have probably absorbed the majority of the drug already,"" Gomez said.  Activated charcoal is also rarely used to combat alcohol poisoning, since alcohol is absorbed rapidly from the gut.  Despite a long history of medical applications, there is no international set of standards on how activated charcoal should be administered — each dosage requires a precise analysis of risks and benefits. Taking one tablet of activated charcoal may not only be an insufficient dose but also the improper formulation for it to produce its intended effect. Aspiration of charcoal in powdered form may contribute to an abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary issues.   Ingesting charcoal could also have other potentially painful or distressing consequences, since it could bind to other medications, like antidepressants and birth control pills, rendering them ineffective.  Experts said that taking a charcoal tablet to block drugs is misguided and could provide people a false sense of security. Instead, they said, if someone thinks they have been poisoned, they should seek medical help immediately.  A Facebook post claimed that charcoal activated tablets ""will counteract most date rape drugs."" Although activated charcoal is often given as an emergency poison treatment, medical experts said that it’s unlikely to be effective in detoxifying the gastrointestinal system by the time someone realizes that they may have ingested a drug.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/09/facebook-posts/activated-charcoal-unlikely-be-effective-counterin/
"['Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jon Erpenbach']","
Wisconsin ranks near-last in federal money received for public health, but higher in state spending
","Wisconsin’s state budget for the next two years has arrived at the desk of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, lauded by the Republican-controlled Assembly and Senate and opposed by most Democratic lawmakers.  The nearly $88 billion spending plan would cut taxes by more than $3 billion, end an eight-year freeze on tuition at University of Wisconsin schools and lower property taxes by about $100 for the owner of a typical home.  Republican lawmakers removed hundreds of items that Evers had proposed, including expanding Medicaid, legalizing marijuana, raising the minimum wage and repealing Act 10, the law that restricted collective bargaining for most public employees.  They also passed on public health spending that Democrats argue is key to preparing for the next pandemic. Evers had proposed a $53 million boost to state-funded public health activities, including a $5 million annual increase in grants to local public health departments for communicable disease prevention and 23 full-time positions in the Bureau of Communicable Diseases. State Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-West Point, voiced his displeasure with that decision on Twitter, responding to a June 15, 2021 tweet about Republicans’ health care priorities.  ""(Wisconsin) is 49th in public health spending,"" Erpenbach tweeted. ""We just had a pandemic and will be vulnerable to the next one because Republicans are not investing in public health.""  The first part of that statement needs more context to understand which ranking he’s talking about — but once we have that context, is it true?  Let’s take a look.  When asked for backup for the claim, Kate Constalie, communications director for the office of the senator, said Erpenbach meant that the state was 49th in the nation in federal public health dollars.  She pointed to a May 2021 report from Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit health policy organization based in Washington, D.C., that detailed the federal government’s investment in states’ public health initiatives.  Most federal money for public health flows through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and much of that is rerouted to states to use for specific efforts such as immunization, public health preparedness and chronic disease prevention.  But declining funding for the CDC over the past decade has resulted in fewer federal funds for public health, which the report argued set states up to fail during the coronavirus pandemic.  That report said Wisconsin ranked 49th in total CDC program funding to states in fiscal year 2020, which ended in September. The state received more than $108 million, averaging out to $18.65 per person — just about 50 cents more than New Jersey, which was ranked last.  In comparison, Washington, D.C. at the top received more than $208 per person, the report found.  But Erpenbach’s claim was made in the context of the state budget. And how much money Wisconsin receives from the federal government for public health isn’t anything statehouse Republicans — whom he appeared to be talking about in the tweet — can control.  What they do control is how much the state spends on public health.  The State Health Access Data Assistance Center, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson program at the University of Minnesota, assembles a yearly ranking of per-person state public health funding.  In 2020, it found Wisconsin spent $18 per person on public health, sitting at 42nd in the nation plus Washington, D.C. Below Wisconsin were Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, North Carolina, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Nevada and Missouri.  The state actually ranked higher in 2019, at 40th in the nation, despite spending a dollar less per person that year on public health, according to data from the center.  So Wisconsin ranks higher in state dollars put toward public health than in what it receives from the federal government — though to be sure, it’s still on the lower end by that measure, too.  Since 2010, spending for state public health departments dropped 16% per person, and spending for local health departments has fallen 18%, according to a Kaiser Health News and Associated Press analysis of government spending on public health.  In a retort about the state budget, Erpenbach said Wisconsin ranks 49th in the nation in public health spending.  While the state ranks next to last in the amount it received from the CDC, the picture is different when looking at state money. By that measure, Wisconsin ranks 42nd in the nation, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.  Our definition of Half True is a statement that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/09/jon-erpenbach/wisconsin-ranks-near-last-federal-money-received-p/

Evidence shows George Floyd’s death was not the result of a fentanyl overdose
","On June 16, 2021, the city of Newark, N.J., unveiled a statue of George Floyd sitting on a park bench and resting with his arm outstretched. The 700-pound bronze sculpture, erected in front of city hall, was gifted to the city by artist Stanley Watts. A Facebook post on July 2, 2021, criticized the tribute, stating that Floyd died ""because he had a system full of fentanyl and meth,"" rather than police brutality. It also stated that he beat women, and ""held guns to their pregnant bellies,"" a claim which was sparked by misinformation regarding Floyd’s criminal background. The post, which called the statue ""St. George of Fentanyl,"" also said that Floyd resisted police when he died. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact has debunked several claims that Floyd died due to a drug overdose. Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020, when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned his knee to Floyd’s neck for several minutes.  The Hennepin County chief medical examiner, Andew Baker, ruled that the cause of Floyd’s death was homicide, due to ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,"" meaning that Floyd’s heart stopped as Chauvin restrained him. Another independent autopsy, ordered by Floyd’s family, also ruled the death a homicide by asphyxiation, or suffocation.  The medical examiner found high levels of fentanyl in his system. But Baker and other experts in toxicology, cardiology and drug use stated that death by overdose was unlikely or impossible. Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The portion of the claim stating that Floyd beat and held pregnant women at gunpoint is based on misinformation about his criminal history. Snopes, the Houston Chronicle and other news sources published background pieces that provided context on Floyd’s childhood and adult life, which included several arrests in the late 1990s and early 2000s in Texas. The Associated Press detailed that in 2007, Floyd was involved in an aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, in which he and five other suspects forced their way into a woman’s apartment. Floyd was identified as the suspect that pushed a pistol against the abdomen of the woman, who was identified in other reports as Aracely Henriquez. He pleaded guilty to the crime in 2009 and served five years in prison before his release in 2013.  Following Floyd’s death, an Instagram post made claims regarding the incident, stating that Henriquez was pregnant at the time of the robbery and that Floyd beat her and threatened to kill her baby. The post used a photo of a battered woman, claiming it was Henriquez. PolitiFact reported that the Instagram post fabricated claims about the robbery. The photo is not of Henriquez but Andrea Sicignano, an American student who was assaulted and raped in Madrid in 2018.  There is no evidence that Henriquez was pregnant at the time of the robbery, according to court documents. The documents further state that after Floyd put the gun to her abdomen, he went on to search the house while another suspect guarded her. It was this suspect that beat Henriquez, not Floyd.    A Facebook post claimed that Floyd was a man who resisted police when he died, and that his death was due to an overdose of drugs. The post also claimed that he physically abused pregnant women and held them at gunpoint. Floyd was killed when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned his knee to Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Two autopsy reports ruled the cause of death as a homicide, not a drug overdose. The post exaggerates details surrounding Floyd’s criminal activity. In 2007, Floyd was involved with a group of other men in an aggravated robbery, in which he was identified as a suspect that held a gun to a woman’s abdomen. However, court records do not show that she was pregnant at the time, and that another suspect injured the woman, not Floyd. Floyd pleaded guilty to the case and served five years in prison.

Popular Facebook Post Distorts San Francisco Policy On Minors Getting COVID-19 Vaccine
","Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for emergency use for minors ages 12 and above, more people have begun to get their first dose. In California, more than half of the population has received their first dose of the vaccine against COVID-19. In San Francisco, it’s 82%. But with the news of more people eligible to get vaccinated comes more misinformation about the shots.  Two weeks after the FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use for the new age group, a Facebook post claimed minors in San Francisco could get vaccinated against COVID-19 without their parents consent. That post went viral, garnering over 10,000 shares, comments and reactions combined on Facebook.  A post from The Hodgetwins, a conservative commentary duo, was flagged on May 27 as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In bold letters, the post reads ""San Francisco Allowing Children to ‘Consent’ to Covid Vaccine Without Parents Approval.""    At the bottom of the post is a snippet from a San Francisco County health order that attempts to justify the claim that minors are receiving vaccines without parental consent. However, the Facebook post and others on Twitter fail to point out the health order was intended for emancipated California minors or those who can prove they are self-sufficiently independent.  As a way to make COVID-19 vaccines more accessible, San Francisco’s Department of Public Health said the health order was issued in anticipation of the FDA’s decision to administer Pfizer vaccines to the newly eligible group.  A few weeks later, SFDPH issued further guidance for city and county healthcare providers administering vaccines to minors at mass vaccination spots. The guidance said because emancipated and self-sufficient minors ""are not the norm and thus relatively uncommon,"" they can consent to medical care without a parent or legal guardian's approval.  The guidance also says, San Francisco-affiliated vaccination providers should ""reasonably attempt to ascertain a minor’s claim of self-sufficient or emancipated status"" such as signed documentation. A minor is considered ""self-sufficient"" if they are at least 15 years old, manage their finances, and live separately from their parents. If a minor is not emancipated or considered self-sufficient ""healthcare providers must reasonably attempt to notify a parent or guardian to consent to medical care for that minor and allow that person the opportunity to object to administration of that [vaccine],"" according to the guidance. Even with the health order, it’s not as easy for minors to consent to the vaccine on their own behalf. In an email, SFDPH said ""generally, parent or legal guardian consent is required for COVID-19 vaccinations of minors."" California’s Department of Public Health said the same and lists acceptable forms of consent for ""persons younger than 18-years"" such as being accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, a signed consent form prior to the appointment, or some kind of verbal consent via telephone.  Medical experts agree that vaccinating minors was always part of the vaccine rollout plan, but knowing a person’s medical history is also just as important. Specifically for emancipated minors consenting on their own behalf. ""There’s some gray zones here where it’s not easy to make these decisions,"" said Lee Riley, a Professor of infectious disease at UC Berkeley.  One of those gray zones is myocarditis. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an increased number of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, in adolescents after their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices concluded that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine to individual persons outweigh the risks of myocarditis.  Because of this, Riley agrees that healthcare providers administering the vaccine to minors should do everything they can to understand the minor’s medical history.  In regards to vaccine side effects, ""the story is not completely done with children and safety and we have to watch this and do no harm,"" said Monica Gandhi, an American physician and Professor of Medicine at University of California in San Francisco.  Gandhi says because of a lack of CDC data on vaccine side effects in children, healthcare providers administering vaccines should be extra careful.  Our Ruling: Social media posts claimed that minors can get vaccinated without their parent’s consent in San Francisco. The county’s department of public health issued a health order in anticipation of the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use for emancipated or ""self-sufficient"" minors who are 12 years old and above. Weeks after the health order, SFDPH said the exemption for minors to consent without their parent’s approval ""are not the norm and thus relatively uncommon.""  Medical experts agree with the city and county of San Francisco that healthcare providers must do everything possible to get consent from a parent or legal guardian prior to administering a vaccine to a minor. We rate this claim as Mostly False.  MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2021/jul/08/facebook-posts/popular-facebook-post-distorts-san-francisco-polic/

Fact-checking Donald Trump on there being 'no reason' for shooting Ashli Babbitt
","During a press conference to announce that he was filing a lawsuit against several social media giants, former President Donald Trump answered a question about the event that triggered his removal from Facebook and Twitter: the storming of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters on Jan. 6. A reporter asked Trump, ""Because so much of your banning (on social media platforms) has to do with comments you made around Jan. 6, just to clarify further, what did you do to stop the insurrection as some people call it, and why were you not able to stop it?"" In his answer, Trump called the storming of the Capitol an ""unfortunate event"" and pivoted to the death of Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old San Diego woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Capitol Police officer when a crowd of rioters was trying to force its way into the House chamber.  ""The person that shot Ashli Babbitt — boom — right through the head — just boom — there was no reason for that,"" Trump said. ""And why isn’t that person being opened up, and why isn’t that being studied? They’ve already written it off. They said that case is closed. If that were the opposite, that case would be going on for years and years, and it would not be pretty."" First, we should note that the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for Washington, D.C., determined that Babbitt was struck in the front left shoulder, not the head. Beyond that, Trump’s assertion that ""there was no reason"" for the shooting goes beyond saying that, in his opinion, the shooting was unjustified. Rather, he’s saying there’s no possible argument to support it. However, even if one disagrees with the Justice Department’s determination not to prosecute the officer for the shooting, video evidence demonstrates that the officer was facing an angry mob near the House chamber. Experts told PolitiFact that the situation involved a risk of serious bodily harm to either law enforcement or lawmakers, which is a longstanding defense made and upheld by the courts in police shootings. The former president’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. A sign against wearing masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus covers the office door of Fowler's Pool Services and Supply Inc. Ashli Babbitt, listed as an owner of Fowler's, was shot and killed during the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. (AP) Babbitt was a 14-year Air Force veteran who served four tours as a high-level security official, KUSI-TV in San Diego reported. Her husband told the station she was an avid Trump supporter. Babbitt also sent 21 tweets referencing the QAnon conspiracy beginning in February 2020, according to the Daily Beast. The site reported that Babbitt posted Jan. 5 that the United States would soon see ""The Storm,"" a day of reckoning the conspiracy theorists believed was coming for deep-state pedophiles, sex traffickers and Trump opponents. On Jan. 5 she flew from her home in San Diego to Washington to attend the ""stop the steal"" rally where Trump would speak, according to the investigative website Bellingcat. In a video obtained by TMZ, she described ""a sea of nothing but red, white and blue, patriots and Trump. And it was amazing, you could see the president talk."" She entered the building when other rioters breached the building. The deadly showdown occurred in a corridor known as the Speaker’s Lobby; the lobby is a formal, ornately decorated space that leads directly to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Capitol Police had used furniture to barricade a glass door to prevent rioters from getting near the lawmakers.  The Speaker’s Lobby (U.S. House of Representatives) Video footage (warning, graphic content) shows a plain-clothes officer standing with a gun drawn in the Speaker’s Lobby. The officer fired once as Babbitt was climbing through a broken window adjoining the door. (The officer’s name has not been released, though Babbitt’s husband has sued seeking to release the name.) Babbitt fell to the floor, where she was immediately treated by uniformed officers on her side of the barricade. A Jan. 7 news release from the Capitol Police said she was taken to a nearby hospital where she died of her injuries. A witness account that Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., shared with ""Good Morning America"" on Jan. 7 fits with this account.  Mullin was in the Speaker’s Lobby behind the officer who shot and killed Babbitt. He said that ""when they broke the glass in the back, the (police) lieutenant that was there, him and I already had multiple conversations prior to this, and he didn't have a choice at that time. … The mob was going to come through the door, there was a lot of members and staff that were in danger at the time. And when he (drew) his weapon, that's a decision that's very hard for anyone to make and, once you draw your weapon like that, you have to defend yourself with deadly force."" A Jan. 7 statement by Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund confirmed that Babbitt was shot by a sworn Capitol Police officer who was later placed on administrative leave, in line with agency policy. ""As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn (Capitol Police) employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female,"" Sund said in his statement, referring to Babbitt.  On April 14, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division jointly announced that there was ""insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution"" against the officer who shot Babbitt. The department said: ""The investigation determined that, on Jan. 6, 2021, Ms. Babbitt joined a crowd of people that gathered on the U.S. Capitol grounds to protest the results of the 2020 presidential election. … The investigation further determined that Ms. Babbitt was among a mob of people that entered the Capitol building and gained access to a hallway outside the Speaker’s Lobby, which leads to the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives. ... ""As members of the mob continued to strike the glass doors, Ms. Babbitt attempted to climb through one of the doors where glass was broken out. An officer inside the Speaker’s Lobby fired one round from his service pistol, striking Ms. Babbitt in the left shoulder, causing her to fall back from the doorway and onto the floor."" The department concluded that it was unable to find sufficient evidence that a federal criminal civil rights statute was violated. ""Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used force that was constitutionally unreasonable, but that the officer did so ‘willfully,’ which the Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that the officer acted with a bad purpose to disregard the law,"" the department said. ""As this requirement has been interpreted by the courts, evidence that an officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required."" Investigators concluded that there was ""no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber,"" the department said.  We asked several law-enforcement experts whether they saw any justification for Trump’s assertion that there was ""no reason"" for the officer to have shot Babbitt. They agreed that the department made the right decision not to prosecute the officer. ""It is very easy, of course, to play Monday-morning police officer and second-guess quick decisions made at the time,"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""There was clearly a risk of serious bodily harm to the officers and everyone they were protecting, justifying the use of deadly force in defense of self and others."" Fox added that it’s also worth keeping in mind ""the high stakes given the important roles of those being protected,"" even though that is not written into the relevant statutes. Philip Stinson, a Bowling Green State University criminologist, agreed. ""A police officer is justified in using deadly force when that officer has a reasonable apprehension of an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death being imposed against the officer or someone else,"" Stinson said. ""Mr. Trump is wrong in stating that there was ‘no reason’ to shoot Ms. Babbitt."" Greg Meyer, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain, said that less harmful measures to subdue the rioters, such as pepper spray or warning shots, should be weighed in after-the-fact analyses of how to handle such situations in the future. But he added that any assumption that these alternatives should have been pursued would be ""a matter of speculation based on 20/20 hindsight."" ""The reason the officer fired at Ms. Babbitt was because a violent mob was taking over the Capitol and causing police to evacuate House and Senate members out of fear for their lives,"" Meyer said. Trump said that ""the person that shot Ashli Babbitt — boom — right through the head — just boom — there was no reason for that."" Babbitt was fatally shot in the shoulder, not the head.  As for Trump’s assertion that ""there was no reason"" for the shooting, this means there’s no possible argument to support it. But the angry mob that prompted the shooting was captured on video, and at least one member of Congress directly witnessed it. Experts said that, according to the video evidence, the situation involved a risk of serious bodily harm to either law enforcement or lawmakers, which is a longstanding defense made and upheld by the courts in police shootings.

No, Facebook isn’t kicking people out for supporting the NRA
","An old claim about Facebook banning users who support the National Rifle Association is again gaining traction on social media, but there’s still no evidence of this.  ""Well Facebook said that if you support the NRA you will get kicked off,"" one July 2020 post says. ""Well let’s experiment. I support the NRA how about y’all."" The fact that this post is still on Facebook a year later should make clear that it’s not true, and Facebook spokesperson told PolitiFact the same. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Facebook doesn’t mention the National Rifle Association in its community standards, where it outlines rules about objectionable content such as hate speech and sexual solicitation. (Facebook does ban users from buying, selling or trading guns and some other regulated products on its platform.)  The NRA’s Facebook page, followed by more than 4.7 million people, is active.  And in September 2020, when USA Today looked into the claim, a spokesperson for Facebook said it was ""not true"" and that support for the NRA doesn’t violate the company’s community standards. Facebook also told AFP in July 2020 that the claim was wrong.  While we found other Facebook posts claiming that the company would ban NRA supporters from the social media platform, we found no credible evidence of this in news coverage or anywhere else.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/08/facebook-posts/no-facebook-isnt-kicking-people-out-supporting-nra/

Jill Biden did not imply that the government planned the COVID-19 pandemic
","First lady Jill Biden visited vaccination sites in Tennessee and Mississippi on June 22 as part of a nationwide tour to promote the efficacy of vaccines. The two states have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the United States. A few days later, selectively edited portions of Biden’s remarks in Mississippi circulated on Instagram — giving the impression that she suggested the pandemic was planned. ""So when this pandemic started, they already had a pandemic ready to go,"" Biden tells the crowd in the video. The Instagram user who shared the clip captioned it this way: ""So this was planned? It was in the making? This is why you don’t trust the government and nothing they giving out.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  Here’s the thing: Biden did speak the words in the video, but the Instagram post omits crucial context.  Biden was telling a crowd at Jackson State University — a historically Black university in Jackson — that researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for years.  If you watch the remarks in their entirety, Biden states: ""I’m surprised to learn that while these vaccines might be new, the technology behind them really isn’t new at all. You know, scientists have been studying similar viruses and working on this type of vaccine for decades, and many of you probably already know this. So when this pandemic started, they already had a pandemic ready to go. And the vaccines might feel like a miracle, but there’s no faith required. They are a result of decades of rigorous scientific research and discoveries, and they’ve been held to the very same safety standard as every single vaccine that we’ve had here in America."" In her speech, Biden did not acknowledge that the pandemic was ""planned"" or orchestrated by the federal government. When Biden says ""they had a pandemic ready to go,"" she appears to be referring to scientific advances regarding vaccine research. An Instagram post shows Biden appearing to say that the pandemic was planned. The post takes her statements out of context to present a misleading narrative. The full remarks show she was referring to vaccine research.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/08/instagram-posts/jill-biden-did-not-imply-government-planned-covid-/
