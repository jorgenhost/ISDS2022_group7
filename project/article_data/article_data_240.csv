IRS targeted liberal groups during Bush years, says Jim McDermott
","
At a House Ways and Means committee hearing Tuesday, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., listened closely to the stories from members of groups that were snagged when the IRS cast a wide net for politically active organizations seeking tax-exempt status. All of the groups advocate for conservative causes, from opposing gay marriage to promoting a broad tea party agenda. 
While McDermott said he was sorry they had been singled out, and that ""the IRS has unequivocally made a mistake here,"" he was more focused on the lack of clear legal rules that should guide the IRS. 
""Let’s not get lost,"" McDermott said. ""During the Bush administration liberal groups were targeted without any concern by Mr. Issa or anyone else in this committee."" (Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.) 
This caught our eye. Were liberal groups targeted when a Republican held the White House? And if so, were the circumstances back then similar to what has come to light today? 
We asked McDermott’s office for details and staff pointed us to a recent Salon article that described how the IRS subjected the NAACP, Greenpeace and a liberal Episcopal church in California to sometimes intense scrutiny. In 2004, the IRS audited the NAACP after its chairman said President George W. Bush was the first sitting president since Herbert Hoover who declined to speak before the group. The same year, the IRS moved to revoke the tax-exempt status of All Saints Episcopal in Pasadena. The Sunday before the 2004 election, the rector told the congregation ""Jesus (would say), ‘Mr. President, your doctrine of pre-emptive war is a failed doctrine.' "" 
That case dragged on for three years before the IRS dropped it. From 2004 to 2009, the IRS had a Political Activities Compliance Initiative aimed at 501(c)(3) groups that might have endorsed a candidate or otherwise crossed the line between charitable work and electioneering. In 2004, the IRS opened cases on 110 groups. While there were allegations and even lawsuits claiming that the IRS took a light hand with churches that promoted conservative candidates, a 2005 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found no political bias. 
""We ... did not identify any cases in which the same criteria were used to select one information item for examination and to decline a similar item for examination,"" the auditors wrote. 
The current controversy involves the examination of nearly 300 groups and there are significant differences today from the examples cited in the Salon article: 
The inspector general found that IRS staff used ""inappropriate criteria"" to identify groups for special attention. A group’s name or a focus on government debt and spending triggered IRS action, rather than the group’s activities. 
Most of the groups, about 70 percent, held or were applying for 501(c)(4) status, not 501(c)(3). The limits on (c)(3) groups -- the ones examined under Bush -- are much more strict than for (c)(4) groups. 
The inspector general found that all cases with ""tea party,"" ""patriots"" or ""9/12"" in their name were singled out. 
All the experts we contacted said the rules concerning what 501(c)(4) groups can and cannot do are vague and leave the door open to excesses by the IRS. 
McDermott’s office said that the congressman’s point was that while the recent IRS actions were unacceptable, they don’t represent a political conspiracy or a unique occurrence. 
Nevertheless, McDermott’s comparison falls short on a number of fronts. 
David Keating, president of the conservative leaning group, Center for Competitive Politics, sees nothing similar between what happened under Bush and what happened under Obama. 
""I just don't’ see this as being in the same league,"" Keating said. The key difference is the global impact of the IRS screening. ""What the IRS did with the tea party groups is they set them aside and every single one got special scrutiny because of the philosophy of the organization."" 
In contrast, Keating said, there is no evidence that the IRS under Bush targeted all environmental groups or all progressive churches. 
Another legal expert, Bruce Fein, who served in the Reagan Justice Department, said McDermott’s comparison also falls short because the rules concerning (c)(3) groups are so tight. 
""Even the tiniest political activity would raise a flag with a (c)(3). You would naturally expect that there is going to be a more exacting examination."" 
On the other hand, Gabe Rottman, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said we should withhold full judgment on the IRS actions during the 18 months between 2010 and 2012. 
""We don't know if it was a good faith mistake or if it was an effort by people at the IRS to target these groups because of their political beliefs,"" Rottman said. ""What happened under Bush, the mechanics might be different, but the existence of a situation that allows selective enforcement is a problem across both administrations."" 
That said, Rottman agreed that the systematic screening criticized in the present inspector general’s report creates greater harm than the more case-by-case instances during the Bush administration. 
We should note that the IRS’s more recent methods caught up at least three Democratic-leaning groups. Bloomberg reported that Emerge America, Progress Texas and Clean Elections Texas received IRS letters requesting more information. Emerge America ultimately saw its tax-exempt status denied, making it the only group to suffer that fate during this episode. 
Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization that has sued the IRS for failing to rein in conservative 501(c)(4) groups, said she has no doubt the Bush administration went after the NAACP and others because it didn’t like them. But she finds little use for McDermott’s comparison. 
""It’s apples and oranges,"" Sloan said. ""Those were big organizations with an established track record. What you have here are new groups asking for special tax status, and the IRS was legitimately asking them if they engaged in political activities to see if it exceeded what the law allows."" 
Our ruling 
McDermott said liberal groups were targeted during the Bush administration. While some liberal groups were audited, the numbers we could find were small, largely confined to 501(c)(3) nonprofits where the rules are more strict, and stemmed from complaints levied by outsiders. 
In contrast, the current case was fueled by internal bureaucratic rules applied to a significantly larger number of organizations. A group’s name or its policy agenda triggered the IRS action, rather than a complaint or the group’s specific activities. While there is an element of truth in McDermott’s statement, the systematic nature of the IRS actions between 2010 and 2012 represents a distinctly different set of circumstances. 
We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/06/jim-mcdermott/irs-targeted-liberal-groups-bush-years-jim-mcdermo/

Barbara Buono's record on tax, debt hikes targeted in GOP ad
","
In much the same way that a woodpecker keeps at its target, Republicans continue hammering Democrat Barbara Buono on her political record when it comes to taxes and debt. 
The latest salvo in the increasingly testy gubernatorial campaign comes from the Republican Governors Association, which last week released a TV ad about Buono’s record on those issues. The group backs Chris Christie, who was the RGA’s vice chairman last year. 
""Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times,"" a narrator states during the ad. ""Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards."" 
Similar to other gubernatorial campaign ads from both Christie and Buono, claims in this ad ignore context and misplace blame. 
Let’s start with the claim of 154 votes in favor of tax increases and then look at the others. 
We have previously rated this claim True. Between 1996 and 2010, Buono voted in favor of various measures that raised either taxes or fees on things ranging from tanning and limousine rides to higher gross income tax rates on New Jerseyans earning six-figure incomes, or she supported tax policy changes resulting in higher costs for individuals and businesses. 
And the ad is correct that those increases affected utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins and more, according to a list of votes provided by Republicans to PolitiFact New Jersey for the years that Buono has served in the Legislature. We confirmed every vote on the list, but Buono obviously wasn’t the only legislator to support the increases. 
Next up, property taxes climbing 70 percent under Buono. Property taxes did increase 70 percent in New Jersey in the 10 years before Chris Christie became governor, when the state was overseen by Democratic administrations. Buono was a member of the Legislature during those years but that doesn't make her responsible for the hikes. Property taxes are voted on at the local level. 
As for a sales tax increase, Buono voted to raise the tax, but also supported earmarking part of the resulting revenue for property tax relief, according to a statement from her campaign. 
Now let’s look at whether she drove New Jersey into $2 billion worth of debt. 
The RGA claims Buono was the ""architect"" of Corzine’s budget when she chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2008 and 2009, working on the fiscal year 2010 budget. But the governor – not the committee chair – has the final say on the budget. Still, by the time Christie came into office on Jan. 19, 2010, the state had a $2.2 billion shortfall. Christie fixed it by cutting more than 300 line items in the budget, including $475 million in school aid. 
Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, has told us that a variety of factors – including the recession -- led to that deficit. The recession, for example, was a main reason why the state fell short on anticipated revenues. 
""I think it’s probably a little over the top to say that Senator Buono was responsible for the $2 billion shortfall,"" Caprio told us in a previous fact-check about this deficit. 
As for the entirety of the ad, Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said in a statement, ""Governor Christie and his national Republican sponsors’ false attacks on Senator Buono’s record are attempts to distract from the truth: they have made careers off defending millionaires over working and middle class families. Senator Buono has consistently fought to make millionaires pay their fair share to provide property tax relief to New Jersey’s middle class."" 
The RGA did not respond to our request for comment. 
Our ruling 
An ad from the RGA claims, ""Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times. Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards."" 
Each claim on its face has a degree of accuracy, but lacks context and places blame squarely on Buono. As we have noted before, she has some responsibility for these increases because she voted for them, but they wouldn’t have happened without approval from either Corzine or a majority vote in the Legislature. 
We rate the ad Mostly True.

Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Buono did not vote for a 70 percent hike in property taxes during the decade before Chris Christie became governor.",/factchecks/2013/jun/06/republican-governors-association/barbara-buonos-record-tax-debt-hikes-targeted-gop-/

Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo says college students typically come out of schools hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt
","
It's not news that college is expensive. This past year, according to the College Board, cost for tuition, fees, room and board for one year averaged $17,860 for an in-state public four-year college, $30,911 for students who went to a public college outside their state, and $39,518 if they attended a private nonprofit college or university. 
So it's not surprising that some students end up in debt, even before their degree translates to a paycheck. 
Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo talked about that problem as part of a May 29 story on the 5:30 p.m. newscast on WJAR-TV. The story was devoted to a looming rise in the interest rates for federal student loans. Raimondo said the higher rates would make a bad situation even worse. 
""The average student comes out of college hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and they can't afford these interest rates to go up,"" she said. 
An alert reader who caught the program wrote PolitFact Rhode Island to say, ""I don't think it's anywhere near that."" 
We decided to check. 
We called Raimondo's office to ask for her source. 
While we were waiting, we went to the College Board website and found its ""Trends in Student Aid"" report for 2012, which covers the 2010-2011 academic year. It tells a very different story. 
The average debt among graduates who borrowed to get a bachelor's degree was $25,300. (A second source, the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success, through its Project on Student Debt, calculates a comparable average -- $26,600.) 
Forty percent of the degree recipients had not borrowed at all, so they had no debt, according to the College Board. If you factor them into the mix, its calculation of the average debt drops to $15,100. 
Even if you only look at private, nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, where the costs are higher, the average debt for graduates who had borrowed was $29,900. Thirty-four percent of graduates hadn't borrowed. Among all graduates from these schools -- borrowers and non-borrowers -- the average debt was $19,700. 
To put this in perspective, 10 years earlier, the average debt for graduates who had borrowed was $23,400, adjusted for inflation. If you include all graduates -- both borrowers and non-borrowers -- it was $14,600. 
The College Board also followed a group of students who enrolled during the 2003-2004 academic year to see how much graduates owed. Only 1 percent had more than $75,000 in debt. Another 1 percent had a debt level of $50,000 to $75,000. 
Locally, we also found that as of October 2012, Rhode Island graduates ranked fourth in student debt from public and private nonprofit four-year institutions, according to a state-by-state ranking by the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success. The average Rhode Island debt among students who borrowed was $29,097. 
Viewed in another way, 69 percent of students in the Class of 2011 in Rhode Island had debt; only seven other states have a higher percentage of students who owed money. 
When we heard back from Raimondo's office, she acknowledged the error. 
Said spokeswoman Joy Fox, ""Although the Treasurer and her husband personally came out of college with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt, she misspoke by saying this was the average amount of student loan debt. According to the Project on Student Debt, the average debt is more in the range of tens of thousands."" 
We rate Raimondo's claim False.

Distance between Deal, Reed can be measured in steps
","
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal have become something of a team, delivering a one-two punch for various economic development projects in Georgia, including metro Atlanta. 
Although the two line up on opposite sides of the political aisle, they have managed to put the D and R aside to work together on getting funding for Georgia ports, get a new football stadium built and get Porsche to move its North American headquarters close to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. 
The relationship has caught the eye of politicos far and near as an example of how leadership should work. 
But that hasn’t always been the case. And Reed noted this last month during the Governing Georgia Leadership Forum in downtown Atlanta. 
""My office is about a 300-step walk to the governor's office,"" Reed said. ""But you would have thought previously that walk was a 10k."" 
PolitiFact Georgia is always looking for an opportunity for a little fun and exercise. So we grabbed our pedometer and set out for a walk. 
At the Leadership Forum, Reed and Deal were co-presenters for a 30-minute session titled ""Shared Fortunes -- Building a Better Georgia."" 
The description of the discussion said: ""the state's governor, a Republican, and the mayor of its largest city, a Democrat, discuss how they are working together to advance a common agenda."" 
And to work together you have to be together. And being together includes office visits, so we set out to check the distance between them. 
Not depending on our math alone, we got out a pedometer for a more accurate step count. We walked the path from Reed’s office in Atlanta City Hall to Deal’s office on the main floor of the Georgia State Capitol, and back again, twice. 
We began walking at a normal pace. But the mayor stands at 6 feet, a full six inches taller than this PolitiFact Georgia reporter, so we extended our stride a bit. 
Our calculations found that Reed was correct. The distance from the governor’s office to the first step outside City Hall was 300 steps. Throw in the distance from the outside City Hall steps to Reed’s actual office and the step count increases between 65 and 100 steps, depending on the route through the lobby, whether you take a short ramp or the few steps up to the main office level, and stride of the walker. 
To sum up, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said his office was about 300 steps from Gov. Nathan Deal’s office. Walking the path that the mayor is likely to take, it is 300 steps from Deal’s office to the bottom of the first step of Atlanta City Hall, where Reed’s office is located. Walking all the way to the receptionist that sits just outside the mayor’s office adds additional steps, based on our calculations, which could make the mayor’s claim off by about one-third. 
Reed’s overall point was that the political divide between he and Deal has closed. Based on their history of delivering economic development projects for the city and state, that statement is correct. 
But the mayor is off just a bit on his distance claim if you take his statement literally.

Is Barack Obama trying to 'pack' the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals?
","
In the Rose Garden on June 4, 2013, President Barack Obama named three nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a pivotal moment in a long-simmering partisan fight over the nation’s second-most influential court. 
That prompted Republican lawmakers to sharpen their rhetoric, accusing Obama of trying to ""pack"" the court -- a phrase that invokes the 1937 proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to increase the size of the Supreme Court by as many as five justices. 
It’s no small charge: FDR’s scheme was seen, then and now, as a naked power grab. By proposing to sidestep a court that had blocked much of his New Deal agenda, Roosevelt alienated many Americans, and the plan ended up in history’s dustbin. 
Court packing ""had always had a bad name, but Roosevelt’s proposal was such a fiasco that no subsequent president has even seen it as an option open to them,"" said Jeff Shesol, author of Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. The Supreme Court and a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. 
Several senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have recently made the ""packing"" charge. 
In a May 16 hearing, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, used a variation of the word ""pack"" no fewer than six times. He repeated the charge in a news release on the eve of Obama’s announcement: ""It’s hard to imagine the rationale for nominating three judges at once for this court given the many vacant emergency seats across the country, unless your goal is to pack the court to advance a certain policy agenda."" 
Superficially, Obama’s actions don’t seem to mirror FDR’s, since Obama is seeking to fill existing vacancies, rather than creating new seats he can fill. But do the Republicans have a point? 
What’s the definition of ""court packing""? 
Most historians and legal scholars offer similar definitions of ""court packing."" 
Burt Solomon, author of FDR v. The Constitution: The Court-Packing Fight and the Triumph of Democracy, called it an effort to ""expand the size of the court"" to stack it with supporters. Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, agreed, saying it ""indicates a departure from the ordinary process."" (Roosevelt is the great-great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt and a distant relative of FDR.) 
And Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, called it a ""manipulation of court membership to achieve certain substantive results in cases the court will decide."" 
Historical examples of court packing 
The highest-profile examples have come at the Supreme Court level. 
The Constitution doesn’t specify the number of Supreme Court seats. Starting at six in 1789, it briefly fell to five in 1801 before returning to six in 1802. It rose to seven in 1807 and nine in 1837. It rose to 10 in 1863, then shrunk to seven in 1866 before stabilizing at nine in 1869. 
These changes weren’t necessarily nefarious. Initially, the nation was growing geographically, which required more justices, and the increase in 1863 can be explained by the Civil War, which left the court with several justices from states in rebellion. 
We found three pretty clear historical examples in which one branch of government sought to change the makeup of the courts for political reasons. 
• The ""midnight judges."" In 1801, following a contentious election, the lame-duck Federalist administration of President John Adams sought to stymie the incoming Democratic-Republicans of President Thomas Jefferson by adding six new federal circuits with 16 judges, all appointed by Adams. The last-minute appointees came to be known as ""midnight judges."" The Jeffersonians sought to abolish the new courts, and in 1803, the Supreme Court upheld their right to do so in Stuart vs. Laird. 
• The post-Civil War era. After President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, a southerner, Andrew Johnson, was elevated to president. After clashing with the Republicans who controlled Congress, they shrunk the Supreme Court from 10 seats to seven, effectively denying Johnson any appointments. After Johnson was succeeded by victorious Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Congress restored the Supreme Court to nine justices. It has not varied since. 
• The third example, as we’ve noted, is Roosevelt’s doomed 1937 proposal. 
The Republicans’ arguments 
A spokeswoman for Grassley argued that, ""just as FDR did, Obama is trying to influence the courts because neither president liked being overturned. The president and Senate Democrats have made that clear in their comments."" 
Republican lawmakers make two main arguments. 
• The court is under-worked, so Obama is trying to fill unneeded seats with Democrats. ""It is evident that the D.C. Circuit is the least busy court"" in the nation, Grassley said at the May 16 hearing. ""In fact, it ranks last or almost last in nearly every category that measures the workload of the courts."" 
In fact, Grassley has introduced the Court Efficiency Act of 2013, which would, among other things, reduce the number of D.C. Circuit judges from 11 to eight. 
Grassley’s proposal is ""understandable,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a legal scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The court isn’t overworked, the openings are there because of filibusters of Bush nominees, and Obama’s had five years to nominate people and hasn’t,"" he said. ""There are lots of overworked courts out there to which these three slots could go, but he wouldn’t be making it if Obama weren’t making his political play."" 
• Senate Democrats are threatening a structural change that would affect judicial nominations. In the Senate, a single lawmaker can hold up Senate business unless supporters can muster a 60-vote majority. Over the years, due to actions by senators from both parties, such blocking tactics have become increasingly common. 
Frustrated by this trend, recent Senate majorities from both parties have considered invoking the ""nuclear option"" -- a procedural move that would allow a minority blockage to be overcome with just 51 votes. 
In 2005, a bipartisan group of 14 senators successfully headed off a Republican attempt to invoke the nuclear option by pledging not to support judicial filibusters. Now, the tables have turned: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. has threatened the nuclear option to combat Republican opposition to Obama’s nominees. 
The Democrats’ arguments 
Democrats challenge both arguments. In his Rose Garden announcement, Obama cited an April report by the Judicial Conference of the United States, a nonpartisan body headed by Chief Justice John Roberts, which told Congress that the circuit should remain at 11 judges. Court observers add that caseload counts don’t account for the complexity of the circuit’s cases. 
Meanwhile, Democrats say they have been driven to consider the nuclear option by strenuous GOP obstructionism. Obama said on June 4 that his judicial nominees ""have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor"" and added that he had to withdraw the nomination of Caitlin Halligan for a D.C. Circuit vacancy earlier this year after waiting fruitlessly for confirmation since September 2010. 
""I recognize that neither party has a perfect track record here,"" Obama said. But calling the present deadlock ""unprecedented,"" he added, ""For the good of the American people, it has to stop."" 
Who has the better of the arguments? 
Our experts agreed that Obama is trying to put his imprint on the court -- but they said he’s doing so within the bounds of his constitutional duty to fill court vacancies. Ironically, the experts said, Grassley’s bill comes closer to the kind of structural meddling typical of court packing than does Obama’s approach, even if Grassley’s bill would result in a shrinkage. 
The experts agreed with Grassley that judicial resources could be better allocated, but they added that this question is better addressed by a more politically insulated entity such as the Judicial Conference of the United States. 
Arguing for efficiency wasn’t enough to shield FDR from backlash, Shesol said. ""Everybody knew the game,"" Shesol said. ""The fact that he was dishonest about it was what really hurt him."" 
The nuclear option would be a structural change, but one focused more narrowly on one branch’s procedures. This keeps the argument from being a slam dunk -- and it hasn’t happened yet 
""If the Democrats eliminate the filibuster, I would call that hardball,"" Roosevelt said. ""But it’s a change to the Senate rules, so it’s not an attack on the integrity and independence of the judiciary in the way that court-packing is. It’s also something that the other side can benefit from later, which neither packing nor shrinking really is."" 
Our ruling 
The claim that Obama is ""packing"" the D.C. Circuit Court largely runs counter to American legal and political history. 
Genuine court packing has involved one branch of government proposing to change the structure of the courts, either expanding or decreasing the number of judges. That's not what Obama's doing.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/05/chuck-grassley/barack-obama-trying-pack-dc-circuit-court-appeals/

Ohio honors citizens who give their lives in military service for their country with the Ohio Military Medal of Distinction.

The medals are presented to family members of fallen service members during a joint session of the General Assembly. The day also includes a memorial program that includes remarks from the governor and a wreath laying ceremony.

On May 21, 2013, the General Assembly presented medals to families of 16 fallen service members.

In his remarks, Senate President Keith Faber noted that Ohioans have always served on the front lines ""to preserve and protect our freedoms.""

He particularly noted Ohio’s service during the American Civil War.
""During the Civil War, more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Union Army, more per capita than any other state.""

PolitiFact Ohio knew that Ohio has a deep history of service in the Civil War, and asked Faber for support of his claim.

His staff referred us to data from the Ohio Historical Society, a nonprofit organization, partially funded by the state, that champions and preserves Ohio history. It maintains, by law, the state archives of Ohio.

As part of its commemoration of the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, the historical society published an article that discussed Ohio’s war effort.

""Although most of the American Civil War was fought outside of Ohio’s borders, the Buckeye State played a huge role in determining the outcome,"" the article notes. ""Between 319,000 and 330,000 Ohioans served in the Northern army for varying lengths of time.""

The level of recruits, according to the Historical Society, was more per capita than any other state.

""Three out of every five Ohio men between the ages of 18 and 45 served at various times in the Union Army and Navy during the Civil War. Ohio men fought in every major battle of the war.""

In all, almost 3 million men served in the Union army during what remains the bloodiest military conflict in American history, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History. Nearly 360,000 federal troops were killed during the war. About 160,000 Confederate soldiers perished.

NRA founded to fight KKK, black leader says
","
On May 28, 2013, the Republican Party of Milwaukee County posted on its website a video that has been popping up elsewhere on the Internet. 
The video features African-American leaders speaking out against proposals to restrict gun rights at a Feb. 22, 2013 news conference in Washington, D.C. Among them: Harry Alford, president and chief executive officer of the D.C.-based National Black Chamber of Commerce. 
Alford, who spoke in Milwaukee in 2008, said at one point: 
""I want to thank the Lord for our Constitution. I also want to thank the NRA for its legacy. The National Rifle Association was started, founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan."" 
Well known as a defender of the right to bear arms, the 5 million-member NRA does describe itself as ""America's longest-standing civil rights organization."" 
But is that why it was founded? 
Not even close. 
What the NRA says 
Here’s what the NRA says on its website about its founding: 
Dismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to ""promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,"" according to a magazine editorial written by Church. 
After being granted a charter by the State of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA's first president. 
An important facet of the NRA's creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York State, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held. 
No mention of religious leaders, slaves or the KKK. 
Brief histories of the NRA by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post contain no such mentions, either. We called and emailed the NRA to inquire about Alford’s claim, but the group offered no response. (Milwaukee County Republican Party chairman David Karst told us he wasn’t sure why the party posted the video on its website.) 
Alford’s evidence 
Alford’s wife, National Black Chamber of Commerce executive vice president Kay DeBow Alford, provided us three articles to back her husband’s claim. 
But none of them do.

PolicyMic.com: A January 2013 article on PolicyMic.com, which describes itself as a platform to ""engage millennials in debates about real issues,"" notes that the NRA founders started the group because of the Union soldiers’ poor marksmanship and it calls the NRA the oldest civil rights organization in the United States. 
No mention of religious leaders founding the NRA to protect freed slaves from the KKK. 
2. Ann Coulter: In an April 2012 opinion column, conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter said that when civil rights leader Robert F. Williams returned home to Monroe, N.C., after serving in World War II, the Ku Klux Klan was ""beating, lynching and murdering blacks at will."" 
In 1957, Williams got a charter from the NRA, founded the Black Armed Guard and repeatedly thwarted KKK attacks, Coulter wrote. She didn't say whether the NRA played a role in the guard's fighting the Klan. 
Again, no reference to religious leaders or slaves. And the fighting against the KKK -- whether it involved the NRA or not -- would have occurred more than 85 years after the NRA’s founding. 
3. Psychology professor’s article: A January 2013 article by psychology professor Warren Throckmorton of Grove City College in Grove City, Pa., not only doesn’t support Alford’s claim, it disputes it. 
Throckmorton noted that the NRA’s website makes no mention of the KKK or getting guns in the hands of newly freed slaves. He said he found no evidence in the early charter of the NRA, or the biographies of the founders, either. 
Other evidence 
So, even tangentially, is there anything to Alford’s statement? 
Two historians -- Jerald Podair of Lawrence University in Wisconsin and Kenneth Janken of the University of North Carolina -- said there is no evidence to support the statement. 
But, as an aside, here’s more information on Coulter's reference to Williams, the civil rights leader, and the KKK in North Carolina. It’s from the University of Florida-produced documentary ""Negroes with Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power"": 
In 1956, Williams took over leadership of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was close to disbanding due to the Ku Klux Klan. Williams filed for a charter from the NRA and formed the Black Guard, an armed group committed to the protection of blacks. 
It's unclear, however, whether the NRA provided any assistance, based on what Williams' widow, Mabel, said in a University of North Carolina oral history interview. 
Mabel Williams said her husband altered the occupations of the members when applying for the NRA charter. ""I'm sure when we joined and the years after then, had they known we were a black group, they would have revoked our charter,"" she said. 
Our rating 
Harry Alford, the head of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, said the National Rifle Association was ""founded by religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan."" 
We can’t say whether he was misinformed or intended to mislead. But the NRA itself says the group was formed by Union Civil War veterans to improve soldiers’ marksmanship. And we found no evidence that religious leaders founded the NRA to protect freed slaves from the KKK. 
The claim is not only inaccurate but ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/jun/05/harry-alford/nra-founded-fight-kkk-black-leader-says/

Derek Ryan says first 8 chosen to draw Austin City Council districts are 7 Democratic primary voters, 1 GOP primary voter
","
When Austin announced the first members of a commission that will draw new City Council districts, Republican political consultant Derek Ryan offered quick analysis. 
Eight names were drawn May 22, 2013, and within a couple of hours Ryan, a voter data specialist and former research director for the state Republican party, tweeted, ""Seven are D primary voters, only one has voted in an R primary."" 
Some might think that 88 percent Democratic sounds about right for Austin, the ""blueberry in the tomato soup"" of Texas politics. In fact, 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin voted exclusively in Democratic primaries from 2006 through 2012, with 22 percent participating exclusively in Republican primaries, according to numbers that Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin ran for us. 
Voting in a primary election doesn’t necessarily prove someone’s political lean, though in Texas it’s the closest signal available from voting records. Texans do not register to vote by party affiliation; anyone can vote in either primary, even switching from election year to election year. 
In Austin, where many down-ticket races field no Republican opposition, sometimes the only way a voter can affect the outcome is by choosing between Democratic candidates in the primary. In the same way, it often makes sense for voters in, say, Midland, to commit to the county’s Republican primary. 
Council races in Austin are nonpartisan, and while city ordinance says the commission should have ""diversity by race, ethnicity, gender and geography,"" it doesn’t specify any restrictions on members’ politics. But we looked into whether Ryan got the commission members’ votes right. 
In November 2012, Austinites voted to switch the council from seven citywide members to 10 district representatives and a mayor, starting with the November 2014 election. 
Some 550 people applied to be on the 14-member commission that will draw the new districts’ maps by Dec. 1, 2013. A panel narrowed the pool to 60 finalists, then city staffers drew names at random, according to the city’s website. The new members will choose six more from the pool of finalists to round out the group. 
Ryan told us by email, ""When the eight were announced, I did a quick check on those individuals,"" looking at records from the 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 primaries. Afterward, he said, he got curious about the other eligible applicants and calculated that 55 percent voted in the 2012 Democratic primary and 24 percent voted in the Republican primary. 
He started his research, Ryan said, with information from the commission applications the city posted online. Then he matched each applicant’s information to his own voter database, which he said he compiled from information kept by county clerks’ offices and the Texas secretary of state, the state’s chief elections officer. 
The applicants whose names were drawn for the commission were Magdalena Blanco, Mariano Díaz-Miranda, Rachel Farris, Phil Hewitt, Carmen Llanes Pulido, Art Lopez, Anna Saenz and Maria Solis. 
All except Llanes Pulido were registered Travis County voters from 2006 through 2012; according to Smith’s records, Llanes Pulido was registered in Travis from 2007 through 2012. If she voted in the 2006 primary somewhere else, Smith said, it probably was not in Texas, because his records showed no voting history for her before the 2007 general election. 
At our request, Travis County Tax Office spokeswoman Tiffany Seward looked up each new commission member’s 2006-2012 primary voting record and emailed us the results.

We sought to speak with all eight for their views and reached everyone but Saenz, although Blanco, Farris, Hewitt and Lopez declined to comment. Farris, incidentally, writes the MeanRachel.com blog, where she is identified as a Democratic activist who also writes for the Huffington Post. 
Three commissioners who voted in the latest three Democratic primaries said by telephone that voting records did not tell the whole story and party politics won’t bear on the commission’s job. 
Llanes Pulido told us, ""I consider myself politically independent; I do not consider myself a Democrat."" She dislikes how primaries cause voters to identify themselves with a party, she said, and as an elections judge had asked voters, ""In which primary would you like to participate?"" rather than ""Are you a Democrat or a Republican?"" Party leanings are not germane, she said, ""because the Austin City Council is a nonpartisan council and the elections are nonpartisan elections."" 
Díaz-Miranda said Ryan’s tweet wasn’t relevant. ""The job we’re doing is to try to bring more people to feel represented,"" he said. He considers himself independent, he told us. ""I’ve also voted Republican here,"" he said; as an example, he said, he voted for Terry Keel for Travis County sheriff (a post Keel held from 1992 to 1997 before serving as a Republican state representative from Austin). 
Solis said, ""I’m not going to give you an opinion about my politics because that’s not what this is about. … I think I’m a well-informed, balanced person that will vote on what we’re supposed to be doing and not on my party preference."" The commission’s job, she said, is to give voters representation that is ""hopefully more within their own area, and hopefully they will know the people that they are voting for."" 
Our ruling 
Ryan said the first choices to draw Austin’s council districts are seven Democratic primary voters and one GOP primary voter. 
Records show that six of the eight members voted in the three Travis County Democratic primaries from 2008 through 2012, and two of the six also voted in the county’s 2006 Democratic primary. One commissioner voted in the 2008 Democratic primary and didn’t vote in any others. One voted in two Democratic primaries and two Republican primaries since 2006. 
We rate his statement as True. 
  
CLARIFICATION, 11:30 am, June 5, 2013: We revised this story to clarify that 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin cast ballots exclusively in Democratic primaries. The original version said 70 percent of Austinites had recently voted exclusively in those primaries. This revision did not affect our rating of the claim.",/factchecks/2013/jun/04/derek-ryan/derek-ryan-says-first-8-chosen-draw-austin-city-co/

Democrats say Republicans ‘doctored emails’ about Benghazi, ‘trying to pass them off as real’
","
The president’s political opponents have ""been caught red-handed"" making up ""so-called ‘scandals,’"" Democrats recently told supporters in an email blast. 
Congressional Republicans have stirred up ""false rumors of vast ‘cover-ups’ happening in the White House"" about attacks in Benghazi, Libya — and even altered the evidence, Democrats claimed. 
""Republicans actually doctored emails between administration officials about Benghazi,"" said the message from Brad Woodhouse, communications director for the Democratic National Committee. ""Then, they released them to the press, trying to pass them off as real in order to create their scandal."" 
Partisans creating counterfeit White House emails seemed like a serious charge to us. It also struck us as an exaggeration. We wanted to know: What’s the evidence for their claim that Republicans doctored the evidence? 
Tale of the talking points 
The emails in question trace the back-and-forth between the CIA, FBI, State Department and White House that resulted in controversial talking points used to explain the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi. 
Those talking points were used most infamously by Susan Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday talk shows several days after the attacks. (In the resulting Republican uproar, she gave up her bid to be the next secretary of state.) 
Early drafts of the CIA talking points made references to terrorist groups, saying ""we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaida participated in the attack."" But in 12 rounds of edits of the talking points, that reference disappeared. 
Instead, Rice told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sept. 16, 2012: 
""I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine."" 
Republicans argued this was evidence the White House interfered, attempting to downplay a terrorist attack before the election. 
The White House said the gap between early and late versions of the talking points could be chalked up entirely to the best assessment of the ""intelligence community"" — in other words, political concerns of the State Department or White House had nothing to do with it. 
White House press secretary Jay Carney went so far as to claim in November that the ""single adjustment"" by the White House and State Department was to change the word ""consulate"" to ""diplomatic facility."" 
Republican Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte wanted to see the evidence. 
In January, they asked: Why had the administration refused to provide the full text of emails that would explain the deletion of references to al-Qaida and terrorism? 
Lawmakers got a peek at the messages. 
But the email exchange otherwise generally stayed under wraps — until some details appeared in an April 2013 report from House Republicans, then in May articles from the Weekly Standard, ABC News and others. 
They made Carney’s comments look entirely misleading: It turned out a State Department spokeswoman had raised ""serious concerns"" about the CIA talking points, and the White House had to play mediator — a bigger role for either of them than he had suggested. 
Shortly after the news reports, which relied on leaks of messages that weren’t yet public, the White House released 100 pages of back-and-forth between officials. 
And something else interesting emerged. 
While a State Department spokeswoman had weighed in on the CIA talking points, contrary to Carney’s suggestion, the early news reports that relied on leaks had inaccurately characterized a message from the White House. ABC News, for example, used a direct quote from a White House adviser that differed from the actual email text. 
The difference mattered: In the early reports, it looked like the White House was piping up in support of the State Department, which better served Republicans’ arguments that the White House was involved in a political coverup. The actual email looked like an even-handed attempt to resolve issues between the agencies. 
In news reports, the message from Ben Rhodes, then a deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, included a direct mention of the State Department. 
""We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don’t want to undermine the FBI investigation,"" ABC News reported he had written, according to CNN. 
But Rhodes’ email had actually said to the group, ""We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation."" 
He didn’t, in fact, single out the State Department. 
What happened?  
The Democrats’ explanation: Republicans doctored the emails! 
But explanations from ABC News and the author of the Weekly Standard piece, Stephen Hayes, tell a somewhat different story. 
Hayes explained to the Washington Post’s Fact Checker that someone provided him with ""summaries"" of email messages — not altered versions of emails. 
""I didn’t speak to anyone who represented the email summaries as direct quotes,"" Hayes told the Post. 
ABC News added an editor’s note to its story that it ""should have been more precise in its sourcing of those quotes, attributing them to handwritten copies of the emails taken by a congressional source. We regret that error."" Reporter Jonathan Karl said in an update that his source took notes on a long chain of emails that included references to the State Department, so the notes reflected that. 
""Summaries"" and ""handwritten copies of emails"" are a bit different from ""doctored"" emails — wording that creates the impression of electronic fakery. 
Meanwhile, one detailed account of the email leak, from TPMDC, says that whomever shared the notes was ""presumably a Republican."" 
In other words, the leaker hasn’t been named. 
Woodhouse didn’t share evidence with us — or claim to know — exactly who leaked details from the emails. Nor could he prove that the source deliberately altered his or her notes to create a false impression, then lied to reporters. 
Our ruling 
The Democratic National Committee claimed to its supporters that ""Republicans actually doctored emails between administration officials about Benghazi. Then, they released them to the press, trying to pass them off as real."" 
But when we asked, Democrats didn’t provide evidence that discrepancies resulted from anything more than sloppy note-taking, or that journalists had been snookered into believing they had seen the original messages. 
ABC News, in fact, took responsibility for imprecision in its story. Hayes of the Weekly Standard says no one tried to misrepresent summaries that were leaked to him as actual emails. 
It’s certainly possible the leaker’s inaccurate notes were intended to deceive. But Democrats have failed to prove that’s the case. Their claim about doctoring evidence could use some evidence. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/04/democratic-national-committee/democrats-say-republicans-doctored-emails-about-be/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
GOP group targets Barrow's health care votes
","
U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from the Augusta area, keeps arguing he agrees with many Republicans regarding the federal health care law, aka ""Obamacare."" 
Repeal and replace, he says. 
Is there a doctor around to examine Barrow? Republican activists ask. 
Republicans overwhelmingly want the entire law repealed, polls show. Barrow’s position is not strong enough, some GOP activists say. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee recently announced it was paying for mobile billboards to drive through Barrow’s district to criticize what it says is his approach to health care. 
""Congressman Barrow’s Plan: Put the IRS in charge of your health care,"" the ad says. 
The ad includes a telephone number for anyone ""fed up"" with his plan. The ad quickly made the rounds on several political news sites, including The Atlanta Journal Constitution’s Political Insider blog. 
PolitiFact Georgia recently fact-checked a somewhat similar claim by the National Republican Senatorial Committee against Barrow and rated it Mostly False. We wanted to find out if the NRCC accurately reflected Barrow’s stance on this issue. 
NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill said the billboard was based on Barrow’s votes against repealing the health care law. 
""The IRS is in charge of implementing Obamacare,"" Prill said in one email. 
The IRS, under fire for its role in scrutinizing some tea party groups and others, is in charge of determining whether individuals have insurance and collecting fines. The Washington Post Fact Checker column recently examined this issue and determined the NRCC claim deserved two Pinocchios, which means there were significant exaggerations or omissions. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, are also involved in implementation of the law. Health and Human Services has taken the lead in organizing its implementation, providing information to the public about the law and providing oversight. 
Barrow, who fashions himself as a moderate, is consistently one of the top Republican targets during election season. He’s the last white Democrat serving in the U.S. House from the Deep South. The five-term congressman has thus far successfully avoided GOP efforts to oust him. 
Barrow’s camp says the claim is specious for several reasons. First, they note the congressman voted in 2010 against the legislation to create the contentious health care law. 
Second, his office says Barrow’s approach to the law is similar to that of many Republicans. He wants to repeal some of the most controversial aspects of the law and keep some elements of it. 
Barrow wants to remove: 
The Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers. 
The individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty. 
An employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees. 
The congressman wants to keep the provision that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26 years old. 
Third, and most pertinent to the NRCC’s claim, Barrow voted against legislation in April 2011 that would fund as many as 16,500 IRS employees House Republicans said were needed to implement the health care law. 
""Further proof that the NRCC is twisting the facts and exaggerating to make their claims,"" said Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo. 
Prill pointed out that Barrow voted three times against repealing the law, most recently in May 2013 in a 229-195 vote. Every House Republican voted to repeal the law while only two Democrats voted in favor of repeal. The Democratic-led U.S. Senate has not supported repeal. 
Barrow’s votes on portions of the health care law have been across the spectrum. 
""There are a lot of good things in the bill. I don’t believe in voting against the parts that are good. ... We need to amend it, not end it,"" Barrow said after his vote in January 2011 to retain the law. 
Prill said Barrow’s position is insufficient. 
""At the end of the day, John Barrow had the opportunity to repeal this law and he chose not to. Whether it was political pressure from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi or because he truly believes in this law, he made the decision to keep Obamacare in place and for it on Georgia families. It seems like if John Barrow really wanted to fix our health care system, he would have voted for repeal."" 
To sum up, the NRCC says in its mobile billboard that Barrow’s health care plan ""puts the IRS in charge of your health care."" Barrow didn’t vote to create the federal health care law. However, the NRCC points out that Barrow’s voted three times against repealing Obamacare, which they say is allowing the law to be implemented. Barrow supports repealing some of the most contentious parts of the law. 
Barrow’s camp says what’s most important in this debate is the congressman voted against legislation that would fund additional IRS agents to implement the health care law. The billboards, they say, are disingenuous. It’s not really his plan. The IRS will be involved in the implementation of the law, but so, too, will other federal agencies. 
We believe the billboards omit some important context. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jun/04/national-republican-congressional-committee/gop-group-targets-barrows-health-care-votes/

Karl Rove says Republicans running in Texas draw 40 percent of Latino vote on average
 ","Republican consultant Karl Rove thinks Georgia Republicans need to stump more like their Texas counterparts. In a May 18, 2013, speech at Georgia’s GOP state convention, Rove said Republicans have ""got to get outside of our comfort zone and go places Republicans are not comfortable going,"" according to a transcript provided to us by Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Daniel Malloy. ""And we’ve got to get candidates who represent the diversity of our country,"" Rove said. ""Look, in Texas we get 40 percent of the Latino vote on average,"" Rove said. ""And that’s because every Republican is comfortable campaigning everywhere in Texas and because we go out of our way to recruit qualified Latino candidates and run them for office."" Nationally in 2012, Barack Obama defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney while enjoying substantial Latino support. Some 71 percent of Hispanic voters favored Obama, compared to 27 percent for Romney, according to voter exit polls undertaken for a consortium of news organizations. A Nov. 9, 2012, CNN news article quoted Republican strategist Ana Navarro, formerly a national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, as saying: ""If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever."" We wondered about Rove’s 40-percent-in-Texas claim. Rove, best known for guiding George W. Bush to two wins for governor of Texas and two more for president, declined to elaborate. Polling in 2012 Meantime, we noticed Texas Gov. Rick Perry earlier airing a similar claim, telling Politico for a Nov. 30, 2012, news article that about 40 percent of his state’s Hispanic voters had supported Bush for president and ""me when I ran"" for re-election as governor ""in 2010."" Also, Mike Baselice, an Austin pollster who has counseled Perry and numerous Republican candidates, said in an October 2012 memo based on his firm’s Oct. 10-14, 2012, survey of 851 likely Texas voters that at that time, Obama had the support of 49 percent of the state’s Hispanic voters, with Romney at 40 percent. According to Baselice’s memo, Republican U.S. Senate nominee Ted Cruz was supported by 36 percent of Hispanic voters, while Democrat Paul Sadler had 40 percent. The Politico story also mentioned a Texas poll taken on the eve of the 2012 elections indicating Cruz had 35 percent of the state’s Hispanic vote, outpacing Romney, who had 29 percent. The poll by Latino Decisions, a Seattle-based firm that specializes in Latino political opinion research, was based on 400 telephone interviews with Texas Latinos who had voted or were certain to vote. Its margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points suggests that Cruz, but not Romney, was on the verge of drawing 40 percent of the Latino vote. We also talked to Steve Munisteri, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, who said by phone that in December 2012, Wilson Perkins Allen Research polled 600 Latino Texas voters who participated in the 2012 elections. According to that research, conducted for the party and Republican officeholders, the party’s candidates at the top of the ticket drew more than 40 percent of the state’s Hispanic vote, Munisteri said, with statewide hopefuls farther down the ballot drawing about 35 percent. James Henson, director of the Politics Project in the Department of Government at the University of Texas, struck a cautionary note as we explored Rove’s claim. Any look at how Latino voters divide relies on extrapolation, Henson reminded by email, ""since there is no direct measure for Latino voting."" Besides, polls can be flawed, Democratic consultant James Aldrete of Austin said by telephone, sometimes under-sampling Hispanic voters or failing to query voters who wish to be interviewed in Spanish. Sylvia Manzano of Houston, an analyst for Latino Decisions, said by telephone that most polls of Texas Latinos fall short of achieving representative samples by concentrating, she said, on pockets of the state. She pointed out an October 2012 Latino Decisions blog post covering polling weaknesses in surveys taken before the 2012 elections. Manzano said she would take Rove’s 40 percent claim with a grain of salt, though she also said ""Latinos in Texas have not been averse to voting for Republicans"" partly because the state’s Republican Party has not been hostile. Texas polls since 2000 Kind of like stacking grains of salt, we focused on Texas Latino voters by reviewing more than a dozen poll results, covering seven elections from 2000 through 2012, as posted publicly or described to us by pollsters or partisans (see summary table below). Upshot: The best a Republican fared with Texas Hispanics in the elections was U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison when she drew half the Hispanic vote in 2000, by one analysis. The same year, Bush got 49 percent in his first run for president, according to that year’s exit polls taken for news organizations, or 33 percent, according to a poll by the William C. Velásquez Institute. Bush also drew 49 percent in 2004, according to the national exit poll. Joe Lenski, an executive with Edison Research, which oversaw the exit polling, told us by phone the margin of error on Bush’s share of the Latino vote in his home state was plus or minus seven percentage points. By our look, the worst any Republican fared among Texas Hispanics was Romney’s election-eve 29 percent, according to the Latino Decisions poll. We set aside as an outlier Perry’s 31 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2006, considering Perry faced three major November foes, a Democrat and two independents.The same year in a more conventional race, Hutchison drew 44 percent of the Latino vote, according to that year’s exit poll. Considering every result except the one for Perry in 2006 delivers an average of 39 percent of the Hispanic vote for Republicans at or near the top of the tickets. We also averaged the poll showings for each election year, reaching an across-the-years average of 40 percent. Trying another tack, we counted only the polled results for non-presidential candidates, also landing at 40 percent. Three border counties Next, we looked at how Republicans running statewide fared in 2010 and 2012 in traditionally Democratic and Latino-rich Cameron, Hidalgo and El Paso counties, which are on the Texas-Mexico border Drawing on results posted online by the state, we found that in 2010, Attorney General Greg Abbott outpaced nine other GOP statewide winners, drawing 38 percent of the vote in Hidalgo County; 42 percent in El Paso County; and 48 percent in Cameron County. All the candidates together averaged 42 percent of the vote in Cameron County, 39 percent in El Paso County and 33 percent in Hidalgo County. Aside from the presidential race, the 2012 Texas ballot had four statewide races pitting Republicans against Democrats. Cruz topped other GOP victors with 36 percent of El Paso County’s vote. Counting Romney, the GOP nominees carried an average of 27 percent of El Paso County’s vote; 28 percent in Hidalgo County; and 32 percent in Cameron County. Wider views Broadly, Aldrete suggested that since Republican divisions over immigration policy stirred many Latinos starting in 2006, Texas Republicans have experienced slippage among Hispanic voters, like Republicans nationally, he said. So we checked the average result across the available polls for Texas Republicans from 2008 through 2012: 37 percent. By telephone, Baselice offered his historical perspective, saying that in 1982, in an era when Democrats usually won statewide elections, Texas Republicans seeking statewide office drew 12.5 percent of the Hispanic vote. Their share of the Hispanic vote in 1992 was 25 percent, Baselice said, and he then advised Rove that Bush would need 30 percent of the Hispanic vote to defeat Democratic Gov. Ann Richards in 1994. Fast forward: In 2002, Baselice said, Perry carried 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in his first win for governor, and in 2010, he said, Perry got 36 percent of the Hispanic vote. The news organizations’ exit poll that November found Perry getting 38 percent of the Hispanic vote. The same year, Baselice said, David Dewhurst, the Republican re-elected lieutenant governor, drew 40 percent of the Hispanic vote while carrying 62 percent of the total vote. ""You don’t get to the mid-60s"" in overall percentage, Baselice said, ""without getting a significant chunk of the Hispanic vote."" By email, New York pollster Micheline Blum, whose clients have included newspapers including the Austin American-Statesman, said by email: ""While the majority of Latinos vote for Democrats in Texas as in other states, the Republican candidates for president and for governor have been averaging approximately 40"" percent of the Texas Latino vote. ""Candidates cannot afford to ignore the Latino vote in Texas—and they don’t,"" Blum wrote. ""Also, Texas is more conservative than the country as a whole and Latino voters in Texas are a bit more conservative than in the country overall as well."" Our ruling Rove said Republican candidates in Texas draw 40 percent of the Hispanic vote on average. That claim holds up if you consider the limited array of public polls going back back to 2000, though polls taken in connection with the latest elections suggest not every Republican draws 40 percent. Perhaps there has been slippage since the immigration debate roiled anew and Bush stopped appearing on the ballot. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

Rick Scott claims 24 tax cuts for Florida since 2011
","
How many times did Gov. Rick Scott cut taxes? You better believe the unpopular Republican running for a second term is counting the ways. 
""Twenty-four times,"" Scott said last month after signing the state’s $71.1 billion budget. 
The claim certainly got our attention at PolitiFact Florida. Could Scott and the Legislature have enacted two dozen different tax cuts in just three budget years, two of which were hamstrung by billion-dollar budget shortfalls? We turned to the Truth-O-Meter to sort it out. 
What Scott counts 
Defining a ""tax cut"" can be difficult. To Scott, it means anything that reduced government revenue by $3 million in any given year. 
So, for instance, a three-day sales tax holiday is a tax cut in Scott’s mind. And because it’s been in the budget the past three years, it’s counted as three tax cuts. (Actually, Scott says it’s four. More on that later.) Other ""tax cuts"" are really reductions in automatic fee increases or tax credits, and several are temporary. 
We’ll discuss whether they can be considered tax cuts in a moment. First, let’s go through Scott’s list. (His office actually provided 25, not 24.) 
1, 2.)  Unemployment compensation taxes:Lawmakers spared businesses from paying higher taxes in 2011 by reducing the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation. It saved businesses $124.5 million. 
The next year, the Legislature rolled back a tax increase businesses were supposed to pay. The change meant businesses still paid more than in previous years, but not as much as originally anticipated. The savings -- on paper -- to businesses: $830 million for tax years 2012 through 2014. 
3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: Scott signed an expansion of a sales tax exemption on machinery purchases in 2012, worth $56 million. In 2013, lawmakers eliminated the sales tax entirely, at least temporarily. The tax will be eliminated for three years starting in April 2014. Removing the sales tax, which faces constitutional questions, would cost the state $370 million and local governments $83 million through 2017. 
5.) Property taxes: In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections by about 30 percent, leading to about $210 million in savings for property owners. This resulted in modest property tax savings for most Floridians, except those in northwest Florida, whose district did not have to reduce its tax rate, according to a bill analysis. 
6, 7, 8, 9.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counts the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times. It applies to shoes and clothing (up to $75/item) and school supply purchases (up to $15). The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. 
The price tag is about $30 million to the state. The 2013 tax holiday (Aug. 2-4) counts twice, according to Scott, because it also exempts sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750. State economists expect Floridians to save $4.7 million. 
10, 11.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Per Scott’s wishes, the Legislature expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and again in 2012 to $50,000. The hit to the state budget for both is about $60 million a year, sparing thousands of businesses from paying the tax. (Scott wanted to eliminate this tax outright when he took office, but he has scaled back his approach to placate the Legislature.) 
12.) Tax credit scholarships: This expands a program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools. The trade-off results in a loss of $25 million in state revenue. 
13, 14, 15.) Energy breaks: One 2013 law implements part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a ""renewable energy source device,"" including windmills, solar panels and roof pools. The law may lead to local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017, according to state analysts. It will not go into effect until tax year 2014. 
Two other credits are in a 2012 bill, HB 7117, aimed at inspiring more renewable energy production in our natural gas-dependent state. These credits, which could help agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities, are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. The department has received five applications for the renewable energy production tax credit, but none has yet been issued. 
16, 17, 18, 19.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, the Legislature and Scott have done the following: 
Expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state ""new markets"" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill. ($12.9 million loss/year) 
Allowed certain companies, which spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13, to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes. ($7.5 million loss/year) 
Temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption lasts through June 30, 2014. ($4.4 million loss/year) 
Created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses of up to $9 million a year. 
20, 21, 22, 23, 24.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, worth $12.3 million. The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area ($3.5 million/year). 
They blocked an automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years. Eliminating the increase, which would have taken effect July 2013, cost the state $4.4 million for 2012-13. 
They tinkered with a formula for the tax owed by Floridians who sever phosphate rock to sell. To put it very simply, a wide-ranging 2012 law eliminates the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate for an annual cost of $12.6 million. 
A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law. ($3.8 million hit to local government/year.) 
25.) Communications dealers: HB 809 in 2012 spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction (local governments can add hikes to this tax on top of the state rate). The change will result in annual savings of about $4.7 million for the communications industry. 
True tax cuts? 
That’s the evidence. What to make of it? 
After speaking with experts and considering the evidence, we found numerous caveats -- some more noteworthy than others. 
Some cuts are temporary and others are very narrowly targeted. The three-day sales tax holiday counts four times on Scott’s list (Nos. 6-9). 
""Does it really count as a tax cut if you’ve been providing it since 1998?"" said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. 
Other cuts are not really cuts but credits, which mean you have to spend somewhere to save somewhere else. The energy legislation (No. 13) prevents property appraisers from raising someone’s property taxes for making energy-efficient home improvements. That’s not a cut in the literal sense. 
The break for communications dealers (No. 25) is not so much a tax cut as it is the removal of a penalty. 
And while changes in unemployment compensation rules save businesses money (No. 1), they also take money away from out-of-work Floridians. 
""It’s a tax cut for employers, but who’s really paying for it? Unemployed workers,"" said Karen Woodall, director of the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, pointing to a committee analysis. 
The elimination of the scheduled increase in license and registration fees for hunting and fishing (No. 22) is not a tax cut in the truest sense because it applies only to people using a certain service. 
""Americans don’t like the word ‘tax’,"" said Scott Drenkard, Tax Foundation economist at the Center for State Tax Policy. ""It’s a holdover from the Revolutionary War. The word ‘fee’ is a little bit more generous."" 
Readers may hear Scott’s statement and rush toward to their tax bills, eager to see all the ways it is reduced. But the truth is that most of the breaks are for business. 
""There is very little in that that provides some benefit to the average working person,"" said state Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach. 
Besides the caveats, there’s also another thing to consider: Are there places Floridians are being asked to pay more? 
Scott considers raising tuition a tax increase, which is why he vetoed a 3 percent increase in the 2013-14 budget. However, he signed an 8 percent tuition increase into law in 2011 and a 5 percent tuition increase for colleges in 2012. 
Another 2013 law will require state and local government to contribute $900 million in 2013-14 to the state retirement system. Local officials have already said they may have to increase taxes to cope with the new cost. 
In other cases of lost revenue to local government, it’s unclear if local officials made up the difference by cutting services or raising taxes. 
Our ruling 
Scott said, ""We cut taxes 24 times."" 
The evidence backs him up, to a point. Lawmakers and Scott have done several things to reduce the financial burden on groups of Floridians, but the benefits have been aimed mostly at business owners -- not average working people. If you don't own a business, you haven't seen most of these cuts. 
Using such a specific number is also troublesome. Backing up that specific claim requires overlooking all sorts of caveats, including counting the same effort multiple times. 
Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jun/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-claims-24-tax-cuts-florida-2011/
"['Immigration', 'Education', 'Florida', 'Carlos Curbelo']","
Carlos Curbelo says Miami-Dade schools spend more than $20 million a year due to our 'broken immigration system'
","
In February as federal lawmakers including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, were drafting immigration reform, Miami-Dade school board member Carlos Curbelo sought a district report to shine a spotlight on the challenges immigration poses to the nation’s fourth-largest school district. 
Curbelo, a Republican political consultant who may challenge U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, highlighted a key figure from the report while on Fox News with Rubio on May 24. Rubio has been trying to win over conservatives to the Senate’s immigration bill , which would create a 13-year pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The bill allocates billions for border security and provides visas for high-tech, agricultural and low-skilled workers. 
Curbelo cited his school district as an example of the high costs posed by the current immigration system: 
""We spend at our school system over $20 million every year as a direct result of the broken immigration system. The federal government doesn't reimburse us despite the fact that it is their fault. Why? 
""Because, like you said, a lot of people overstaying their visas and in some cases the government lets families with children in, in the middle of school year, which imposes a burden on schools. So it can't just be the border. We all support border security, but it has to be a lot more than that."" 
Curbelo’s comments didn’t distinguish between costs associated with legal or illegal immigration. 
Still, his figure caught our eye: do Miami-Dade schools spend more than $20 million a year educating immigrants? And how would that change if Rubio’s bill passes? 
The Miami-Dade school district immigration report 
The report that Curbelo drew his number from states that as a result of immigration reform, the district will need to increase English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) courses and invest in helping these students pass FCATs and graduate. 
The report calls on Congress to fully fund the cost of immigration for the schools, among other measures. 
The key part of the report is the district’s fiscal analysis. 
An average of 979 foreign-born students a month enter the school district -- or 11,228 for the 2011-12 school year. The report doesn’t identify what percentage are illegal, because federal law prohibits school officials from asking about students' immigration status. The district serves about 350,000 students. 
The district spent about $322 million on ESOL for about 47,700 students during the 2011-12 school year. That group includes the 11,228 foreigners who arrived that year, plus students who arrived in previous years and native born students whose families speak another language at home and need ESOL. 
The district calculated that it costs about $6,750 to educate an ESOL student -- or about $1,485 more than a typical student, largely for staff salaries. The district calculates a per-student cost for building and infrastructure of about $473. 
The district added the extra ESOL cost of $1,485 to the $473 building cost to get a total of $1,958.87 and multiplied that by the 11,228 foreign born students. That brings the grand total to $21,994,243. 
So it costs $322 million for all ESOL students. The $22 million that Curbelo cited pertained to the foreign students who arrived that school year. 
The education and building costs are paid for through state and local dollars -- the district analysis omitted federal dollars it gets for very specific uses such as tutoring. For 2011-12, Miami-Dade schools received about $14 million in federal Title III money for English Language Learners or recent immigrants, according to the Florida Department of Education. 
""We are very confident this is a very conservative analysis"" of the costs of educating an immigrant child, assistant superintendent Iraida Mendez-Cartaya told PolitiFact Florida. 
School board member Raquel Regalado raised some philosophical issues about placing a number on costs. 
""The school district is one of a few places illegal immigrants receive services without being asked about their status,"" she told PolitiFact Florida. 
We don’t have any major quibbles with the district’s math here. But Curbelo used that $22 million figure to criticize our ""broken immigration system."" So if the Senate’s bill -- which Curbelo told us he generally supports -- passes what does that mean for the number of foreign born students in Miami-Dade and the cost to educate them? 
Curbelo, who was born in Miami and the son of Cuban exiles, told PolitiFact he isn’t certain how the student population numbers would change, but he believes that improvements to border security and changes in the visa system will make the flow more predictable. 
Immigration experts on future flows to Miami-Dade 
We sent the school district’s report and Curbelo’s claim to multiple immigration experts across the political spectrum to ask what they thought of the analysis and what -- if anything -- would change for the Miami-Dade schools if the Senate bill passes. 
First, one note about Miami-Dade: The dominant immigrant group -- Cubans -- have a special wet-foot dry-foot policy that allows them to become legal U.S. residents when they reach U.S. soil. Those interdicted at sea are returned to Cuba. That policy will remain in place, immigration experts told us. 
In 2012, about 30,000 of Miami-Dade’s 68,000 foreign born students were from Cuba. (The district has students from 170 countries.) 
""The data show that a little under 50 percent of the Miami-Dade foreign born students were born in Cuba,"" said Roger Rice, an attorney who fights for the educational rights of immigrants including winning a consent decree in Florida. 
Second, we heard disagreements among immigration experts about whether the Senate bill would lead to a higher number or fewer immigrants in the future. (As of late May the House hadn’t filed its version.) 
But most experts we interviewed agreed it would be difficult to predict how the law’s effects would trickle down to the future numbers of immigrant students in the Miami-Dade public schools. Some said the student population numbers may not change significantly, but their immigration status could change. Others said it could increase, though they couldn’t say by how much for one district. 
Steve Camarota, research director for the Center for Immigration Studies that lobbies for restricting immigration, said that he expects Rubio’s bill would increase the number of immigrant children in public schools. 
""The bill doubles roughly the number green cards from one to two million That could have a very big impact from number of kids in school,"" he said. 
Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who supports the bill, said that ""the bill will probably not have a huge impact"" on the number of immigrant school children in Miami-Dade. 
He disagreed with Curbelo’s speculation that the numbers will be more predictable. 
The number of illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. is driven by the economy -- not border security, Nowrasteh said, and that will still remain the case even if border security improves. 
""If the economy improves dramatically in Miami-Dade, thousands upon thousands will move to the area....,"" he said. ""Who would have said in the early 1970s that Miami, which had a lot of urban problems and decay and people leaving, who would have said Cubans and the wave of immigrants were going to come here and revitalize Miami?"" 
Some experts also said that the district’s analysis reflects costs but not benefits of educating children who will be able to get jobs in the future and pay taxes. 
The Senate bill would still leave the states and local governments to pay for the majority of the education costs -- as they do right now. There is some mention of grants in the bill for services such as immigration integration and citizenship classes, but it’s unclear if the district could get any such grants and how much money that would provide. 
Philip Wolgin at the Center for American Progress who supports the Senate bill, said for the immigrants who are already here who become legal their wages will increase and they will have more resources to support their children. 
""The idea will all education is we make investments in students now and later on in life they work and are able to pay into the system far more than they take out,"" he said. 
Though the Center for American Progress’s estimate shows a slight net decrease as a result of the Senate bill, ""it's very very difficult to actually say these many are going to go to Miami."" 
Our ruling 
When talking on Fox News about the challenges posed by immigration, Curbelo said ""I'll give you an example, in our hometown, Miami Dade County. We spend at our school system over $20 million every year as a direct result of the broken immigration system."" 
The more than $20 million a year figure is valid; it reflects annual costs for new students who need English for Speakers of Other Languages, or ESOL. The district spends additional money for existing students who need ESOL classes. 
Curbelo's comments also gloss over some of the complexity of immigration costs. We found differing opinion among experts as to what impact the law would have on school districts. Some said the costs would likely stay the same, other said costs would go up. Overall, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jun/03/carlos-curbelo/carlos-curbelo-says-miami-dade-schools-spend-more-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Jobs', 'Small Business', 'Marco Rubio']","
Sen. Marco Rubio says 75% of small businesses say they’ll fire workers or cut hours under Obamacare
","Sen. Marco Rubio says it’s not too late to stop Obamacare. In fact, he says, Congress should refuse to pass a spending bill that funds it, even at the risk of shutting down government. That’s because he sees ""mounting evidence of how Obamacare creates more problems than it solves, particularly for small business owners and the people who work for them."" One of those pieces of evidence: the number of small business who ""say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours."" According to his FoxNews.com op-ed on July 25, 2013, that number is a jaw-dropping 75 percent. (He repeated the claim in a July 29 piece for RedState.com, ""Shut Down Obamacare, Not Government."") Rubio blames the health care law’s now-delayed employer mandate, which requires businesses with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable, comprehensive health coverage or potentially face penalties of $2,000 or more per full-time worker after the first 30. That creates a disastrous disincentive, he argues: ""If you are a small business with about 47, 48 or 49 employees and you want to hire more people, Obamacare encourages you to hold back on hiring new workers or cut the hours of existing ones so that you don’t reach 50 employees. That is why 75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours."" Do three in four American small businesses say the health care law will drive them to fire workers or cut their hours? Survey says Rubio’s not alone in his distaste for the employer mandate, which has detractors on the right and left. Even some supporters of the health care law don’t like the way the mandate’s structured, noting that it may discourage hiring and create an incentive to keep workers under 30 hours. But do 75 percent of small businesses say they face that pressure? Rubio’s office provided us with a July 16, 2013, Washington Examiner article headlined ""74% of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare,"" which begins: ""Despite the administration's controversial decision to delay forcing companies to join Obamacare for a year, three-quarters of small businesses are still making plans to duck the costly law by firing workers, reducing hours of full-time staff, or shift many to part-time, according to a sobering survey released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."" It goes on to summarize results from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s quarterly Small Business Outlook Study. We read the the study and reached out to the chamber. And there’s a problem with that ""three-quarters of small businesses"" claim. Well, a series of problems, actually. Categories don’t add up The study was conducted among a national sample of 1,300 executives for small businesses, defined as fewer than 500 employees and with annual revenue less than $25 million. It included chamber members and non-members ""weighted to be representative of the small business population."" But it turns out the question the Washington Examiner and Rubio cited wasn’t asked of the entire group — something not clear in the published results. The chamber told us executives were first asked whether the employer mandate would affect them: As a result of the health care law, the employer mandate will require employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to all full-time employees and their dependents or face a penalty. The law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours per week and the penalty is based on the number of full-time employees. Will you be impacted by the employer mandate? Just 17 percent of the small business executives said yes. So less than one in five businesses that participated in the survey said that the employer mandate would even affect them. Those 17 percent were then asked how they planned to respond. They could select as many answers as they felt applied to them: Please indicate how your business will react to this new mandate. Please select all that apply. a. Reduce hiring to avoid surpassing the 50 full-time equivalent employees (24 percent) b. Cut back hours to reduce the number of full-time employees (27 percent) c. Stop providing employee health insurance d. Replace full-time employees with part-time workers (23 percent) e. None of the above The chamber published responses for answers A, B and D — the responses cited by the Washington Examiner and Rubio. It has not provided responses for answers C and E. So, the only way to reach 75 percent is to not only ignore the majority of executives who didn’t answer the question, but also to fold those who said they would ""reduce hiring"" with those who planned to cut hours or replace workers. And we just don’t know how many employers said, ""None of the above."" It’s also not clear from published results exactly what percentage of affected businesses said they would cut hours or replace workers. It could be as high as 50 percent, assuming there was no overlap between the executives who said they planned to replace full-timers with part-timers and those who said they would cut back hours. It could be as low as 27 percent, assuming total overlap — that the same people who said they would replace full-timers with part-timers also said they intended to cut back hours. So, of all small businesses in the study, how many said they would cut back hours or replace full-time workers in response to the health care law? Just 5 percent to 9 percent. And that’s in line with other evidence. Most companies have 10 employees or less — far from the 50-employee threshold. Meanwhile, of firms with 25 to 49 people — a group Rubio said he was concerned about — 87 percent already offer health benefits, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual employer survey. Of those with 50 to 199 employees — the smallest businesses actually subject to penalties in 2015 for not offering insurance — 94 percent already offer benefits. Meanwhile, under the law, businesses with fewer than 25 employees may already qualify for tax credits for offering coverage — an extra boost they didn’t get before. Still, surveys show small businesses are worried. A May Gallup poll commissioned by an employment law firm showed that 41 percent have held off on plans to hire new employees, 19 percent have reduced workers, and 18 percent have reduced employees’ hours to part time. Part of the problem, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, is that small employers don’t actually know yet how the law will affect them. Only 30 percent of respondents in the U.S. Chamber’s small business survey said they were prepared — including understanding what’s required to participate in health care insurance exchanges. ""There's a lot of misinformation and a lot of ideology out there,"" Blumberg said. Our ruling Rubio, arguing to defund Obamacare, said ""75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours."" That’s not remotely true. In the study of small businesses he cited, less than 10 percent said they might make that choice. His office cited a news article that misinterpreted ambiguous results from an interest-group survey. But basic statistics about America’s small businesses show the number was seriously unlikely, and a quick message to the U.S. Chamber exposed the error. Yet opinion pieces under Rubio’s name repeat the claim — one that’s so wrong, it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/jul/29/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-75-small-businesses-say-theyl/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says Barack Obama has promised veto unless sequestration cuts are eliminated
","As the nation hurtles toward another possible fiscal showdown, both President Barack Obama and House Republicans are engaging in a pre-emptive blame game. ""Last month, through a series of Statements of Administration Policy, the president announced that he would not sign ANY spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated – and replaced with his plan for higher, job-destroying taxes,"" wrote House Speaker John Boehner in a statement on his website on July 22, 2013. (Sequestration refers to the mandatory, across-the-board cuts in every federal agency that took effect earlier this year.) The Ohio Republican was citing a pair of messages Obama released in June called Statements of Administration Policy. SAPs, as they are known, are used to officially convey whether an administration will support or oppose a particular bill pending in Congress. We located the two statements in question, both of which addressed annual bills to fund parts of the federal government:  H.R. 2216 (the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2014) and H.R. 2217 (the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014). Both SAPs were released on June 3, and they had nearly identical language in an underlined section, the usual signal of the document’s main point. ""Unless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future, the President’s senior advisors would recommend that he veto (the bill) and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework."" We decided to check two elements of Boehner’s claim. Did Obama really say he ""would not sign"" the bills? And did Obama’s potential veto hinge on ""sequestration spending cuts (being) eliminated""? Veto threat kabuki An almost Talmudic hierarchy of veto-threat language has developed over the years, remaining much the same regardless of who is in the White House. Keith Hennessey, who spent several years as a senior aide to President George W. Bush and is now a lecturer at Stanford University, has developed a handy primer for the linguistic nuances of SAPs. The first three of his examples involve gradations of approval for pending bills. From there, the language proceeds, with increasing degrees of opposition, to: • The administration opposes the bill. • The administration strongly opposes the bill. • If the president were presented this bill for signature, a particular administration official would recommend that he veto it. • If the president were presented this bill for signature, the president’s senior advisers would recommend he veto it. • If the president were presented this bill for signature, he would veto it. • If the president is presented this bill for signature, he will veto it. • If this bill makes it to my desk, I will veto it. (This one is more commonly used in a public appearance than in a Statement of Administration Policy.) So the statements that Boehner referred to used language that was about half-way up the hierarchy of presidential opposition. We asked several experts in the back-and-forth between the White House and Congress whether they thought it was reasonable for Boehner to call Obama’s language a sign that he ""would not sign"" the bills in question. Most took a middle ground, saying Boehner was right to suggest strong opposition by Obama but wrong to imply that Obama had closed the door to negotiation. Obama’s wording ""is customary for a veto threat communicated through OMB -- they always leave enough wiggle room for compromise,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist and budget expert at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed, saying that Obama’s wording is usually ""meant as a strong ‘no’ … but a ‘no’ that is meant to say he is firm in his position and that it's time to negotiate."" Does Obama’s threat hinge on sequestration? Obama’s SAPs don’t explicitly say the restoration of sequestration cuts would trigger a veto, mentioning instead ""legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework."" In his statement, then, Boehner makes a reasonable point: Obama opposes the House Republican budget framework, which doesn’t envision restoration of past sequestration cuts. In fact, it would make even deeper cuts. The White House has ""made very clear that their idea of a budget framework does away with sequestration,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner. ""So he’s saying he won’t sign these bills absent a plan to do away with sequestration."" However, budget experts say Boehner went too far by suggesting that sequestration is Obama’s specific line in the sand. The experts say that while Obama strongly opposes the current design of the House Republicans’ budget, he left vague exactly what provisions he would agree to.

U.S. agency monitoring millions of Americans' financial records, Rep. Sean Duffy says
","Seizing on revelations that the National Security Agency has been scooping up the phone and Internet communications of ordinary Americans, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., is sounding new alarms about citizen surveillance by another, relatively new government agency. In a July 17, 2013 interview on ""Opinion Journal,"" a Wall Street Journal online show, he invoked the National Security Agency in making his attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""The CFPB is collecting financial information, monitoring financial information, of millions of Americans, and they have no clue that it’s going on. It’s again this NSA push of having more information on more Americans,"" Duffy said. He added: ""We know in politics, oftentimes people will sample data, to see what the president’s approval rating is or disapproval rating is. The CFPB could do the same thing to find out information about financial transactions. But instead of sampling data, they’re actually collecting it and storing it for up to 10 years. This is absolutely crazy."" So, Duffy’s claim is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects and monitors financial information of millions of Americans, without their knowledge, and stores it for up to 10 years -- the implication being that bureau is keeping data on individuals’ personal accounts. Let's do some information gathering of our own. What CFPB does The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which launched in July 2011, is charged with protecting consumers from abusive practices in financial services and regulating the terms of mortgages, student loans, credit cards and other transactions. ""We gather and analyze available information to better understand consumers, financial services providers and consumer financial markets,"" the bureau says. For example, a bureau report in June 2013 found that overdraft penalties represent well over half of banks' fees from consumer checking accounts, The law creating the bureau prohibits it from collecting data ""for purposes of gathering or analyzing the personally identifiable financial information of consumers."" But that doesn’t personally identifiable information isn’t being collected. A disclosure Suspicion about the bureau’s work ratcheted up in April 2013 when Bloomberg News reported it was demanding records from banks and was buying anonymous information about at least 10 million consumers from various companies. The article said the bureau was paying the Experian credit-monitoring company up to $8.4 million to provide data on 5 million to 10 million consumers. The bureau was also buying auto loan information from the company and payday loan data from another credit-reporting company, the article said. Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile also pointed out that the bureau’s April 2013 strategic plan says the bureau will ""acquire and maintain a credit card database at the summary and loan levels covering approximately 80 percent of the credit card marketplace."" So, the first part of Duffy’s claim is accurate. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is obtaining from third parties financial data involving millions of Americans without any direct notification from the bureau to consumers. But what about the rest of Duffy’s message, which suggests the bureau keeps financial data on actual individuals, monitors it and stores it for up to 10 years? Bureau makes its case A week before Duffy made his claim, the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit held a hearing specifically to examine how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects and uses consumer data.  Duffy is a member of the committee. The bureau’s acting deputy director, Stephen Antonakes, testified that the bureau’s data collection on individuals is very limited. The bureau collects personally identifiable information only when consumers are seeking help with a complaint against a business, he said, or when ""we're using our supervisory tool, conducting examinations of the banks, the credit unions and the nonbanks under our jurisdiction."" When Duffy asked about news indicating the bureau was buying information about at least 10 million consumers, Antonakes replied: ""Congressman, we're not monitoring any individual American. We're collecting broad data on markets to understand how varied markets work."" At the same time, Antonakes said he didn’t know how many millions of Americans were involved in the data the bureau has collected. And he said the bureau needs years’ worth of complete data, not a sampling of data like pollsters might use, to do its work. Duffy’s evidence We asked Duffy’s spokeswoman for evidence that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was monitoring data on individual Americans and storing it for up to 10 years. She cited a July 2013 lawsuit filed against the bureau by a firm that says it is fighting the bureau’s demand for ""thousands of personally identifiable"" financial documents of individuals considering bankruptcy. The documents contain data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, amount of debt owed and creditor information, the firm alleges in a news release in which Duffy is quoted. Duffy’s spokeswoman also cited a contract -- revealed by the Judicial Watch conservative group, which litigates on public corruption and other issues -- that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has with a firm to store and analyze credit card information. The firm can get access to ""non-public confidential information and personally identifiable information,"" the contract says, although the firm is barred from disclosing any of the data to any third party without permission from the bureau. The contract also states that ""most if not all"" of the data the firm will handle will be ""confidential supervisory information,"" but that some records will contain sensitive, personally identifiable information. Judicial Watch has published documents from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing the bureau wants to track the financial records of 5 million Americans. The bureau acknowledged the program and said all data collected is ""anonymized,"" according to a U.S. News & World Report article. Other evidence We put Duffy’s claim to Bradley Jansen, director of the Center for Financial Privacy and Human Rights in Washington, D.C., which says it defends privacy, civil liberties and market economics, and Florida attorney Justin Angelo, who represents banks and other businesses that are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They agreed the bureau has collected and is monitoring financial data involving millions of Americans, but that’s not the same as monitoring the financial activity of individuals. They also agreed it’s likely the bureau cannot collect all of the data it does without obtaining personally identifiable information in the process, even if the data is not being collected for that reason. How the bureau is collecting data and safeguarding it will be the focus of a government audit. On July 12, 2013, three days after the House subcommittee hearing on the bureau’s data collection practices, the U.S. Government Accountability Office agreed to review the bureau’s collection and analysis of credit records. U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who requested the review, says some of the bureau’s contracts  with third-party data collectors would enable the bureau to monitor an individual consumer’s financial activity on a monthly basis. But Crapo has also said the GAO review is needed because it’s unclear what personally identifiable information is being kept by the bureau. He said: ""While CFPB officials have stated the CFPB is not collecting personally identifiable information, we do not know what information it collects, on how many accounts, or how this information is being used. We also need to know whether the CFPB is truly not collecting personally identifiable information from the data it is collecting or purchasing."" It’s worth noting that when Crapo raised similar concerns two months earlier, bureau director Richard Cordray responded in part by saying that while the bureau is creating a national mortgage database with ""loan-level"" data, and had bought 10 years of credit data representing 4 percent of Americans, none of that data contains personally identifiable information. Our rating Invoking the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency, Duffy said the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is ""collecting financial information, monitoring financial information of millions of Americans"" without their knowledge and ""storing it for up to 10 years."" The implication was that bureau is keeping data on millions of individuals’ personal accounts. The bureau is collecting information, even 10 years’ worth of some data, involving millions of Americans. That’s being done through third parties without consumers’ knowledge But even a critic who has made claims similar to Duffy’s, in asking for a review of the bureau, says he doesn’t know what information the bureau collects and whether it contains personally identifiable information. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Duffy a Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/29/sean-duffy/us-agency-monitoring-millions-americans-financial-/

Rush Holt warns “millions will die” from climate change as global temperatures reach historic highs
","U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt set off a political firestorm last week with these three words tucked into a campaign ad about the dangers of climate change: ""Millions will die."" Holt, a Democratic congressman, defended that claim in the face of criticism from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who dismissed Holt’s climate change assertions as ""silly hysteria."" In the Aug. 13 Democratic primary, Holt is running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg. PolitiFact New Jersey cannot fact-check the ""millions will die"" claim -- since it’s a prediction -- but another statement made by Holt earlier in the July 22 campaign ad caught our attention. ""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,"" Holt (D-12th Dist.) said. ""All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Those statements are accurate, according to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. First, let’s address the first part about monthly temperatures. Referring to global temperatures -- meaning land and ocean surfaces combined -- Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with the NOAA, confirmed in a series of e-mails that ""since February 1985, every month has been warmer than the average of that month."" The NOAA compares each month’s global temperature against the average for that respective month for the period between 1901 and 2000, Blunden said. Since February 1985, the global temperature for every month has been above its 20th Century average, she said. For instance, the NOAA found that the global temperature in June was 1.15 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average of all the months of June between 1901 and 2000. That measurement marked ""the 37th consecutive June and 340th consecutive month—that’s a total of more than 28 years—with a global temperature above the 20th-century average,"" according to a summary of the NOAA’s latest climate report. On the second point, it turns out that Holt's figure of the 12 warmest years on record occurring in the last 15 years was actually a conservative estimate. Based on NOAA data, the last 15 years -- from 1998 to 2012 -- have included the 14 hottest years on record since 1880 for global temperatures. The NOAA estimates that the hottest year was 2010. Using a different methodology, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates that the last 15 years have included the 13 hottest years since 1880 for global temperatures. In a statistical tie, either 2010 or 2005 may be considered the warmest year on record, according to Reto Ruedy, a climate scientist with the institute. The institute has said 2012 was the ninth warmest year on record, while the NOAA estimates that 2012 was the tenth hottest year. ""The record dates back to 1880 because that is when there were enough meteorological stations around the world to provide global temperature data,"" according to a news release on the institute’s website. Our ruling In a campaign ad where he claimed ""millions will die"" from climate change, Holt cited two statistics about monthly and annual global temperatures. ""Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average,"" Holt said. ""All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."" Both of those statistics are backed up by data released by scientists at the NOAA and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The global temperature in every month since February 1985 has been above the 20th Century average for its respective month, according to the NOAA. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years.

Rep. Helio Melo says R.I. has the highest percentage of lawyers per capita
","Rhode Island state Rep. Helio Melo, chairman of the House Finance Committee, recently questioned Governor Chafee’s nomination of Eva-Marie Mancuso, chairwoman of the state Board of Education, as interim commissioner of higher education. Even though she’s a lawyer, Mancuso is not necessarily qualified to be commissioner, Melo said. ""I’m not sure that someone with a law degree is what the state should be looking for,"" Melo told a Providence Journal reporter in an interview published July 13. ""I understand that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of lawyers per capita in the country. Does that make all lawyers here potential commissioners of education? The board doesn’t have to follow the governor’s recommendation, and I would urge it to take a serious look at her qualifications."" A Journal reader was fascinated. Is it true, he asked us,  that the Ocean State is awash in lawyers? We wondered, too. We called Melo. He said he had heard -- probably at a government seminar out of state, he thought -- ""that we had a very large or probably the largest percentage of lawyers in Rhode Island per capita. I found that to be intriguing and it kind of stuck in my head."" We also went online and found U.S. Census data and state tallies of practicing lawyers compiled by the American Bar Association. Then we created a spreadsheet and melded them. Here’s what we discovered through our calculations. Rhode Island, with an estimated population of 1,050,292, and, according to the ABA, 4,060 residents who were active as lawyers in the state as of December, has one lawyer per 259 people. We’re definitely not number one. The most lawyer-saturated state is New York, with one lawyer per 118 people, followed by Massachusetts, ranked second, with one lawyer per 155 people, and Connecticut, in third place, with one lawyer per 170 people. The state with the fewest lawyers per capita is Arkansas, with one lawyer per 495 people, according to our math. We omitted the District of Columbia from our comparison list because it is unique as the capital of national government and thus is swarming with lawyers. Where does Rhode Island emerge on the list of 50 states?  Thirteenth. Melo’s reaction? ""Actually, that doesn’t put my pants on fire,"" said Melo, who has been singed before on the Truth-O-Meter. ""That’s high,"" he said of 13th place.  ""... I guess it is one of the highest."" Our ruling Helio Melo said Rhode Island has the highest percentage of lawyers per capita in the nation.

Rhode Island Rep. Teresa Tanzi says the contents of electronic cigarette vapor are unknown
","A lot of things are said in the heat of debate on the floor at the General Assembly. As PolitiFact Rhode Island listened during a July 1, 2013 discussion of legislation on electronic cigarettes, a categorical remark by a state representative caught our attention. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, D-South Kingstown, declared, ""We have no idea what is contained in that vapor"" when an e-cigarette is used. Is there really no information available to the public, as she seemed to suggest? Our exploration of her statement took us into the world of ""vaping"" -- the act of using an e-cigarette. An e-cigarette is a battery-powered nicotine delivery system that resembles a cigarette; it heats a liquid and turns it into a colorless, odorless vapor without combustion. Unlike puffing on a tobacco cigarette, the user inhales vapor, not smoke. The Assembly in June enacted a measure that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, but Governor Chafee vetoed it. He said the proposal would circumvent existing Rhode Island law on tobacco control and taxation. The Assembly has not scheduled any veto override session. It didn’t take us long to discover that, despite Tanzi’s assertion, there have been numerous scientific studies about the content of e-cigarette vapors. One of the leading voices in the national tug-of-war over e-cigarettes is Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Health, and a Brown University graduate. He co-authored a definitive academic paper in 2010 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Health Policy that reviewed the available science on e-cigarettes. He cited 16 studies, most of them sponsored by the industry, but all conducted by independent laboratories. The studies concluded that the primary components of the vapor are propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and nicotine. Trace amounts of cancer-causing ingredients also have been detected. Of course, actual cigarettes are a known cause of cancer. Siegel pointed out that most e-cigarette users are former smokers or smokers who are trying to quit. ""The issue is not finding out what’s in there. We know what’s in them,"" he said in an interview with The Journal. ""The question is what are the long-term ramifications. And how do you weigh that against the risks of continuing to smoke."" We telephoned Tanzi, who said that, in her comment during the House debate, she was referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulating tobacco but not e-cigarettes. As a result, she said, there are no government standards regarding the content of e-cigarettes and their possible secondhand effects. In the absence of such standards, Tanzi contended, e-cigarettes should not be sold to anyone. But that’s not what she said on the House floor. Nor is she quite right in her characterization of the FDA position. We contacted the FDA, whose web sites and spokeswoman told us that e-cigarettes are subject to regulation in two ways as the result of a federal court ruling -- as tobacco products and as therapeutic devices. Subject to regulation, in the case of tobacco products, does not mean they are actually regulated today. The FDA’s Jennifer Haliski said the agency has announced its intent to issue a proposed rule deeming products defined as e-cigarettes to be subject to regulation under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. After the rule is adopted, she explained, the FDA will be able to exercise its authority over e-cigarettes as tobacco products. But Haliski said e-cigarettes are regulated by the FDA if a seller makes a therapeutic claim -- in other words, the seller boasts, as spelled out in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, that ""it treats or prevents disease or otherwise affects the structure or any function of the body . . ."" So Tanzi is half-right when she says that the FDA does not regulate e-cigarettes. They are not regulated as a tobacco product but they are regulated as a drug device. No e-cigarette maker has yet applied to the FDA for approval of a  therapeutic claim. When a maker does, Haliski said, the FDA will review the scientific evidence submitted and then rule. The agency has warned a handful of e-cigarette distributors about alleged unsubstantiated claims and alleged poor manufacturing practices. Haliski said that as an official matter, because manufacturers have not applied for approvals, backed with science, the FDA does not yet know what is in the vapor. In limited lab studies of certain samples, though, the FDA said it found mismatches between labeling and contents indicative of manufacturing quality problems. ""We need more research,"" Haliski said. Our ruling State Rep. Teresa Tanzi said, ""We have no idea what is contained in [electronic cigarette] vapor."" But we found that numerous studies have identified the primary components of the vapor. Tanzi said she was referring to a lack of federal regulation of the products and the setting of safety standards. But that’s not what she said in the House debate. The judges rule her claim False.

Leticia Van de Putte says residents of Texas and San Antonio can be fired or denied jobs because they are gay
","In a June 14, 2013, opinion article in the San Antonio Express-News, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte urged the city to ""pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or veterans' status."" Supporting the measures, which the City Council was expected to consider in August 2013, the Democrat said of a fellow San Antonio resident, an Iraq veteran: ""Here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay."" We figured Van de Putte was making a broad statement about all Texans and all San Antonians; a spokesman for the senator, Lee Nichols, confirmed that. Like nearly all U.S. states, Texas is an employment-at-will state. That means, as the Texas Municipal League puts it in a legal white paper, ""Generally, employees without a written employment contract can be fired for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all,"" as long as that cause is not illegal. Section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code, Nichols said via email, makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or applicants because of ""race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age,"" but does not mention sexual orientation. Van de Putte offered a bill during the 2013 Legislature’s regular session to extend that protection, he said. Here’s the law, part of the Texas Labor Code’s Title 2, Subtitle A, Chapter 21: SUBCHAPTER B. UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES Sec. 21.051.  DISCRIMINATION BY EMPLOYER.  An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer: (1)  fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment;  or (2)  limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee. 
So while it’s illegal in Texas to ""deprive an individual of any employment opportunity"" or refuse to hire someone because of gender, race and several other factors, it isn’t against state law to do so because they are homosexual or of any other sexual orientation. Spokesman Charlie Joughin at the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, told us 21 states have laws meant to protect residents against job discrimination based on sexual orientation. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that ""in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for … being gay,"" as Martina Navratilova claimed in a May 2013 interview. PolitiFact rated the ex-tennis star’s statement Half True, noting significant exceptions. In all states, federal and state government employees have certain protections because courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit a discrimination lawsuit under the right of equal protection in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. PolitiFact also noted that cities or individual employers can have anti-discrimination policies even if their state does not. That’s the case in several Texas cities. City of Austin spokeswoman Patricia Fraga told us by phone that Austin ordinances protect against discrimination citywide in employment, housing and public accommodations -- a term that takes in businesses such as restaurants, theaters, bars and stores -- for reasons that include sexual orientation. Ordinances in Dallas and Fort Worth bar such discrimination citywide. Houston has several related ordinances, spokesman Justin Concepcion of the mayor’s office told us by phone. El Paso has a citywide ordinance against housing and public accommodation discrimination for sexual orientation, but not employment, deputy city attorney Laura Gordon told us by phone. San Antonio’s website advises its employees, ""Unlawful discrimination may be occurring if you are treated differently because of"" reasons that include sexual orientation. The proposed measures were described by the Express-News in a July 25, 2013, news blog entry as a ""proposal to fix the city’s anti-discrimination policies, which right now are a hodgepodge of disparate references scattered across the city’s code."" Van de Putte spokesman Servando Esparza told us by phone that protections at the city level were important, but not a comprehensive guarantee of rights, because a resident could move or rules could change as new city officials came in. ""We wanted to make sure this was solved at the state level,"" he said. Our ruling Van de Putte said that a Texan and San Antonian could be ""denied or fired from a job just because he is gay."" In Texas, it appears, many workers can be fired for nearly any reason. That said, state law also doesn’t bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. But several major cities do and Texans who work for state or federal government -- and even for San Antonio city government itself -- have some protections, too.

Chain email says Homeland Security can seize safe deposit boxes without notice
","Nothing screams Internet credibility quite like an entire paragraph in all caps, alternating text background colors and no fewer than five question marks in an email subject line.

(If anyone can persuade you to take your valuables out of the bank and stuff them in your mattress, please don’t let it be a stranger who just can’t figure out that caps lock key.) Different versions of a chain email about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seizing safe deposit box contents have been circulating through inboxes and on websites since 2006, and as recently as this month. The message sent to PolitiFact read: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAS TOLD BANKS -- IN WRITING -- IT MAY INSPECT SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES WITHOUT WARRANT AND SEIZE ANY GOLD, SILVER, GUNS OR OTHER VALUABLES IT FINDS INSIDE THOSE BOXES! According to in-house memos now circulating, the DHS has issued orders to banks across America which announce to them that ""under the Patriot Act"" the DHS has the absolute right to seize, without any warrant whatsoever, any and all customer bank accounts, to make ""periodic and unannounced"" visits to any bank to open and inspect the contents of ""selected safe deposit boxes."" Further, the DHS ""shall, at the discretion of the agent supervising the search, remove, photograph or seize as evidence"" any of the following items ""bar gold, gold coins, firearms of any kind unless manufactured prior to 1878, documents such as passports or foreign bank account records, pornography or any material that, in the opinion of the agent, shall be deemed of to be of a contraband nature. This raises the question: Who keeps their porn in a bank safe deposit box? But porn aside, there was a lot to check out here. We contacted David McGuinn, president of Safe Deposit Specialists, a financial consulting firm that offers training, products and services to the financial industry. He told us he was flooded with phone calls when this claim resurfaced in 2013. He attributes it to the Cyprus financial crisis earlier this year. The small Mediterranean country had been in severe recession since 2009, and a banking crisis led to a rescue package from the European Central Bank. The terms of the bailout left the government desperate for cash, so officials announced in March that they would seize a portion of savers’ assets. That’s when people started warning that something similar could happen in the United States, and the chain email started circulating again, McGuinn told us. ""There’s no truth to that at all,"" he said. The Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs are groups McGuinn listed as potential officials who could force open a box with a search and seizure notice. McGuinn said this process doesn’t occur frequently. And when officials do open safe deposit boxes, there are safeguards in place. Rob Rowe, vice president with the American Bankers Association, explained that good cause must be proven in order for the Patriot Act to be used to open a safe deposit box, which is private property. The email in question cited the Patriot Act as the reason the DHS can seize this property, but Rowe said that isn’t the case. Also, DHS officials wouldn’t be able to open up boxes without bank officials present, he said. ""The only way to open the box without the renter’s key is to drill the lock. If and when a box is drilled, standard bank operating procedures require dual control – the presence of two officers – and many jurisdictions also require that the locksmith who drills the box to be specially licensed or certified,"" Rowe said. When we contacted Homeland Security about the issue, an official cited the Fourth Amendment, explaining that searches and seizures by the department may only take place with probable cause and a court-ordered warrant. Our ruling Various chain emails over the past seven years have warned readers about the possibility of Homeland Security seizing items like gold, silver and guns from their safe deposit boxes at the bank. This isn’t possible without first obtaining a search warrant, since those boxes are private property. And banking officials told us random seizures just aren’t happening.

Republicans greet Obama with ad touting lack of federal money for port project
","President Barack Obama isn’t just late to the party for Florida’s ports, Republicans say. He’s taking credit for throwing it. The Republican Party of Florida, umm, ""welcomed"" Obama to the Jacksonville Port Authority on Thursday with a full-page ad in the Florida Times-Union talking up Gov. Rick Scott’s focus on the economy, especially the ports. ""Here in Jacksonville, right where you will be speaking, Gov. Scott invested $38 million in the Port of Jacksonville's vital Mile Point Project,"" the ad stated. ""It is a state investment that will help create good-paying jobs. And it covered missing federal funds for the project."" Their attack is riddled with political irony: Obama and Scott have had major differences over transportation projects in the past (see high-speed rail), but both are fans of ports. We wanted to know if it was true that the state provided missing funds for ports that the federal government didn’t. The Mile Point project is aimed at improving access to the Jacksonville port. Right now, strong ocean cross-currents prevent the biggest cargo ships from accessing the harbor outside of a narrow window each day at high tide. ""Two-thirds of the day, that cargo cannot move,"" said JaxPort spokeswoman Nancy Rubin. ""Those are just the very largest ships, but that is becoming a significant part of the trade we’re dealing with."" To fix the problem, the federal Army Corps of Engineers devised a plan that will basically remove part of a man-made wall contributing to the strong currents and reconstruct the surrounding area. By law, Congress must authorize the corps to do the project. In a gridlocked, sequester-ridden, earmark-less era, that’s no easy task. Large-scale infrastructure projects have fallen prey to an earmark ban, even though its intention was to weed out spending on unvetted, wasteful projects, said Kurt Nagle, president and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities. ""What got caught up in that were port projects that do have a clear federal role and clear national interest and have gone through multiple layers of review and analysis,"" he said. Congress typically approved money and permission for port projects in the Water Resources Development Act, which has not passed since 2007. In May, the Senate passed a bipartisan version of the bill that would authorize Mile Point and other projects, as well as allow for the corps to proceed with projects, under certain conditions, for which it has outside funding. (Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., voted for it; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against.) Obama called on the House to pick up the Senate bill. Catch that? The Mile Point project is essentially held up by the House, led by Republicans averse to new spending, growing the deficit and tax cuts. The corps projected the cost for the Mile Point project at about $36 million, with 65 percent coming from the feds and the rest coming from local sources. Scott, eyeing a state budget surplus with no federal investment in the pipe anytime soon, pushed the Legislature to set aside $36 million for the project. The Legislature agreed. The port kicked in $500,000 and the federal Army Corps of Engineers kicked in $1.5 million to create designs for the project. (The ad credits all of that money to Scott, which isn't quite right.) But even though the port has the money from the state, it can’t spend it because Congress hasn’t moved legislation that would allow that. The state’s JaxPort investment is part of a trend under Scott not to wait for federal dollars. In 2011, he got $77 million for a deep dredging project in Miami. JaxPort also wants to deepen its channel, but the Mile Point project is a ready-to-go priority (and hundreds of millions of dollars cheaper). ""We feel like we are at the finish line, we’ve got the money,"" Rubin said. ""The authorization, to us, is pushing us over the finish line."" Port of Tampa CEO and director Paul Anderson penned a June op-ed advocating for passage of the federal legislation. The Port of Tampa received about $25 million for various projects from the state in the 2013-14 budget. Our ruling Yes, Scott persuaded state leaders to put aside $36 million for the project, with the remaining $2 million coming from the port and the corps. In years past, the federal government paid most of the tab for improving a federal shipping channel. The Republicans’ ad implies Obama bears the burden for missing federal funding for Mile Point, saying Obama ""took his eye off the ball."" Truth be told, it’s the fault of Congress, which has final say over Army Corps port projects. A wide-ranging bill that would authorize the Mile Point project is stalled, the norm in recent years. RPOF’s ad is accurate but could use more context. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/26/republican-party-florida/republicans-greet-obama-ad-touting-lack-federal-mo/

Barack Obama says businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in current recovery as in previous recovery
","During a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill., President Barack Obama touted his record on job creation. Referring to his Republican critics, Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech, ""They’ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare."" We’ll first check whether Obama is correct about job growth, and then take a look at the impact of Obama’s health care law. The job numbers Because Obama used the term ""recovery,"" we started by looking at Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers for the first 49 months after the official end of the past two recessions -- that is, from November 2001 until November 2005, when George W. Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obama’s tenure. Under Obama’s recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery. That’s ""nearly twice as many jobs,"" as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers. But it isn’t the only way. Instead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These aren’t the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isn’t the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession. Using this method makes Obama’s recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recession’s official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery. If you count from the low point in private-sector jobs instead, the Bush recovery produced 6.35 million private-sector jobs in the first 41 months, compared to 7.20 million in the first 41 months of Obama’s recovery. That’s modestly more private-sector jobs under Obama -- but it’s not ""nearly twice as many jobs,"" as he had said. There’s also a third way to look at it -- looking at all jobs, not just private-sector jobs. Using this measurement casts an even more unfavorable light on the Obama recovery, since the government sector has been among the hardest-hit of any job category in the current recession. If you start counting private and government jobs from the low point in employment, the Bush recovery generated slightly more than 7 million total jobs, which actually exceeds the 6.58 million jobs created in the Obama recovery. Two economists we interviewed -- Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution and Tara Sinclair of George Washington University -- agreed that the alternative measurements are also valid. But by choosing the more favorable of the two statistics, Sinclair said, ""I think he's cherry-picking. To in any way claim that this labor market is better than what we had in the mid-2000s just doesn't sound fair to me."" To be fair, Burtless said, Obama did acknowledge elsewhere in his speech that, ""I’m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do."" The role of Obamacare Obama used the line we’re checking as a way of countering Republican claims that the president’s signature health care law is a job-killer. The reality is that no one knows yet how much of a job-killer the law is going to be, or if it will be a job-killer at all. Many key provisions of the health care law haven’t kicked in yet. That includes new rules with fines for large businesses that don’t provide their employees with health care. Republicans say the new rules could drive some employers to shed employees or turn them into part-time employees. Sinclair said it’s possible that some companies may have pre-emptively cut down on employee hours or laid off workers due to the fear of looming Obamacare mandates, or due to certain Obamacare taxes being imposed. However, even if this is happening, it’s impossible to quantify the impact with any specificity. Obamacare’s impact on the currently available job data -- either positive or negative -- is still highly speculative. Our ruling Obama said, ""Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare."" Obama’s carefully worded claim uses the most advantageous time frame to measure job growth. Other metrics show that the job recovery he has presided over has been similar to, or even weaker than, the job recovery under Bush. So we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-businesses-have-created-nearly-t/
"['Oregon', 'City Government', 'Water', 'Portlanders for Water Reform']","
Are 'pet projects' to blame for Portland's high water and sewer rates?
","There’s little doubt that Portland has one of the highest combined water and sewer rates in the country. The city came in at No. 5 in a 2010 industry analysis of the nation’s 50 most populous cities, and rates have more than doubled since 2001.

Naturally, this leads to some frustration from ratepayers. A couple years back, a group of Portlanders filed a lawsuit asking a Multnomah County judge to declare that the city improperly spent millions of dollars in ratepayer money on projects such as the Rose Festival Foundation headquarters and the Water House in east Portland.

Now the man behind that lawsuit, Kent Craford, is launching another effort to tamp down on increases. He’s formed a group called Portlanders for Water Reform, which aims to get a measure on the 2014 ballot with the goal of wresting oversight of water and sewer utilities from the Portland City Council and giving it to an independently elected board.

The group explained its motivation in an e-mail looking for donations on the day it launched the campaign:

""As you know, Portland water and sewer rates are out of control and sadly they aren’t going to get any better. According to the Portland Water Bureau’s own numbers, water rates will increase 66 percent in the next five years. Portland’s water rates are higher than those in Phoenix, Arizona! This is unacceptable.

""What is even more unacceptable is the reasoning behind the high rates. All kinds of ’pet projects’ unrelated to the core function of the water and sewer bureaus has (sic) been funded in the bureaus’ budgets at the direction of the City Council. Ratepayers have sued the City over these expenditures. By the City’s own account, the projects identified in this lawsuit total over $127 million.""

These are excerpts from a e-mail sent to select donors by a fundraising agency on behalf of Portlanders for Water Reform and then published by the Portland Mercury. Craford wouldn’t give The Oregonian a copy but he did confirm the letter’s authenticity.

PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t help wonder whether these pet projects were really the reason for the growing rates. We decided to look into the matter for ourselves.

First we spoke with the city attorney’s office to double check that the $127 million cited in the e-mail was accurate. It is. There are two things to keep in mind here, though. That $127 million figure is the high-end estimate. And the bill was wracked up over a time period of between four and 10 years.

The figure includes line items like the financing of political campaigns, the Portland Loo Project, the Rose Festival Headquarters (which has since been paid through other funds), the Dodge Park master plan, park arborists and the acquisition of Centennial Mills.

Now that all adds up -- and it’s not just the group filing this ballot measure that has been closely watching the spending. So has The Oregonian, both in news articles and editorials. Still, as City Hall reporter Brad Schmidt has been careful to point out in his coverage, these projects are a relative drop in the bucket when shown against overall bureau spending.

Together, those bureaus spend about $440 million a year while the millions mentioned in the lawsuit have been dispersed over a number of years, at least as far back as 2008 according the lawsuit itself. That means the ""pet projects"" spending -- and folks at the city don’t believe everything in the lawsuit is unrelated to the bureaus’ missions -- accounts for about 7 percent of what the water and environmental services spent over the past four years.

Now, we also spoke with people from each of the bureaus.

David Shaff, the Water Bureau’s administrator, pointed out that the bureau is expecting to spend about $300 million alone on federally mandated reservoir changes. ""The Water House or the loo or the Rose Festival headquarters are a tiny fraction of that,"" Shaff said.

Similarly, over at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which takes care of sewers, money is being spent. Take, for instance, the Big Pipe. That project cost the city $1.4 billion and its debt is still being paid off. What’s more, to keep the city’s century-old system in working order, that bureau plans on spending $139 million over the next five years in one repair program alone.

We called Craford to get his take on all of this.

""It's a one page letter,"" he said. ""They need to be quick, they need to get people's attention and conclude with the request … it's not intended to be a book report.""

We understand that, of course, but the way the e-mail reads it’s the pet projects that are driving the increasing water and sewer rates. Certainly, ending those projects would help curb the increases, but that wouldn’t end them -- not by a long shot.

""Of course these are not the only contributors to rates,"" Craford said. He then cited $300 million worth of spending on reservoirs he doesn’t believe we need -- though that has been mandated by the federal government -- and ""all sorts of projects that are ‘mission related’ that are unnecessary.""

In a letter looking for donations, Portlanders for Water Reform clearly draws a link between the city’s high water and sewer rates and ""all kinds of ‘pet projects’ unrelated to the core function of the bureaus."" The e-mail clearly states that those projects are ""the reasoning"" for the high rates, leaving the impression that they’re the main cause, if not the only one.

A closer look reveals they are a relatively small part the rising rates, shadowed by much larger projects.

The statement contains some element of truth in that these project contribute to increased rates, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, particularly larger projects like the $1.4 billion Big Pipe.

"['Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Dave Hansen']","
Wisconsin Sen. Dave Hansen says state budget forces someone making $12,000 a year to pay $4,000 in health insurance costs
","Work on the Republican-authored state budget is all over, capped by Gov. Scott Walker’s signature June 30, 2013. But the shouting continues. State Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) protested after the Associated Press reported that a GOP real-estate agent wrote to Walker about buying state office buildings while the Legislature considered Walker’s budget -- which ended competitive bidding for such sales. ""The ink on the budget wasn’t even dry,"" Hansen claimed in a July 19, 2013 news release, ""before one of these wealthy Republican donors was angling for a sweetheart deal from a political party that appears all too eager to reward their friends."" Hansen included an income-tax break and an expanded voucher-school program among the ""rewards,"" but it was a health-care claim on Hansen’s list that caught our eye. The GOP budget, he said, included a move ""forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year."" So, by Hansen’s calculation, the state budget means low-income people will be pushed into the private market and find themselves spending fully one-third of their income on health care. Hansen is talking about Walker’s controversial decision to reject the federal Medicaid expansion and instead require some 90,000 poor people to get coverage from the new private insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, under Obamacare. Critics, including Democrats such as Hansen, said that despite federal subsidies a chunk of those people would not be able to afford private insurance from the exchanges. Currently, those people have very limited out-of-pocket costs under the state’s BadgerCare Plus health program. Hansen, in his blast at the budget, puts a hard number on the challenge facing some people with his $12,000/$4,000 scenario. The two numbers are familiar to experts who track how the Obamacare exchanges will work in Wisconsin. At an income of $12,000 -- just above the federal poverty line of $11,490 -- an individual will no longer be eligible for state BadgerCare coverage and will have to move into the federal exchanges. The $4,000 is a worst-case scenario figure for out-of-pocket costs in the exchanges for a family of two with a household income of up to 200 percent of the official federal poverty level, notes Jon Peacock, research director at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal advocacy and research group. But Hansen muffs the illustration using the two figures. One big problem is he mixes an income level for one person with the costs facing a household of two. A single person with an income of $12,000 would pay about $240 a year in insurance premiums, and if serious health problems arise could pay up to an additional $2,100 in out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance), said Peacock and Sonya Schwartz, a member of the research faculty at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. That adds up to a possible total outlay of almost $2,400 -- one-fifth of the cited income -- not the $4,000 or one-third that Hansen says. No small change in either case, but it makes for a big difference. A couple of final notes. The $4,000 cost figure Hansen cites could come into play for married couples, for instance, but only if their combined income was above $15,510 -- higher than the $12,000 Hansen cites. Most of the people who would be moved from BadgerCare, though, would be single parents with custody of a child. The child would stay on BadgerCare, however. The  maximum costs for a parent who is right at the poverty level would be around $2,400. They jump up to over $4,000 for a single parent making $30,000, Peacock said. So, Hansen’s specific example is significantly off the mark -- and that’s especially problematic because he’s talking about the worst-case scenario to begin with. Our rating Hansen sought to highlight the biggest impact on a group of poor people when he said the Republican move will have the effect of ""forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year."" But Hansen errs in the example and significantly overstates the effect. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/26/dave-hansen/wisconsin-sen-dave-hansen-says-state-budget-forces/
"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Federal Budget', 'Karen Handel']","
Immigration bill includes several nods to industries
","Congress still hasn’t passed a comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy, and the outlook does not look good for any timely action. Last month the U.S. Senate approved its immigration bill, but a plan from the House could be delayed until September. Georgia’s Capitol Hill crew of lawmakers has weighed in on the issue. And so have those running for office. Last week, Karen Handel, one of the major candidates seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, entered the fray. In an email and Twitter post, Handel denounced the legislation. ""The Senate immigration bill is over 1,000 pages long; filled with things like: rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos; and does not even secure the border."" Lawmakers are not known for their brevity, and we knew the final Senate bill was more than 1,000 pages. What piqued our interest was Handel’s claims about the rewards included for various industries. Those industries didn’t seem like key immigration components to us. We dug for more details. Handel further criticizes the Senate bill in a longer statement posted on her campaign website. ""The bill is equivalent to the amnesty measures passed in the '80s that, in large part, got us into this mess in the first place,"" part of the message states. ""It is heavy on rewarding illegal immigrants, light on border enforcement, and it's as loaded with pork as a rib cook off!"" Handel spokesman Dan McLagan pointed us to several news reports of the provisions written into the Senate amendment. A USA Today article provided the most detail. These provisions, or ""rewards"" as Handel calls them, are part of a compromise amendment to the Senate bill. We’ll look at them individually: Au pair agencies This part of Handel’s claim centers on the J-1 cultural-exchange visitor visa program, which allows foreigners to enter the United States under a variety of categories ranging from camp counselors to professor and research scholars. About 350,000 people enter the U.S. under J-1 visas each year, including about 20,000 au pairs. The Senate bill initially included language eliminating fees that recruiters charge foreign students to work in the U.S. But au pair agencies -- and other employee recruiting and placement agencies -- say the fees were necessary to cover administrative and travel costs for the au pairs. A compromise included in the Senate amendment still allows the fees but requires them to be set and regulated by the State Department. (Sec. 3911 of the bill) Alaskan seafood processors The final bill also includes a provision that would help the seafood industry in Alaska by allowing processors to bring in seasonal seafood workers under the summer work travel visa program. The Obama administration banned this practice last year to protect foreign exchange students from jobs the government considered dangerous. The Senate bill also includes a provision designating seafood processing as a shortage occupation, thus making it eligible for longer-term guest workers under a new visa program. (Sec. 4408) Vegas casinos This item is included in a provision of the bill that effectively extends the Corporation for Travel Promotion forever. The CTP, which has been renamed Brand USA, is a federal program designed to promote U.S. tourism abroad. It is funded by a tax on international visitors and receives up to $100 million in federal funds to match funds raised from the private sector. That federal funding would have expired in 2015, but it was extended with no end date. (Sec. 1102) When the Travel Promotion Act was passed in 2009 establishing the tourism promotion program, the hotels along the Las Vegas strip, which would benefit from the extra visitors, thanked Sen. Harry  Reid, D-Nev., for his help in getting the bill passed. We checked with immigration experts about the Senate bill and Handel’s statement. The general thrust of the statement is accurate, the experts said, but they noted that ""rewards"" is a subjective word choice. To sum up, Handel said that the Senate immigration bill contains ""rewards"" for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos.The provisions cited for the three industries are included in the legislation, along with several others. The items were part of deals fought for by industry lobbyists and included to garner support for the bill. Whether that classifies them as ""rewards"" is a matter of opinion -- in this case, Handel’s opinion.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says deficit is falling at the fastest rate in 60 years
","President Barack Obama aimed to refocus the national debate and put the economy front and center with a speech at Knox College in Illinois. It was the same place he spoke as a senator in 2005 about the need for the government to help the middle class. He stuck to that theme in this speech, but now as president, he summarized the improvements that have come on his watch. He talked about millions of new jobs, burgeoning energy production, and the nation’s improving balance sheet. ""Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years,"" Obama told the crowd. In light of Obama’s ongoing battle with Republicans over taxes and spending, we thought this would be an interesting claim to examine. In this factcheck, we look at whether we are really seeing one of the most rapid declines in the deficit in many decades. As a reminder, the deficit is a snapshot of one year’s fiscal outlook. It’s the shortfall between what the government spends and what the government collects in taxes and other revenues. The White House press office told us that the proof is in the numbers. They tracked the deficit as a percent of the entire economy, measured as the Gross Domestic Product. In 2009, the first year of Obama’s presidency, after tax cuts and new spending, the deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP. In 2012, the deficit declined to 7 percent of GDP. So that’s a decline of 3.1 percentage points. You have to go back 63 years to the period between 1946 and 1949 to find a bigger four-year drop than what the country saw between 2009 and 2012. Right after World War II ended, the U.S. deficit stood at 7.2 percent of GDP. By 1949, America had a surplus of 0.2 percent. So that’s a decline of 7.4 percentage points. We downloaded data from the Office of Management and Budget that shows the deficit as a percent of GDP all the way back to 1930. When we ran the numbers, we found, as Obama said, you need to go back to 1946 to find a larger change. The numbers game As with any statistics, you have to be careful, and to help us be careful, we contacted five economists and policy analysts. The White House simply did a little subtraction to measure the difference between the numbers at the start and the end of the four years. There is another option, which is to look at the relative size of the decline. So if the deficit went from 10.1 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP, that means the deficit dropped 30 percent.  But when we did this going back to World War II, we saw some very strange results. Big deficit declines could look smaller in relative terms than small declines. Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that seeks to reduce deficits faster than the president has done, confirmed that point. Peuquet said the administration has the right approach, because relative numbers can make very different changes look the same. Peuquet gave the example of a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in the first year and 0.5 percent after four years. ""That would look like a 50 percent improvement in the level,"" Peuquet said. ""However, a change in deficits that went from 10 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP would also register as a 50 percent improvement – despite being a much larger change in relation to the economy."" Peuquet and others raised a second statistical issue -- choosing the endpoints for the comparison. It’s a common device to pick the range that best proves your point. But in the case of deficit reduction, no one quibbled with the idea that longer periods are more revealing, and Obama used all the years he has available. His first year in office was 2009 and the numbers for 2013 are not yet in. To the extent that a majority view emerged, economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley probably expressed it best. ""There is no single ‘correct’ way of doing the analysis,"" Auerbach said, ""but I would say that their approach is a reasonable one."" One reason Obama is able to point to an historically high decline is because the deficit as a percent of GDP had never been higher.  Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group focused on taxes and spending, said the reduction is significant. But at the same time, he said, ""Let’s face it, there was a lot to reduce. The deficit was morbidly obese."" Similarly, the economy took a major hit which gave it more room for improvement in historic terms. So even a moderate recovery has eased the deficit by both increasing tax receipts and reducing demand for government aid such as unemployment support. Lastly, while the deficit might decline, the country’s accumulated debt is projected to grow. ""The future path is not captured in snapshots of what happened over the past few years, Peuquet said. ""It ignores the unsustainable debt trajectory the country still faces."" Our ruling Barack Obama said the deficit has fallen at the fastest rate in 60 years. While economists vary on how to best measure that decline, the president used an acceptable approach and his numbers are accurate. There are no statistical tricks in play. Our experts warned against reading too much into Obama’s claim. While Obama did not spend much time one way or the other on the significance of the decline in the deficit, he didn’t mention ongoing concerns over the national debt. We rate the statement True.

Barack Obama says top 1 percent saw incomes quadruple, while typical family saw theirs barely budge
","A reader asked us to check a dramatic statistic on income inequality from President Barack Obama’s recent speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill. ""The income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged,"" Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech. When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, a spokesman pointed us to a study published in late 2011 by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budget-analysis arm of Congress. The study looked at income trends between 1979 and 2007 for various income levels, including the top 1 percent. CBO found that over that period, the top 1 percent’s inflation-adjusted, after-tax income rose by a cumulative 275 percent. Over 28 years, that averages to almost a 10 percent increase each year. That’s not quite quadrupling -- a 300 percent increase would have been a quadrupling -- but Obama did say ""nearly quadrupled,"" and we think that qualifies. As for Obama’s claim that the ""typical family’s incomes barely budged,"" that seems on target, too. For the 60 percent of the population in the middle of the income scale -- that is, excluding the top one-fifth and the bottom one-fifth of earners -- the cumulative growth in inflation-adjusted, after-tax household income was just under 40 percent. That may sound like a healthy increase, but it actually averages to just 1.4 percent per year. While an income increase of 1.4 percent a year above inflation does mean the middle 60 percent advanced economically during the period studied, the increase was only about one-seventh as fast as it was for the top 1 percent. In this context, we think the description ""barely budged"" is reasonable. We should point out that the CBO’s findings about the top 1 percent were a little different than the conclusions we drew in a previous fact-check. But there’s a good reason why. We calculated that income for the top 1 percent grew between 1979 and 2008 by 169 percent, well below the 275 percent the CBO found. Our calculation was based on data compiled by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who are specialists in income inequality. However, the Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains. Capital gains refers to income earned from investments such as stocks, and the lion's share of the nation’s capital gains go to the very wealthy. The CBO data, unlike the data from Piketty and Saez, included capital gains income, so that explains the discrepancy. Our ruling Obama said ""the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged."" Calculations by the CBO, a highly credible agency, show an increase of 275 percent for the top 1 percent, which is pretty close to quadrupling. And for average households, income rose by comparatively modest amounts. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-top-1-percent-saw-incomes-quadru/

Americans for Prosperity says Patrick Murphy flip-flopped in votes on health care
","Americans for Prosperity, a group opposed to Obamacare, called U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, a hypocrite for his votes on the health care law. The group announced that it had started running online ads nationwide to highlight votes House members took to delay ObamaCare mandates. In Florida, the ads are targeting three South Florida Democrats: Murphy, Lois Frankel and Joe Garcia. (All three members are in their first terms -- Murphy and Garcia are expected to face competitive races in 2014.) A July 23 press release from the group stated: ""Rep. Murphy voted for the law back in 2010, yet he reversed himself and voted to delay both the employer mandate (in keeping with President Obama’s decision) and the individual mandate..."" and then continued about Garcia’s and Frankel’s votes. The press release portrayed Murphy as a flip-flopper: did he vote for Obamacare in 2010 and then vote to delay the employer and individual mandate? (AFP supports delaying the mandates and repealing the health care law.) The problem with this claim that leapt out at us was that Murphy -- as in Patrick Murphy who represents parts of Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties -- wasn’t a member of Congress in 2010. Murphy beat U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, in November 2012 and officially took office in January 2013. There was a Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy in 2010 -- but he was from Pennsylvania and lost re-election in 2010. (To make matters more complicated there is a U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa.) We asked an Americans for Prosperity spokesman if it had mixed up Patrick Murphys. ""Yes, that’s an error, it was a mix-up with Murphy from PA. We sent out a corrected release a couple minutes later,"" spokesman Christopher Neefus told PolitiFact Florida in an email July 24. At PolitiFact, we give props to folks who admit to their errors -- and the group did ‘fess up quickly. But we still continue our fact-check. In this case, when we looked at AFP’s newsroom page about Florida on July 24, it still contained the press release with the wrong information about Murphy. The online banner ad doesn’t contain the error -- it simply says ""Patrick Murphy voted to delay the ObamaCare mandate. Now let’s end it for good."" Murphy’s position on Obamacare On the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. Specifically, he liked the provisions offering coverage for young people on their parents’ plans, fixing the doughnut hole to get prescription drugs for seniors, and forcing insurers to offer coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms. That requirement was later repealed. In office, Murphy has continued that general stance of supporting the law overall while calling for ""improvements."" AFP correctly pointed to separate votes Murphy took for a one-year delay for the employer and individual mandates on July 17. Murphy was one of 35 Democrats to join the Republicans on the employer mandate vote and one of 22 on the individual mandate. (Murphy’s votes help him build the case that he is a moderate. The liberal Daily Kos pointed out that more than half of those 22 Democrats won close races.) The Democratic-leaning Senate is not expected to vote in favor of the delays. In early July, Obama said he would delay enforcement of the employer mandate. The Palm Beach Post quoted Murphy about the mandate votes:  ""While I believe these delays are important,"" he said – to give the administration time to work out complexities in the law – ""I do not support a wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is already providing important protections and security to individuals and families who previously didn’t have access to affordable, quality health insurance."" Murphy does not support full repeal of the mandates but does support a one-year delay. Our ruling Americans For Prosperity said in a press release: ""Rep. Murphy voted for the law back in 2010, yet he reversed himself and voted to delay both the employer mandate (in keeping with President Obama’s decision) and the individual mandate."" The group quickly admitted that Murphy of Florida wasn’t in Congress in 2010, so that part of the claim is wrong. While campaigning in 2012, Murphy said he was generally supportive of the law although he called for some changes. The group is also correct that Murphy voted to delay the employer and individual mandates, but their claim leaves readers with a false impression that his voting record reflects flip flops. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/jul/25/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-patrick-murphy-flip-flop/

Sheila Oliver says U.S. Senate is mostly made up of multimillionaires
","Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver says the U.S. Senate doesn’t look enough like the rest of America. It’s mostly just a bunch of multimillionaires, the Essex County Democrat claims. As one of four candidates in the Aug. 13 Democratic primary to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg, Oliver has presented herself to voters as a hard-working individual from humble beginnings. Oliver is competing against Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Congressmen Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. ""Many of our senators have not lived the life of an average working-class person,"" Oliver said in a July 11 interview on NJToday. ""Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires."" For the most part, Oliver’s claim is on the money. Most current senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million, but less than a majority were ""multimillionaires"" with several million dollars, according to an analysis of financial disclosure forms by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The Washington, D.C.-based center’s analysis is based on financial disclosure forms filed by members of Congress when they were already in office or running as candidates last year. After subtracting the liabilities from the assets, the center estimates a range of net worth. The most recent data available on the center’s website covers 2011 and includes 98 of the 100 current senators. Only Sen. Jeff Chiesa of New Jersey -- who was appointed as an interim replacement for Lautenberg -- and Brian Schatz of Hawaii are not included in the database of personal finances for 2011. Of those 98 current senators, 62 had an average net worth of more than $1 million, according to the center. Among those 62 senators, 13 had between $1 million and $2 million; 6 had between $2 million and $3 million; and 43 senators had more than $3 million, the center states. Based on those 2011 figures, the wealthiest senator was Mark Warner of Virginia, who had an average net worth of slightly more than $228 million, according to the center. The poorest senator was Florida’s Marco Rubio with negative $45,494 in average net worth, the center states. The annual salary for most senators is $174,000. Senate leaders earn $193,400 per year. Since less than a majority of senators had an average net worth of several million dollars in 2011, Oliver’s claim about ""multimillionaires"" is slightly off. Still, most senators at least had more than $1 million. In response to our findings, Oliver spokesman Michael Makarski made the following statement: ""Speaker Oliver was making the point that average working and middle class people are underrepresented, and that Congress and Washington in general are out of touch with mainstream Americans."" Some political science experts said the number of millionaires in the Senate is related to the expense of running a Senate campaign and the prestige of being a senator. ""The Senate is the big boy's and big girl's...sandbox,"" Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said in an e-mail. ""You get all your calls returned."" Richard Arenberg of Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions, who worked on Capitol Hill for about 34 years, also noted how wealthier individuals are more likely able to meet the demands of running for Senate and maintaining the office. ""My theory would be that it is a challenge to live the lifestyle expected of a senator, including maintaining homes in Washington and their home states, if the senator is living solely on a senator's salary,"" Arenberg said in an e-mail. ""The campaign demands also play a role in the sense that a campaign for the Senate these days takes a fulltime commitment for up to two years,"" Arenberg added. ""Many people cannot break from their careers and make the financial sacrifice to do that."" Our ruling In an NJToday interview, Oliver claimed: ""Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires."" Based on financial data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, 62 current senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million. Of those senators, 13 had between $1 million and $2 million; 6 had between $2 million and $3 million; and 43 senators had more than $3 million. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: After this story was published, we learned that Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey is included in the database of personal finances for 2011 as a congressman. We have revised the story to show that 62 senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million.",/factchecks/2013/jul/25/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-says-us-senate-mostly-made-multi-mil/
