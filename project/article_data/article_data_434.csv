Wisconsin Medical Society president says doctors could be charged if women don’t return for follow-up care after drug-induced abortions
","
The debate over a Republican-sponsored measure that requires new medical protocols in abortions has spawned confusion -- and its own debate -- over liability for doctors.

The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker in April, added penalties if physicians perform medication-induced abortions without an in-person exam before the procedure -- a move aimed at blocking the potential use of so-called ""webcam abortions"" in Wisconsin. Medication-induced abortions are limited to the first nine weeks of pregnancy.  

The law also required that doctors tell patients they ""must return"" for a post-abortion follow-up appointment at the same facility within 12 to 18 days instead of, for example, seeing their primary care doctor where they live. Critics, such as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, say this places an undue burden on women, especially in rural areas.

Indeed, in the wake of the law, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said April 20, 2012 it would stop providing medication-induced abortions, citing legal uncertainty for doctors.

The bill’s passage also drew a strong reaction from the Wisconsin Medical Society, which said the law intruded on the patient-doctor relationship.

In an April 19 interview with the Wisconsin State Journal, the society’s new physician-president, Tosha Wetterneck of Madison, spoke about the mandate that women return to the same facility for follow-up care.

The story paraphrased Wetterneck’s remark this way: ""If she refuses, or prefers to see her personal physician, the patient would face no penalty but the doctor could be charged, Wetterneck said.""

The remark prompting a reproductive rights group, RH Reality Check, to say that doctors could face a Class I felony and up to 42 months in jail if the patient does not return for the recommended visit. Its Web posting cited Wetterneck’s comment.

Meanwhile, state Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, author of the original bill, denounced critics’ descriptions of it as ""grossly misstated,"" and the claim about criminal charges when patients no-show as ""patently false.""

So, who’s right?

Can doctors be charged if a patient fails to do something?

While debate rages on about the broad impact of the law -- critics say it limits access to the procedure, proponents say it protects women from substandard care -- we found wide agreement on this narrow question.

The consensus: Doctors could face a fine of up to $10,000 if they don’t advise women to return in 12 to 18 days -- but not criminal liability.

And the forfeiture only applies if the doctor fails to inform -- it’s not dependent on what a patient does later.

We heard that from Lazich and Wisconsin Right to Life, but also the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, a state government agency that analyzed the bill -- and even the Medical Society itself.

They all said that even though the bill says patients have to be told they ""must return,"" there is no accountability built into the law for either the woman or the physician if the woman does not come back.

So why was Wetterneck of the Medical Society quoted as saying doctors could be charged?

Medical Society lobbyist Mark Grapentine told us Wetterneck is not a lawyer and likely thought ""charged"" was an appropriate description even for forfeitures. He said she and the Medical Society understood the lack of criminal penalties for the no-return scenario, while strongly objecting to felony liability for other aspects of drug abortion protocols.

We think the term ""charged"" would be heard by most listeners as a reference to criminal liability -- as evidenced by the reaction from RH Reality Check.

Perhaps confusion on the issue was inevitable.

The law does create a criminal felony penalty for failing to follow certain procedures related to a medication-induced abortion. Just not the protocol on the post-abortion follow-up.

Specifically, Act 217 requires that the same doctor who prescribes the drugs do the pre-procedure exam and be physically present when the drug is given. Bill authors say those rules were aimed to block use of Web cameras to consult with women about the drugs, as is done in some states to make abortions more possible in rural areas. By law, at least 24 hours must pass between the patient’s voluntary consent and an abortion.

The potential criminal penalty on that point, for the person who provides the drugs, is up to 42 months imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.

Our conclusion

The president of the Medical Society said a new abortion law means doctors could be charged if patients don’t return for a follow-up appointment after a drug-induced abortion.

On that specific portion of the law, no criminal liability was inserted, and doctors’ duty is limited to orally informing the patient she must return.

There is a new criminal penalty for failing to personally supervise such abortions, but Wetterneck clearly was referring to the follow-up care section of the bill.

We rate her statement False.

Samuel 'Joe the Plumber' Wurzelbacher says Barack Obama's parents were communists
","
Ohio congressional candidate Samuel ""Joe the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher first gained national attention after querying presidential candidate Barack Obama’s about tax policy during a televised 2008 campaign appearance in the Toledo area.

As the GOP nominee to challenge Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 election, Wurzelbacher recently made news again when the Christian Broadcasting Network website published a letter he wrote about Obama’s religious faith as well as his own Christian beliefs. Wurzelbacher told the website he plans to distribute the letter titled: ‘I’m Blessed to be a Christian,"" to churches during his upcoming congressional campaign.

Wurzelbacher’s letter doesn’t address Kaptur. It mostly dwells on Obama. Wurzelbacher says he believes Obama is a Christian, and it’s not Christian for people to say otherwise.

Wurzelbacher’s letter also provided a colorful rendition of Obama’s background:

""Imagine being the child of a mixed-race marriage - especially in the turbulent 60’s and free-wheeling 70’s,"" his letter said. ""And when you throw in that dad was a Muslim and mom an atheist - you know it could not have been easy - and they were communists for crying out loud!""

Communists? That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We thought we’d check out Wurzelbacher’s claim. 
When asked for evidence that Obama’s parents were communists, Wurzelbacher’s campaign spokesman Reece Collins supplied a 2007 Chicago Tribune article about Obama’s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. The article stated that Dunham attended a Washington state high school where a teacher asked students to read ""The Communist Manifesto"" and the school board chairman told the House Un-American Activities Subcommittee that he had been a communist Party member. A classmate of Dunham’s called her ""a fellow traveler,"" and claimed ""We were liberals before we knew what liberals were.""

The Merriam Webster dictionary says the term ""fellow traveler"" describes someone who ""sympathizes with and often furthers the ideals and program of an organized group (as the Communist Party) without membership in the group or regular participation in its activities."" While the expression often describes people with communist leanings, Dunham’s classmate appears to apply it towards her liberal sympathies. Nor does graduating from a high school where students read the ""TheCommunist Manifesto"" and a school board member was a Communist party member mean that Dunham herself was a communist, as Wurzelbacher alleges.

Claims that Obama’s estranged father was a communist are more widespread on conservative websites. Collins forwarded a profile of Obama from DiscoverLinks which describes the senior Obama as ""a communist who had left his rural Luo-speaking village and his own Muslim father to become an agnostic and study economics abroad."" Several editorials in the conservative Investor’s Business Daily also call Obama’s father a ""communist.""

Many claims that the senior Obama was a communist derive from a 1965 article he authored in East Africa Journal. The article titled ""Problems Facing Our Socialism,"" critiques an earlier economic paper released by Kenya’s government. In it, the elder Obama argues for removing ""the disparities in our country such as the concentration of economic power in Asian and European hands while not destroying what has already been achieved and at the same time assimilating these groups to build one country.""

""What is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all and at the same time be able to channel some of these gains to future production,"" Obama’s father wrote. ""This is the government’s obligation: it should have come out with a plan in the paper to achieve this.""

When Politico tracked down the 1965 paper before the last presidential election, it sought an evaluation from Kenya expert Raymond Omwami, an economist who was a visiting UCLA professor. Omwami told Politico that the elder Obama didn’t endorse radical politics, but instead criticized the policies of Kenya’s Ministry of Economic Planning and Development, ""which applied African socialism principles to the country’s ongoing political upheaval."" Omwami said Obama’s paper responded to a government document that suggested Kenya should concentrate its financial aid in more populous areas in hopes that positive effects would trickle down to smaller villages.

""The critics of this article are making a big mistake,"" Omwami told Politico. ""They are assuming Obama senior is the one who came up with this concept of African socialism, but that’s totally wrong. Based on that, they’re imbuing in him the idea that he himself is a socialist, but he is not.""

Omwami told Politico he would instead refer to the elder Obama as ""a liberal person who believed in market forces but understood its limitations.""  

To settle the question of whether Obama’s parents were communists, we also consulted authors of a pair of books about the president, who have extensively researched the president’s background.

Harvard University historian James T. Kloppenberg, who wrote a 2010 book on Obama’s intellectual roots called ""Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition,"" says he’s confident that Obama’s parents were not communists.

""Obama’s mother was left of center, as was his father,"" Kloppenberg wrote in an email. ""But I found no evidence to indicate that either of them ever affiliated with any Communist movements.""

Likewise, Cincinnati native David Mendell, a former Chicago Tribune political writer who authored a biography of Obama titled ""Obama: From Promise to Power,"" also says there’s no evidence to back up Wurzelbacher’s assertion that Obama’s parents were communists.

Mendell calls Obama’s mother ""a traditional Adlai Stevenson liberal,"" and said it’s unlikely that Obama’s largely absent father was a communist because ""there aren’t many communist economists.""

Mendell said his research didn’t unearth any communist ties to Obama’s Indonesian stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, an oil company employee. And Mendell says the maternal grandmother who played a big role in raising Obama, Madelyn Dunham, was a conservative Republican.

""I have never heard him or anyone in his family espouse any kinship with the old Soviet Union,"" Mendell said of Obama.

The evidence that Wurzelbacher produced doesn’t back his claim. There does not seem to be any proof that Obama’s mother was a communist. Nor does the 1965 paper authored by Obama’s estranged father verify that he was a communist. And authors of books on Obama say there’s no evidence that Obama’s parents were communists.

How costly is Atlanta gridlock? Nearly $1,000 per person, group says
","
So how much time and money do you lose being stuck in traffic each year?

""The average Atlanta resident ... spends an extra $924 each year in additional gasoline and wasted time,"" Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in a flier that began to fill the mailboxes of many residents in mid-April.

That’s about enough money to buy a fairly nice flat-screen television or two nights in the Deluxe Room at the St. Regis hotel in Buckhead or season tickets on the Terrace View level for the Atlanta Braves.

There’s plenty to do with $924, but does it really cost us that much additional money each year when we’re tapping our brakes trying to get to and from work? PolitiFact Georgia went on the road in search for answers.

Citizens for Transportation Mobility is hoping this statistic and other information the group has shared will encourage enough drivers to support a 1 percent sales tax to fund dozens of transportation projects it believes will improve traffic throughout the region. A voter referendum will be on the July 31 ballot.

Citizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long sent PolitiFact Georgia a report by the Texas Transportation Institute that it used as basis for the claim. Since 1982, the institute has released an annual Urban Mobility Report that examines traffic in hundreds of American cities and metropolitan areas. The 2011 report, which was released in September, showed the $924 estimate that Citizens for Transportation Mobility mentioned in the flier. The report relied on data compiled in 2010.

The institute used a detailed formula that examined travel time during peak (rush) hours in Atlanta, how much gas was wasted and the amount of time lost while not at work or being late to the kids’ track meet. It used Consumer Price Index data to estimate the cost of time, $16.30 an hour per person, and $88.12 an hour for commercial motorists. The average number of people in each vehicle during peak period travel is 1.25, the institute calculated.

The report on Atlanta said the average gas price in 2010 was $2.60 a gallon, with diesel fuel going for $2.88 a gallon. The estimates seemed reasonable. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed a half-dozen Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles written throughout 2010 that showed the average price for a gallon of regular gas in this area ranged from $2.53 to $2.83.

The researchers concluded that the average Atlanta motorist spent 43 excess hours in traffic during those peak hours and wasted an additional 20 gallons of fuel.

The report accounted for lighter traffic during holidays and came up with measurements for the average speed on interstate highways and widely traveled roads.

The institute’s 2010 Atlanta figure was close to the 2009 total per commuter of $913 and the 2008 number of $938. Interestingly, the 2006 total per Atlanta commuter was $1,578 and fell dramatically to $1,066 in 2007. Institute researcher Tim Lomax said there was an error around that time due to ""a redefinition of the urban area and population jumped a lot.""

The loudest criticism to the research has come from CEOs for Cities, which describes itself as a civic laboratory for today’s urban leaders. Its co-chairmen have included former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and prominent developer Charles Ratner.

Economist Joe Cortright reviewed the 2010 Urban Mobility Report for CEOs for Cities and concluded the report used a flawed approach to come up with travel times and inaccurate speed volume models, and that it also has not corrected earlier overestimated traffic congestion and associated economic costs. Cortright’s criticism has been circulated by several transportation and urban research organizations.

The institute put together a seven-page reply to the critique. It said it improved some of its methodology before the criticism was made. It said better fuel estimates were used for the 2011 report. It noted that estimates were used for its speed/volume models, but it countered that it is nearly impossible to track every vehicle trip made by a motorist.

Some, like University of Connecticut civil and environmental engineering professor Norman Garrick, say the report doesn’t take into account other costs: such as health care and the environment. Garrick and others have created their own transportation index and determined the average Georgia household pays as much as 50 percent more to cover costs than people in states such as Massachusetts and New York.

""The difference between Georgia and these more competitive states: less transit, more highways, and more sprawl,"" Garrick, who was in Switzerland, told us via email.

There’s no criticism about the $924 estimate, but there are critiques about how the Texas Transportation Institute reached its conclusion. The TTI research is thorough. But it is based, in part, on estimates.

"['Tennessee', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Bill Haslam']","
Gov. Haslam says Tennessee led nation in income growth
","
In a speech to the Carter County Republican Party’s ""Reagan Day"" gathering, Gov. Bill Haslam hailed the accomplishments of himself and Republicans controlling the state legislature in leading Tennessee to better times.

After repeating some oft-heard declarations about cutting the state budget and ""aggressive"" pursuit of new jobs by creating a business-friendly environment, he added a new claim to exemplify the results of Republican leadership.

""In Tennessee – personal income is growing faster in Tennessee on average than any other state in the country,"" the governor said as he concluded his remarks.

We hadn’t heard that and decided to check the veracity. And because the claim was made as he touted his accomplishments, we'll also factor in the extent to which the growth in income was created by the official or their policies.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, released its latest report on personal income growth on March 28, providing a 50-state list based on 2011 figures.

Here is the first paragraph of the BEA’s news release:

""State personal income rose an average 5.1 percent in 2011 after rising 3.7 percent in 2010, according to estimates released today by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. State personal income growth ranged from 3.4 percent in Maine to 8.1 percent in North Dakota. Inflation, as measured by the national price index for personal consumption expenditures, increased to 2.5 percent in 2011 from 1.8 percent in 2010.""

North Dakota, then, not Tennessee, is deemed No. 1 in the nation.

The tables accompanying the release show Tennessee’s per capita growth in personal income for 2011 was 5.4 percent, increasing from $34,921 to $36,533. That was the 16th highest percentage increase in the nation, which is pretty good, but some distance from the top.

David Smith, spokesman for the governor, said the BEA report was, indeed, the source of his information and noted that there were media reports stating that Tennessee had the highest percentage increase in the Southeast and that the rate ""was one of the best in the nation.""

He and Alexia Poe, communications director for the Haslam administration, acknowledged the governor had made a mistake. The comment came at the end of a long day that included events in Nashville and Knoxville before making it to Elizabethton for the evening partisan speech. Poe said Haslam ""perhaps melded two comments together"" – that Tennessee leads in the Southeast and that is one of the highest averages in the nation.

As for being tops in the Southeast, a couple of points may be worth noting to put Tennessee’s standing in perspective. One is that Texas is not considered part of the Southeast. And another -- the Southeast ranked lowest in average personal income among the eight regions listed by the BEA. The top region is New England with an average income of $51,074.

The Southeastern per capita personal income average in 2011 was $37,472 versus the national average of $41,683. And Tennessee’s average income, even after the growth in 2011, is still below the Southeastern average.

In rating states for average personal income, not growth, Tennessee last year was No. 36 in the nation, up one notch from 37th in 2010.

As for credit for the income growth? When we evaluated Haslam’s claim about job growth, we determined it was a stretch to say a governor in his first year in office had much real impact on improved economic numbers, based in part on the evaluation of economists.

Malcolm Getz, a Vanderbilt University economics professor, said it’s also a little premature of Haslam to start claiming or otherwise implying credit for income growth. ""Governor Haslam's programs are unlikely to have had any significant effect in 2011,"" he said. ""For the most part, the effect of policy shifts accumulate over several years. The main forces that drive economic growth are out of the control of governors.""

One huge ""force"" is the national economy, and Tennessee’s 5.4 percent growth was just above the national average. So even if this involved a governor who had been in office for several years, it’s clear that Tennessee benefitted from national patterns not directly related to specific state policy.

Our ruling

Even if it was a mistake made at the conclusion of a long day, Haslam told an audience that personal income was growing faster in Tennessee than in any other state -- something that we see on video and that was then reported by a newspaper. In fact, 15 states showed better per capita income growth than Tennessee did, and the state only outpaced the national average by 0.3 percent.

He also, in our determination, is trying to take premature credit for income growth that for the most part occurred before any of his policies had been put into place.

We rule the governor’s claim False.",/factchecks/2012/apr/27/bill-haslam/gov-haslam-says-tennessee-led-nation-income-growth/

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says Obama administration gave $1.5 billion to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood
","
Foreign policy was one of the issues that came up when U.S. Senate candidate Benjamin ""Barry"" Hinckley was interviewed on ""State of the State,"" a cable television public affairs program that aired April 21 and 22.

Hinckley, a Republican, was critical of foreign aid, and specifically questioned one of the aid decisions of the Obama administration. He was struggling a bit as he made his point, but here's what he said:

""Obama gave the Muslim Brotherhood a million [then correcting himself] a billion and a half dollars last week, you know, in Egypt. We need that money here. A billion and a half dollars could really help Rhode Island, quite frankly. We probably need it, in my opinion, more than the Muslim Brotherhood needs it . . . especially when the Muslim Brotherhood got together, I think one of the first things they did, when they convened their new congress, was to make Israel enemy #1. And we give them a billion and a half dollars? That's a problem in my book. We need to focus our resources here.""

The Muslim Brotherhood has been a part of Egyptian politics -- sometimes an outlawed part -- since 1928; one of its goals is to promote Sharia law, which is the moral code and religious law of Islam.

Did the Obama administration really give the Brotherhood $1.5 billion?

It turns out that the money was actually an aid package to Egypt itself, not the Brotherhood, according to a March 22 story in The Washington Post.

We contacted Hinckley's campaign.

Spokesman Christopher McAuliffe said Hinckley ""is aware that there is a pro forma difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Egypt. In that light, his position could certainly have been more precise. However, I do think the basis of it is readily understandable, since the Egyptian government is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.""

For guidance on that point, we contacted some experts on Egypt.

Melani Cammett, director of the Middle East studies program at Brown University, told us that sending aid to Egypt was not the same as giving it to the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood doesn't actually control the government.

""It's true that the Muslim Brotherhood won the plurality of seats [in December elections] and when you combine them with the Salafis, which are more radical Islamists, they've won the majority of seats in the parliament,"" she said. ""The fact of the matter is the SCAF, which is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, still controls the government and controls the executive branch and is manipulating things in such a way that it's making it difficult for the Islamists to exert their full power as the majority in parliament.""

""So the major struggle going on in Egyptian politics right now is that the SCAF, controlled by elite military officers, is not willing to relinquish power,"" said Cammett.

John P. Entelis, director of Middle East studies at Fordham University, said it would be ""totally inaccurate"" to say that $1.5 billion is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. ""This is an ongoing military aid package that we've been giving to Egypt since 1979.""

The aid package, according to multiple sources, includes $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic and political assistance.

Our ruling

Republican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the Obama administration approved $1.5 billion to go to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.

In fact, the aid package was for the nation of Egypt, not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood may control the largest bloc of seats in parliament, but it's not even a majority. Not only that, the country itself continues, for now at least, to be controlled by the military. And more than 80 percent of the aid package is military aid.

The statement is incorrect for so many reasons, we rate it False.

Mitt Romney says youth unemployment rate is double what it is for all Americans
","
For the third time in recent weeks, Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign has released an ""infographic"" that criticizes President Barack Obama’s jobs record for key demographic groups. First came women, then Hispanics, and now youth.

One of its claims got our attention: ""The youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans."" The graphic goes on to say that the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent overall and 16.4 percent for youth.

When we looked at data compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that these numbers referred to the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Americans 16 years and older (the category the graphic calls ""all"") and ages 16 to 24 (the category it calls ""youth"").

We confirmed that those numbers are correct. However, we wondered the 2-to-1 ratio was unique to Obama.

It’s not. Not by a long shot.

We downloaded historical BLS unemployment rate data for the two age ranges, then divided the ""all"" number by the ""youth"" number. Going back to January 2001, the month President George W. Bush took office, the ratio of the two unemployment rates has been remarkably consistent.

Over that 135-month period, the ratio has barely budged, ranging only from 1.9 to 2.4. That’s essentially the same 2-to-1 ratio that the Romney graphic used to criticize Obama’s record on youth jobs.

In other words, the two statistics essentially move in lockstep, regardless of whether the broader job market is in a period of modest growth, general stability or precipitous decline.

In fact, if you average together all the monthly ratios under Obama, it’s lower than it was under Bush. The average ratio under Obama was 1.9, compared to 2.2 under Bush.

While it’s accurate to say the two unemployment figures are in a 2-to-1 ratio today, ""it’s a meaningless, or perhaps misleading, statistic for people who are unaware that the youth unemployment rate is always well above the unemployment rate of people 25 and older,"" said Gary Burtless, a labor and employment economist at the Brookings Institution. (Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Romney does have a point that younger Americans are suffering during the current recession.

We found that in January 2008 -- a year before Obama took office and right after the most recent recession began -- the unemployment rate for Americans 16 to 24 years of age was 11.7 percent. By January 2009, that had surged to 14.9 percent, and it surged again by January 2010 to 18.7 percent. By January 2011, it had begun to recover, dropping to 17.9 percent and falling again by January 2012 to 16.0 percent.

So the unemployment rate has recovered from its high point under Obama, but it’s still significantly above its pre-recession level.

Our ruling

Romney has a point that young Americans are hurting in today’s job market. There’s no question that employment prospects have dried up for many recent high-school and college graduates. But bolstering this argument by making the claim that the ""youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans"" is silly, since that's consistently been the case under both President George W. Bush and Obama. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/apr/26/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-youth-unemployment-rate-double-wh/

Barack Obama says family incomes have fallen by 6 percent
","
During an April 18, 2012, speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio, President Barack Obama painted a picture of economic decline for American families resulting from Republican economic policies.

""I’m always confused when we keep having the same argument with folks who don’t seem to remember how America was built,"" Obama said. ""They keep telling us, well, if we just weaken regulations that keep our air and water clean and protect our consumers, if we just cut everybody’s taxes and convert these investments in community colleges and research and health care into tax cuts especially for the wealthy, that somehow the economy is going to get stronger -- and Ohio and the rest of the country will prosper. That’s the theory.

""Ohio, we tested this theory,"" he continued. ""Take a look at what happened in Ohio between 2000 and 2008. It’s not like we didn’t try it. And instead of faster job growth, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. Instead of broad-based prosperity, the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent. Outsourcing, rampant; phony financial profits all over the place. And instead of strengthening our economy, our entire financial system almost collapsed. We spent the last three and a half years cleaning up after that mess.  So their theory did not work out so well. Maybe they haven’t been paying attention, but it didn’t work out so well.""

This passage includes a lot of claims, but the one we’ll focus on here is whether ""the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about six percent"" during the time when Republican economic policies were in force.

As we typically do with claims of this sort, we’ll look both at the accuracy of the numbers and the question of whether Obama has justification for blaming Republicans for the nation’s economic challenges.

Checking the number

We’ll start by noting that Obama' remarks were confusing. He mentioned ""Ohio between 2000 and 2008,"" but then he spoke of the decline in the incomes of ""the typical American family,"" which would include families outside of Ohio. And the dates he used were mentioned three sentences before the decline in income he cited. Since that’s all we had to go on, though, we began our analysis by looking at national data on family incomes between 2000 and 2008.

We looked at the most straightforward measurement that seemed to fit Obama’s claim -- the median income for families, adjusted for inflation. This is one of the standard measurements taken by the Census Bureau every year.

According to the Census Bureau, the inflation-adjusted median income for families fell from $64,232 in 2000 to $62,299 in 2008, a decline of about 3 percent. That’s half of the 6 percent figure Obama used.

The White House confirmed that it had used the same data set we did but said the 6 percent figure came by comparing the numbers between 2000 and 2010. Indeed, when we checked the math for those years, median family incomes declined by just under 6 percent.

However, doing it this way is problematic.

First, Obama didn’t say 2000 to 2010; he said 2000 to 2008. The two additional years make a big difference, because 2009 and 2010 encompassed one of the weakest economic periods in recent American history.

The White House did point us to two speeches in which Obama accurately described the time period for the 6 percent statistic. However, we’re not sold on the idea that using the period 2000-2010 bolsters his argument that Republican economic policies caused a 6 percent decline in median incomes.

On the one hand, you could argue that Democrats, who controlled the White House and Congress, bear some of the blame for the economic decline in 2009 and 2010. On the other hand, you can argue that Obama doesn’t deserve the economic blame for 2009 and 2010 since the decline was shaped by the policies of his predecessor. But if you do, then it’s not equitable to hold his predecessor, President George W. Bush, to a different standard. If you argue that the economic outcomes in 2009 and 2010 result from Republican policies, then being consistent requires attributing a share of the blame for what happened in 2000 and 2001 to the policies of Bush’s predecessor, President Bill Clinton.

And what happens if you make the calculation using the years 2002 to 2010 instead? It works out to a 3.6 percent decline -- still lower than the 6 percent the president cited.

How much does a president or a party deserve credit or blame for the economy?

We asked several economists of various ideological perspectives how much blame the GOP deserved for the recession that started in December 2007. None said the Republican Party deserved all of the blame, but none said the party deserved no blame at all, either. The consensus was that it was somewhere in the middle.

Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said, ""I fully agree that Republicans deserve a lot of blame. But the reason the economy was anemic is that the burden of government spending almost doubled, the regulatory burden increased, and other statist policies were implemented.""

In other words, in Mitchell’s view, you could say the GOP deserved blame because they weren’t staying true to the party’s fiscally conservative, anti-regulatory rhetoric and were instead acting like stereotypical Democrats. (On a non partisan note, Mitchell praises a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, for offering economic policies that were superior to Bush’s.)

Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Carter administration, said it’s ""fair to blame government for regulatory failures in the areas of housing and finance and the resulting financial crisis."" He said the blame for that extends to both parties. ""I think the Republican philosophy of unfettered markets bears the greater blame, but Democrats also allowed excesses to develop in the housing market and were happy to take Wall Street’s money,"" Bosworth said.

Several of the experts we contacted emphasized that the U.S. government, while powerful, is not all-powerful.

""Republican policies certainly didn't help,"" said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""But the fundamentals are technological and global forces.""

""There was a worldwide credit bubble that led to a worldwide financial collapse that led to a global Great Recession,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""If you accept that observation, it becomes hard to blame anyone in the U.S. overly for the results.""

Foster added, ""The simple political narrative is to blame the other side. Fair enough to a point.  The party in power always gets too much blame and too much credit, depending on circumstances.""

Our ruling

Obama has a point that incomes for the ""typical"" family have fallen since 2000 when adjusted for inflation. But using a time frame that treats Obama’s tenure and Bush’s tenure equally, the decline was about 3 percent, not the 6 percent he cited. Meanwhile, on Obama’s larger point of blaming Republicans for the weak economy, we found a consensus that Obama is partly, but not completely, on defensible ground.

State Rep. Donna Howard says Texas spending $500 less per student on average
","
At a Texas Capitol rally, state Rep. Donna Howard, an Austin Democrat, said a dire consequence of the 2011 Legislature’s budget-writing was a drop in per-student spending. 
Speaking to the crowd gathered to advocate for more public school support, Howard, without naming names, called out those officials who have said the state has increased its aid to school districts. ""But the Legislative Budget Board, the nonpartisan budget board of the Capitol, will tell you we are spending on average $500 less per student, so the fact that we are appropriating more, the truth is we are spending $500 less per student,"" Howard said. 
Is that so? 
In a recent fact-check, we gave state Comptroller Susan Combs a Pants on Fire rating for her claim that state lawmakers in 2011 did not cut public school funding when they wrote the two-year 2012-13 budget. The upshot: Although lawmakers increased state spending on education, the state’s ""general revenue"" increase pales in comparison to reductions in other funds appropriated for public education. 
Specifically, legislators, faced with a shortfall in projected state income, changed the formulas that govern how much aid flows to districts so districts would get $2 billion less a year through the 2012-13 budget period than they would have gotten if the longstanding formulas had gone unchanged. Members also reduced by $1.3 billion the two-year appropriation of state funding for grants that finance targeted programs such as teacher incentive pay and dropout prevention. 
Howard told us that the figure she aired at the rally was based on information she received from the staff of the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters, about the impact of those two cuts. 
Her figure turned out to be less than what the board staff estimates. Staff spokesman John Barton told us that per-student reductions from the two cuts shook out to $569 a year on average, some $428 of that attributable to the drop in formula-driven aid and $141 tracing to the grant reductions. 
From email exchanges with Barton, checks with nongovernmental experts and a report from a national teachers group, we identified a few ins, outs and curlicues built into these figures — as well as alternative ways to determine per-student cuts. It’s fair to say this topic can be as complicated as any analysis involving the complex Texas method of funding public schools. 
Let’s tick through those curlicues. 
For starters, the board reached its per-student reduction averages for the grant reductions and changes in formula funding in different ways. 
The $428-per-student reduction calculation is based on comparing money that districts are going to field for operations via the state’s main school funding mechanisms in the 2012-13 biennium with what they would have gotten had lawmakers not changed the formulas. If lawmakers had hewed to previously existing formulas, Barton told us, districts would have been entitled to roughly $7,662 per student in operations aid for each year of the 2012-13 biennium. With the formula changes, the per-student estimate became approximately $7,234. The difference: $428. 
The rest of the board staff’s per-student reduction calculation is based on comparing state funding that lawmakers appropriated for the targeted grant programs in the 2012-13 budget with the funding during the 2010-11 budget cycle. 
Curlicue No. 2 is a caution on this portion of the analysis: Calculating how much grant funding is available for each student in Texas public schools does not reflect how the funds are actually allocated. That’s because the grant money is not evenly distributed among schools districts, ""so the degree to which that portion of the funding reduction affects a given district will vary widely,"" Barton said. 
Next, some twists behind the board staff’s analysis of the legislated reduction in formula funding. 
The analysis doesn’t consider money flowing to school districts from the state to help pay off debt, most commonly bonds sold to pay for facility construction. Then again, the operations revenue is by far the largest chunk of state-guided education aid. 
Second, the operations revenue figures in the staff’s analysis fold in state and local revenue. That’s because the overall funding system counts on districts to contribute toward their total funding by tapping local property tax revenue. State aid fills in. Given the interconnected school funding system, Barton advised, any analysis of state funding alone ""would present a grossly incomplete picture"" of the amount of revenue available to school districts. ""The entire system is a model of shared local and state revenue,"" he said. 
Overall, Barton said the board’s analysis of formula-driven aid — comparing what districts were owed for 2012-13 before the cuts with what they would actually receive — is the best way to assess the Legislature’s changes. His explanation: It isolates the impact on state revenue because all the other factors that go into determining the amount of funding for districts are the same. 
Still, we wondered whether it’s reasonable for anyone to say per-student funding is down an average of $500, as Howard did, when the board staff’s comparison largely looked at what districts would have had versus what they are now expected to field. One could read Howard’s charge as indicating that districts are getting $500 less per student than they got in the two school years during the state’s previous budget period, 2010-11. 
Apples to apples? 
Per the formula funding, Barton said, the average per-student amount going to districts for each year of the previous budget period was ""roughly"" equivalent to the $7,662 estimate for 2012-13 before the formula changes. That brings us back to that $428 reduction figure, which is less than $500, but also does not roll in the impact of the grant cuts. 
We decided to do an analysis of our own, using both the operations revenue and the grant funding. First, we combined those two funding sources for each biennium. Next, we split that total in half, to get a total funding figure for one fiscal year, which basically mirrors a school year. Finally, we divided that figure by the average annual number of students in the public school system for the corresponding biennium. 
And? For 2010-11, we found a per-student average spending total of $7,988 per year. For 2012-13, our calculations yielded an annual per-student average of $7,393. The drop? $595 — greater than the $500 figure that Howard aired. 
For wider perspective, we asked nongovernment sources to guide us to their estimates of the legislated per-student reductions. 
Several folks — including Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, and Ray Freeman, deputy executive director of the Equity Center, an Austin group that advocates for school funding equity — suggested a simple way of measuring that: Divide the annual amount of the funding cuts by the number of students in the system. 
We did that, starting our calculations from a combined reduction total for the biennium of $5.3 billion. Next we split that in half to get a per-year cut figure of $2.65 billion. Finally, we divided by the number of students. 
That method yields different results depending on what measure of student enrollment is used, but all our calculations generated figures greater than $500. 
We found a distinct look at how per-student spending is changing in a December 2011 report from the National Education Association that presents education statistics for each state, including information provided by the state education agency in Texas. 
Although this fact-check has focused on the flow of money to school districts, the NEA report provides estimates of spending by districts on a per-student basis. According to the report, Texas districts were projected to spend $486 or $538 less per student in the 2011-12 school year — about the first year of the 2012-13 biennium — than in the previous one, depending on what enrollment measure is used. 
Notably, the report folds in spending by districts from all sources, including federal money, so the shown changes can’t be entirely attributed to decisions by state legislators. 
Our ruling 
Howard’s statement is about the effect of two major legislative actions on public school funding. By every measure we found and one that we ginned up, those actions resulted in a per-student funding reduction of at least $500. 
We think it’s significant that those figures represent averages — a fact that Howard noted in her rally remarks. That means some districts were likely to be hit harder, others less hard, especially by the legislated cuts to grants, which are not distributed uniformly to districts.

Tom Rooney says feds want to ban kid farmers from using battery-powered screwdrivers and garden hoses
","
Update (April 27, 2012): A few hours after our item posted about U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney’s claim related to a proposed child farm labor rule, the Department of Labor withdrew the rule in response to opposition from lawmakers and farmers.

""The decision to withdraw this rule – including provisions to define the 'parental exemption' – was made in response to thousands of comments expressing concerns about the effect of the proposed rules on small family-owned farms. To be clear, this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration,"" the April 26, 2012 press release states, adding that the department will instead work with rural stakeholders to develop a program to promote safety.

The Department of Labor’s announcement -- while good news for Rooney and others who opposed the rule -- does not affect our rating in this fact-check. Rooney failed to provide evidence that children working on farms would be banned from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose, as he claimed, and the Department of Labor specifically said those activities would not be prohibited under the proposed rule. 
--------------- 
Family farms are under attack by the feds, because the government is proposing a new rule that would restrict children working on farms, said U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla.

Rooney, chair of a House Agriculture Subcommittee, cosponsored a bill to fight the rule change proposed last year by the U.S. Labor Department.

Rooney wrote that the rule would ""would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture....The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose.""

Does the proposal ban children from using such basic equipment as a battery-powered screwdriver to fix a fence or use a pressurized garden hose to wash a truck? That claim caught our eye because it sounded like simple tools that could be found in any home -- not just on farms.

As we researched, we found the battery-powered screwdriver has become a symbol for politicians and farmers fighting the rule.  

When we searched the more than 10,000 comments submitted to the department, we found 177 mentions of ""screwdriver"".

In Florida, Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam opposed the regulations. A letter signed by the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association said the proposal would mean kids couldn’t draw water for a bucket or ride an asparagus cart. Joy Goodwin, an agriculture education graduate student at the University of Florida wrote, ""We believe it is more responsible to teach students to be safe, rather than to tell them, ‘Oh don’t do that, you might get hurt.’""

Rule includes parental exemption

The Labor Department wrote that the goal is to increase safety and provide parity between rules for children working on farms and non-farm settings. (Some of this background comes from our sister site, PolitiFact Tennessee, which looked at a similar claim from Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander.)

For decades, a parental exemption has allowed children to do any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. That means if Dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids’ chores, the feds won’t raise a fuss.

The summary of the proposed rules states they ""would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents.""

The way the department interpreted that exemption -- that farms had to be wholly owned by parents for kids to work -- led to an outpouring of angry letters from family farmers. In February, the department announced that it would rework that section by 2012 and any decision on a final rule would follow. That was welcome news to family farmers who believe that they -- not the feds -- should oversee their children’s work.

Rooney’s press release doesn’t mention that the new rules wouldn’t apply to children who fall under the parental exemption.

Also, there are separate rules for children who qualify for the ""student learner exception"" -- hired workers who are 14 and 15 could qualify to operate certain power-driven equipment and operate a tractor, if the tractor is equipped with seatbelts and rollover protection structures.

Still, the rules leave lots of proposed no-nos for children working somewhere other than their own parents' farms.

Children under 16 would be banned from harvesting tobacco, doing certain work with animals, and working from ladders or structures at elevations higher than 6 feet. Violators would face fines, and the government can stop shipment on crops. (We’ll address more of the thinking behind the restrictions in just a bit.)

Rule doesn’t cite screwdrivers or hoses

The proposed rule doesn’t specifically mention battery-powered screwdrivers or pressurized garden hoses. So we asked Rooney spokesman Michael Mahaffey for an explanation.

He pointed to a section that states the rule would ""prohibit operating and assisting in the operation of power-driven equipment and contain a limited exemption for student-learners."" The rule defines power-driven equipment to include ""machines, equipment, implements, vehicles, and/or devices operated by any power source other than human hand or foot power… Equipment operated by any source of energy, such as wind, electricity, fossil fuels, batteries, animals, or water, would all be considered ‘power-driven.’""

That language is broad. And the concern about broad language isn’t only a Republican talking point.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control, said the proposal for power equipment ""may be unnecessarily restrictive."" The institute wrote that the rule ""would prohibit the use of small handheld battery-powered equipment (e.g., a flashlight)"" that could be safely handled by youth. If that ban remains, the institute suggested an exception for ""student learners.""

Labor Department Secretary Hilda Solis said at a March Senate subcommittee hearing that the department has no intention of banning children from using screwdrivers.

In response to a question from a senator, Solis said, ""Some of the comments that you make about the use of powered screwdrivers and what have you, I think those are taken out of context, and they’re not what we’re proposing. So we do need to do a better job of communicating if that is what is being said out there.""

Solis said the department will ""certainly clarify those areas you pointed out that I believe are misinterpreted.""

At a House appropriations subcommittee hearing later that same month, Solis debunked the claim again:

""So I want to be very practical because we've heard some really outlandish things said in other committees that we would somehow regulate automated or battery-powered screwdrivers that -- nothing could be farther from the truth of what we want to do here.""

Later in the hearing, she added that the department’s goal was to prevent accidents that cause serious injury and even death.

""We're not talking about battery-powered screwdrivers, we're talking about tractors. When talking about bins, we're talking about grain operation where children have been killed or have been maimed,"" Solis said. ""We're also not talking about precluding educational program. We encourage that, we're not in any way trying to take away that particular part of the culture. I understand that my father was a farm worker, I know that.""

We couldn’t find a statement by Solis in which she specifically addressed garden hoses. But a department spokesperson said later that the department won’t ban children from using them.

Child safety on farms

As Solis emphasized at the hearings, the rules’ goal is to increase safety.

A peer-reviewed article in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics noted that while few adolescents are employed on farms, compared with other work, ""the proportion of fatalities in agriculture is higher than that for any other type of adolescent employment.""

The rules specifically note that they’re aimed at preventing injury and death, citing specific examples. Some of the details in the rules are not for the squeamish, detailing gruesome deaths of youths chewed up in various kinds of machinery. 
Such concerns date to the turn of the last century and are recorded in the findings of the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health, which routinely looks at promoting safe work conditions for young workers.

""The reason the labor laws are in place is…because there have been kids who have been hurt,"" said Diane E. Bush, coordinator of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California-Berkeley. ""Most people think of the workplace as a safe place where young people are going to learn responsibility and it will have a positive impact on them.

""It’s important to make sure they’re working in an environment where that’s going to happen, rather than ending up with a serious or even worse, a fatal injury.""

Our ruling

Rooney said that a proposed U.S. Labor Department rule for children working on farms ""would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose."" He points to language so broad that even the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health raised concerns about it.

But ultimately, it is up to the Labor Department to enforce the rule once it is final. Solis testified that the department has no intention of banning children from using screwdrivers, and her department says the same applies to garden hoses. The rule is a proposal at this point -- Solis has indicated that the power equipment section may need clarification.

The proposed rule would limit the work children can do on farms, but Rooney and other critics omit that it won’t apply to children working on their own parents’ farms. Instead, they cite eye-popping examples of activities -- like using screwdrivers or garden hoses -- that they interpreted for themselves from the rules. Meanwhile, the department said specifically that’s not what they intend. The intention is to protect children from real-life cases of injury and death.

R2RMerge claims George Norcross said the merger of Rowan and Rutgers-Camden would cost billions
","
An official estimate of the cost to merge two universities in southern New Jersey has not been released, but a student group claims a Democratic power broker put a multibillion-dollar price tag on the proposal.

R2RMerge, a student movement at Rutgers-Camden, has taken to the web and to the streets to rally opposition to a plan to merge their school with Rowan University in Glassboro. The group is soliciting signatures for an online petition, as well as distributing literature to stop the controversial merger.

A flier from the group found April 15 in a Jersey City grocery store states: ""TAKEOVER OF RUTGER$ CAMDEN WILL COST NEW JER$EY BILLION$""

The flier attributes the statement to a Feb. 7 interview South Jersey power broker George Norcross did on WHYY’s Radio Times program.

With the lack of an official cost estimate, PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether Norcross, who supports the reorganization, put a number on the proposal.

Norcross did not, although he did say New Jersey taxpayers would need to approve multibillion-dollar bond issues to boost investment in higher education.

During the Feb. 7 interview, Norcross cited a statistic that many have used to highlight the need for more investment in New Jersey colleges: the state ranks 47th nationally for higher education appropriations.

Later in the interview, while discussing that the merged schools would not carry the Rutgers name, Norcross said: ""I believe the students that are at that campus today are entitled to have their diploma say Rutgers University. I think there is a legitimate debate and discussion that needs to take place as to what happens after that because change is never easy.

""But the amount of money that is involved in a reorganization of higher ed and an initiative to advance New Jersey from 47th in the country to the top 10 in the country is going to involve the voters of this state approving multibillion-dollar bond issues and southern New Jersey, undoubtedly, would receive its fair share of capital dollars, which historically it has not,"" he said.

Norcross elaborated on his point to PolitiFact New Jersey.

""What I was talking about was the long-awaited and sought capital spending initiative for higher education that would accompany a reorganization agreement statewide,"" he said.

The proposed merger of Rutgers-Camden and Rowan is part of a larger reorganization plan that includes the restructuring of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, as well as the merger of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the School of Public Health from UMDNJ to Rutgers-New Brunswick.

Norcross mentioned a recent Bloomberg News article about a plan for New Jersey to sell up to $3.5 billion in bonds for capital investments at state colleges. ""That’s not the cost of the reorganization,"" Norcross said. ""That’s to invest in the universities and colleges.""

A spokesman for R2RMerge, Michael Edelman, said in an e-mail that ""it’s easily discernible from the punctuation, word-choice, design, and spelling that the flier is not meant to be a direct quote from George Norcross.""

""Thus, we think the issue shouldn’t be framed as whether George Norcross literally said that verbatim, but whether his comments reasonably lead to that conclusion. And, in that sense, we think it safe to draw the conclusion we did,"" Edelman said.

Our ruling

A flier distributed by the student group R2RMerge claims Norcross said during a February radio interview that the takeover of Rutgers-Camden will cost New Jersey billions.

A cost estimate for the merger has not been stated publicly. During the interview Norcross said efforts to restructure higher education in New Jersey and boost the state’s national ranking for investment in higher education is ""going to involve the voters of this state approving multibillion-dollar bond issues and southern New Jersey, undoubtedly, would receive its fair share of capital dollars, which historically it has not.""

Norcross’s comments referred to overall restructuring and investment in higher education, not folding Rutgers-Camden into Rowan University.

We rate the claim False.

John Boehner says Senate Dems haven't passed a budget in more than 1,000 days
","
As the House prepared to begin floor consideration of several contending budget resolutions for fiscal 2013, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner released a video trumpeting the Republican position.

""Ours is the only responsible budget in town,"" Boehner said about the GOP spending plan proposed by Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee’s Republican chairman.

Other budget proposals included those from the House Democratic leadership, the conservative Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus, plus a bipartisan budget inspired by the Simpson-Bowles Fiscal Commission and co-authored by Reps. Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, and Steve LaTourette, the Ohio Republican.

""Unfortunately, we're again waiting for leadership from the Democrats who run Washington,"" Boehner added, and then refreshed a favorite GOP talking point: ""The Democrat-controlled Senate, it hasn't passed a budget in more than 1,000 days.""

Ultimately the House approved the Ryan budget by a near party-line 228-191 vote, but it isn’t expected to go anywhere in the Senate. PolitiFact Ohio, though, thought it’d check out the speaker’s claim about Senate budgets.

It is similar to other statements that have been rated by PolitiFact national, PolitiFact Ohio, PolitiFact Wisconsin, PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact New Hampshire. Among them: 

Each of those statements cites the same starting point as Boehner’s claim of 1,000 days -- April 29, 2009. That was,  according to the Congressional Research Service and news sources, when the Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2010.

No budget resolution has passed since then, so Boehner's time tally -- like those of the previously checked statements -- is accurate. The day his video statement was posted, March 28, 2012, was 1,064 days from that date.

The PolitiFact rulings on these and other similar statements depended on their phrasing, but none was rated entirely True.

Knowing how Congress comes up with its federal budget helps to explain why.

Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.

Budget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes.

If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money.

But, as a previous PolitiFact story said, ""the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.""

We wondered if the Senate, under Democratic control, had neglected its basic responsibility.

Our PolitiFact colleagues in Wisconsin, Florida and at PolitiFact national had the same question, and concluded that neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions.

In 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill ""because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders,"" said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending.

Senate Democrats didn’t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because ""Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people’s time with pointless political votes,"" a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told PolitiFact Florida. ""Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people’s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families.""

Our Florida colleagues also found that the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four earlier occasions since 1983.

For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.

Those facts lend perspective to Boehner’s statement.

But on its face, Boehner’s statement is accurate. And it is more precisely worded than those that we’ve previously checked.

Is Amanda Fritz responsible for dropping the number of parks workers on contract from over 100 to under 40?
","
Portland Parks & Recreation has long used a contractor to hire workers for seasonal help as lifeguards, instructors, front desk help and such. Organized labor has protested the use, claiming it is a way for the city to avoid paying benefits. 

Portland city commissioner Amanda Fritz, who is up for re-election in May, opposes privatization of city jobs and recently claimed credit for reducing the number of workers on contract at parks.

""At my urging, Commissioner (Nick) Fish reviewed contracting out in Parks. As a result, the number of contracted employees dropped from over 100 to under 40 in the three years I've been in office,"" she wrote in response to a questionnaire by Occupy Portland.

She repeated the claim in another primary election questionnaire: ""My advocacy questioning contracting out in Parks, despite not being the Commissioner in Charge of that bureau, delayed and altered the renewal of the Brooks contract, and reduced the number of contracted employees in Parks from over 100 to fewer than 40.""

The questions for PolitiFact Oregon are straightforward. Did the number of workers on contract at parks drop? And, more importantly, was Fritz responsible for the reduction?

Parks spokesman Mark Ross confirmed that in 2009, the bureau had on average between 60 to 120 workers through S. Brooks and Associates. In February 2009, there were 57 workers. By July 2011, the number was 36.

So Fritz is correct on the numbers. But was she behind the drop in contracted hires, as she claims? Pinning down this part proved challenging for PolitiFact Oregon.

Fritz’s office says yes, and that but for her intervention the numbers would not have declined. However, Parks and Recreation and the city’s Human Resources director both credit a rule that went into effect in January 2008, allowing seasonal city employees to work more hours, thereby reducing the need to hire workers on contract. (A representative for Brooks did not return phone calls or email requesting comment.)

""The number had started to dramatically decrease in 2008 once we made the charter change and it has continued to decrease as a result of the charter change and as a result of the types of programs and activities that parks is running,"" said HR director Yvonne Deckard.

Previously seasonal workers could work at most 860 hours in a year. The rule change increased the maximum to 1,200 hours a year. Fritz, we should point out, joined the City Council in January 2009. She had nothing to do with the new hours.

So, what is Fritz’s office talking about?

Well, in February 2009, the City Council considered renewing the Brooks contract for another five years. This was a sore subject with Laborers’ Local 483, the union that represents many parks workers. Leaders there raised the issue of contract workers with Nick Fish soon after he inherited the bureau in January. Fritz also lobbied Fish to reconsider the contract.

""I do recall strongly that she had a concern about that contract,"" Fish said. ""She wanted to know more about it. She did in fact meet with me about it. She's the reason it got scaled back.""

The City Council eventually agreed to a one-year renewal, not five years. But we still wanted to know how renewing a contract for a shorter period of time reduced the use of Brooks workers.

Tim Crail, a spokesman for Fritz, explained that the shortened time period prompted Fish’s office, the parks bureau and labor leaders to ""negotiate moving classifications, which has resulted in a reduced reliance on the Brooks contract to fill certain job classifications. Thus the reduction from 100 to 40,"" he wrote.

""But for Commissioner Fritz questioning the five year extension on February 25th, 2009, the changes would not have occurred.""

Yet that’s not what happened. Crail didn’t have the number of positions recategorized. The contract and its amendments, which we requested, did not change. And Fish told us that talks between parks and labor didn’t result in a new agreement on when to use contract workers.

Fish can’t recall how the parks bureau came to reduce its reliance on Brooks. It may have been a combination of concerted effort and scheduling as allowed under the 1,200-hour rule. (By the way, the maximum is now 1,400 hours a year.)

""It was both my belief, her belief and, ultimately, the bureau position that we would lessen our reliance on these positions,"" Fish said. ""It’s clear we did not want it used as much.""

So, how do we rule on Fritz’s statement?

The commissioner accurately states that she questioned the use of contract employees at the bureau. It’s also accurate for her to say that from 2009 to 2011, the number of contract employees used by the parks bureau went from 100 to 40. What Fritz has not showed is that but for her questioning, the changes would not have occurred.

After all, Fish had concerns about the use of contract workers. Labor had concerns. The terms of the Brooks contract did not change materially after 2009. The city, notably, did not reclassify positions to favor direct hires, as her office claims.

Certainly Fritz’s questioning helped prompt a council-level discussion about an issue dear to the union and troubling to the parks commissioner. But the mechanism to reduce the use of contracted temps was a rule change, which stemmed from a charter change, in effect a year before Fritz took office.",/factchecks/2012/apr/26/amanda-fritz/amanda-fritz-responsible-dropping-number-parks-wor/

UPDATED: Clay Dafoe says Austin bus riders subsidize commuter rail
","
CLARIFICATION, 11:20 a.m. April 26, 2012: This fact check incorporates corrected 2010 and 2011 revenue figures provided by Capital Metro after the article’s publication. The changes do not affect our rating. 
As Austin’s candidates for mayor took part in a debate April 16, 2012, Clay Dafoe urged less spending on trains and more money for bus service.

""Basically, what we’re having is people riding a bus, subsidizing this expensive, romanticized train that really doesn’t qualify or fit the needs of Austin,"" said Dafoe, a tax preparer, in the debate televised by Austin’s KXAN-TV, Channel 36.

Although Austin is again considering a plan for electric-powered ""urban rail,"" its current system is diesel-powered commuter trains, in operation since 2010. Capital Metro, Austin’s transit agency, runs MetroRail between Leander and downtown Austin roughly 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. weekdays and, with hours added in March, until midnight Friday and 4 p.m. to midnight Saturday. A one-way fare to ride the whole distance is $2.75.

MetroBus is Capital Metro’s catch-all term for its 65 regularly scheduled bus routes criss-crossing Austin and in some cases extending out to suburbs like Leander, Manor and the Wells Branch area. A day pass, entitling a rider to board all but the agency’s 900 series express bus, costs $2; an express bus day pass costs $5.50.

From data that Cap Metro spokeswoman Erica McKewen emailed to us, including a link to the agency’s 2012 budget, it’s clear MetroBus earns more than MetroRail.

For 2012, Cap Metro predicted MetroRail will provide 400,000 rides and earn $909,939, while MetroBus will provide 25.4 million rides and earn $8.8 million in fares.

But expenses are considerably higher than revenue from fares. MetroRail’s 2012 operating costs were estimated at $11.8 million for 2012, and MetroBus expenses at $106.6 million.

So neither system is covering its own expenses -- nor is either intended to. Most of Cap Metro’s budget comes from a sales tax on purchases made in the agency’s service area, McKewen said.

A chart on Cap Metro’s website shows the agency expects 80.3 percent of its 2012 revenues will come from that 1 percent tax, which its board raised from 0.75 percent in 1995.

Thus, the tax is expected to bring in $153.2 million (out of $191 million total revenues) for 2012. Cap Metro’s 2011 year-end financial report says that in 2011, sales tax revenues were $151.2 million (80 percent of total $189.3 million), compared with $141.9 million (74 percent of total $191.9 million) in 2010, the year MetroRail began running.

McKewen said that Cap Metro’s April 23, 2012, deal to outsource bus operations is not expected to result in the system becoming profitable.

Are bus riders ""subsidizing"" the trains, in any sense?

Not by the usual definition of ""subsidy,"" which is a grant of money. McKewen said no block of funds is transferred from the bus services to the train services.

If we use a more colloquial sense of ""subsidize,"" we might say, for example, that if one unit of a company turns a profit while another loses money, the first unit is ""paying"" to keep the other afloat. That’s not the case here: Neither the rail nor buses turn a profit.

Our ruling

Cap Metro’s buses pull more of their weight, so to speak, than its trains. But neither system turns a profit, and besides, most of the agency’s budget comes from sales tax, not tickets to ride.

So if anybody’s ""subsidizing"" the trains, it’s Austin-area shoppers, though that group likely overlaps with bus riders. We rate Dafoe’s statement False.",/factchecks/2012/apr/25/clay-dafoe/clay-dafoe-says-austin-bus-riders-subsidize-commut/

A claim about distributing Jeff Bezos’ billions gets the math wrong
","Income inequality is so severe, an Instagram post suggests, that a single American billionaire could give away enough money to make everyone else in the world a billionaire — and still keep the bulk of his fortune. ""If Bezos has 200 billion dollas, and there’s 7 billion people on earth, why can’t we each get a billion and (he’d) be left with 193 billion dollas left?"" the Oct. 25 post says. There’s a reason we can’t, and it’s not selfishness or the gift tax. It’s arithmetic. The post, which received more than 128,000 likes, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Many of the commenters also noticed the flaw in the argument.  First, let’s check the numbers. According to Forbes, which tracks the real-time wealth of the world’s richest people, Jeff Bezos — the founder of Amazon.com, and owner of the Washington Post and aerospace company Blue Origin — had a net worth of $197.6 billion as of the end of trading on Oct. 27. So yes, close to $200 billion. He and Tesla CEO Elon Musk run neck-and-neck for the title of world’s wealthiest person. The world’s population is on the cusp of 7.8 billion people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s population clock. So the post is off on the population figure, but on the correct order of magnitude. Now for the math. In order to provide $1 billion to each person on Earth, Bezos would have to have more money than even he has. $1 billion  X  7.8 billion people = $7,800,000,000,000,000,000 That's $7.8 quintillion, or about 40 million times Bezos' fortune. Looked at a different way, if you rounded up Bezos’ fortune to the even $200 billion stated in the post, and apportioned it evenly among the world’s 7.8 billion people, each one would get about $25.  Bezos, as one of those 7.8 billion, would be left with just $25.

Vaccines do not cause sudden infant death syndrome
","A viral image doesn’t mention COVID-19, but it falsely implies that vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The image states: ""79.4% of babies who die of ‘SIDS’ had a vaccine the same day."" The claim, shared in an Oct. 26 Instagram post, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that vaccines cause babies to die from SIDS — the sudden, unexpected death of an apparently healthy baby younger than 1 year, usually during sleep.  The cause of SIDS is unknown. But it appears SIDS might be associated with defects in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep, though other factors such as low birth weight and sleeping on the stomach or side, can also make an infant more vulnerable, according to Mayo Clinic.  The statistic cited in the image could be incorrectly quoting a finding from a 2015 study done by researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that examined deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. VAERS  is run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration.  For reports in the database of the deaths of children up to age 17, 79.4% received more than one vaccine on the same day; and among infants, 86.2% received more than one vaccine on the same day.  So, the study said the vast majority of infant deaths occurred among infants who received more than one vaccination on the same day. But receiving more than one vaccine on the same day is common for infants. And the study did not say that the infants died on the same day as the vaccination.  Moreover, the study said: ""Because SIDS peaks at a time when children are receiving many recommended vaccinations, it would not be unexpected to observe a coincidental close temporal relationship between vaccination and SIDS."" The CDC says currently: ""Babies receive multiple vaccines when they are between 2 to 4 months old. This age range is also the peak age for SIDS. The timing of the 2-month and 4-month shots and SIDS has led some people to question whether they might be related. However, studies have found that vaccines do not cause and are not linked to SIDS."" We rated False a claim made in June that SIDS ""is absolutely a side effect of vaccination.""  We cited the lack of any evidence that vaccines cause SIDS, and noted that studies actually show that receiving recommended immunizations can lower an infant’s risk of SIDS.

A video clip shows Fauci plotted AIDS pandemic? Pants on Fire!
","A 39-second TikTok video with background music suggests that it shows Dr. Anthony Fauci laying out an evil plan to create the AIDS pandemic. Not only that, but laying out the plot to an audience at the U.S. government’s National Institutes of Health. Yes, it is false and ridiculous. ""You take an infectious agent and you introduce it into a population in which the spread among those individuals — if it’s sexual-contact spread — it’s a perfect set-up to spread,"" a decades-younger Fauci says in the video, which is labeled: ""AIDS/Dr. Anthony Fauci (NIH, 1984).""  An Instagram user who shared the clip wrote: ""This maniac needs to serve multiple lives behind prison bars, but that’s not nearly enough of a punishment for his #crimesagainsthumanity."" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The clip is from a lecture Fauci gave at the National Institutes of Health on Nov. 4, 1984, on AIDS. He talked about how the disease first emerged in the United States in 1979 and how it was recognized as a new disease in 1981.  At the time, Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a title he holds now along with being chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden. Here’s the relevant part of what he said; the portion that was shared in the Instagram post is in italics:   ""I’ll get to in some of the later slides how this disease, which we surmised early on, started off in the male homosexual population in this country. Not that there was anything intrinsically different or wrong or what-have-you about homosexuality. It was very simple; it’s straightforward epidemiology. You take an infectious agent and you introduce it into a population in which the spread among those individuals — if it’s sexual-contact spread — it’s a perfect set-up to spread."" Fauci continued by referring to the first 4,000 cases in the United States. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, called AIDS, was first recognized as a new disease in 1981 when increasing numbers of young gay men succumbed to unusual opportunistic infections and rare malignancies.  HIV is the virus that can lead to AIDS. HIV infection in humans came from a type of chimpanzee in Central Africa and may have jumped to humans as far back as the late 1800s. The virus has existed in the United States since at least the mid to late 1970s, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suggestion that comments Fauci made in 1984 are evidence that he plotted AIDS — which emerged in the United States several years earlier, but whose roots date back decades — is false and ridiculous.

Posts falsely say Joe Biden broke with Donald Trump on Afghanistan withdrawal
","A conservative webpage being shared on Facebook attacks President Joe Biden on multiple fronts, asserting that ""liberals are waging a war on Christianity and Trump Supporters."" The page encourages visitors to claim a free ""In God We Trust"" hat, or, as the page describes it, a ""Jesus hat.""  One part of the online pitch caught our eye: ""The reason why Biden wanted to withdraw troops so quickly from Afghanistan ... leaving behind thousands of Americans was simply because of Trump Derangement Syndrome and they wanted to reverse any policy that Trump had implemented."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Officially, the State Department says the number of Americans still in Afghanistan is smaller than ""thousands."" In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Oct. 26, Colin Kahl, the undersecretary of Defense for policy, said that 196 Americans remain in Afghanistan but are ready to leave the country, with another 243 not yet ready to leave. Those numbers are impossible to verify independently, so we won’t address them here.  However, we will assess the statement that ""the reason why Biden wanted to withdraw troops so quickly from Afghanistan ... was simply because of Trump Derangement Syndrome and they wanted to reverse any policy that Trump had implemented."" In reality, Biden, for whatever the shortcomings of his troop removal efforts, was following an approach begun by Trump, rather than reversing it. The United States had been in Afghanistan militarily since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Trump reached an agreement with the Taliban that would have resulted in the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan before Biden ultimately withdrew the troops.  On Feb. 29, 2020, almost a year before Biden took office, the U.S. signed an agreement with the Taliban that paved the way for a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, to conclude by May 2021 if certain conditions were met. The deal featured guarantees from the Taliban to ""prevent the use of the soil of Afghanistan by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies.""  In remarks about the deal, Trump expressed hope but reservations about the Taliban, saying of its leaders, ""We'll be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they're going to be doing. They will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going."" On Sept. 18, 2020, Trump said, ""We’re having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It’s been public. But we’ll be down to, very shortly, we’ll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. We’ll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen. Certain things have to be fulfilled, but 19 years is a long time."" Then, on Nov. 17, 2020, Trump’s acting defense secretary, Christopher Miller, made that official. He announced that Trump had decided that by Jan. 15, 2021, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan would be reduced from 5,000 to 2,500. When Biden took office, he announced on April 14, 2021, that he would delay the final withdrawal date from May to September but otherwise keep Trump’s planned removal in place. He did not set conditions for the withdrawal.  In a speech on July 8, Biden said the military mission in Afghanistan would end Aug. 31. But events on the ground hastened the removal: By Aug. 16, the Afghanistan government had fallen to the Taliban. The posts said ""the reason why Biden wanted to withdraw troops so quickly from Afghanistan ... was simply because of Trump Derangement Syndrome and they wanted to reverse any policy that Trump had implemented."" In reality, Trump set the U.S. troop removal in motion and Biden continued on that path. Biden could have reversed the Trump policy by declaring an open-ended U.S. commitment to stay in Afghanistan, but he didn’t.

Children to families to community COVID transmissibility claim falls short
","Perhaps the struggle among school districts over how to deal with COVID-19 this academic year is best encapsulated by the neighboring districts of Marshfield and Wausau.  Marshfield is mandating masks in schools. Wausau isn’t. But both faced similar pushback and protests from parents and others. Before the school year began, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, who represents the area, posted a video on Twitter on Aug. 8, 2021 that came firmly down in support of local control. But it also included a claim about the safety of kids in schools that remains relevant. Citing experts, Tiffany claimed ""the seasonal cold and flu is actually more dangerous for kids than the coronavirus"" and that ""there is very low transmissibility from children to their families and to their communities."" Is he right? When asked for backup, Tiffany’s staff said he based his claim on an October 2020 article from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a self-labeled non-partisan think tank whose board is comprised of Republican party insiders, which found that those under the age of 15 were at significantly lower risk of death from COVID-19 than of the flu. But a year has passed, and according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is no longer the case. Remember, in October 2020 the flu season was only ramping up, and COVID had really emerged in March of that year, toward the end of the flu season. A 2020 CDC report detailing the differences between COVID-19 and the flu stated that ""the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19."" But a June 2021 study showed children are more frequently being hospitalized with COVID-19 than the flu. In the more recent report, researchers compared the numbers for COVID-19 and flu hospitalizations for those ages 12 to 17. From Oct. 1, 2020, to April 24, 2021, hospitalization rates nationwide for COVID among adolescents were 2.5 to 3 times higher than for seasonal flu in previous years. In Wisconsin, there has been a similar shift to more COVID cases among youth: Flu hospitalizations: Between Oct. 1, 2020, and Sep. 18, 2021, there were only two influenza-associated hospitalizations reported in Wisconsin among those up to 17 years old, according to data from the state health department.  COVID hospitalizations: In contrast, there have been 1,440 COVID-19 cases resulting in hospitalizations among those between up to 19 years old reported in Wisconsin as of Sep. 27, 2021.  The same pattern is seen in the death numbers.  There were no influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported in Wisconsin between Oct. 1, 2020, and Sep. 18, 2021 in those up to age 17. There have been three COVID-19 deaths among those up to 19 as of Sep. 27, 2021. It’s important to note the datasets for the two viruses don’t align perfectly, said Elizabeth Goodsitt, a spokesperson with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. ""We can’t make an apples-to-apples comparison as the dates and age groups are not exactly the same,"" Goodsitt said. But the difference between the two categories — and the two years — is striking. And it underscores that Tiffany was using outdated information in his claim. In a September 2020 factcheck of a flu vs. COVID claim, we noted that the flu was able to spread through children more commonly than COVID-19, creating more cases, more complications and more deaths.  But when it comes to transmissibility, there is another key change this year: The emergence of the highly contagious delta variant. According to his staff, Tiffany based his low-transmissibility statement on an August 2020 article in the Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics called ""COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame."" The article uses data from schools in China, France and Australia in 2020 and found COVID transmission in schools may be ""less important in community transmission than initially feared."" Although outbreaks in schools can occur, both Goodsitt and studies from the CDC said that transmission within school settings is typically lower than — or at least similar to — levels of community transmission, when prevention strategies are in place in schools. That last part is important because it could vary from district to district based on whether there is a mask mandate (as in Marshfield) or no mask-mandate (as in Wausau). Additionally, the CDC says if community transmission is high and community vaccination level is low, students and staff are more likely to come to school while infectious and introduce COVID-19 into the schools. So, while Tiffany is more on track with that part of his claim, it’s much more complicated than he suggests. Tiffany claimed ""The seasonal cold and flu is actually more dangerous for kids than the Coronavirus"" and ""there is very low transmissibility between from children to their families and communities."" The first part of the claim uses outdated information, and the situation is now the opposite of what Tiffany said. Meanwhile, though the level of transmissibility from schools to families and the community may generally be low, the situation is more complicated than presented. Much depends on the level of spread in the community, how many adults are vaccinated and what mitigation measures are in place. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2021/oct/28/tom-tiffany/children-families-community-covid-transmissibility/

He was not an official White House photographer, just credentialed to take pictures there, the Washington Post reported at the time.   According to the Post, Moon wouldn’t say who has employed him since he started taking pictures at the White House, and when he was pressed for information about himself and his work, he wrote back: ""You ask too much personal things.""  We don’t know if Moon still has White House media credentials. The White House didn’t respond to our questions about this post. Neither did Trump.  We also couldn’t find any other instances of this photo being posted online.

""Unvaccinated people are most likely to spread to other unvaccinated people,"" he said. The next most likely pattern is unvaccinated people spreading to vaccinated people, he said.  ""Third is vaccinated spreading to unvaccinated,"" he said, ""but this is going to be much rarer than the first two scenarios. Least likely is vaccinated to vaccinated."" In late July, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reverted to previous guidance and recommended that everyone, including fully vaccinated people, wear masks in indoor public spaces in areas where spread of COVID-19 was high.  The guidance was updated ""to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others.""  The update was based on the discovery that infection from the highly contagious delta variant resulted in similarly high viral loads in vaccinated as well as unvaccinated people. In other words, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people could get breakthrough cases of COVID-19 and transmit the virus. But this was a precaution to help prevent the spread. The Instagram claim ignores the fact that the unvaccinated are more likely to become infected, and to become seriously ill. And like vaccinated people, they can also be asymptomatic and spread the disease unknowingly. They are more likely to spread the disease. A study led by University of Oxford researchers that was posted Oct. 15 found among cases in England that vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections are less likely than unvaccinated people to infect others with the delta variant.  A study in China published in August also found that the unvaccinated were more likely to spread infection. A third study, done in Singapore and published in July, found that vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral load, a possible indicator of declining infectiousness. None of the studies had been peer reviewed. Unvaccinated people lack protection against the disease. The CDC reported in September that the range of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness remained high in the United States, even though it had decreased since the onset in late June of the delta variant, which the agency said is more than twice as contagious as previous variants. The effectiveness against infection ranged from 39% to 84%, and against hospitalization ranged from 75% to 95%.  A study in the Netherlands published in August said that the COVID-19 vaccines not only protect the vaccinated person, ""but also offer protection against transmission to close contacts."" Unvaccinated people face greater risk of hospitalization and death. In September, the CDC analyzed vaccine effectiveness across 13 U.S. jurisdictions from April 4 to July 17 and matched that data to vaccine registries from those areas. It found that after delta became dominant, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected than fully vaccinated people, and more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die.  Meanwhile, as of Oct. 18, more than 189 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the latest CDC statistics. Of them, 41,127 got COVID-19 and were hospitalized or died. That is 0.021%. About 85% of the deaths and 66% of the hospitalizations were among those 65 or older. Unvaccinated people are most likely to be infected by other unvaccinated people because the unvaccinated ""are far more likely to get COVID, and when they get it, they are infectious for a significantly longer time than vaccinated people are,"" said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.  With the delta variant and over time, the vaccine effectiveness wanes a bit, Wachter said, ""but vaccinated people remain far less likely to have and to spread infection."" An Instagram post claimed that, with COVID-19, vaccinated people ""are the real threat to"" unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people can get COVID-19 from vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections.  But the greater threat to the unvaccinated is other unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people are more likely than the vaccinated to get COVID-19, more likely to spread it, and much more likely to become seriously ill or die.  We rate the post False.

Debt ceiling increase doesn’t give U.S. government a 'blank check'
","Iowa’s U.S. Senate and House Republican delegation have voiced unanimous opposition to raising the national debt ceiling. Rep. Ashley Hinson went on to say that raising the debt ceiling would be akin to writing a blank check for Democrats in control of Congress to spend.  Hinson issued a press release after voting ""no"" when the House voted 219-to-206 to raise the debt ceiling on Oct. 12 stating:  ""The way Democrats talk about spending trillions of dollars like pocket change, while asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions, should concern every single American."" Hinson also tweeted about the vote after issuing the press release saying:  ""We shouldn’t give Democrats a free pass to spend Iowans’ money irresponsibly and jeopardize the entire global economy. ""Democrats should drop their multi-trillion-dollar social spending extravaganza. #IA01"" The notion that increasing or suspending the debt ceiling creates a ""blank check"" for spending is a common misconception, Iowa State University economics professor Joydeep Bhattacharya told Politifact Iowa.  The debt ceiling is the limit on how much the U.S. government can spend before getting authorization to spend again. The government is borrowing in order to spend because the Department of Treasury isn’t raising enough in taxes, Bhattacharya said.  Raising the debt ceiling is an indication to countries and individuals the U.S. has borrowed from that the government intends to pay its debts back, he said.  Hinson’s communications director Sophie Seid wrote in an email to Politifact Iowa that Hinson has been outspoken on the debt ceiling and Democrats’ effort to raise or suspend it to continue spending money the government doesn’t have.  Bhattacharya said increasing the debt ceiling can’t be used for new spending.  Additionally, raising the debt ceiling alone doesn’t authorize new spending. New spending proposals have to go through Congress. Raising the debt ceiling allows spending on programs that have already been authorized. Before the House voted on raising the ceiling, the Senate voted 50-to-48 to raise it on Oct. 7. After the House vote, President Joe Biden signed the bill on Oct. 14.  PolitiFact has reviewed the history of the nation’s debt ceiling as recently as September, heading into the October votes. At the beginning of 1917, Congress moved away from approving the sales of every bond available to the public and, instead, handed to the Treasury Department responsible for handling these bonds. However, Congress retained the right to set overall debt, which means having to vote to change that limit when spending on debt exceeds it. Congress raised the debt ceiling three times — in 2017, 2018, and 2019 — under former President Donald Trump. Votes to raise the debt ceiling often are bipartisan, but not always. The current bill increases the debt ceiling by $480 billion and another vote will take place on Dec. 3. Before the vote, the ceiling was at $28.4 trillion. Now,  it’s capped at $28.9 trillion.  Hinson told constituents she would continue to vote against raising the debt ceiling and prevent Democrats from having a blank check for unlimited spending.  Raising the debt ceiling does not mean the U.S. government can spend money on additional costs. It means money the government borrowed, some of it during the Trump Administration, will be paid back.  The Senate and House voted to temporarily cap the ceiling at $28.9 trillion but must vote each time it raises the ceiling. Hinson’s claim of a blank check book is inaccurate, so we rate it False.",/factchecks/2021/oct/27/ashley-hinson/debt-ceiling-increase-doesnt-give-us-government-bl/

Christmas trees still aren’t ‘holiday trees’ at the White House
","A years-old, debunked claim about Christmas is decking the halls once again. ""The White House referred to Christmas trees as Holiday Trees for the first time this year,"" according to a viral Facebook post.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim first surfaced in fall 2009, when a chain email claimed that the Obamas would refer to Christmas trees as holiday trees. The email said an artist who paints ornaments for the annual White House Christmas tree had been notified via letter from the White House of the change in terminology. At the time, a White House spokeswoman said the claim was false and the letter did not exist. PolitiFact rated it Pants on Fire. We did not find any evidence on official White House social media accounts or in published reports to indicate that the Biden administration is calling Christmas trees by any other name. Recently, news stories have referenced the 2021 White House Christmas tree being chosen from a North Carolina farm. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Despite having been debunked, the claim was resurrected in 2016 by Eric Trump, son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, who said in an interview that part of his father’s motivation for seeking the presidency was his belief that the White House Christmas tree was referred to as a Holiday Tree. The Facebook claim also says that the White House’s supposed change in how it refers to Christmas trees ""prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you."" What follows is a long passage about how Stein doesn’t like ""getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don't think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians."" But Stein’s speech can be traced back to a 2005 appearance on ""CBS Sunday Morning News,"" so his words were not in reference to the 2009 false claim about Christmas trees being renamed. Snopes reported that some of the speech attributed to Stein was actually by Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of Billy Graham. A Facebook post said, ""The White House referred to Christmas trees as Holiday Trees for the     first time this year."" This claim was debunked in 2009 and is still untrue today. We did not find any evidence to indicate that the Biden administration is calling Christmas trees by any other name. A second part of the claim says Ben Stein responded to the change in Christmas terminology with a speech. But his speech was delivered in 2005, years before the false claim about Christmas trees emerged.

Australia’s quarantine facilities are for travelers, not for isolating unvaccinated people
","As Australia prepares to loosen its strict COVID-19 border controls, misinformation is spreading about who will be affected by shifting regulations. One viral video post said, ""Australia to Implement Quarantine Camps for the Unvaxed."" It was shared by the account of ""The Charlie Kirk Show,"" whose founder is known for spreading falsehoods. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the post, the account shows footage from an Australian morning show that interviewed the premier of the state of Queensland, Anastasia Palaszczuk, on Oct. 19, the day after the state announced it would gradually reopen its borders to domestic and international travelers. The segment used in the claim shows Palaszczuk saying that a planned quarantine facility will be needed for travelers returning from high-risk countries and unvaccinated people. A narrator then says, ""Well, well, well, naughty, naughty Anastasia. You just admitted on camera that you’re going to plan to put the unvaccinated into quarantine camps."" The claim implies that anyone who is not vaccinated against COVID-19 will be placed in a quarantine facility based solely on their vaccination status, which is false. The planned facility is intended for travelers, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated. Queensland plans to use the facility for fully vaccinated international students when they enter the country, and ""the Premier believes (the facility) might also be valuable for travel for the unvaccinated,"" according to Emmy Kubainski, a manager of external relations and services in Palaszczuk’s office. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia has had strict, mandatory quarantine requirements for nearly all international travelers, and some states require quarantine for domestic travelers too. The country’s ports of entry are currently closed to everyone except citizens, permanent residents, their immediate family members and some travelers from New Zealand. Australia plans to start gradually easing its quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travelers beginning in November. The government’s transition plans suggest that unvaccinated people eventually will face different requirements than fully vaccinated people, and likely will have to quarantine when vaccinated people do not, when entering Australia and traveling within the country, but those requirements have not been defined. Fact-checkers recently rated false a similar claim that Australians who are not fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by the end of the year will be put into isolation camps. The Australian Department of Health told the Australian Associated Press that quarantine facilities are ""intended to support the quarantine of returning international travellers."" AAP reported, ""In the future, vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers could face different quarantine requirements, but this wouldn’t mean unvaccinated people living in the country would be put in camps."" False claims about quarantine facilities as jails or punishment for the unvaccinated have also spread in the U.S. and Canada. The detention of regular citizens in government camps is a popular anti-government conspiracy theory. A video post by The Charlie Kirk show said, ""Australia to Implement Quarantine Camps for the Unvaxed."" The state of Queensland is building a quarantine facility intended for arriving travelers, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated. In the future, the Australian government might impose different quarantine requirements on vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers, but unvaccinated people living in the country would not be put in camps.

Fact-checking Ron DeSantis on job growth in Florida
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took a victory lap after the federal government released job numbers for September. DeSantis, a Republican, posted on Oct. 22 that ""Florida is driving the nation’s economy forward — the nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September, and Florida accounted for 84,500."" A reader noticed this post and asked us if we could fact-check it. DeSantis made a similar point during a press conference on Oct. 25. He used the same two numbers and said that ""almost half of the nation's (job growth) output was just in Florida."" We found that Florida does have reason to be pleased with its showing in jobs for September. But DeSantis’ comparison of the two figures is exaggerated. Both numbers come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but they are calculated differently.  Florida’s number, 84,500 net jobs, is impressive compared with what other states produced. In numerical job gains, Florida ranked second in the nation to Texas that month.   Florida is the nation’s third most-populous state, so measuring job gains by raw numbers does risk giving it an unfair boost in a 50-state comparison. But in this case, Florida did well on a percentage basis, too. In fact, measuring by percentage gains from the previous month, Florida would actually leapfrog Texas to No. 1 in the national rankings for job growth. That said, this state number may change, and the numerical comparison DeSantis made to national figures isn’t apples-to-apples.  The numbers are subject to revision. Not only are these numbers preliminary, but figures for individual states have a larger margin for error than the national numbers do, and the eventual revisions made to the September numbers in subsequent months could make ""significant"" changes to the 84,500 figure, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. (Of course, the revision could push the numbers higher, rather than lower.) There can be significant variations from month to month. During the previous month, Florida gained a net 20,500 jobs, or about one-fourth of the total in September. That ranked Florida 17th nationally for percentage job growth. The month-to-month variations can be especially affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to ups and downs in what sectors are expanding or contracting at a particular time. And Florida’s bounceback in September may have had something to do with the lower job growth the previous month. Economists say a better way to look at the numbers is to use a longer timeline, so that month-to-month variations are smoothed out. So we looked at the data between September 2020 and September 2021. Florida did well, but it wasn’t as much of an outlier as it was in the most recent month alone. Year over year, Florida’s percentage job gains ranked eighth among the 50 states.   The two numbers DeSantis compared aren’t really apples to apples. The biggest caveat is the relationship between the two numbers DeSantis cited in his post. The 84,500 figure he used comes from the state-by-state breakdown released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whereas the 194,000 figure comes from the national survey. This may not sound like a big deal, but the smaller state-level counts are subject to greater uncertainty and error. Specifically, if you add up all the net job gains from the 34 states that gained jobs in September and subtract the net job losses in the 16 states that lost jobs that month, it produces a net gain of 363,000 jobs nationally. That’s a significantly larger figure than the national estimate. DeSantis’ juxtaposition made it seem like Florida accounted for 44% of the jobs created nationally. But that’s misleading. If you compare Florida’s 84,500 jobs gained to the national figure for net job gains from the same data set — 363,000 — Florida accounted for 23% of the nation’s job gains that month. Again, not a bad result, but not as good as the comparison DeSantis made. If you use the 194,000 figure, then the top three gaining states alone — Texas, Florida, and California — collectively produced a net 227,700 new jobs, which would be 117% of the new net job creation in September.  Emilie Oglesby, director of communications and external affairs at the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, said that the administration ""stands by the statement that Florida is driving the nation’s positive economic activity."" DeSantis said, ""The nation reported adding 194,000 jobs in September and Florida accounted for 84,500."" The 84,500 number was an impressive showing nationally, ranking second among the states in raw job gains and first as a percentage. However, state jobs numbers are more in flux than they may seem, because they are subject to revision and bounce around a lot from month to month.  In addition, DeSantis’ numerical comparison contains a mismatch in the underlying data. The 194,000 figure is taken from a national calculation; the more accurate national figure to compare it to is 363,000. Comparing Florida’s jobs gains to the bigger but more comparable number gives Florida a smaller share of the national total.

No, diesel fuel isn’t recharging electric cars at COP26 climate meeting
","Too bad snark can’t fuel our cars. Climate-change skeptics have delighted in pointing out the shortage of electric vehicle charging stations in Glasgow, Scotland, site of the upcoming international climate change summit known as COP26. ""More Embarrassment: COP26 Luxury EVs to be Recharged Using Diesel Generators,"" said a headline on the website Watt’s Up With That on Oct. 24. The conservative website Zero Hedge quipped Oct. 16, ""Maybe since we're gathered to talk about the negative effect on the climate, we could at least start by finding a carbon neutral way to shuttle yourself back and forth to the event."" A plain reading would suggest that electric vehicles were being recharged by burning ordinary diesel fuel.  That’s not what’s going on. Yes, generators are being used for recharging, but people who read just a bit further would see that the generators will burn a type of vegetable oil, a fuel with significantly lower emissions than diesel.  The fuel is called a biodiesel, but it’s fossil-free and chemically quite different from standard petroleum-based diesel fuel. A number of dignitaries will be staying at hotels that are some distance from the conference site, in some cases as much as 45 miles away. In September, the U.K. government announced that Jaguar Land Rover would provide electric cars and SUVs to shuttle people back and forth. According to Reuters, the automaker is providing 240 vehicles. There aren’t enough charging stations to top off the batteries for that many cars overnight. To fill the gap, as The Scotsman reported Oct. 9, the conference organizers will deploy generators powered by waste vegetable oil. The U.K. COP26 office said they would run on hydrotreated vegetable oil. Hydrotreated vegetable oil is less polluting than diesel. A 2018 comparison found the biofuel ""resulted in a significant reduction of all regulated emissions."" RELATED VIDEO 
  That included a 75% reduction in soot, 35% in carbon monoxide, at least 20% fewer  hydrocarbons, and about 6% less carbon dioxide. With nitric oxides, the results were mixed. Under some conditions, emissions were lower with hydrotreated vegetable oil. Under others, emissions were higher.  Hydrotreated vegetable oil is actually a second-generation biofuel and is broadly seen as more sustainable than the first biofuels based on products like soybeans and rapeseed. The European Union plans to use hydrotreated vegetable oil more in the next decade. While this fuel might be cleaner than diesel, climate change activists criticized the organizers for lack of planning, and suggested the delegates could ride electric buses instead of cars and SUVs.  Bloggers said the organizers of the COP26 climate change summit were using diesel generators to recharge electric vehicle batteries. Organizers are using generators, but they run on a type of vegetable oil that has much lower emissions than diesel fuel. The fuel, hydrotreated vegetable oil, is sometimes called a biodiesel, but it is not a fossil fuel and is chemically distinct from diesel.
