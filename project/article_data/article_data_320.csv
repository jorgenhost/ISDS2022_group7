Rick Santorum says after 'Obamacare,' all Americans will be dependent on the federal government
","
In a speech to supporters at the end of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, 2012, Rick Santorum offered a set of statistics designed to highlight what he sees as the growing dependence of Americans on the federal government. 
""In a very short period of time, the next two years, a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them,"" Santorum said. ""After Obamacare, it will not be less than 50 percent; it will be 100 percent."" 
We will take up the two parts of this statement in separate items. In this item, we’ll look at whether it’s correct that after President Barack Obama’s health care law takes full effect, ""100 percent"" of Americans will ""depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them."" 
To analyze this claim, we will first have to review what we wrote about the first half of the claim, so that we can provide a baseline for how many Americans currently receive federal benefits. 
We used a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010. 
As we noted, the table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans' compensation, workers' compensation, railroad retirement and veterans' educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance. 
The Census Bureau found that in the first quarter of 2010, 48.5 percent of Americans lived in a household where at least one member received one or more federal cash or cash-like benefits -- close to what Santorum said. (Counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies would push that number higher, but we won’t do so here.) 
We can think of two provisions of Obama’s health care law that are equivalent to the items included in the Census Bureau calculation: increases in Medicaid enrollment, and subsidies to participants in the health care ""exchanges."" The exchanges are marketplaces created by the law that offer insurance coverage to Americans who aren’t already provided an option for affordable, employer-provided health insurance. 
Before we calculate the impact of these two provisions of the law, let’s set a few guidelines. We will use estimates for 2019, the latest year projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in order to judge the law’s fullest projected impact. We’ll calculate the percentage of the projected U.S. population in 2020 (the closest year we could find an estimate for) that receives one of these two federal benefits from the health law. 
CBO estimates that the number of Americans added to Medicaid through the health care law by 2019, above and beyond what would have occurred without it, will be 16 million. The number of participants in the exchange by then will be 24 million. Combined, that adds up to 40 million Americans receiving one of those two benefits by 2019. When you divide that by the population by 2020, which is projected to be 341 million, that works out to be a bit under 12 percent. 
In reality, this percentage could be higher or lower than 12 percent for various reasons, including the likelihood that many people in that category will already be receiving other federal benefits or will have too much income to qualify for the means-tested exchange subsidies. 
If you add the 12 percentage point increase due to the health care law to the 48.5 percent of the population already determined by the Census Bureau to be receiving federal benefits, you’d get a bit over 60 percent of Americans relying on federal benefits, well short of the 100 percent Santorum cited. 
In addition, no matter what, by 2019, 162 million Americans are projected to be receiving employer-based health insurance, and that means they won’t be newly added to either the Medicaid rolls or the exchange subsidy population. 
Even a skeptic about the health care law, Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute, thinks Santorum is off base. 
The law ""will likely increase these numbers, especially since subsidies can extend to families of four with incomes of $88,000 per year,"" he said. ""But I can’t see any way you get to 100 percent. Santorum may be suggesting that eventually Obamacare leads to a single-payer system. I think that’s a reasonable conjecture. But it’s not the law as is."" 
The Santorum campaign did not respond to our request for comment. 
Our rating 
It’s likely that the new health care law will increase the number of Americans receiving benefits from the federal government, but it’s highly unlikely that it will push the percentage beyond 60 percent -- far from the 100 percent Santorum claims.

Rick Santorum says almost half of Americans receive federal benefits
","
In a speech to supporters at the end of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, 2012, Rick Santorum offered a set of statistics designed to highlight what he sees as the growing dependence of Americans on the federal government.

""In a very short period of time, the next two years, a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them,"" Santorum said. ""After Obamacare, it will not be less than 50 percent; it will be 100 percent.""

We will take up the two parts of this statement in separate items. In this item, we’ll look at whether it’s correct that ""a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them.""

We’re going to ignore Santorum’s focus on what will happen within ""the next two years,"" since we don’t have a crystal ball. But we think the most recent data can serve as a fair stand-in instead.

For that, we can use a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010.

The table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans' compensation, workers' compensation, railroad retirement and veterans' educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance.

The Census Bureau found that a little over 147 million Americans received payments from at least one of these programs at a time when the U.S. population was just over 303 million. This meant that 48.5 percent of Americans received federal cash or cash-like benefits -- and it means that Santorum’s number is well-supported. In fact, counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies -- neither of which are included in these figures -- would push that number higher. 
Our colleague at the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that the usefulness of these numbers is weakened because they count everyone in a household as benefiting from a particular federal payment even if that payment is made in the name of only one person. We think that's a fair point, although we would add that if a couple and their two children live under the same roof as grandma, and she receives Social Security and Medicare, those federal benefits add to the resources available to the rest of the family. And if a child gets free school lunches, his parents will have more disposable income as a result. 
Our ruling

The percentage of Americans ""who depend on some form of federal payment"" is indeed ""a little less than 50 percent,"" as Santorum said -- it was 48.5 percent in 2010. If anything, the ongoing rise in usage of food stamps and other federal assistance programs may have pushed this number higher, and adding in tax refunds from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies could push the number higher still. 
The number, however, includes every member of a household in which one member receives benefits, and in some households, it would be a stretch to say, as Santorum does, that as a result of that every member will ""depend on some form of federal payment."" Discounting for that, we rate Santorum’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-almost-half-americans-receive-f/

Rep. Gerry Connolly claims stock market doubles since Obama took oath
","
U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, as a leader in President Barack Obama’s re-election ""Truth Team,"" wants to right verbal wrongs on the president’s record.

In a Feb. 13 interview with on Richmond’s WWBT-TV with NBC12’s Ryan Nobles, Connolly, D-11th, claimed a series of successes for the president’s economic policies. One, in particular, caught our ear.

""We’ve doubled the stock market from where we started when he was sworn into office -- Bush had gotten it down to 6,500. It’s double that today,"" Connolly said.

We went to the ticker tapes to see if the stock market really has doubled since Obama’s inauguration on Jan 20, 2009. We were in deep recession then. The stock market took hits as the subprime mortgage crisis exploded. Catastrophic losses at Bear Stearns led to its sale to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008. Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that September.

We looked first at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, since that’s the index Connolly alluded to in his statement.  The Dow is an average of 30 large stocks in corporations such as Exxon Mobil, General Motors, Microsoft and Wal-Mart.

The Dow opened at 8,279.63 on the morning Obama took the oath of office and closed at 12,874.04 on Feb. 13, 2012, when Connolly made his statement. That’s a 55.5 percent increase, not really close to the 100 percent increase Connolly claimed.

So how does Connolly justify his statement?

The Dow continued to plummet after Obama took office, hitting a low of 6,469.95 on March 6, 2009. It’s at this point that the Connolly camp begins measuring the stock market’s performance under Obama. The Dow increased 99 percent from that day through the day the congressman made his claim.

James Walkinshaw, Connolly’s chief of staff, said the market, until that low point, was reacting to the policies of former President George W. Bush, a Republican. He said Obama’s economic plan began to take effect with the passage of the $787 billion stimulus on Feb. 13, 2009 and was not fully in force until the recovery money began flowing out that spring.

Walkinshaw, in an email, also said the Nasdaq Composite Index -- which largely measures stocks of technology companies -- has doubled since Obama became president. Nasdaq opened at 1,520.76 on Inauguration Day and closed at 2,931.39 on the day Connolly made his claim. That’s a 92.8 percent increase -- almost a doubling.

How much credit does Obama deserve for improvements in the stock market?

Some, but not all, said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University.  

""There are many underlying currents in the economy and the federal government can effect their direction and flow,"" he said. ""But the president is just one part of government. There’s Congress, regulatory agencies and the courts and they all fill this amalgam.""

White was skeptical about Connolly’s assertion that the decline of the market was due to Bush and the rise because of Obama. He said policies by both presidents helped lift the recession: Bush pushed through the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008 that eased credit by allowing the U.S. Treasury to buy up to $700 billion in mortgage backed securities from financial institutions; Obama proposed the stimulus, which helped save and create jobs.

""There was a set of actions started by Bush and continued by Obama that were, in my general opinion, the right actions,"" White said.

Michael Jones, chief investment officer with Riverfront Investment Group of Richmond, linked the upswing to actions by the Federal Reserve System and not presidential policies.

White said the two indexes Connolly’s office used -- the blue-chip Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq -- are not the best measures of overall stock market performance. He suggested we look at two gauges that track a broader array of companies.

So we turned to Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which measures 500 stocks representing a wide swath of the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 opened at 849.64 on Inauguration Day. It closed at 1,351.77 on the day of Connolly’s statement. That’s a 59.1 percent increase.

We also looked at the Wilshire 5000, which measures more than 6,500 stocks of all types. The index averaged 8,603.17 during the week on Inauguration Day and closed at 14,290.97 on the day of Connolly’s statement. That’s a 66.1 percent increase.

We should note that both these indexes have doubled since early March 2009, when the stock market bottomed out.

One last note: As of March 8, the stock market had not changed much since Feb. 13, when Connolly made his statement. None of the closing figures we give for that date has varied by more than 1 percent.

Our ruling

Connolly said the stock market has doubled since Obama ""was sworn into office.""

Connolly based his statement on the Dow. But to make his math work, the congressman omitted a 28 percent drop in the Dow that occurred during the first seven weeks of Obama’s presidency, attributing that to the Bush administration. Connolly advantageously begins counting for Obama when the Dow, in early March 2009, sank to its lowest level in almost 12 years.

We wouldn’t quibble if the congressmen had said the market has doubled during Obama’s term -- every index we examined shows it has done just that since March 2009. But Connolly’s statement demands a count from Day 1 of Obama’s administration and when start there,
a different picture emerges.

The Dow rose 55.5 percent from Inauguration Day to the day of Connolly’s statement. Two broad indexes tell a similar story: the S&P 500 went up 59.1 percent and the Wilshire 5000 increased by 66.1 percent. It’s debatable how much of the improvement can be pinpointed to the president’s policies.

So Connolly’s claim has a foundation that is cracked by the weight of exaggeration and cherry-picked data. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/08/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-claims-stock-market-doubles-oba/
"['Transparency', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Falk']","
Dem candidate for Wisconsin governor says GOP Gov. Scott Walker keeps schedule secret
","To fend off a recall effort aimed at removing him from office, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has traveled out of state to raise campaign money and been accused of being both greedy and secretive.

Democrat Kathleen Falk made such an attack on Feb. 18, 2012, 10 days after the Republican governor made a political trip to Florida.

Falk, a former Dane County executive who has announced she will run against Walker in a recall election expected later in 2012, said at a candidates forum:

""My calendar will be public, unlike Scott Walker's. The only reason we know he's in Florida is because of Facebook. It's bad enough that he's out of state raising these unforeseen amounts of money from billionaires and millionaires instead of working here for us. But the fact that he's on our dime and we don't know where he is, is wrong. So, my record and my schedule will be public.""

Let’s check both parts of Falk’s claim -- that Walker doesn’t make his schedule public and that ""he’s on our dime and we don’t know where he is.""

Walker’s schedule

When asked for evidence to back Falk’s claim, Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross said Walker does not post his schedule on a website or make it directly accessible to the public in any other way.

It’s true that Walker does not post his schedule ahead of time. For some events, he gives advance notice to reporters. And under the state open records law, he also issues a monthly calendar -- after the fact -- to reporters and others who request it.

That calendar, which lists Walker’s official activities as governor, is usually distributed about 10 days after the month ends, said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie.

The two most recent monthly calendars available -- December 2011 and January 2012 -- list activities from morning until night, with a time frame listed for each. Included are activities such as public appearances, meetings, media interviews, travel and phone calls; some blocks of time are simply listed as personal.

Werwie said calendars aren’t released ahead of time because the governor’s schedule can change by the hour.

Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, initially provided more information.

Doyle released to reporters a weekly list of some of his upcoming public events, but stopped the practice near the end of his first term. During both of his terms, Doyle released a detailed monthly calendar after the fact. But, unlike Walker, he included events that, while not specified as political, could be easily ascertained as political events.

Falk, who ran for governor and state attorney general while Dane County executive, issued a weekly notice listing highlights of some of her upcoming events as county executive, Ross said. Falk herself said: ""I didn't think it was the wisest thing to do to put campaign things on the county exec calendar regularly."" So, in terms of excluding political events, Falk's list of upcoming events was similar to Walker's official calendar.

Madison attorney Robert Dreps, an expert in media and political law, said governors are not compelled to create a schedule, but if they do, it is generally considered a public record that must be released upon request.

So, Falk is partially correct on the first part of her claim. Walker doesn’t keep a public schedule that would enable citizens to know his plans ahead of time, but he does release his schedule after the fact.

‘On our dime’
  
The second part of Falk’s claim -- that Walker is ""on our dime and we don’t know where he is"" -- suggests that while he’s working for the taxpayers, he takes political trips and doesn’t give notice of them.

Falk’s campaign provided two Madison newspaper articles to support this part of the claim.

The Wisconsin State Journal reported in December 2011 that Walker ""has refused to keep the public informed as to his comings and goings. His presence in New York, or Texas or Washington has been learned after the fact and almost always tipped off by a blogger or a website listing."" The Capital Times reported six weeks later that the ""governor's office does not send out press releases when he's headed out of town on campaign or personal business.""

Werwie, the governor’s spokesman, confirmed that the governor’s office does not publicize Walker’s political events or include them in his official calendar, saying the office tries to draw a line between official and political events. He cited a state statute that prohibits political events from being planned, staffed or paid for by the governor’s office.

Attorney Dreps said it is arguable that political events would not have to be listed on calendars Walker releases, because Walker is not conducting official business, but that hasn’t been tested in court.

So, Falk is partially correct on the second part of her claim, as well. It’s true that Walker doesn’t routinely notify the public about his political trips. But almost by definition he’s not ""on the public dime"" if he’s raising campaign money or involved in other political activity.

Our rating

Falk said Walker doesn't make his work schedule public -- ""he's on our dime and we don't know where he is.""

Walker makes his schedule public, but only after the fact. And while he typically doesn’t give notice of his political activities, it’s off base to claim he’s on the public dime during those times.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims proposed budget is smaller than the level of state spending when he took office
","
Gov. Chris Christie wants to increase state spending in the coming fiscal year, but he claims the proposed budget is smaller than the one in place when he took office in January 2010.

The governor made that point in a Feb. 21 speech before state legislators and other officials, when he unveiled his proposed $32.1 billion budget for fiscal year 2013, which begins July 1. The adjusted budget for the current fiscal year stands at roughly $30.9 billion.

""The budget I propose would total $32.1 billion for the coming year,"" Christie said. ""While this represents minimal growth from last year, it is still below the level of state spending when I took office.""

PolitiFact New Jersey was interested in whether state spending was higher two years ago, and a state Treasury Department spokesman showed us the numbers that back up Christie’s claim.

The proposed fiscal year 2013 budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2010 budget in place around the time Christie took office -- but just barely. The difference between the two budgets is about $5 million.

Let’s break down the numbers.

Christie, a Republican, was sworn into office on Jan. 19, 2010 -- in the middle of fiscal year 2010, which began under former Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat. Two months later, the new governor introduced his budget for fiscal year 2011.

To support the governor’s statement, Treasury spokesman Andrew Pratt pointed out how the fiscal year 2010 budget when Christie took office was $32.151 billion. That figure represented the adjusted budget as of March 16, 2010, according to a Treasury report at the time.

The governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 is $32.146 billion, according to a recent budget summary. ""As such, his statement is true,"" Pratt told us.

So, the proposed budget is roughly $5 million less than the ""level of state spending"" when Christie took office, marking a decrease of 0.016 percent. That’s not a lot of money, but it still means Christie’s statement is correct.

But there’s a major reason for why the fiscal year 2010 budget was larger than the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013: federal stimulus dollars.

That adjusted budget of $32.151 billion for fiscal year 2010 included $2.289 billion worth of appropriations supported by stimulus funds. Those stimulus funds were used to help close a projected budget shortfall.

Without those stimulus dollars, the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 would be larger than the budget in place when Christie took office.

Our ruling

In his Feb. 21 budget speech, Christie claimed in regard to his proposed fiscal year 2013 budget: ""While this represents minimal growth from last year, it is still below the level of state spending when I took office.""

According to state Treasury documents, Christie is accurate. The proposed budget is $32.146 billion -- about $5 million less than the $32.151 billion spending plan in place when Christie took office.

We rate the statement True.

Rick Scott says state pension fund is ""not funded""
","
Gov. Rick Scott made no secret of his distaste for a judge’s decision to overturn a 3 percent cut in state workers’ salaries on March 6, 2012.

Lawmakers in 2011 touted the cut as necessary; they said they were diverting the money to shore up the $124 billion pension fund for state and local employees. The change saved the state $1 billion and local governments $600 million, reported the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald.

Circuit Judge Jackie Fulford’s decision throws that plan into chaos. She ruled the pay cut an unconstitutional breach of the state's contract with employees and ordered the money returned with interest. 
Fulford noted in her order that the 3-percent salary reduction did not actually go toward the retirement fund; legislators used it to balance the budget and left $1.2 billion unspent. 
Her decision didn't sit well with Scott.  
""This is an example of a judge wanting to write the law. We all know that this is constitutional, there's no question about it,"" Scott told reporters. 
""I want to make sure we fix the plan so individuals can actually rely on it. Because today, you can't rely on that plan, it's not funded,"" he said. ""So it's going to have a big impact on our counties, it has a big impact on our state budget. But it's clearly constitutional.""

We’ve heard alarming things about Florida’s pension fund over the years, but never that it is flatly not funded. PolitiFact Florida wanted to set the record straight on how the Florida Retirement System works.

The truth is that Florida’s pension fund is funded. Is it fully funded? No, but that’s not typical for most state pension funds.

The most recent data shows the pension’s worth versus what it owes in benefits is 87.5 percent, as of June 30, 2011. So if everyone in the pension system retired at once, there would not be enough money in the retirement system to pay their full benefits.

Still, 87 percent isn’t bad compared to most states. The average level is 77 percent.

""87 (percent) is a strong funding level, particularly given the difficult financial market over recent years,"" said Keith Brainard, research director of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

Scott spokesman Lane Wright said we were nit-picking the governor’s statement and that he obviously just misspoke. Wright pointed us to past stories on the pension from our site and the Tampa Bay Times, where Scott correctly asserts the retirement system is underfunded.

What’s more, Wright said, is that Scott’s office for a few months has been occupied by a big chart comparing the pension fund’s liabilities, assets and payments. His graphic correctly shows the plan as funded at 87.5 percent for fiscal year 2010-11. It also shows how that liability has grown since 2007-08.
""He’s had that chart there since at least the beginning of January,"" Wright said.

Not long before storing a daily reminder of the liability gap in his office, Scott attempted to address it in his 2011-12 budget proposal. He called for $300 million to go into the retirement system, including an additional $120 million to address the liability on top of fully funding the normal annual contribution.

In his response to the judge’s ruling, though, Scott’s warning was stark, saying ""I want to make sure we fix the plan so individuals can actually rely on it. Because today, you can't rely on that plan, it's not funded."" That sounds really bad to people who are relying on state benefits. The truth is, it's one of the better funded pension plans in the country. If all public employees retired tomorrow, they still get 87.5 percent of what they were owed. We rate his statement False.

David Axelrod says Barack Obama won more Ohio votes than Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum combined
","
During election night coverage of the Super Tuesday contests on March 6, 2012, NBC’s Brian Williams interviewed David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. In that interview, Axelrod tried to shift the focus from that night’s GOP primary fight in Ohio -- in which Mitt Romney edged out Rick Santorum statewide -- to the president’s reelection bid. 
""Tonight in Ohio, more people came out to vote for Barack Obama in an unopposed race than voted for Romney and Santorum combined,"" Axelrod told Williams. 
A reader asked us to check this claim, so we did. 
We looked at the Ohio Secretary of State’s election results page and found the following statewide totals as of the morning after the primary, at which point 100 percent of precincts had been counted. Here are the totals: 
Obama: 547,588 votes (100 percent of the Democratic primary vote) 
Romney: 456,205 votes (37.95 percent of the Republican primary vote)
Santorum: 445,697 votes (37.07 percent of the Republican primary vote)
Total of Romney and Santorum: 901,902 votes 
Clearly, Obama didn’t outpoll the combination of Romney and Santorum. He did outpoll them each individually, so Axelrod would have been correct if he’d said that Obama won more votes than ""either Romney or Santorum."" 
We do have an educated guess about where Axelrod may have gotten the idea, though. 
At 8:17 p.m., BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith, a prominent national political journalist, tweeted, ""Huh: So far more votes for Obama in OH tonight than for all Republicans (who have actual campaigns) combined."" 
However, 14 minutes later, Smith walked back that comment: ""Ah: The early pile of votes for Obama seems to be because Cuyahoga among the first reporting."" 
Smith was referring to Cuyahoga County, which is home to Cleveland. Not only is Cuyahoga County a populous jurisdiction that votes heavily Democratic, but voters in a portion of it were especially likely to vote that day because of another race on the ballot -- the hotly contested face-off, forced by redistricting, between incumbent Democratic House members Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich. 
All told, 39 percent of the new congressional district is in Cuyahoga. Having a large number of ballots counted early in the evening from Cuyahoga would boost Obama's turnout numbers compared to the Republican candidates. 
Axelrod’s interview was at 10:30 p.m., which was well after Smith’s correction tweet. 
Our ruling 
Axelrod’s claim turned out to be off by a wide margin by the time all votes were counted and was almost certainly wrong at the time he said it. We rate the claim False.

Mitt Romney says the Iranians released hostages in 1981 because they feared Ronald Reagan's approach to foreign policy
","
During a March 6, 2012, video address to a conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, Mitt Romney seized the tough foreign policy mantle of President Ronald Reagan. 
""I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength,"" Romney told the pro-Israel group. ""There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in. As president, I'll offer that kind of clarity, strength and resolve."" 
But was Reagan’s ""peace through strength"" philosophy really responsible for freeing the 52 Americans who were taken hostage by Islamic militants and held for 444 days? 
First, a reminder of what the hostage crisis was all about. In 1979, the Shah of Iran -- who had been installed and supported by successive United States administrations -- was overthrown by Islamic revolutionaries. Militants took over the American embassy and held hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day President Jimmy Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of the incumbent’s handling of the crisis. 
""Iran contacted the Carter administration in September 1980 with a proposal to end the hostage crisis,"" said Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor who has written two books about the Iran hostage crisis. ""The U.S. made a proposal. Iran responded with an unacceptable offer just a day or two before the election. Afterwards, they nominated the Algerians to act as intermediaries. Those valuable discussions went on until literally the day or two before the inauguration, and they were settled by the Iranians caving in on a number of issues that were extremely costly to them. By my calculations, the Iranians ended up paying about $300,000 per hostage per day of incarceration."" 
The agreement that led to the release, as described by the New York Times 11 days after it occured, revolved around $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. It had been negotiated over the course of several months before Reagan's inauguration. 
The Times, in its account of the inauguration, reported that ""no one on the speaker's stand knew of the latest developments in Iran. Word quickly spread among the governors, Congressmen and Reagan friends, family and aides as they left the platform."" 
Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, ""but the onetime bitter rivals for the presidency told reporters as they entered the speaker's area separately, to the flourish of trumpets, that the hostages had not yet taken off from Tehran. The President got his first chance to announce the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall in the Capitol."" 
So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages’ safe return. However, we contacted seven scholars of the period, and their consensus was that neither Reagan nor his philosophy played any significant role in freeing the hostages. 
""Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats,"" said David Farber, a Temple University historian and author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. 
""No Reagan administration officials participated in the successful negotiations,"" Farber added. ""The Iranian government waited to officially release the Americans until Carter had left the presidency as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages."" 
""By doing this, Iran thought they were showing the world that they could meddle in our affairs, just as we had done to them in 1953,"" added Dave Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. Houghton suggested that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and said he thinks it’s possible that the Iranians ""didn’t even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail."" 
""I don't think they were scared into the release,"" Houghton said. ""In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq."" 
The one scholar who entertained the possibility that Iran was taking heed of the future president’s philosophy was Michael Gunter, a political scientist at Tennessee Tech University and the author of several papers about the crisis. Still, Gunter added, the ""main reason for the release"" was that ""the mileage the Iranians had gained by holding the hostages had been used for everything it was worth and there was no further advantage in continuing."" 
Several other experts agreed that the Iranians’ focus was on Carter, not Reagan. 
""If it was related to the occupant of the White House, it certainly had more to do with Carter than Reagan,"" said Stephen Kinzer, a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Boston University and authored the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future. ""My guess is that the hostages would have been released even if someone else had been inaugurated -- anyone but Carter. The Iranians had come to hate Carter and didn't want to give him a triumph. Giving it to someone else was fine with them."" 
Sick, the Columbia University professor, said that ""those who wish to believe that the final flurry of activity was out of fear of Reagan have a right to their opinion. Those closer to the events believed that the Iranians, who had clearly decided months earlier that the hostages were a wasting asset, feared that they would have to start the whole laborious process of negotiation over from scratch with a new administration, which obviously had no great appeal."" 
The Romney campaign did not return an inquiry seeking backup for the candidate’s claim. 
Our ruling 
We can’t read the Iranians’ minds, but seven scholars of the period told us that Reagan’s foreign policy approach was either a minor factor in the release of the hostages or not a factor at all. The fact that the deal was negotiated entirely by the Carter administration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team, seems to support the expert consensus. Romney made a claim that flies in the face of history and offered no evidence to support it. We rate the statement Pants On Fire. ",/factchecks/2012/mar/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-iran-released-hostages-1981-becau/

Rick Santorum says happiness 'at the time of our founders' was 'doing what you ought to do'
","
When Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"" into the Declaration of Independence — just what did he mean by happiness?

Probably not what you think he meant, according to Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum.

""If you actually go back and look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders ... happiness was not going out and doing whatever you want to do to make yourself feel good,"" Santorum explained in a campaign speech near Knoxville, Tenn., on Feb. 29, 2012. ""Happiness was not doing what you wanted to do but doing what you ought to do, because that's what leads to true happiness.""

Doing what you ought to do, huh?

We had to know: What did dictionaries say about happiness when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence? Was ""happiness"" about doing your duty, rather than chasing your desires?

We tracked down dictionaries Jefferson would have had in his library, consulted historical references in the Oxford English Dictionary, read source documents for the Declaration of Independence and spoke with historians. As it turns out, Santorum was right in some ways — and very wrong in others.

The speech

Santorum invoked the wisdom of the founding fathers during his hourlong campaign speech. The Constitution of the United States should be ""central to the conversation,"" along with its companion document, the 1776 Declaration of Independence from the British empire, he said.

""You really can't have one — and understand the country — without the other,"" he said. ""While the Constitution is the how of America, the declaration is really the soul of America, the why of America.""

God is mentioned four times in the declaration, he said, starting with the word ""creator"" in its most famous sentence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

Santorum mentioned that ""life, liberty and property"" was the other phrase used at the time — but that for the founders, the term ""property"" wasn’t enough.

""It was insufficient, because ‘property’ is about stuff,"" he said. ""They put the sights at a higher calling: happiness.""

He continued: 
""When we think of the word happiness today, we're thinking, is that a higher calling? To go out and do what makes you happy? To go out and seek enjoyment and pleasure? Because of course, that's what we think of today when we think of happiness — things that make you feel good. 
""But our founders had a fundamentally different understanding of that word, because they understood what true happiness — what process it took to create true happiness. And if you actually go back and look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders, it was even there. It was something that was discussed and written about. Happiness was not going out and doing whatever you want to do to make yourself feel good. Happiness was not doing what you wanted to do, but doing what you ought to do, because that's what leads to true happiness."" 
For this fact-check, we’re looking at the claim, ""If you look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders … happiness was not doing what you want to do, but doing what you ought to do.""

'Happiness'

We asked Santorum’s campaign for support for his statement but didn’t hear back.

Instead, we turned to the Jefferson Library in Charlottesville, Va., down the road from Jefferson’s historic plantation, Monticello.

In 1776, a committee of five was assigned the task of writing the Declaration of Independence, but Jefferson wrote the rough draft, including the key phrase, ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" So we figured his understanding of ""happiness"" would be most relevant to this fact-check.

Research librarian Anna Berkes pointed us to two dictionaries among those known to be in Jefferson’s collection, by Samuel Johnson and Nathan Bailey. (Jefferson owned the 1775 edition of Johnson’s dictionary, and we consulted the 1773 version, but bear with us. We consulted the matching version of Bailey’s reference work.)

Did their definitions of ""happiness"" talk about ""what you ought to do""? Not so much.

Johnson’s Dictionary of the English Language had this to say (we’ve changed some of his F’s to S’s to make it more readable to the modern eye): 
Happiness 
1. Felicity; state in which the desires are satisfied 
2. Good luck; good fortune. 
3. Fortuitous elegance 
Bailey’s Universal Etymological English Dictionary defined the word merely as, ""Felicity, good Fortune.""

So, if anything, Johnson’s ""state in which the desires are satisfied"" would seem to contradict Santorum’s claim that ""happiness was not going out and doing whatever you want to do to make yourself feel good."" How else would you satisfy your desires?

We marched on toward another historical perspective, provided by the Oxford English Dictionary. Jefferson wouldn’t have had the benefit of the authoritative reference — the earlier version wasn’t published until 1898.

But the OED catalogs the use of words over time, so it offers a snapshot of ""happiness"" as Jefferson might have understood it. OED’s basic definition is the ""quality or condition of being happy,"" and includes this citation from Isaac Watts’ book Logick in 1725:

""Happiness consists in the attainment of the highest and most lasting natural good.""

That’s more in line with Santorum’s discussion of ""true happiness"" but still doesn’t get to the idea of ""what you ought to do.""

Meanwhile, when we looked up definitions of ""happy"" in the OED, the lengthy entry included the ""colloquial, humorous"" definition of ""slightly drunk: ‘elevated,’"" based on two citations, one from the Gentleman’s Mag in 1770.

So it seems the understanding of ""happiness"" in the founder’s era wasn’t entirely divorced from seeking ""enjoyment and pleasure.""

The dictionaries weren't definitive. It was time to move on to other writings.

John Locke’s ‘happiness’

We spoke with three historians with expertise in the time period, including one who wrote the entry on ""happiness"" for the Blackwell Encyclopedia of the American Revolution.

They agreed Santorum was right in the sense that "" ‘pursuit of happiness’ is the pursuit of fulfillment in a wider sense than immediate gratification,"" said Jan Lewis, a history professor at Rutgers University at Newark who wrote the encyclopedia entry.

That’s relatively consistent with Santorum’s claim that happiness ""was not doing what you want to do."" But Santorum’s claim that to the founders it instead meant ""doing what you ought to do"" lands him on the wrong side of history, experts said.

That’s a puritanical definition out of line with the world of Jefferson.

""It wasn't a sense of obligation. It wasn't a sense of oughtness. Rather, it was a more expansive sense of property,"" Lewis said. ""... I guess the closest we could say is ‘well-being,’ being well-situated, being fulfilled.""

And Jefferson may not have been referring to individual happiness at all, she said — a point of debate among scholars. He may have been writing about a general sense of social well-being, a good standard of living — not about individual desire or duty.

""It wasn't an individualist, libertine happiness or individualist pleasure-seeking,"" she said. ""But it wasn't a sense of duty.""

The founders were rebels, she pointed out.

""Jefferson and the founding fathers were not about duty. Duty would have been your obligation to obey the monarch. Duty would have been your obligation to obey priests, to obey the church hierarchy, to find fulfillment in obeying your hierarchy,"" she said. ""… That was not the way Jefferson and the founding fathers thought.""

Rather, Jefferson was likely drawing on the ""happiness"" that John Locke wrote about in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, said Richard Beeman, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania to whom we were referred by the National Constitution Center.

Locke, a 17th century English philosopher, provided key inspiration for the Americans’ withdrawal from Great Britain, especially with his Second Treatise on Government written in 1682.

""Life, liberty and property."" That was derived from a phrase of Locke’s. But he had plenty to say about happiness in his essay. Pursuing true happiness was the foundation of liberty, he wrote. And true happiness may mean being ""obliged to suspend the satisfaction of our desires in particular cases.""

At last! That’s far more in line with Santorum’s speech than early dictionary definitions. Locke’s happiness required some sense of deliberation, rather than knee-jerk pleasure-seeking.

""Whatever necessity determines to the pursuit of real bliss, the same necessity, with the same force, establishes suspense, deliberation and scrutiny of each successive desire, whether the satisfaction of it does not interfere with our true happiness, and mislead us from it,"" he wrote.

And yet, Locke wasn’t opposed to pleasure or feeling good. In his world, the definition of happiness would vary individual to individual.

""Men may choose different things and yet all choose right,"" he wrote. 
""The mind has a different relish, as well as the palate; and you will as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all men with riches or glory (which yet some men place their happiness in) as you would to satisfy all men's hunger with cheese or lobsters; which though very agreeable and delicious fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive; and many people would, with reason, prefer the griping of an hungry belly, to those dishes which are a feast to others. Hence it was, I think, that the philosophers of old did in vain inquire, whether summum bonum consisted in riches or bodily delights or virtue or contemplation? And they might have as reasonably disputed whether the best relish were to be found in apples, plums, or nuts; and have divided themselves into sects upon it. For as pleasant tastes depend not on the things themselves, but their agreeableness to this or that particular palate, wherein there is great variety; so the greatest happiness consists in the having those things which produce the greatest pleasure; and in the absence of those which cause any disturbance, any pain. Now these, to different men, are very different things."" 
So to Locke, the pursuit of happiness could mean the pursuit of ""doing what you want to do,"" unlike Santorum what said. Locke just wanted people to be deliberate about their choices and make decisions in their long-term favor. If a man believed there to be no heaven, he might decide, "" ‘let us eat and drink’ let us enjoy what we delight in, ‘for tomorrow we shall die,’ "" Locke wrote.

That example was, to Locke, ""why, though all men’s desires tend to happiness, yet they are not moved by the same object.""

For him, happiness was in the eye of the beholder — and not merely in ""doing what you ought to do."" 
In the era, happiness was ""a many-definition term, and it's very hard to nail down,"" said Peter Onuf, a history profesor at the University of Virginia who specializes in the American Revolution. 
Certainly, ""ought"" wasn’t part of Jefferson’s definition, according to Lewis and Beeman, also deeply familiar with his writings.

""Jefferson would not have said happiness is 'doing what you ought to do,' ""  Beeman said.

Our ruling

Santorum said, ""If you look up the dictionary definition of happiness at the time of our founders … happiness was not doing what you want to do, but doing what you ought to do."" We took him up on that and checked two dictionaries that would have been in Jefferson’s library and one published after the fact with historical references and found no such mention. Although we did read work by philosopher John Locke that might be read as supporting part of Santorum's assertion, Locke went on to say that happiness means different things to different individuals. And historians told us that the notion that happiness means doing your duty or ""doing what you ought to do"" ran counter to Jefferson's nature and to the nature of other founders.

Rick Santorum says government lets health insurers keep only 15 percent of their revenue
","
In a 40-minute speech to supporters near Knoxville ahead of Super Tuesday, presidential candidate Rick Santorum framed the health care debate in terms of government power versus individual choice.

President Barack Obama, he said on Feb. 29, 2012, ""wants that power in the hands of government. He wants to control your insurance policies and your access and the reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and how much insurance companies -- not how much they’ll make, how much they’re allowed to keep of the money they collect.

""That’s already in place by the way. The federal government has a regulation in place already that tells health insurance companies how much money they’re allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues. Fifteen percent -- that’s what they can keep. That’s how much money they get to keep to run their businesses.""

He wrapped up the topic saying, ""they’re going to micromanage everything because they don’t believe in you.""

We decided to check the claim that the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep just 15 percent of their revenues to use for operating expenses.

Medical loss ratio

Santorum didn’t call it by this name, and we didn’t hear back from his campaign for our story, but it appears he was referring to the medical loss ratio, a provision of the 2010 health care reform law signed by Obama and opposed by congressional Republicans.

The provision is similar to others already in place in several states. It ""requires most insurance companies that cover individuals and small businesses to spend at least 80 percent of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement, leaving the remaining 20 percent for administration, marketing, and profit. The … threshold is higher for large group plans, which must spend at least 85 percent of premium dollars on health care and quality improvement,"" according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There are other exceptions for small companies. (You can read Kaiser’s full explainer on the medical loss ratio here.)

Insurance companies that exceed those limits are required to pay the money back in rebates to their customers, beginning in 2012.

With large group plans required to spend 85 percent of premium income on health care, what’s left is the 15 percent to which Santorum referred.

According to John Rother at the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, the medical loss ratio ""was enacted to put pressure on insurers to become more efficient"" as well as to ""make sure that consumers and businesses got a fair deal on their premiums.""

Timothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., called it ""a pro-consumer regulation.""

The idea behind, he said, is that ""when people purchase health insurance, they ought to have the money go to health care.""

Revenue not affected

Santorum referred to health insurers’ overall revenue -- ""what they receive"" -- but the provision applies only to revenue from premiums. In other words, of what you pay your insurer in premiums, 80 or 85 percent must be spent on your health care. It may not pay for television commercials or new office space.

But other sources of revenue may be used for those purposes.

""Many (insurance companies) have side businesses, offering IT services and other services that are sold to health providers,"" said Rother.

Added Jost: ""Some insurers are heavily invested, and that doesn’t figure in at all.""

""It’s not that they are limited to 15 percent of their income for all of their expenses. They’re limited in their premium income,"" Jost said.

While they may not account for all revenue, Robert Zirkelbach, press secretary for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, pointed out that premiums comprise the majority of insurance companies’ revenue.

Expenses not affected

Some insurers’ expenses, such as quality improvement efforts, taxes, regulatory fees and patient safety, do not have to come out of the 15 percent.

Jost said some things that previously were considered administrative costs are now specifically exempted, namely quality improvement costs that include wellness programs and patient safety.

""It does not limit the insurers’ ability to work with doctors and hospitals to improve quality. Those costs are not charged against the 15 or 20 percent limit,"" Rother said.

But Zirkelbach said the cap also encompasses services that affect consumers, including services to help patients navigate complicated delivery systems, efforts to modernize technology and programs to prevent fraud and abuse.

His group raised concerns about the medical loss ratio when it was being debated, citing fears it would disrupt the health insurance market and inhibit innovation.

A Government Accountability Office study found that the majority of established insurers would have already been in compliance with the medical loss ratio in 2010 if it had been in effect. Thus, most policy holders won’t be getting a rebate this year, Jost said. But they’re also likely avoiding premium rate increases that might have happened without the rule.

""It’s … fair to say that many insurers are showing that they can meet this requirement without breaking a sweat,"" Rother said.

Our ruling

Santorum said the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep only 15 percent of their revenues to run their businesses.

His description of the medical loss ratio provision of the health reform law doesn't tell the whole story. The rule does require large group insurance plans to spend 85 percent of their premium income on real health care. For small group plans the rule is more generous. All health insurance companies are still free to spend other streams of revenue however they wish, and several types of expenses are specifically exempted from the 15 (or 20) percent limit.

Santorum’s statement leaves out a good deal of important information. That pushes the needle to Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/07/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-government-lets-health-insurers/

Christie’s pension contributions would represent 75 percent of the total payments made between 1995 and 2010, assemblyman says
","
After just two years of making contributions to the state’s pension funds, Gov. Chris Christie apparently will be closing in on the total amount contributed by his five predecessors during a 15-year period.

Well, that’s at least what one state assemblyman claimed in a recent TV appearance.

With a combined pension contribution of nearly $1.6 billion over two fiscal years, Christie is on track to contribute 75 percent of the total state contribution made between 1995 and 2010, according to state Assemblyman Gary Chiusano (R-Sussex).

Chiusano made that claim during a Feb. 26 interview on My9 News’ ""New Jersey Now,"" when he appeared with Assemblyman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson). The week before, the Republican governor unveiled his fiscal year 2013 budget, which includes a nearly $1.1 billion pension contribution.

""Assemblyman Prieto is correct in terms of us funding the pensions by $1.1 billion, actually. And combine that with the contribution last year, the total…contribution by this Legislature and this governor is $1.6 billion,"" Chiusano told host Brenda Blackmon.

""Brenda, that's 75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010,"" Chiusano continued. ""That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Chiusano needs to check his math, because he’s off by about $1.3 billion.

Chiusano acknowledged in an e-mail that he mistakenly used the contributions made by former Gov. Jon Corzine to represent all of the contributions during that 15-year period.

""You are correct. The figure I was using as a Grand Total was in fact a Sub Total,"" Chiusano told us. ""The corrected statement in the future will be that Christie's total contributions to date will be 45.65% of the total contributed in 15 years of $3.4 billion. Thanks for catching that.""

Let’s explain how the pension payments break down.

The governor’s fiscal year 2013 budget summary includes a page detailing pension contributions from fiscal year 1995 under then-Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to Christie’s proposed payment for fiscal year 2013.

According to that page, the combined state contribution between fiscal years 1995 and 2010 was about $3.4 billion -- not the $2.1 billion cited by Chiusano.

Here’s the pension payments by governor: 
$3,406,543,000 
Between payments in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, Christie’s total pension contribution would be $1,555,237,000, according to the budget summary.

Based on that figure, Christie’s total contribution would represent about 45 percent of the total payment made between 1995 and 2010. That’s 30 percentage points less than the 75 percent claimed by Chiusano.

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Chiusano claimed that Christie’s total pension contribution would represent ""75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010. That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion.""

But according to the state Treasury Department, Christie’s total payment of nearly $1.6 billion would represent about 45 percent of the roughly $3.4 billion contributed between 1995 and 2010.

Marijuana use claim close to the mark
","Most Georgians missed it, but there was a presidential debate here after all.

Actually, it was a forum, and the candidates weren’t the Republicans vying for the White House. (CNN canceled a debate set for last Thursday in Atlanta when GOP candidates Mitt Romney and Ron Paul said they had other plans.)

These candidates were Libertarians, five of them, and they answered questions from a moderator for about an hour at their party’s Georgia state convention Feb. 25 in Athens. The Truth-O-Meter started swaying when Gary Johnson, who won a straw poll afterward with 79 percent of the vote, was asked a question about legalizing marijuana.

Johnson, who believes in legalizing marijuana, said an individual’s drug problem should be handled by his or her family -- not the criminal justice system. He then offered this statistic:

""Fifty percent of the [high school] graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done some illegal drugs,"" said Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico.

We wondered whether Johnson, who initially tried running as a Republican for president this year, was correct?

For the record, Johnson doesn’t believe teenagers should have access to marijuana. Johnson does believe marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and thinks the money the federal government spends on marijuana enforcement could be better spent ""against the individuals committing real crimes against society.""

The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on marijuana use. According to the CDC’s most recent data, from 2009, nearly 46 percent of 12th-graders had smoked marijuana at least once. Nearly 51 percent of 12th-grade boys had used marijuana, while the percentage of girls was lower, at just over 40 percent. In Georgia, the percentage of all 12th-graders who tried marijuana at least once was nearly identical to the national average.

The CDC figures showed the following for other illicit drug use by 12th-graders in 2009: 

There was no overall figure for the percentage of 12th-graders who used any illegal drug.

The federal National Institutes of Health has data on its website that says 42 percent of 12th-graders in 2009 had tried marijuana. The percentage had actually declined from nearly 48 percent in 2002. Officials there provided PolitiFact Georgia some data for all types of illicit drug use by 12th-graders.

""In 2011, 50% of high school seniors reported having tried an illicit drug at some time,
40% used one or more drugs in the past 12 months, and 25% used one or more drugs in the prior 30 days,"" Shirley Simson, a media specialist for the NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, told us via email.

Simson said there’s been an increase in the past four years, primarily due to more teenagers smoking marijuana.

The National Center for Education Statistics has data on its website that says about 47 percent of the graduating class of 2009 had tried any type of illicit drug. The percentage has declined each year since 2000, when 54 percent of high school seniors had tried drugs.

We couldn’t find data about the percentage of high school seniors graduating this year who’ve smoked marijuana or have done any kind of illicit drug. The studies we’ve found show drug use among 12th-graders hovers around the 50 percent mark, with a slight decline in recent years.

Silvestre Reyes says challenger favors legalizing drugs
","A video posted by U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes of El Paso opens by showing a silent, grim-faced child. His image is followed by other kids individually saying ""no."" The words flash on screen: ""Beto O'Rourke,"" challenging Reyes in the 2012 Democratic primary, ""wants to legalize drugs."" ""Legalizing drugs is not the answer,"" a narrator says. ""Even our children understand.""

Does O’Rourke, a businessman and former member of the El Paso City Council, want to legalize drugs?

Marijuana, certainly, we learned.

But a news article in the Feb. 28, 2012, El Paso Times quotes O’Rourke saying he has not advocated the wholesale legalization of drugs.

The article quotes Reyes defending his ad by pointing to a book and a 2011 San Antonio Express-News op-ed column that O’Rourke co-wrote with Susie Byrd, a member of the El Paso City Council.

Their Dec. 4, 2011, column says the prohibition of marijuana has resulted in a lucrative but violent marijuana economy entwining Mexico and the United States.

""Mexican drug cartels smuggle many things into the U.S., but marijuana is the most profitable portion of the cartel's portfolio,"" the column says. ""Marijuana has the larger customer base with the most stable demand and steady prices. And, the Mexican cartels own the value of the marijuana from farm to market.""

El Paso, the column continues, ""bears daily witness to the violence that the marijuana economy inflicts on Juarez, our neighbor on the U.S./Mexico border. Since 2008, more than 9,000 people have been murdered in Juarez. The violence stems at least in part from a declared war between the two largest cartels for control of the El Paso/Juarez trade corridor.""

Meanwhile, they write, Americans, including high-school students, continue to use marijuana.

""At some point, we must challenge our elected leaders to enact laws that reflect reality,"" the column says. ""We must come to a reckoning, much the same way we did 80 years ago, and repeal a prohibition that does more harm than good. If Washington won't do anything different, if Mexico City won't do anything different, then it is up to us — the citizens of the border who understand the futility and tragedy of this current policy first hand — to lead the way.""

In December 1933, the federal prohibition of the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic liquors, which had been in place since early 1919, was repealed on ratification of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. Alcohol consumption had persisted in the intervening years while federal efforts to enforce prohibition cost 150 lives and billions of dollars, according to a December 5, 1933, New York Times report.

We did not track down O’Rourke’s just-published book, ""Dealing Death and Drugs, the Big Business of Dope in the U.S. and Mexico."" But we noticed the subtitle underneath the title on a portion of a Kindle version of the book: ""An Argument to End the Prohibition of Marijuana.""

A Nov. 21, 2011, El Paso Times news article about the book quotes O’Rourke opining on possible benefits from legalizing marijuana: ""We can do a much better job of keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids and keeping marijuana proceeds out of the hands of cartels that use those proceeds to murder, kill and terrorize with impunity, corrupt public officials, recruit people and arm themselves.""

Reyes also has offered as backup for his claim a resolution supported by O’Rourke when he was on the El Paso City Council. According to a news account on newspapertree.com, an online El Paso newspaper, the council in January 2009 unanimously endorsed the resolution, which included language added at O’Rourke’s suggestion urging the federal government to come to the aid of bordering Juarez by ""supporting an honest open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics."" The story says Mayor John Cook later vetoed the resolution, saying that as amended, it would not be taken seriously in Washington.

O’Rourke, talking to reporters about the resolution before the veto, said: ""I’m not advocating legalization, but I’m saying that we should at the very least have a conversation about ending prohibition. And that it is looking like one of the more attractive solutions out there right now to an otherwise intractable problem that’s getting worse by the day."" He added that the nation needs to rethink its drug war, which is ""not working.""

After declaring his House candidacy, O’Rourke defended the resolution in what appears to be a classroom speech, according to an undated video of his remarks brought to our attention by Reyes’ campaign. In the recording, O’Rourke recaps his rationale for advocating the resolution and says that he said at the time that ""given what’s going on in Juarez, given what’s at stake, I think that we owe ourselves an honest and open conversation about our drug laws and potentially, potentially, ending the prohibition on these drugs -- namely and most importantly marijuana.""

Reyes’ campaign also pointed out a ""declaration"" presented by O’Rourke and others at the U.S.-Mexico border on May 17, 2010, bemoaning conditions in Juarez and urging ""repeal of the ineffective U.S. marijuana drug laws in favor of regulating, controlling and taxing the production, distribution, sale and consumption of marijuana by adults.""

In a telephone interview, O’Rourke told us that he favors ending the legal prohibition on marijuana but has not been telling voters he will push such a change. He said that is ""not a priority of this community; it doesn’t reflect the desires of people I seek to represent as my constituents.""

Asked why he doesn’t describe himself as favoring legalization of marijuana, O’Rourke replied: ""That word (legalize) is so charged and weighted from years of popular culture references.""

Our ruling O’Rourke favors ending laws against marijuana and has urged a national conversation about legalizing other illegal drugs. But Reyes’ claim leaves the misimpression that O’Rourke favors legalizing all illegal drugs.

"['Vermont', 'Vermont Democratic Party']","
Is Scott Milne violating campaign finance laws by appearing in ads for his company?
","The Vermont Democratic Party has called on state media organizations to stop running advertisements for Milne Travel, a business owned by Scott Milne, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor.  Milne has recently appeared in television ads for his travel agency. The Democrats allege Milne is spending corporate funds ""in service of boosting his name recognition for political gains."" ""Advertisements for Mr. Milne’s travel company allow Milne to illegally use corporate funds and skirt around campaign finance laws to boost his name recognition for political gain,"" party officials said in a statement. The television ad featuring Milne does not make a reference to his political candidacy. In the advertisement, Milne says he hopes the Covid-19 pandemic will soon subside, and that a ""brighter day is on the horizon."" ""When you are ready to travel again, we're right here, ready to help, just as we've been since 1975,"" Milne says. But the Democratic Party charges that Milne's ad doesn't focus on his business, but his personal story.  ""It's in fact kind of a bio narrative that you would put in a campaign ad, so that's where the concern lies,"" R. Christopher Di Mezzo, a spokesperson for the party, said in an interview. The current ad does not highlight Milne's backstory. But in 2016, when he was running for U.S. Senate, Milne also appeared in ads for his company, which mentioned that his parents founded the company in the 1970s. Is running and appearing in ads for his company while seeking the lieutenant governor's office really an illegal use of corporate funds, as the Democrats claim? The Democratic Party pointed to federal and state campaign finance laws to back up their claim.  State law defines an ""electioneering communication"" as one that clearly refers to a candidate for office, and either supports, or opposes that candidate. Federal law has a similar definition: candidates and corporations must report expenditures that promote the election of candidates.  But campaign finance experts said that just because Milne appears in ads for his company while running for office at the same time doesn’t mean he is running afoul of the law.  Brian Porto, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in election law, said that after reviewing state statutes, he can’t find ""clear evidence of a violation."" ""He may be using ‘corporate funds’ from his company, but using your company's funds to promote your company's product -- in this case, travel services -- is perfectly legal,"" Porto said. ""Admittedly, Mr. Milne appears in the ads, but their purpose is to promote his company, not him,"" Porto said, adding he didn’t see how the ads ""intend to promote [Milne’s] candidacy."" ""If the viewer didn't already know that Milne was a candidate, she certainly wouldn't learn from the ad that he was a candidate,"" he said.  Porto noted that the advertisements could ""boost his general name recognition"" and suggested that an ""ethical compromise"" would be for Milne to not appear in them until after the election.  The Vermont Secretary of State’s Office referred to state elections statutes and declined to comment.
 
Burlington attorney and longtime Progressive John Franco, who has represented Vermont political candidates in campaign finance cases, called the Democrats' claim that the ads were an illegal use of corporate money ""BS."" Franco said that he doesn't doubt that Milne might be trying to use the ads for a political advantage. But that doesn't mean he’s violating the law.   ""I have no doubt that that's what's going on. But is it a campaign finance violation? No,"" Franco said. ""This complaint by the Democrats doesn't even meet the straight face test. There's nothing about this ad that's a campaign ad. It just isn't."" Jared Carter, a constitutional law professor at Vermont Law School, echoed that Milne may be running the ads to increase his name recognition. But he said Milne -- who has advertised his business for years in print, on radio and television -- is still engaging in ""protected commercial speech that is not connected to his campaign."" ""So to say that Scott can't advertise the business that carries his name because he happens to be running for lieutenant governor, at least from a constitutional perspective, sounds dubious,"" Carter said. The ads never mention Milne’s campaign, he noted.  ""It's virtually impossible, at least under their interpretation it would seem, for him to be able to advertise his business while also running for lieutenant governor,"" he added. ""So I think on the surface that's how it strikes me, as probably not with a lot of merit."" Milne declined an interview request. In an email he said: ""Our ads are perfectly appropriate and will continue running their planned schedules."" Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a campaign finance watchdog group, said questions about whether candidates seeking office can appear in ads for their businesses frequently come up at the federal level.  Fischer said these cases rarely present a ""super clear line"" between an advertisement ""that does not constitute a federal electioneering in communication and an ad that could be construed as promoting the person's candidacy."" He said Milne’s ad occupied this ""gray area.""  Fischer said Milne opened the door to questions being raised by mentioning a ""pressing public, or political issue,"" referring to the Covid-19 pandemic.  ""The connection between the content of the ad to sort of pressing political issues, and the naming of the candidate himself could be factors that would be considered,"" Fischer said.  DISCLOSURE: Milne Travel is an underwriter with VTDigger.  The Vermont Democratic Party said ""Advertisements for Mr. Milne’s travel company allow Milne to illegally use corporate funds.""  While Milne’s ads may have the effect of boosting his name recognition, there is no support for the VDP’s claim that the ads are illegal. Democrats could and do argue that Milne is ""skirting"" the law by appearing in his company’s advertisements while he is seeking public office.
 
But legal experts say that unless the advertisements refer to Milne’s candidacy, they would not violate Vermont campaign finance laws. We rate the VDP’s statement false.

Stoney makes U-turn on national search for new Richmond police chief
","On June 16, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney forced city Police Chief William Smith to resign and pledged a national search for a replacement who could improve community relations and ""reimagine"" the way police work. Ten days later, Stoney announced he hired Gerald Smith - the deputy police chief in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, N.C. - to head Richmond’s force. The fast turnaround has led some activists to accuse Stoney of breaking his pledge to conduct a thorough search for a chief while, at the same time, seeking community advice on how to reshape the police department. ""Hearing that Mayor Levar Stoney is not fulfilling his promise or commitment to involve the public and the advocates that have been doing this work is not surprising to any of us,"" Chelsea Higgs Wise, a longtime activist with Richmond for All, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in a June 28 article.  ""It just shows that his choices are not one that are keeping the public in mind."" We took a look on the Flip-O-Meter whether Stoney changed his position on conducting a national search. The ousting The controversy arose from the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, underneath the knee of a Minneapolis policeman. Protests spread across the nation and began in Richmond four days later, leading to vandalism, some looting, and clashes between the demonstrators and the city’s police. A key moment came on June 1 when police sprayed tear gas into a peaceful group of protestors gathered at the statue of Robert E. Lee on Monument Ave. Stoney repeatedly apologized to an estimated 1,000 demonstrators who voiced outrage outside City Hall the next day. He promised to involve citizens in reforming the department.  On June 16, Stoney announced he had requested and received the resignation of Chief William Smith. The mayor promised a painstaking search for a new chief who would bring change to the department and improved community relations.  ""There is no timeline,"" Stoney said. ""We will do a national search, eventually. Right now, we have to do a number of things on our plate, right? A lot of police departments across the country have a lot on their plate and what we want to do is a national search."" More immediately, Stoney said he’d be setting up a citizens’ review board to give the community a voice in changing police policies - including use of force and dealing with people experiencing mental health crises.  Blackwell In the meantime, Stoney named police Maj. William ""Jody"" Blackwell as interim chief, creating a new controversy. Blackwell fatally shot a man, Jeramy O. Gilliam, while on duty in 2002. Although a grand jury cleared Blackwell of wrongdoing, many residents,  protestors and Gilliam’s family were critical of his promotion to interim chief. Stoney said he was aware of the shooting when he appointed Blackwell. The hiring Ten days later, Stoney announced he hired a new chief. ""I talked to a number of candidates. Chief Gerald Smith was on the top,"" he said at a June 26 news conference. ""I think he’s the sort of leadership we need at this time.""  Reporters asked Stoney how the quick hiring squared with his pledge to have the community involved in reshaping the police department.  ""I’m still the mayor of the great City of Richmond and plan on being mayor of the great City of Richmond for the next five years - four years - and I will say that we all recognize what we need right now,"" he replied.  Stoney said the next day that he worked constantly on finding a new chief since the firing of the old one and the hiring of the new one, and he ""solicited the advice and the recommendations of policing leaders across the country."" There’s no doubt, however, that Stoney changed his national search plans.  On June 28, the city ran an ad in the Times-Dispatch saying it was beginning a national search for a police chief that day, which was two days after Smith had been hired. The ad said the city would begin reviewing applications on July 26.  The job posting also debuted on the city government’s employment site on June 28 - again, two days after it had been filled. It finally should be noted that while there is criticism of the process through which the new chief was hired, we have not heard complaints aimed at Gerald Smith or his qualifications for the job. He started in Richmond on July 1.  Also, we tried to reach Jim Nolan, Stoney's director of communications, for this story. He did not reply.  Our ruling Stoney promised a deliberate, national search for a new police chief, then filled the job in 10 days - two days before the first advertisements appeared.

Did Donald Trump lose a trade war he started, as Joe Biden says?
","Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, minced no words in attacking President Donald Trump’s trade policies in a recent ad. The June 24 ad focuses on China and features multiple images of Chinese President Xi Jinping. (The ad was produced by the Democratic National Committee with Biden’s approval, and is targeted at Pennsylvania voters.) Here’s the key narration: ""Trump said he’d get tough on China. He didn’t get tough — he got played. Trump lost a trade war that he started. Farmers bankrupted. Steel workers betrayed. And manufacturing, in a recession. Donald Trump lost."" We checked with trade policy specialists, both those who are supportive of free trade and those who are more skeptical, and we found a general agreement that Biden’s point was reasonable, though it may be too soon to declare an irreversible loss for Trump.  Because the ad focuses on China, we will limit our discussion here to Trump’s policies on trade with China, as opposed to other countries. (The Trump campaign and the White House did not respond to inquiries for this article.) Generally speaking, a trade war is ""a confrontation between two or more countries that involves one country initiating an increase in its tariff rate against another country, usually over that country’s alleged wrongdoing,"" said Kent Jones, a professor of economics at Babson College. ""This sort of provocation typically leads to the other country retaliating with tariffs of its own. The warfare often continues with escalating tariffs on both sides."" There’s a good argument that Trump started a trade war, experts say.  ""It can fairly be said that Trump started the trade war with China by ignoring World Trade Association rules regarding disputes among members, which require both parties to submit to a review of the alleged wrongdoing by a WTO panel of legal experts before taking any unilateral action of their own,"" Jones said.  The U.S. has complained for years about Chinese trade practices. For instance, ""the U.S. has complained over several presidential administrations about Chinese infringement of intellectual property rights,"" said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist. However, even if China’s action’s were provocative, experts agree that Trump pushed the existing trade tensions between the two countries to the point of a trade war. For the United States, the typical mechanism is to invoke Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which is used to punish trading partners deemed by the U.S. to be violating trade agreements or restricting U.S. commerce.  The Trump administration has invoked Section 301 tariff increases of 25% on several occasions starting in 2018. Collectively, the first four tranches of tariff increases were valued at $550 billion. ""Theoretically, if the country initiating the higher tariffs can get the other country to submit to its demands, change its behavior, or conclude a formal agreement to terms of capitulation, then one could say that a country has ‘won’ the trade war,"" Jones said. But trade wars are difficult to win, experts agree. Typically, ""the only issue is who will lose the most,"" said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution. It’s fair to say that China has not simply capitulated: It responded tit-for-tat to the U.S. tariff increases, including shifting its purchases of agricultural products to other countries. It’s possible to look at a few metrics to determine which side is winning this particular trade war. None of them look especially promising for the president. One is the balance of trade in goods between China and the United States. Initially, the trade deficit got worse under Trump but has improved modestly in the past year. (The impact of the coronavirus will make it hard to gauge improvements going forward.) Still, the balance of trade remains solidly in China’s favor.   Other metrics involve the U.S. manufacturing sector. In seeking to take on China, Trump had pledged to reverse the sector’s decline. Here’s a look at gross manufacturing output by quarter. Output grew during the first half of Trump’s tenure but declined slightly during the second half.   Manufacturing employment showed a similar pattern under Trump, a rise followed by stagnation.   In all, the trade balance and the health of the manufacturing sector may have improved marginally. If that was the end of the story, Trump might be able to argue that he’s made progress, even if it’s short of Chinese capitulation.  But there are other significant downsides to Trump’s trade policy, experts say. Most notably, the U.S. agriculture sector has been hit by retaliatory actions by China.  The U.S. Agriculture Department projected in February 2020 that agricultural exports to China would reach $14 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That would be an increase of $4 billion over the prior year, but well short of the $40 billion Trump had pledged a month earlier. Trump administration efforts to boost agricultural purchases were meant to reverse declines provoked by the U.S. tariffs in the first place. ""Did Trump gain leverage to secure a ‘deal’ with China? Yes, he did. Is that deal any good? It’s doubtful,"" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. The Trump administration has also paid compensation to farmers hurt by China’s policies worth at least $28 billion over two years. Despite this compensation, farm bankruptcies hit an eight-year high in 2019. And experts say that once the markets are lost, they may be gone for good. The harm was also spread more widely than just the farm sector.  For starters, the money to compensate farmers comes from American taxpayers. Beyond that, the United States typically gets stuck with paying the tariffs it imposes, rather than China. Indeed, the impacts of the trade war filter throughout the economy.  ""U.S. tariffs against Chinese manufactured imports disrupted U.S. supply chains, raising input costs to many U.S. firms that used these products,"" Jones said.  RELATED: Who pays for US tariffs on Chinese goods? You do Independent observers have projected a net economic hit to the United States from the trade friction with China. A 2019 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that the tariff hikes could cut U.S. and Chinese GDP by 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively, by 2021-22. In a December 2019 study, Federal Reserve researchers concluded that Trump's tariffs ""have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices."" And the economic analysis firm Moody's concluded in September 2019 estimated that the trade conflict with China has reduced U.S. employment by 300,000 jobs. A different Federal Reserve study from October 2019 found that tariffs on Chinese imports added about $800 annually per household, wiping out gains for the typical household under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trade specialists told PolitiFact that it may be too soon to say that Trump has ""lost"" the trade war, as the pro-Biden ad said.  ""It’s too early to say he ‘lost,’ but he obviously hasn't ‘won’ in the sense of getting meaningful, durable, market concessions greater than what he has given in return,"" said I.M. (Mac) Destler, an emeritus professor at the University of Maryland's Center for International Security Studies. ""It isn't over yet, but he seems on track to lose."" Experts added that Trump’s approach has worsened the odds of success by not going through the World Trade Organization. ""The U.S. has lost its reputation as a reliable participant in the international economic order,"" Bosworth said.  The ad approved by Biden said, ""Trump lost a trade war that he started."" Longstanding Chinese trade policies may have provoked Trump into acting, but by moving first to impose tariffs, Trump at the very least escalated existing trade tensions into a trade war. And while it may be premature to say that Trump has ""lost"" the conflict, we found wide agreement among trade experts that he is losing. He has not succeeded in getting China to capitulate to structural demands. He’s made marginal gains in the U.S.-China trade balance and in U.S. manufacturing output. But those have been undercut by significant retaliatory tariffs for the agriculture sector and wider harm to the economy from higher prices, supply chain disruptions, and slower economic growth.

No sign Nancy Pelosi made millions trading on insider coronavirus information
","Did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi get rich off the coronavirus pandemic through insider trading? That is, did the California Democrat improperly use confidential information, gained by virtue of being the government’s third-highest elected official, to make a killing in the stock market? That’s the claim of an article widely shared on Facebook. ""Pelosi made millions in coronavirus insider trading,"" the headline reads.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim we’re checking here misstates the timeline for the stock trades in question and overstates the investment gains. While Pelosi’s husband bought stock that later increased in value, it was nearly two weeks before House members were briefed about the COVID-19 outbreak. Insider trading is when someone uses non-public information to profit from the sale or purchase of a stock. Depending on the circumstances, it can be legal or illegal. Insider trading by members of Congress is a special concern for regulators because lawmakers often have privileged access to nonpublic briefings and investigative information that could affect individual companies or industries.  In 2011, ""60 Minutes"" reported on a transaction by Pelosi’s husband, Paul, involving 5,000 shares of Visa that he bought in the credit card company’s 2008 initial public offering. Within two days of the IPO, as Congress was considering new credit card regulations, Visa’s stock price rose by $20, or about 45%. Five months later, Congress passed the bipartisan Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which prohibits lawmakers from using their insider knowledge to trade stocks. Republicans added the so-called Pelosi provision to prevent government officials from gaining special access to IPOs.   This year, news reports revealed that two GOP senators, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, dumped between hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars worth of stock after being privately briefed by health officials early in the coronavirus outbreak, prompting a federal investigation and a call for more reforms. News reports on May 26 said the Justice Department notified Loeffler, as well as Sens. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., it would not file insider trading charges against them. But the investigation against Burr appeared to be proceeding. The article we’re checking is from IndependentCitizen.com, which describes itself as ""a daily journal of news and opinion for free citizens wishing to defend their liberty"" based in Liberty, Va. Information about the domain’s owner is not disclosed on public databases, but it at one point featured a podcast by longtime Libertarian Austin Petersen, who ran for president in 2016. The article alleges that ""recent reports show that on Jan. 17, Pelosi and her husband bought millions of dollars in Amazon stocks, soon after she began receiving briefings about the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the United States.""  The article, published April 2, notes that Amazon’s business increased as many Americans opted to shop online  — and claims without evidence that the Pelosis earned nearly $2 million in 10 weeks. An article published April 1 by True Pundit, a conservative website, claimed that because Amazon’s stock price reached close to $2,000 on March 31, the Paul Pelosi stock purchase had earned the Pelosis $1.1 million in 10 weeks. Paul Pelosi has been a prominent businessman in real estate and venture capital for decades. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told PolitiFact that Pelosi did not receive a briefing on the coronavirus until one was given to House members on Jan. 29.  That roughly corresponds with a report from Politico that says lawmakers in the House and Senate were briefed via both classified and non-classified meetings about the coronavirus in late January and February. But Paul Pelosi made his stock purchase a couple of weeks earlier — on Jan. 16. Hammill said that Nancy Pelosi herself owns no stock. Still, she is required to disclose her husband’s transactions. Nancy Pelosi disclosed in a report that on Jan. 16, Paul Pelosi bought 3,000 shares of Amazon stock, as well as 5,000 shares of Facebook stock.  Amazon shares traded as low as $1,866.02 a share on that day. Paul Pelosi bought his shares for $1,600 apiece by exercising  call options that he already held. Call options are contracts that allow an investor to buy a specific stock at a certain price up to a certain date. The options would have expired the next day, according to Pelosi’s disclosure form. Over the next few months, Amazon shares moved up and down roughly in tandem with the overall stock market, falling as low as $1,626.03 on March 16, as news of the pandemic-related shutdowns battered stocks. By late June, they were trading at nearly $2,800 a share, with gains far outpacing the broader market.  Pelosi’s disclosure says her husband exercised options to buy 3,000 shares at $1,600 — a $4.8 million investment. Ten weeks later, on March 26, Amazon’s closing price was $1,955. Pelosi’s shares would have been worth $5.9 million. That’s a paper profit of $1.1 million. Actual profit, minus the cost of the call options and other expenses, would not be realized until a stock is sold. Pelosi’s Facebook investment, for which he paid $720,000, was worth about $100,000 more on March 26. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed Nancy Pelosi ""made millions in coronavirus insider trading"" over the course of 10 weeks. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, used call options to purchase Amazon stock, and investment that gained about $1.1 million in 10 weeks. The gain on his Facebook investment was about $100,000. But those are paper gains, not actual earnings. Moreover, Paul Pelosi made his purchase roughly two weeks before House members were briefed about the coronavirus outbreak.

Vos mostly right with claim that Wisconsin was last state to pay out federal unemployment benefits
","Unemployment payments have been a big point of concern in Wisconsin since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.  Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites were laid off or furloughed due to the health crisis, putting intense pressure on the state’s unemployment insurance system. And since March 2020, a backlog of unpaid unemployment claims has led to Wisconsinites facing difficult choices when it comes to paying rent, car payments and other bills.  As people wait -- some for more than three months -- Republican lawmakers and others have criticized the state Department of Workforce Development, the agency responsible for paying unemployment benefits.  Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, is one of them.  In a June 9, 2020 Facebook post, Vos included an image that listed all 50 states with Wisconsin as the last one to start paying out federal unemployment compensation benefits under the CARES Act, which was signed by President Donald Trump at the end of March.  In the image, Wisconsin is listed as starting to make federal PUC payments on April 29, 2020, just behind Connecticut, which is listed as starting its payments three days earlier.  At the top: Illinois, listed as starting April 6, 2020 -- more than three weeks before Wisconsin. PUC stands for Pandemic Unemployment Compensation, though most may know this as the extra payments -- generally $600 -- offered by the federal government.  Is Vos right, that Wisconsin residents were the last to get those payments? When asked for backup, Vos’ office provided a link to a study by the Hamilton Project, part of the Brookings Institute, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit research group . That study is the genesis of the list Vos shared, and reflects the same results. The study -- and Vos’ list -- specifically focuses on the PUC payments, but there is another program to add to our alphabet soup: The PUA, or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. Those payments are available to people who wouldn’t normally qualify for unemployment.  While Wisconsin was the final state to start making the PUC payments, the same study showed the state fared better on the PUA ones. The state began processing those applications April 21, 2020, with payments starting a week later -- much earlier than some states. On those payments, Nevada came in last, not processing applications until mid-May, according to the study. Wisconsin ranked nearer to the top of that list, with the earliest processing dates starting on April 13 in Alabama and Texas.  Ben Jedd, communications director for the state Department of Workforce Development, acknowledged the state was last to make the enhanced unemployment payments.  He blamed the state’s old computer system, as has Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Jedd also said the delay was caused, in part, by the timing of action by Vos and other Republican Legislative leaders in scheduling a vote to suspend a one-week waiting period typically required for newly unemployed Wisconsinites.  In late May, Republican leaders in the Senate and Assembly didn’t immediately schedule a floor session to take up a package backed by Evers, which included waiving the waiting period. Instead, Republicans waited three weeks for the session, causing the state to miss out on $25 million from the CARES Act to help pay for unemployment benefits.  ""The reason DWD was the last to pay FPUC is the length of time it took to program our COBOL software and the fact that we had to wait for the legislation repealing the waiting week to be passed to complete programming for that change before we could begin,"" Jedd said. He also noted Wisconsin fared better on the PUA program. But that program applies to far fewer people, and the image shared by Vos makes clear that the last-in-the-nation ranking applies to the PUC payments.  Vos claimed Wisconsin was the last state to pay out COVID-related federal unemployment money.  He is on target about that, but the claim fails to note two important factors: Delays by Republicans played a role in the poor showing by Wisconsin, and the state fared better when it came to payments from a related federal program.

Joe Biden’s dubious claim about Revolutionary War cannon ownership
","Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, recently sat for a video with Wired, part of the magazine’s series of interviews in which celebrities answer the most searched-for questions about themselves on the internet. One of the questions Biden addressed was, ""What is Joe Biden’s stance on gun control?"" He proceeded to answer that he favors outlawing assault weapons. ""They have no rationale for being owned by individuals on the street,"" Biden said. ""They should be outlawed. … From the very beginning you weren't allowed to have certain weapons. You weren't allowed to own a cannon during the Revolutionary War as an individual."" Screenshot from Biden's video A reader suggested we look at Biden’s assertion on Revolutionary War cannons. The historians we reached out to were dubious. To confirm Biden’s point, ""you would need to point to something — a law, or a tradition, or a case where someone was not allowed to possess a cannon,"" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. But the Biden campaign was unable to point to a specific law. ""The vice president's point is that to help end the tragic epidemic of mass shootings that is taking so many American lives, we need to ban weapons of war from our streets,"" the campaign told PolitiFact. Historians say they are doubtful that there were laws to bar individual ownership of cannons during the Revolutionary War period. ""It seems highly unlikely that there were restrictions on the private ownership"" of cannons, said Julie Anne Sweet, a historian and director of military studies at Baylor University. David Kopel, the research director and Second Amendment project director at the free-market Independence Institute, agreed. ""I am not aware of a ban on any arm in colonial America,"" he said. ""There were controls on people or locations, but not bans on types of arms."" The legal framework in the colonies was haphazard during the Revolutionary War period. ""At that time, there was no United States, just a bunch of very confused former colonies trying to cooperate, and often failing, to defeat the British military,"" Sweet said. ""Any sort of gun regulations would have been at the local level, and therefore incredibly difficult and tedious to chase down. The new states were still writing new constitutions and probably did not take this matter into consideration."" There is at least one group of private citizens that owned cannons during the period: privateers. Privateers were privately owned and operated ships that in wartime captured enemy ships for profit. While privateers received a license from the government that allowed them to avoid being prosecuted for piracy, they were not a part of the official navy. So any cannons they set sail with (or that they seized from the enemy) would be private property, not the property of the government or the regular military. The 1899 book ""A History of American Privateers"" by Edgar Stanton Maclay notes several cases in which privateers during the Revolutionary War set sail using cannons. Biden said, ""You weren't allowed to own a cannon during the Revolutionary War as an individual."" The campaign was unable to come up with an example of a law banning private ownership of cannons, and historians of the period doubt that any existed. To the contrary, there are documented instances of privateers, or privately owned vessels, setting sail with cannons during the period.

Claim that Tony Evers ordered U.S. flag removed is ridiculous
","When protesters gathered at the state Capitol in April to call for Gov. Tony Evers to reopen the state, the lack of an American flag at their chosen location became a point of contention. The Associated Press reported chants of ""Where’s our flag?"" and protesters calling it a ""disgrace."" A similar claim surfaced in a viral Facebook post on June 12, 2020. ""Wisconsin Democrat Governor Evers removed the American flag from the Capitol building by ordering it to be taken down! This is beyond disgraceful!"" the post said. The text accompanied an undated photo showing protesters outside the Capitol building, with an empty flagpole circled in red. This question is particularly notable since in the intervening time, Evers has ordered the Capitol fly the rainbow pride flag for Pride Month (as he did in 2019) and the Juneteenth flag to commemorate the end of slavery. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). So did Evers really order the American flag removed at some point? Answering that means figuring out where and when this picture was taken. Let’s get to sleuthing. The Wisconsin Capitol building in Madison — completed in 1917 — is a symmetrical structure with a similar façade of pillars and windows facing north, south, east and west. The peak of each entry has a flagpole. So the first question is which flagpole we’re talking about. A review of photos from Google Maps shows the picture in question was taken at the West (State Street) entrance. That entrance has two rows of windows, with arched windows at the top. The other three entrances each have three rows, with a smaller row atop the arched windows. The west wing of the Capitol houses the state Assembly, so that body is in charge of which flag flies when. The Assembly policy — like the state Senate — is to fly the American flag, but only when the body is in session. The other element is when this photo was taken, since it’s undated in the Facebook post. The most notable recent rally there occurred April 24, 2020, when protesters gathered to pressure Evers into reopening the state amid the coronavirus pandemic. The lone readable sign in the image — SCIENCE says ""OPEN WISCONSIN!"" — gives us the key clue here. That’s certainly consistent with a reopen rally. But more importantly, that same sign can be seen in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel photo of the event. So we have a picture from April 24 on the west wing of the Capitol. That’s the Assembly flagpole, and since the Assembly wasn’t in session that day (having adjourned the day before), not flying the American flag was standard operating procedure. The protesters could have seen the American flag in its usual spot alongside the Wisconsin flag if they had walked around to the east side of the Capitol. The governor has authority over that flagpole and the north wing pole that flies the POW-MIA flag. The state Senate controls the remaining south wing flagpole. So the Facebook post in question is not only wrong that Evers had authority over the flagpole in question, it goes a step further by claiming the U.S. flag was absent because of a specific order from the governor. Britt Cudabeck, a spokeswoman for Evers, confirmed the governor did not order any U.S. flag taken down. The U.S. and Wisconsin flags have flown daily on the east pole as usual. A Facebook post claims Evers ordered the U.S. flag removed from the state Capitol, posting as support a picture of an empty flagpole. Our research shows that photo was taken seven weeks before the Facebook post in front of the west  wing of the Capitol, which is controlled by the state Assembly. The flag only flies when the Assembly is in session, and it wasn’t that day. So the post is not only wrong, it moves into the realm of the ridiculous by manufacturing the assertion that Evers had specifically ordered the flag removed.

Maine’s plan to help welfare recipients commute to work, fact-checked
","A widespread Facebook post blasts the Democratic governor of Maine for moving ahead with a program to help certain welfare recipients secure reliable transportation to and from work. The June 17 post says Gov. Janet Mills is putting tax dollars toward ""getting into the car sales business."" It comes from Maine People Before Politics, a nonprofit research organization that lists former Gov. Paul LePage, Mills’ Republican predecessor, as its honorary chairperson. The Mills administration is ""using taxpayer money to buy cars for those on welfare, without a public hearing on the rules,"" the post says in all caps. ""If someone on welfare sells the car for cash without the state’s approval, the rules don’t allow the state to prosecute them for car theft."" The post is not fully accurate. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The pilot program, Working Cars for Working Families, was authorized as part of a budget passed by the state Legislature and signed by LePage in 2017. LePage never moved forward with it, despite the budget’s specification that rules be adopted in the 2017-18 state fiscal year. The program is meant to provide affordable transportation to people who receive benefits from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program or certain other programs. The goal is to help them travel to and from work so that they can hold onto a stable job. Maine People Before Politics gets many details about the program right in its Facebook post, which is several paragraphs long. But its all-caps, top-line description gives the impression that the Mills administration is ramming through rules for a new initiative, and that the initiative will give welfare recipients free cars they can easily sell for a quick buck. That’s misleading. According to the proposed rules for the program, the state Department of Health and Human Services will work to connect eligible, low-income Mainers with transportation to and from work.  The rules were posted June 3, and the department is accepting public comments through July 5. Department spokesperson Jackie Farwell said the program will likely kick in by the fall. The rules say that under the program, the department can furnish ""purchased or donated vehicles to participants"" or connect them to public transportation, private transportation, car shares, ride services, shuttle services or driving instruction and education. Funding for the program is capped at $6 million and comes from a federal TANF block grant, so federal tax money is involved. There are several rules that determine eligibility and how the program will operate if a person qualifies for a car.  In addition to meeting financial eligibility requirements, for example, applicants must prove they have ""a reasonable likelihood of obtaining or retaining sustainable employment by participating,"" meaning they have a job, have one lined up or are likely to get one soon. Applicants must also show that they lack the transportation that they need to hold the job. They can’t qualify if they own a functioning vehicle, live with an adult who owns one or have access to public transportation. People who get a car through the program must commit to using it primarily to commute to work and agree that they won’t sell or trade it, allow other household members to drive it or break any laws while using it. They must keep it in good condition and conduct routine maintenance. The Maine People Before Politics post’s claim that Mills is ""using taxpayer money to buy cars for those on welfare"" could be misleading, said Chris Hastedt, a senior policy adviser at the nonprofit Maine Equal Justice, a legal aid and economic justice organization. ""These cars are not ‘free,’ despite the implication,"" Hastedt said. ""In fact, it is the participants themselves that are buying the cars."" The program as proposed requires people receiving cars to make a $300 down payment and pay the Department of Health and Human Services a $100 monthly installment for two years. The Maine People Before Politics post notes this in a later paragraph. Participants must also be able to ""pay all expenses associated with owning the vehicle,"" including insurance, taxes and costs needed to ensure the car passes inspection. After 24 months of payments, those who have satisfied all requirements can graduate from the program and keep the cars. Julie Rabinowitz, director of policy and communication at Maine People Before Politics, said the state could wind up eating costs, because the rules don’t put a price cap on the cars provided.  ""Under these rules, a person could end up owning a $10,000 — or even $30,000-plus — car for a total of $2,700 in two years if they are working,"" Rabinowitz said. The Facebook post also suggests that the program is being introduced suddenly and with no accountability in the form of a public hearing. In reality, the program was passed in the 2017 biennial budget after having first been introduced as part of a broad bill that was aimed at reducing child poverty in Maine but never passed.  The original text of the failed bill noted that the period between 2017 and 2022 was meant to be a ""pilot period,"" Hastedt said. The version passed in the budget said it would end in July 2022. ""It’s a pilot program,"" Farwell said, adding that a report would be made to the Legislature in 2022.  There is currently no public hearing scheduled, according to a notice from the Department of Health and Human Services. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be one, Farwell said. ""A public hearing on the proposed rules would be held if requested by five interested persons,"" she said. There was a public hearing in 2017 for the broader, never-passed legislation related to child poverty, she said, and more than 50 people testified as part of that hearing. One person testified about a similar program after which Maine’s was modeled, Hastedt said. The Facebook post also claims that participants who sell their cars without authorization will not be charged with theft.  The rules say selling a state-furnished car will be punished as an ""intentional program violation,"" and that the seller must pay back a cost equal to the car’s value at the time it was provided. Rabinowitz said such a sale would amount to ""stealing the full value of the car from the state,"" and trying to recover that value through the welfare system’s rules would not be as effective as allowing for prosecution. But Hastedt told us intentional program violations actually ""can involve criminal prosecution for fraud, depending on the facts of the case.""  The state Department of Health and Human Services ""intends to make referrals to law enforcement when appropriate,"" Farwell added. A Facebook post said the Mills administration is ""using taxpayer money to buy cars for those on welfare, without a public hearing on the rules. If someone on welfare sells the car for cash without the state’s approval, the rules don’t allow the state to prosecute them for car theft."" The pilot program is rooted in a budget passed years ago and will be financed using a federal TANF block grant, meaning tax dollars are at play. Other details in the post’s paragraphs-long description of the program are mostly accurate, as well. The program allows the state to furnish cars as one of the transportation aid options. But the cars are not totally free to those who get them, and participants who violate the terms of the program by selling their cars could still be referred to law enforcement. Plus, while there’s no public hearing currently on the books for the state’s proposed rules, public comment is being accepted through July 5, and a hearing could still take place if enough people request it. There was also a public hearing in 2017, when the program was first introduced as part of a separate legislative package that didn’t pass.  We rate this post Half True.",/factchecks/2020/jun/29/facebook-posts/maines-plan-help-welfare-recipients-commute-work-f/

Biden said that without ‘orderly integration’ his children would grow up in a ‘racial jungle’
","Comments Joe Biden made about busing students to integrate schools that first surfaced in 2019 are again being shared on Facebook, this time in an image of a post from a website supportive of President Donald Trump. The headline says: ""1977: Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into ‘a jungle… a racial jungle.’"" There’s a photo of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and this quote attributed to him: ""I don’t want my children to grow up in a jungle, a racial jungle."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The quote is close to something Biden said, but the Facebook post is missing context..   First, he wasn’t speaking broadly about integrating Black and white Americans. He was talking about busing to integrate public schools. The post on the pro-Trump site cites a July 2019 tweet from New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg, who said that a University of Southern California law professor had spotted this quote from Biden:  ""Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this."" Stolberg put that comment in context, tweeting that Biden ""warns that unless there is ‘orderly integration’ (he favored housing, not busing), ‘My children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle.’"" She linked to a story she wrote with her colleague Astead Herndon titled: ""How Joe Biden became the Democrats’ anti-busing crusader. Then-Sen. Biden was speaking in a 1977 congressional hearing on busing schoolchildren and opposed federally mandated busing. (His ""racial jungle"" comment is on page 251 of the hearing transcript.) Addressing Jack Greenberg, director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Biden said: ""We have a fundamental disagreement, you and I, I suspect, as to what is needed to insure that we do have orderly integration of society. I am not just talking about education but all of society.""  Biden went on to reference a ""racial jungle"" and then said that ""pushing busing in a way in which it goes beyond the constitutional mandates is like throwing a rock through the civil rights window. I think it has repercussions that are extensive in terms of the ultimate objective of seeing that we get integrated neighborhoods, of seeing that we eventually eliminate job discrimination, of seeing that we change housing patterns, of seeing alteration of tax structure."" A year earlier, in 1976, Biden introduced legislation to prevent the Justice Department from pursuing desegregation cases that could result in court-ordered busing, the New York Times reported.  ""I oppose busing, to the chagrin of some of my liberal colleagues,"" he said at the time. He also supported several bills that year designed to stop federal judges from issuing busing orders, according to the Times.  Biden never opposed voluntary busing, according to the Times. But in their investigation into Biden’s history with busing, Herndon and Stolberg describe how the former vice president’s opposition to court-ordered busing ""was far more sweeping than he has led voters to believe."" As a young senator, Biden emerged as the Democratic Party’s ""leading anti-busing crusader,"" the story says, ""a position that put him in league with Southern segregationists, at odds with liberal Republicans and helped change the dynamic of the Senate, turning even some leaders in his own party against busing as a desegregation tool."" Biden argued that housing integration was a better way to desegregate public schools though it would take much longer to implement than a busing plan, the story says. In 1974, as ""anti-busing fervor"" led to crowds throwing bricks and rocks at buses with Black children, the story says, Biden said he had become ""more and more disenchanted with busing as a remedy."" In 1975, he objected to the federal government requiring desegregation without a court order, saying that it would lead to white flight and racial unrest, the story says.  In 1976, the Times reported, Biden introduced legislation to prevent the Justice Department from pursuing desegregation cases that could result in court-ordered busing, ""alarming lawyers in its Civil Rights Division."" During a Democratic presidential debate last year, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., challenged Biden on his busing position. Biden has since said that he has always favored ""using federal authority to overcome state-initiated segregation"" and ""never, never, never ever opposed voluntary busing."" But in fact, few districts were voluntarily desegregating schools through busing, which is why courts stepped in.  Biden’s current positions include plans to close racial wealth and income gaps, reduce racial disparities in health and education, and enact reforms to the criminal justice system.   RELATED: The Democratic debate resurrected controversy over busing. But is it an issue today? Our ruling The Facebook post says that in 1977, Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into ‘a jungle… a racial jungle.’"" That’s not quite right.

Wisconsin GOP lawmaker Quinn only partially right in claim about Evers recording
","Gov. Tony Evers came under fire after it was revealed a staff member in his office secretly recorded a May 14, 2020 phone meeting between the governor and Republican legislative leaders. The move incensed Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who immediately called for the staffer’s firing. Other lawmakers, including Republicans and at least one Democrat, echoed that demand. State Rep. Romaine Quinn, R-Barron, waded into the debate during the GOP’s June 18, 2020 weekly radio address, accusing Evers of ""a complete disregard for civility, cooperation and a lack of leadership."" Quinn went on to say: ""The governor has refused to identify or discipline the staff member who secretly taped the conversation.""  Is that accurate? Partially. Let’s take a look. The call in question came one day after the state Supreme Court threw out Evers’ safer-at-home order, forcing officials to regroup and discuss a new response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Evers, Vos and Fitzgerald talked respectfully to one another, but disagreed on next steps and what was happening in the state, based on a tape of the call released to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel under an open records request. When asked for evidence to back up Quinn’s claim, an aide pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a June, 11 2020 Department of Health Services briefing, at which Evers was asked about the recording incident, and a Wisconsin Radio Network-WSAU article about the briefing headlined, ""Evers won't fire staffer who secretly recorded phone call."" During the briefing, on the state’s response to COVID-19, Evers fielded multiple questions about the controversy and claimed he didn’t know the meeting was being recorded.  The governor’s chief legal counsel, Ryan Nilsestuen, said staff consented to the recording in compliance with the state’s one-party consent rule, but wouldn’t identify who OK’d it. ""A staffer wanted help taking notes, and that’s why that staffer did that,"" Evers said. ""I will not discuss personnel issues in public, but needless to say, the practice has ended with this one time."" So Quinn is right that Evers won’t identify the staff member. But what about the discipline? Wisconsin Radio Network reported in its article that Evers said the staffer ""will not be fired.""  One problem: Evers never said that in the call, according to a review of the call by PolitiFact Wisconsin. He has only continued to reiterate that he won’t talk about disciplinary matters, so it’s unclear how -- or whether -- the staffer has been disciplined. But in a June 23, 2020 DHS briefing, Evers hinted action had been taken, saying:  ""This is obviously a personnel issue, and discipline measures are being handled internally,"" he said. Evers’ office did not respond to questions from PolitiFact Wisconsin. In the weekly GOP radio address, Quinn said Evers ""has refused to identify or discipline the staff member who secretly taped the conversation."" The governor has so far been very clear that he won’t identify the person. But he repeatedly refused to discuss any discipline in public. So, on that point, Quinn mischaracterized what Evers said and what is known about the situation. That leaves us with a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition for Half True.

Facebook post wrong about wearing mask, carrying concealed weapon in North Carolina
","In North Carolina, some residents are speculating about the ripple effects of Gov. Roy Cooper’s mandate that people wear masks in public. One Facebook post, which was viewed hundreds of times, said the mandate will infringe upon North Carolinians’ Second Amendment rights. ""For those of you like myself that has your concealed carry permit and carry, you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying,"" it says, adding: ""Once you have a felony(,) you can no longer carry."" Is that true? No. A spokesman for Cooper, who is a Democrat, a spokesman for the Republican state Senate leader, and the leader of the state’s leading gun rights group all agree: North Carolinians are allowed to wear a mask and carry a concealed weapon. The Facebook post references North Carolina’s General Statute 14-12. That statute, specifically 14-12.7, forbids adults from concealing their identities in public. But it doesn’t mention guns at all. And it passed decades ago to target the Ku Klux Klan, according to WRAL. The mask law was suspended in May when state lawmakers passed their coronavirus relief package.  The law now says ""any person wearing a mask for the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others"" is exempt from state law prohibiting masks in public. It’s set to expire Aug. 1. But even when it does expire, experts told us they don’t believe there will be a conflict between mask laws and concealed carry laws. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact that the anti-mask law applies ""irrespective of whether a person is carrying a weapon or not."" ""No statute exists that treats carrying a concealed weapon while masked differently than any other activity while masked,"" Ryan said. Grass Roots North Carolina, one of the state’s leading advocates for Second Amendment rights, interprets the mask laws the same way. Paul Valone, president of Grass Roots NC, told PolitiFact in a phone interview that he’s aware of the rumors.  He says they’re inaccurate and could potentially discourage someone from carrying their concealed weapon and protecting themselves. Valone posted a letter from the group’s lawyer on its Facebook page. ""At your request, I have investigate(d) the rampant rumors that NC law makes it a felony to carry a firearm while wearing a mask – even if the individual holds a valid Concealed Handgun Permit,"" wrote Ed Green, the group’s Director of Legal Affairs. ""There is no such law."" Green explained the mask and concealed carry laws this way: ""There is no law that makes wearing a mask illegal because one is carrying a firearm, and there is no law that makes carrying a firearm illegal because one is wearing a mask."" Asked if it’s illegal to carry a concealed weapon while wearing a mask, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said: ""Having reviewed the concealed carry statute, our office does not believe this is the case."" A fact check by the Associated Press also found the Facebook post to be False. A viral Facebook post says ""you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying"" in North Carolina. The state’s top Democrat, top Republican and leading gun rights group agree: the claim is inaccurate and unfounded. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jun/26/facebook-posts/facebook-post-wrong-about-wearing-mask-carrying-co/
