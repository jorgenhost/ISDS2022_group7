Coffman falsely says Carroll voted to make it 'easier to sue' doctors, small businesses, nurses
","Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman pulls no punches in an ad accusing his Democratic opponent,  Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her ""shady interests"" as a trial lawyer. ""Meet Morgan Carroll, state senator, who’s also Morgan Carroll, personal injury lawyer,"" the narrator says in the ad that aired Sept. 20. ""Morgan Carroll the lawyer has worked for some of the sleaziest firms in the state. And they love frivolous lawsuits."" The ad shows photos of Carroll on billboards next to slimy-looking lawyers. The narrator says the state senator’s votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."" Coffman’s radio version of the ad goes further, accusing Carroll of ""using her position in the state Senate to line her own pockets"" and speaking about an ""odor of corruption,"" the Denver Post reported. We took a hard look at Coffman’s TV ad claim that Carroll's votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses""to serve her ""shady interests."" Carroll became an attorney in 2000, and spent the first decade of her career working with her mother. Their firm mostly represented clients with disabilities, Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich told PolitiFact. In an ad of her own, Carroll recalls that she was a girl when her dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and she watched him get sicker as medical costs wiped out his retirement savings. ""It's why I've dedicated my career to fighting for people with disabilities, helping people stay in their homes and receive the care they need,"" she says. More recently, Carroll worked for two big personal injury law firms whose TV commercials are well-known to Coloradans. She spent two years at the Sawaya Law Firm, then moved to Bachus & Schanker. The Bachus & Schanker website says, ""Morgan Carroll specializes in representing people in personal injury, Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability and employment law."" Godinich said Carroll primarily was doing legal research at the firm until about four months ago when she took time off to devote herself to the race against Coffman for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, a crescent-ring of Denver suburbs. The Coffman ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. One of them is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman says Carroll opposed to make it ""easier to sue""doctors and nurses. The Republican-sponsored bill granted immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics to help people in need. The Coffman ad is misleading. Carroll, who at the time was a House member, voted against the bill in committee after she and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association raised concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield a medical professional when a patient was harmed by gross negligence. However, Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to grant immunity to medical volunteers from civil liability when an ""act or omission of a volunteer"" resulted in injury, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct and even violent crimes -- acts that would prevent a volunteer from receiving immunity under the federal Volunteer Protection Act.      Ultimately, Carroll supported passage of the law that made it harder -- not easier -- to sue volunteer doctors, nurses and other health-medical professionals -- unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Coffman’s claim that Carroll made it easier to sue small businesses, refers to the ""Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013. ""Carroll was a primary sponsor of the bill. State law already allowed someone who prevailed in a complaint about employment discrimination or unfair employment practices before the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to sue for back pay, future pay, or to be reinstated or hired if they were improperly fired or denied a job. Carroll’s bill allowed victims of employment discrimination who win a lawsuit to also receive compensatory and punitive damages in cases where it was proved an employer engaged in intentional discrimination. In addition, the bill allowed an employee to be awarded attorney’s fees and costs. But if a judge found a lawsuit was frivolous -- or unjustified -- the court could award attorney’s fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages at $10,000 for a business with fewer than five employees, and $25,000 for an employer with five to 14 workers, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council’s fiscal analysis. The bill and the Legislative Council noted that while federal antidiscrimination laws allow compensatory and punitive damages, those laws don’t protect workers who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or if their employer has fewer than 15 employees. Carroll’s state bill allowed people to seek the increased damages when their employer had less than 15 employees or there was discrimination based on sexual orientation. So the legislation, which became law, didn’t make it ""easier to sue"" small businesses -- people could already do that -- but it did allow people the opportunity to win greater financial damages. What about Coffman’s accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer? We checked the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission’s records and found no evidence of an ethics complaint having been made against Carroll.    The Legislature’s ethics rules state that a lawmaker has a personal or financial interest in legislation ""if the passage or failure of such bill, measure, or question will result in the member deriving a direct financial or pecuniary benefit that is greater than any such benefit derived by or shared by other persons in the member's profession, occupation, industry, or region."" But a lawmaker will not be deemed to have a personal or financial interest in a bill that ""affects the entire membership of a class to which the member belongs."" In a part-time ""citizen legislature"" like Colorado’s, this generally allows a doctor/lawmaker to vote on a health care bill, a teacher to vote on an educational bill, and a builder to vote on a construction bill.   Our ruling Coffman says Carroll’s votes on state legislation made ""it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."" Carroll voted in committee against a bill to grant immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics. But Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to shield most medical volunteers from lawsuits — except in cases of gross negligence. Carroll did sponsor and vote for an anti-employment discrimination bill that didn’t make it easier to sue small businesses, because existing law already allowed such suits. But her bill did allow for the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees against employers of all sizes, including small businesses. Coffman accuses Carroll, who has worked as a lawyer handling disability, employment, workers’ compensation and personal injury cases, of being sleazy and shady with conflicts of interest. But there's no evidence she violated state ethics laws. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee3b4dca-e5bf-4630-a661-ef96890b8b02",[<zip object at 0x00000280976D9BC0>],/factchecks/2016/oct/05/mike-coffman/coffman-falsely-says-carroll-voted-make-it-easier-/

Attack on Marwig's property taxes misses the mark
","Illinois’ 20th House district is considered one of the most important in-state races to watch come Election Day in the battle for seats between Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner. The district, which includes parts of Chicago’s Northwest side and nearby suburbs,features Republican state Rep. MichaelMcAuliffe defending his seat from first-time candidate Democrat Merry Marwig. McAuliffe’s defense includes a new television ad that calls Marwig corrupt and ties her to Madigan because she has successfully appealed her property tax bills. The ad, titled ""Inside Game,"" is a 30-second spot running in the Chicago area and was produced by Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the Illinois House Republican Organization. Here’s the transcript: ""Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions. Forcing you to pay more. It’s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan’s hand-picked candidate. When Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again. Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system."" It got us wondering: Did Marwig get her property taxes lowered? Did Madigan have anything to do with it? Is it corrupt to get your property taxes lowered? We took a look to find out. Madigan’s law firm and tax appeals The opening line of the advertisement says: ""Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions."" Madigan’s personal law firm, Madigan & Getzendanner, has made quite a bit of money from property tax appeals. According to the Chicago Tribune, Madigan & Getzendanner represented 45 of the 150 most valuable Chicago downtown buildings in 2008. The Tribune also found ""Madigan's firm won enough appeals to cut more than $183 million from the taxable value of the top high-rises it represented"" in 2006. A 2013 Chicago Magazine article also backs this claim, citing a Sun-Timesarticle that says over the course of a decade Madigan & Getzendanner made nearly $14 million for suburban Cook County landowners. Madigan and Marwig   Where the ad gets murky is when it starts linking Marwig to Madigan. The advertisement says Madigan ""saved his friends millions, forcing you to pay more."" It also says Marwig is Madigan’s ""hand-picked candidate."" The ad lays out these ideas in an order that implies Madigan’s firm represented Marwig during her property value reassessment. However, Marwig and her husband were not represented by an attorney and filled out the forms themselves. Marwig’s property taxes Next, the ad claims Marwig had her property taxes ""lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again."" Marwig once unsuccessfully appealed to the Cook County Assessor to have her property value lowered in 2015. However, she successfully appealed to the Cook County Board of Review twice. It resulted in getting her property taxes lowered by about $400 in her 2013 appeal and then about $700 in her 2015 appeal. Marwig believes there is a double standard for McAuliffe to criticize her practices. In an emailed statement to Reboot Illinois she said: ""For Mike McAuliffe -- a 20-year politician who has personally benefited from a property tax appeal -- to attack my family for going through the legal process of correcting a government error in an unfair tax bill is another sad example of what’s wrong with the politics and hypocrisy that local residents are so fed up with."" Note: McAuliffe did benefit from getting his property taxes lowered when his condominium association appealed its property value in 2012. However, McAuliffe did not file the claim himself. And when the advertisement says Marwig got her property taxes ""lowered at your expense,"" it’s technically correct. But Chicago-based property appeals lawyer Gary H. Smith believes the ad implies Marwig is stealing, which is not actually the case.   ""It’s got elements of the truth,"" Smith said. ""When someone gets their property assessment lowered, it has to be made up by everyone else."" But is it corrupt? The ad ends by saying, ""Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system."" Not at all, Smith says. Anyone, regardless of whether they are regular citizen or a political candidate, can appeal a property tax bill if they believe it is inaccurate. According to the most recent available data from the Cook County Board of Review website, citizens filed appeals for nearly 403,000 parcels in 2013. The Board of Review approved a reduction for 63 percent of them. Smith said the ad’s message is misleading and paints the practice of property value reassessment as ugly. ""It’s horrible we live in a society that a system that’s meant to improve our lives might be perceived as a detriment based on a person’s political status,"" Smith said. Our ruling In their advertisement, Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the House Republican Organization say, ""Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected.… When (Merry) Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense... Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system."" Merry Marwig did, in fact, get her property taxes lowered twice and it did raise other people’s taxes. But the ad’s tone and inferences are misleading to viewers. It makes it seem like Madigan’s firm was connected to Marwig’s property value reassessment. Madigan’s firm never represented Marwig. In fact, Marwig never used an attorney during her property tax appeals. The ad also calls the practice of appealing one’s property taxes corrupt. While there is evidence Madigan has been a highly successful property tax appeal lawyer whose clients win breaks more than many others, any citizen within the geographic boundary can file an appeal to the Cook County Assessor's Office or Cook County Board of Review. The process becomes public record. While some people may think Madigan succeeds more than average citizens, there’s no evidence the system as a whole is corrupt. We rate this claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa7dab3e-6788-47a1-a2d6-b1a64c11ecc8",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C491C0>],/factchecks/2016/oct/05/citizens-michael-mcauliffe-and-house-republican-or/attack-marwigs-property-taxes-misses-mark/

Does Calif. Republican Scott Jones ‘want to build a wall’ and ‘deport folks’ ?
","Democratic Congressman Ami Bera has repeatedly described his Republican challenger’s immigration stance as ""extreme,"" saying it compares with Donald Trump’s. Bera tried to draw that connection again during a recent interview with Capital Public Radio, in which he said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones ""wants to build a wall"" and ""wants to round people up and deport folks."" Bera and Jones are in a tight race for suburban Sacramento County’s 7th Congressional District. Here’s Bera’s recent statement in context: ""I mean this is a guy Scott Jones who’s extreme, extreme on immigration. You know he wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks and yeah I’m worried that Scott Jones and Donald Trump are right there in tandem on immigration and I disagree with that approach."" In May, Jones said he planned to vote for Trump for president. Three months later, he said he did not know who he would vote for. Bera is backing Hillary Clinton. We decided to fact check whether Jones ""wants to build a wall,"" and whether he ""wants to round people up and deport folks."" Our research Asked to back up the ""build a wall"" assertion, the Bera campaign pointed to a widely-viewed November 2014 video in which Jones calls on President Obama to reform immigration. Jones made the video weeks after Sacramento County Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver was killed during a shooting rampage by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported twice. At the end, Jones says: ""An American patriot, Ronald Reagan, once told Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev to ‘tear down this wall,’ to preserve democracy and secure safety and freedom for a nation. Mr. President, I’m asking you to build up that wall for the very same reasons.""  Scott Jones makes the ""build up that wall"" comment at the 7:00 minute mark in the video above. Jack Pitney, professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former Republican National Committee staffer, said ""it’s a stretch"" to say Jones was advocating for the same massive wall along the Southern border that Trump has since called for. ""It’s an exaggeration of what (Jones) has said in the past,"" Pitney said, adding it’s not exactly clear what Jones meant by ""build up that wall."" In the ""Immigration Reform Plan"" released by the Jones campaign last month, Jones called for a ""combination of beefed-up border patrols, increased fencing and technology, and certain consequences for illegal entry will help us keep America safe,"" to secure the border. A spokesman for the Jones campaign said in a statement: ""Sheriff Scott Jones has never advocated for building a wall on the entirety of the Southern Border."" ""Round people up and deport folks"" To back up its claim that Jones wants to ""round people up and deport folks,"" the Bera campaign pointed to Jones’ support for the federal Davis-Oliver bill. That legislation, according to a Washington Post article, would authorize state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law and direct money to help in that effort. It would also punish localities that have created ""sanctuary cities,"" where illegal immigrants need not fear being arrested for their immigration status. It is named after the Sacramento County deputy killed in 2014, and  Placer County Detective Michael Davis, Jr., who was also killed in the rampage. Trump specifically mentioned and supported that bill during his immigration policy speech in August. The Bera campaign says the bill would ""amount to a strategy for comprehensive mass deportation."" Pitney said linking Jones to the federal bill shows the Bera campaign has ""at least a smidgen of documentation"" to back up part of its claim. The professor noted, however, that deportations are common under Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Jones has not called ""for the mass deportation of those in our country illegally,"" his campaign said. In his reform plan, Jones says: ""All immigrants currently living here illegally should be given a pathway to legal status, provided they register and pass criminal background checks. Working immigrants should be allowed to stay and support their families, pay taxes, and live out of the shadows."" When the Sacramento Bee asked Jones in January about his immigration stance, he responded: ""No. 1, you are not going to deport 11 million people. I wouldn’t even advise you do that because by and large they are productive members of our community. They deserve more than what we are giving them despite the fact that they are here illegally. I would advocate for a pathway to legal status for each and every one of them."" In the 2014 video, Jones also said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s undocumented immigrants. Our ruling Congressman Ami Bera said his Republican challenger Scott Jones ""wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks."" There’s some truth to that: In a 2014 video, Jones calls on President Obama to reform immigration and to ""build up that wall,"" to ""preserve democracy and secure safety and freedom for a nation."" The statement hints at Jones’ possible preference for border security. But his official immigration reform plan released last month calls for ""increased fencing and technology,"" and doesn’t mention the word ""wall."" Bera’s next claim that Jones wants to deport people might be technically correct: Jones has called for deporting undocumented immigrants ""who have committed serious crimes."" Bera’s overall statement is partially accurate. But it makes too broad a connection between Jones and Trump, who’s called for deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, not just those who have committed major crimes while in the United States. Bera ignores this key context. We rate his claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Katko voted against Planned Parenthood funding four times
","Democrat Colleen Deacon says Rep. John Katko, R-Camillus, flip-flopped on funding for Planned Parenthood. When Katko first ran for the office in 2014, he wasn’t against federal funding for the organization. Now, his opponent says he broke his promise to voters. At a regional campaign office opening for Hillary Clinton in Syracuse, Deacon said Katko voted four times to defund Planned Parenthood. ""He’s somebody who when he ran said he promised he wouldn’t vote to defund Planned Parenthood and since he’s been in office he’s done that four times,"" Deacon told WRVO. She also made the claim in her victory speech in June’s primary election. The Syracuse area congressional district is considered a toss-up. Three Republicans and two Democrats have represented the district since 2003. Is Deacon right about Katko’s record on Planned Parenthood funding? Katko’s position on abortion Katko opposes abortion, except in cases of rape and incest, or if the health of the mother is at risk. He said during one debate in 2014 that he would reverse the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade if given the opportunity. That doesn’t mean he opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Katko told the Post-Standard newspaper in Syracuse last year he supported funding until a set of videos was released that implied the organization was harvesting fetal tissue for sale. The creator of those videos has since faced charges related to the incident. Katko also went on the radio last September to explain why he changed his position. ""It’s never an easy issue, right? Before, when I was running in the campaign, I was absolutely for funding for Planned Parenthood. The law is clear that any federal funds for Planned Parenthood can’t be used for abortions, so that’s not an issue,"" Katko told Grant Reeher on WRVO. He went on to explain that the videos gave him pause to support federal funding for the organization. ""It isn’t about abortion to me. It’s about whether they’re breaking the law or not,"" Katko said. The first and second votes The videos sparked state investigations into Planned Parenthood and a renewed effort to strip the organization of federal funding in Congress. In September 2015, The Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was brought to the House Floor. Katko voted twice to advance the legislation. In his first vote, Katko opposed a proposed amendment to reconsider the bill. His vote helped keep the legislation on the House floor. His second vote supported the actual bill, which passed in the House but was not brought to a vote in the Senate. The third vote Then during federal budget negotiations last year, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was slipped into a one-house resolution to fund the federal government. It included the same language as the standalone bill. The House, with the help of Katko, passed the resolution. The Senate did not. The fourth vote The fourth vote happened a few weeks later when Republicans in the House tried to defund the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Tucked away in that legislation was language that would have stripped federal funding to any entity that provided abortion services. Katko voted for the legislation. The House passed the measure, but the bill did not become law. Our ruling At the opening of Hillary Clinton’s regional campaign office in Syracuse, Deacon said Katko voted four times to defund Planned Parenthood. She’s right. Katko voted defund the organization, according to voting records.

By voting for free-trade deals, Ron Johnson helped companies send jobs overseas, Russ Feingold says
","During the 2016 election cycle, free trade agreements have drawn scorn from candidates ranging from Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders, both of whom have unloaded on Hillary Clinton for her support of NAFTA and other trade deals. But Democrats have ripped Republicans on the deals, too. In June 2016, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold released a TV ad  claiming that the incumbent, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson, ""voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."" Our rating was False. Then on Sept. 26, 2016, Feingold went on the attack again with a similar but less specific claim in a TV ad that features four middle-age people. One looks at the camera and says Johnson ""helped companies ship jobs overseas."" The new attack falls short, too. Three trade deals To back the claim, the Feingold campaign cited three votes Johnson made in 2011. They were in favor of free trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. President Barack Obama, who touts the tariff-reducing agreements as a way to increase U.S. exports and ""support"" jobs in the United States, signed each of them into law in 2012. Currently, the United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries -- with the largest being the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. The South Korea deal is the second-largest. An August 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that the United States’ negative trade balance with South Korea has grown -- from $16.6 billion in 2012 to $28.3 billion in 2015 -- since that trade deal was signed. That report did not make any estimates on jobs. In May 2016, the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that trade deficits with Korea eliminated more than 95,000 U.S. jobs between 2011 and 2015. The report was written by Robert Scott, the institute’s senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research. Scott told us that the Korean trade deal led to an increased demand in the United States for products made in Korea and a decreased demand for U.S.-made products. But, importantly for this fact check, his report did not say that jobs lost in the United States were sent overseas. The report’s job-loss estimate was in the same range as a March 2015 estimate by government accountability think tank Public Citizen, which said the increased trade deficit with Korea ""equates to nearly 85,000 lost U.S. jobs."" But that report did not state that U.S. jobs were sent overseas, either. Moreover, there are issues with the two job-loss estimates attributed to the Korean trade deal. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker weighed in in March 2016 about claims on free trade and job losses, including one by Trump that cited the Economic Policy Institute, saying: ""We urge all readers to view such claims with deep skepticism. The job-loss figures often rely on simplistic formulas that are disputed by other economists. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends."" Indeed, the Fact Checker gave Public Citizen four Pinocchios, its lowest rating, for its 85,000 lost-jobs claim. Public Citizen took ""fishy"" math the White House used to make a jobs increase estimate and then manipulated further, the Fact Checker said. (Scott, of the Economic Policy Institute, told us he has not seen estimates on job effects of the Colombia and Panama free trade deals, noting the deals are much smaller.) Other experts also see problems with the job-loss estimates attributed to free-trade deals. Susan Houseman, senior economist at the Michigan-based Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, told us: ""Estimating the effects of a trade agreement on jobs is very difficult to do convincingly, because many other factors affect employment, and so parsing out the effects of one trade agreement is tough. Some jobs are lost by increased competition, but others are created by increased access to foreign markets."" NAFTA, Houseman noted, has been closely studied, ""and the evidence that it had significant negative effects on employment is weak."" PolitiFact National also concluded in an April 2016 fact check on Sanders attacking Clinton over trade deals that that the jury is still out on the job effects of the deals. Our rating Citing Johnson’s votes for free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, Feingold says Ron Johnson ""helped companies ship jobs overseas."" There are estimates that the largest of the three deals, with South Korea, resulted in a loss of jobs in the United States. But those estimates are disputed, largely because of how difficult it is to isolate one cause for changes in employment. Moreover, the job-loss estimates do not state that any U.S. jobs were shipped overseas. Without evidence of the trade deals helping ship jobs overseas, we rate Feingold’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097285C80>],/factchecks/2016/oct/05/russ-feingold/voting-free-trade-deals-ron-johnson-helped-compani/

Kaine: Police stopped slain Minnesota driver over 40 times
","Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine brought the tense intersection of law enforcement and race into the center of the vice presidential debate. Kaine accused Pence of being afraid to confront the issue of bias in police, but Pence denied that he was afraid. Kaine pressed the issue with the story of Philando Castile, the Minnesota man shot to death by a police officer during a traffic stop for a broken tail light. The gruesome incident was streamed live on a Facebook video by Castile’s girlfriend. ""They called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked,"" Kaine said. ""The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates."" We know the larger point Kaine was making and we’ve checked that before (True). But we wanted to vet his number for how many times police stopped Castille. According to the Associated Press, Kaine is correct. The AP reported on June 9, 2016, that Castile ""had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt."" The report also found that about half of the charges against Castile had been dismissed. A similar investigation by NPR found 46 stops. And NPR noted ""Of all of the stops, only six of them were things a police officer would notice from outside a car — things like speeding or having a broken muffler."" Minnesota offers a rare glimpse into broader patterns of law enforcement and race. In 2001, the Legislature commissioned a study by the Institute on Race and Poverty, a center overseen by a University of Minnesota law professor. That study ultimately included 65 jurisdictions. The results published in 2003 showed several disturbing patterns. Law enforcement officers stopped black, Latino, and American Indian drivers at greater rates than whites, searched them at greater rates than whites, but the rate of actually finding illegal goods was less for minorities than for whites. In a press release, the lead study director Gavin Kearney said, ""The pattern for blacks and Latinos existed in nearly every participating jurisdiction."" Shortly before Castile was shot, he had told the officer that he had a permit to carry a weapon. Our ruling Kaine said Castile was stopped by police 40 or 50 times before the time when he was fatally wounded. According to multiple independent press reports, that is accurate. Police had stopped Castile at least 46 times. A study commissioned by the state legislature found that local police were more likely to stop and search minority drivers.

At debate, Mike Pence claims Trump never said more nations should have nuclear weapons
","Throughout the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate, Democratic candidate Tim Kaine repeatedly baited his Republican opponent Mike Pence to defend Donald Trump’s controversial remarks. In one instance, Kaine criticized Trump’s position on nuclear proliferation. Kaine claimed Trump said ""more nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that."" Pence responded, ""Well, he never said that, senator."" ""He has absolutely said it,"" Kaine said. ""Saudi Arabia. South Korea. Japan."" Trump’s stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, so we decided to lay them out for you here. But reading through these exchanges, it’s clear that Trump thinks it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons, given the threat posed by North Korea. ""Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons,"" said Trump spokesman Steven Chung. Here are some of Trump’s key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons. March 27, 2016 The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump responded, ""At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem."" He added later in the same interview: ""If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us."" March 29, 2016 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, ""If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?"" As part of a winding response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation (""No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any;"" ""I don't want more nuclear weapons"") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time. ""Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" he asked Cooper. Cooper also asked Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?"" Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, absolutely."" Cooper: ""You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?"" Trump: ""No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us."" April 3, 2016 Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Trump, ""You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?"" Trump: ""In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.""   Trump later added of Japan and South Korea, ""Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" May 4, 2016 CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, ""You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?"" Trump responded, ""I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world."" Our ruling Pence said Trump ""never said"" that more nations should get nuclear weapons. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be ""better off"" if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he has also said — often in the same interview — that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.

Mike Pence says Hillary Clinton wants to turn Obamacare into single-payer
","Republican Mike Pence warned during the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate that the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is only going to get bigger if Democrat Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are elected Nov. 8. ""Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare,"" Pence said. ""They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start."" Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies. Some Democrats — including, at one time, Barack Obama — pushed for a single-payer system comparable with what other developed countries have. But that turned out to be politically untenable. The result was the Obamacare patchwork of different commercial insurance plans offered in ""marketplaces"" by individual states and the federal government. We contacted the Donald Trump campaign seeking evidence that Clinton and Kaine, in fact, wanted to convert Obamacare into a national health insurance system. Spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website. It indicates ""that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare,"" Kowalski said. ""A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery."" Clinton's website does, indeed, say that she wants a public option. But that would be just one option. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Clinton's web page makes it clear that there would be other payers as well. Clinton has consistently said she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans — and Trump — and expand it by protecting consumers from rising health care costs. Her expansion would include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries where the prices are dramatically lower. Other parts of her proposal were outlined in a 1,500-word commentary in the Sept. 28 New England Journal of Medicine. Trump declined to submit details on his plans. We asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal. Kowalski responded that ""Hillary has committed fully to the public option,"" and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady. At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, ""I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don’t think it’s — I don’t even think it’s a close call politically."" She earns no Nostradamus points for that one. More to the point, later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works. Our ruling Pence said Clinton and Kaine ""want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program,"" suggesting that they have proposed such a change. They have not. They have promoted a public option, which would be a government-sponsored insurance plan. A lot of Democrats, such as Bernie Sanders, would like to go in that direction. But throughout the current campaign, Clinton has consistently resisted that suggestion, saying she would work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it. No one would be surprised if Clinton pushed for single payer if it became politically practical, but none of her campaign statements are calling for that. We rate Pence's statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c96e957-1429-4062-b0a0-e96538007969",[<zip object at 0x000002809673CE00>],/factchecks/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-hillary-clinton-want-turn-obamacar/
"['National', 'Social Security', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine Mostly False on Donald Trump's Social Security stance
","During the vice presidential debate, Tim Kaine deployed a longstanding Democratic talking point against his Republican rivals -- that Republicans can’t wait to privatize Social Security. Kaine said, ""Here's what Hillary (Clinton) and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us."" Pence’s response was that ""all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it."" Kaine countered, ""Go read the book."" Kaine’s wording was careful, but he left a clear impression that Trump would privatize the retirement program while Kaine and Clinton would protect the existing system. As it turns out, Kaine is on target with the reference to a Ponzi scheme in Trump’s book. But it’s a big stretch for Kaine to use a 16-year-old book as evidence that the Trump-Pence ticket would ""engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security."" A primer on privatization As we’ve noted before, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that beneficiaries could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither outcome is possible under the current Social Security program. The most high-profile proposal along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into ""personal retirement accounts."" Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation. A few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and now serves as House speaker -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress. These two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom that changing the way Social Security operates is the ""third rail"" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. For this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term ""privatization"" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology. Trump’s book In Trump’s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, he directly compares Social Security to a Ponzi scheme. ""The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,"" Trump writes at one point. ""The pyramids are made of papier-mache."" He also wrote in the book, according to BuzzFeed, ""This is the second year Social Security benefits have been paid. The first recipients of Social Security, even once inflation was factored in, got the equivalent of a 36.5 percent annual interest rate on their initial contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund. For those retiring in 1956, their inflation-adjusted rate of return was still a respectable 12 percent. Julie Kosterlitz, in the National Journal, compares that figure with this: For those who are working now and looking to retire after 2015, their returns will be below 2 percent. And that’s if they ever get paid at all. Does the name Ponzi all of a sudden come to mind?"" In his book, Trump proposed allowing ""every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds. Federal guidelines could make sure that your money is diversified, that it is invested in sound mutual funds or bond funds, and not in emu ranches."" So Kaine has a point that Trump once supported partial privatization of Social Security and called it a Ponzi scheme. But that was 16 years ago, and the Clinton campaign did not provide us with any more recent evidence after the debate concluded. So what about Trump’s position today? Trump's views on Social Security as a candidate As we’ve reported, Trump has been somewhat unusual among major Republicans in flatly rejecting any calls for entitlement reform, including Social Security. He’s also been fairly consistent during the campaign -- a statement we can’t make about other policy issues. In September 2015, he said on CBS’ 60 Minutes, ""What I want to do is take money back from other countries that are killing us and I want to save Social Security. And we’re going to save it without increases. We’re not going to raise the age and it will be just fine."" He told a crowd in Georgia in February, ""We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts. Mark my words."" He also responded to a June AARP questionnaire on making Social Security solvent in the future by essentially focusing on economic reforms, and didn’t mention any proposals to change the structure of the entitlement program. ""If we are able to grow the economy, increase the tax base, bring capital and jobs back to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will shore up our entitlement programs for the time being,"" he said. Our ruling Kaine said that Trump would ""engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security."" Kaine cited an old stance, but it needs updating. Back in 2000, Trump did support privatization and call Social Security a Ponzi scheme. But now, 16 years later, Trump has offered relatively vague -- but relatively consistent -- statements that support keeping the structure of the program as is, without enacting changes as significant as private accounts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5ba48df-5efa-48ca-aa2d-4104c36b02e3",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0E7F00>],/factchecks/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-mostly-false-donald-trumps-social-securi/

Tim Kaine correctly notes Richard Nixon released tax returns despite audit
","Mike Pence told Tim Kaine at the vice presidential debate that Donald Trump will release his tax returns -- once an audit of the GOP presidential candidate has concluded. But the Democratic vice presidential candidate responded that explanation didn’t meet the ""Nixon standard."" ""Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit,"" Kaine said. Kaine often invokes Nixon in calling for Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Back in August, we checked a statement Kaine made where he said that Nixon made his tax returns public ""when he was running for president."" We found that statement was Mostly False, because while Nixon made his tax forms public as president, he never did so while running for the country’s highest office. Kaine worded his statement differently this time around, so let’s take another look. You can find Nixon’s tax returns for 1969 through 1972 at the website for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues. That group has compiled tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees. Nixon’s returns were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected. At the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings. Reports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts told us in August. To quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  Nixon was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us. In an April 2016 blog post, Thorndike wrote that the IRS audit found Nixon owed almost $500,000 in unpaid taxes and interest. ""Nixon released his returns even though he was under audit. Ultimately, the audit didn’t go well for him-- it was unpleasant, embarrassing, and ultimately very expensive,"" Thorndike wrote. ""But it was also necessary, given the persistent questions about Nixon’s returns."" Thorndike says Nixon’s disclosure started a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public. His successor, President Gerald Ford, didn’t make his returns public, although he did release a summary of his returns. Every president since Jimmy Carter has made their tax forms public. Our ruling Kaine said, ""Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit."" That is accurate.

Kaine: Trump said undocumented immigrants 'will all be gone'
","Vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence used their only debate to attack the other candidate’s platform on immigration. Pence, the Republican governor of Indiana, criticized the Democratic ticket for an ""open borders"" policy (which is False), while Kaine, a Virginia senator, fired back on Donald Trump’s deportation plans. ""When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said ‘no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.’ He said, quote, ‘They will all be gone. They will all be gone,’ "" Kaine said during the Oct. 4 debate in Farmville, Va. ""This is one of the ones where you can go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said."" Trump has offered contradicting plans for deportations. He has said he would have a deportation force to round up people here illegally, and that while he wants families to stay together, ""they have to go,"" but that there can be a ""softening because we're not looking to hurt people, we want people."" Kaine referenced Trump’s speech in Arizona on Aug. 31, where he outlined a 10-point immigration plan. We revisited Trump’s immigration speech to see if, in fact, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally will all be gone and that he plans to deport everybody. Trump has been steadfast on his plans to build a wall along the southwest border. But Kaine is oversimplifying Trump’s most-recent deportation priorities. When Trump got to point No. 3 of his immigration plan, he said there would be ""zero tolerance for criminal aliens."" He said that according to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens inside the United States. Trump, talking specifically about criminal immigrants in the country illegally, said his administration would begin moving them out ""day one,"" working especially with police and law enforcement who ""know who these people are."" ""They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. ""And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone. ""Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over. They're going out. They're going out fast."" Trump did not say, as Kaine quoted, ""they will all be gone,"" in reference to all people in the country illegally. However, in other parts of the speech, Trump stressed that non-criminal immigrants living in the United States illegally would also eventually have to return to their home countries and apply for re-entry. ""Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined,"" Trump said. Trump’s campaign pointed to part of Trump’s speech in which he said after accomplishing his enforcement and deportation goals, including the construction of the wall, ""then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain."" But Clinton’s team pointed us to other parts of that speech where Trump said, ""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation."" Trump went on to emphasize his priorities, including criminals, gang members and security threats. Our ruling Kaine said, ""When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said ‘no, we're building a wall and we're deporting everybody.’ He said, quote, ‘They will all be gone. They will all be gone.’ This is one of the ones where you can go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said."" Trump has not always been consistent about his deportation plans. But in Phoenix, he did not literally say of the entire undocumented immigrant population, ""they will all be gone."" He used that kind of language to describe his plans for immigrants who had committed crimes, saying they would be the first to go. However, Trump did say in the same speech that people here illegally today and who want to be legalized ""have one route and one route only, to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else.""

Pence repeats false claim on Clinton Foundation's limited charitable work
","In the vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence tried to skewer Hillary Clinton by talking about the multi-billion dollar Clinton Foundation. Pence recycled a flawed GOP talking point that the foundation is a cash cow to enrich the Clintons and their friends. ""10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes,"" Pence said. This is based on a misunderstanding of how the foundation operates. In brief, it raises money to deliver services and projects itself. The amount of money it gives away as grants is a small sliver of its activities. We’ll use the Clinton Foundation’s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That’s close to 6 percent of the foundation’s money being spent on grants. But that doesn’t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say, or that only 10 cents of every dollar went to a charitable cause. ""Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,"" Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. ""In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment."" What are some of the foundation’s programs? The Clinton Development Initiative helps farmers in Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania raise more crops and get higher prices at the market. The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS. Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as ""overhead""), Mittendorf told us. He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses were on program services. ""Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question,"" Mittendorf said. The American Institute of Philanthropy’s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on ""overhead."" ""The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity,"" Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. ""They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100."" Other Republican critics of the foundation have used slightly higher figures than Pence. Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus said the foundation only spent 20 percent on good works. Conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh said it was 15 percent. Those are inaccurate, too. Our ruling Pence said 10 cents on every dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes. While it’s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly. A leading expert in the finances of philanthropies, Mittendorf, says that while the Clinton Foundation calls itself a foundation, it operates like a public charity. Mittendorf cautioned that while the dollar amounts are clear and verified, that is no guarantee that the programs are effective and efficient. However, that is not the criticism Pence raised.

Tim Kaine says that during the Obama administration 15 million jobs were created
","Tim Kaine and Mike Pence sparred over job creation at the vice presidential debate. Pence, the running mate of Republican Donald Trump, said, ""The policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Sen. Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression."" Kaine countered, ""15 million new jobs? 15 million new jobs?"" Is Kaine right that during President Barack Obama’s tenure, the United States has created ""15 million new jobs?"" To be able to get that number, Kaine has to cherry-pick the time frame. Getting to 15 million requires choosing the low point of the job market under Obama. Specifically, the number of employed Americans bottomed out in February 2010 with 107.3 million jobs and rebounded, as of August 2016, to 122.4 million jobs. That’s an increase of about 15.1 million jobs, pretty much what Kaine said. But it’s important to note that February 2010 was just over a year after Obama and Biden were sworn in. Essentially, Obama and Biden took office as the recession was spiraling to its low point, but it took a while to hit bottom. So after they were sworn in, the number of jobs continued to fall for a year as they worked to stop the economic freefall. If you start counting instead at the beginning of Obama’s presidency, the number of jobs rose from about 111.5 million in January 2009 to 122.4 million in August 2016. That’s an increase of 10.9 million jobs, only about two-thirds of the nearly 15 million figure Kaine touted. We should note that starting the count in February 2010 is something economists have told us is not an unreasonable decision, since the recession began under George W. Bush and Obama can’t reasonably be blamed for job losses in the earliest part of his tenure, when the die was already cast. We’ll also note that using private-sector jobs as the benchmark boosts the numbers a bit compared to total jobs, because widespread budget-cutting in states and localities has led to a smaller government workforce. If you look at total employment gains rather than private-sector gains, the increases would have been a little lower -- an increase of 10.5 million jobs (from the start of Obama’s term) or 14.9 million jobs (from the low point in February 2010). Finally, we’ll note, as we regularly do, that no elected official deserves full credit (or blame) for economic results on their watch. Policies pursued by a president can help the economy, but other factors beyond the reach of a president -- from technological change to improvements in the global economy -- also play a role. Our ruling Kaine said that during Obama’s tenure, the United States has created ""15 million new jobs."" To reach a number that high requires some creative calendar work -- starting the count at the low point in the job market, which was just over a year after Obama took office. That’s not an unreasonable place to start, but it’s also not the only one, and for Kaine to cite that figure amounts to a bit of cherry-picking. In addition, it’s always worth a grain of salt when allocating credit to an elected official for good economic news.

Did Ellen Rosenblum say 80 percent of the attorney general's job is being a government lawyer?
","
Oregon is likely to pick its new attorney general in May. No Republicans are running for the office. Two Democrats are running this spring and will face any third party opposition in the fall. So far it’s been a low-profile contest.

But the candidates, Ellen Rosenblum and Dwight Holton, have traded several barbs. Holton, for example, says that Rosenblum has repeatedly claimed that the job of being the state’s top prosecutor is mostly being a government attorney, and not an advocate.

""She has said over and over again that this is a job where 80 percent of the job is being the government’s lawyer. I just don’t believe that. This is the Oregon Department of Justice and I take that word justice very seriously,"" Holton said in a radio interview with 1190 KEX.

Apparently Holton means it in a negative way and the Rosenblum camp takes it as such. ""What Dwight is doing over and over is using that 80 percent number to inaccurately portray her as a candidate that doesn't understand the role and is just a bureaucrat,"" says Cynara Lilly, spokeswoman for the Rosenblum campaign.

A campaign barb under protest is fair game for PolitiFact Oregon. Did Rosenblum say it? Over and over? And what was the context in which she made the statement?

The Holton camp helpfully directed us to a radio interview Rosenblum conducted in January, with 620 KPOJ. The host asked her to explain the job of attorney general to audience members unfamiliar with the role.

""Well I think a lot of people don’t realize that about 80 percent of the work of the attorney general is representing the government agencies, and which in essence means representing the governor …"" she said in response.

Rosenblum repeats the figure one more in that interview. And in response to a question on how she might distinguish herself from current Attorney General John Kroger, she said, ""I would definitely want to focus on the highest quality of the advice that we give to the government agencies.""

There’s no question Rosenblum made the point more than once. She may have repeated the figure elsewhere, as Holton’s people suggest although Rosenblum’s people deny that. (However, Rosenblum and her spokeswoman also denied she said it in the first place, and that is inaccurate.)

Still, here’s the part that really trips us up.

In that same January interview, Rosenblum talked about what she would emphasize, that the public may not know: Consumer protection, financial fraud, helping district attorneys, environmental protection, small businesses, and fighting for workers, children, families. In that way, she hit the same notes as Holton.

""The attorney general also is involved in so many areas and those that I would emphasize would include child advocacy,"" she said about two minutes in. ""I don’t think a lot of people realize that about 300 employees of the attorney general’s office collect child support for those who are in arrears or on behalf of those whose exes or whoever have not kept up with their payments .""

We raised the issue with the Holton campaign. Is it fair to cherry-pick one statement to pound the point that the opponent has acknowledged the job is being the state’s lawyer, which it is?
""What we're talking about here is the difference in the vision of the job of attorney general,"" said Jillian Schoene, a Holton spokeswoman.

Schoene passed along this comment from her boss: ""Providing excellent legal advice is a core mission -- but in my view, if that is all you do, you've failed -- because the attorney general ought to go to work each day to fight for families, not just answer the phone and provide legal advice,"" he said.
 
But that’s clearly not what Rosenblum has said or is saying. She’s not saying that’s all she’ll do.

Holton’s statement is partially accurate in that Rosenblum did describe the job of attorney general as 80 percent government work.

David Dewhurst says Ted Cruz represents a Chinese company found guilty of stealing U.S. blueprints
","
U.S. Senate candidate David Dewhurst, whose campaign last fall sent email blasts depicting candidate Ted Cruz as a China sympathizer, popped a TV ad April 17, 2012, revisiting Cruz’s representation of a Chinese company.

Dewhurst’s ad says Cruz, the state’s former solicitor general, is helping the Shandong Linglong Tyre Co. put a U.S. company out of business. Next, Jordan Fishman, identified as an ""American manufacturer,"" appears on screen, saying: ""Ted is defending a Chinese company who stole things from an American citizen -- and it’s not only from us, it’s from the people who work for us.""

The narrator then says: ""Cruz’s Chinese client stole American blueprints and the courts found the Chinese company guilty, liable, for stealing blueprints."" The commercial closes with mention of the U.S. firm, which is not identified, winning a judgment of $26 million though, the narrator says, with Cruz’s help, ""the Chinese keep stalling in court, they keep counterfeiting, and Ted Cruz keeps getting paid.""

We wondered if Cruz, a partner at Houston’s Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, indeed represents a Chinese firm found guilty, or liable for, stealing U.S. blueprints.

Cruz’s campaign posted a response to Dewhurst’s ad, saying: ""Ted works in the private sector as an appellate lawyer at a major law firm that represents clients on different sides of litigation. One of the clients of the firm is a tire company based in China. That private company was sued in a trademark dispute and hit with a judgment, and the firm was hired to handle the appeal."" The response also says Cruz did not represent the client in the original trial.

""And the appeal concerns technical issues,"" the  response says, ""like the court’s jurisdiction and the appropriate statute of limitations.""

To back up the stolen blueprints’ claim, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed us to a Dewhurst website, titled the ""Real Ted Cruz,"" featuring links to a few articles touching on the legal dispute.

Among them: An Oct. 3, 2011, blog post by Texas Monthly’s Paul Burka mentioning a story placed Sept. 28, 2011 on Plaza de Armas, a San Antonio news blog. The Plaza de Armas story describes Fishman as a Florida businessman who designs and produces underground mining tires. In the 1990s, the story says, Fishman created a version containing a three-inch layer of rubber on the outside, enabling it to withstand movement in confined spaces. Fishman is quoted saying that behind his back, his company’s sales and marketing manager attempted to negotiate a contract with a Chinese company to make the product for himself; when Fishman found out, the employee was fired.

""About two weeks later,"" Fishman is quoted saying, the former employee ""was in contact with the people in Dubai and ultimately China, and turned over the blueprints to them. They copied the blueprints, which you can’t do. You can go and buy a product and retro-design it, but you can’t copy a blueprint.""

Fishman filed suit against Shandong Linglong and in 2010, after a six-day trial, a federal jury in Virginia awarded him $26 million in damages, the story says. Cruz later filed the still-pending appeal on behalf of the Chinese company, the story says.

Also noted by Dewhurst: A July 28, 2010, Sarasota Herald-Tribune news story recapping a judge’s decision to uphold the damages award which attorneys for Fishman rate as one of the largest ever for individual copyright infringement.

The story, quoting from the lawsuit, says that in 2005 former sales manager Sam Vance began providing trade secrets to Shandong Linglong Rubber Co. and Al Dobowi Tyre Co. of Dubai, a distributor. ""The information included design blueprints, customer lists and pricing information,"" the story says. ""Tire Engineering, which does business as Alpha Mining Systems, sued Vance in 2005, and two years later discovered a ‘conspiracy’ among the foreign companies to steal and profit from those trade secrets,"" the story quotes the lawsuit as saying.

Separately, the newspaper said, Fishman's company also had sued the former employee in local court. The story says the company was awarded $59 million in damages in 2008, but a state appellate court later tossed that judgment.

Dewhurst’s site also points to a July 22, 2010, press release stating the federal judge upheld $26 million in damages ""resulting from the illegal copying of Mr. Fishman’s blueprints for unique asymmetrical underground mining tires."" The release identifies August J. Matteis, Jr. as Fishman’s lead lawyer.

Matteis, a Washington lawyer, told us in a telephone interview that the jury found the Chinese firm, and others, liable for misdeeds including stealing tire design blueprints from companies owned by Fishman. He said too that Fishman ran across early evidence of the sneaky work when he saw foreign-made tires based on his designs at a Las Vegas trade show.

Matteis forwarded the jury’s July 15, 2010, verdict and the July 21, 2010, order from U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis, III.

The jury found the defendants liable for violating laws related to copyright, registered trademark, unfair competition deceptive trade practices, conversion and civil conspiracy. Matteis said the ""conversion"" verdict refers to the stealing of blueprints. The verdict also shows the jury awarding $26 million in damages, a figure based on recovering profits made by the other firms by taking the blueprints, Matteis told us.

Ellis’s order states, in part, that the ""evidence was sufficient to prove that defendants unlawfully obtained copies of plaintiffs' blueprints.""

Matteis said the word ""guilty"" in Dewhurst’s ad is incorrect because that term applies to criminal charges while the judgment and award was reached after a civil trial.

Our ruling 
Matteis’s comment about the word ""guilty"" strikes us as valid; viewers might take ""guilty"" in Dewhurst's ad as hinting that Cruz represents someone convicted of a criminal act. This is not so.

Cruz is representing a Chinese firm found liable for stealing blueprints. We rate Dewhurst’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1174C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/19/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-represents-chinese-co/
"['Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Gas Prices', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Florida', 'American Energy Alliance']","
Did Obama policies on Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone contribute to today's high gas prices?
","Gas prices are fueling a drag race of political ads on Florida television. In one lane, it’s spiking gas prices under President Barack Obama. In the other, it’s ""Big Oil’s"" support for Mitt Romney.

We’ve fact-checked several claims from these ads. But for this fact-check, we’re returning to an ad put out by the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy arm of the Institute for Energy Research, which is connected to the oil industry.

""Since Obama became president, gas prices have nearly doubled,"" the ad says. ""Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska. He gave millions of tax dollars to Solyndra, which then went bankrupt. And he blocked the Keystone pipeline. So we will all pay more at the pump.

""Obama's energy secretary said we need to, quote, 'boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.’ That's $9 a gallon. … Tell Obama, we can’t afford his failing energy policies.""

We’ve fact-checked whether Obama opposed exploring for energy in Alaska (Half True -- he opposed it in some parts), whether he gave millions of dollars to Solyndra (a federal program for alternative energy did), and whether Energy Secretary Steven Chu said gas prices should be at European levels (yes, but it was before he joined the administration).

The ad is right that gas prices have doubled (more than doubled, in fact) since Obama took office in 2009. The average price for gasoline was $1.90 in January 2009; now it's $3.98, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Here, we wanted to explore the ad’s larger point, that Obama’s policies on Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone are contributing to those higher gas prices.

Energy exploration in Alaska

The ad’s first claim is that Obama ""opposed exploring for energy in Alaska."" We found in a previous fact-check that while Obama opposes exploration in some parts of Alaska, his administration has approved drilling in other parts.

Specifically, Obama has opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a large nature preserve (roughly the size of South Carolina) managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge is a protected area for wildlife including caribou, polar bears and gray wolves.

But the Obama administration recently approved a plan for Shell Oil to drill in the Chukchi Sea, off the northwest coast of Alaska, giving the green light to Shell’s contingency plans for cleaning up any spills. The company called that a ""major milestone"" and said it hopes to drill up to three wells there this summer.

The company also has plans for two wells in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska’s northern coast. The administration approved Shell’s disaster response plan for that area in March.

But if Obama had given a green light to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, would gas prices be lower today? Not according to the evidence we reviewed.  

A 2008 study done by the independent Energy Information Administration for the late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, found that it would take 10 years to actually produce oil from the area. And that’s only if there were no protracted legal battles, environmental challenge or delays in getting government permits.

So even if Obama had approved drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the day he was inaugurated, there’s no way oil in the ground there would have made it to gas pumps in 2012.

Solyndra

Heard of Solyndra? It was a solar panel manufacturer that won government loan guarantees but then went belly up. We looked into Solyndra when we fact-checked an earlier political ad that said Obama showered special favors on his political friends. The particular charge of cronyism got a Mostly False from the Truth-O-Meter. Solyndra's loan application predated the Obama administration, and career Energy Department officials handled the deal.

We did find that the administration tried to hurry the process, but the evidence pointed to the Obama team wanting to brag about green jobs efforts, not to enrich political cronies. Many private investors also lost money on the Solyndra deal.

Solyndra, based in Silicon Valley, formed in 2005 to build and sell a unique type of solar cell, cylinders that were cheaper and worked better than traditional flat panels. Designed for rooftops, the panels were intended to generate electricity to power buildings like warehouses and retail stores. (Read more details about Solyndra’s rise and fall here.)

Solyndra walked away from $529 million in federal loans, according to the most recent numbers from the U.S. Department of Energy. But Solyndra was an energy company that focused on generating electricity for buildings -- not gasoline for cars. We searched for any connection between Solyndra and gas prices or even just cars and came up empty.

The Keystone XL pipeline

The ad says Obama blocked the Keystone pipeline. Obama did block the Keystone XL, an addition to an existing pipeline so that oil sands (also known as tar sands or bituminous sands) could be moved from Canada to refineries near Houston, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico.

Because the pipeline crosses the U.S. border, the State Department must sign off. Back in November, the State Department said it would delay a decision while environmental concerns about the pipeline were addressed. Back then, the pipeline was set to cross over drinking water sources in Nebraska, and people were asking TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline project, for an alternate route.

The company has since said it would work with officials to shift the route. But environmentalists have still said the pipeline shouldn’t be built at all, because oil sands are harder to clean up when spilled and cost more to turn into gasoline.

Then Congress put new deadlines into play, passing a law that said the Obama administration had to make a decision on the pipeline by February. Obama said that wasn’t enough time for a thorough environmental review and rejected the pipeline.

The ad again suggests the delay of the pipeline is somehow responsible for today’s high gas prices. Since the pipeline was only proposed in 2008 with a then-projected opening of 2013, it’s hard to see how gas prices in 2012 would be lower. (PolitiFact Ohio also looked in detail the question of whether Keystone approval would cause gas prices to drop in the near term; they ruled that claim False.) Whether Keystone will reduce gas prices in the future is a contested point that we won’t settle in this fact-check. TransCanada’s analyst said it would bring down gas prices by 3.5 to 4 cents per gallon, according to Forbes. But environmentalists have seized on arguments that the pipeline could drive gas prices up, by giving Canadian oil an outlet to world markets through the Gulf of Mexico and bypassing U.S. customers. (The Christian Science Monitor explored these issues in some detail.) Greg Laskoski, a senior petroleum analyst with GasBuddy.com, said Keystone had the closest connection to gas prices, but even that connection was far from simple and more oriented toward future prices. Lower-priced Canadian oil could be of some benefit to refineries in the United States, but that assumes it stays in the United States and isn’t sold to foreign countries.

""It’s not as simplistic as some of these sound bites make it out to be,"" he said.

None of the above

We contacted the American Energy Alliance to ask them about the connection between these issues and today’s gas prices. Spokesperson Benjamin Cole said that Obama’s overall policies are hostile to the domestic oil and gas industry, and that markets have reacted with increased prices. (We should note that’s a more subtle point than is made in the 30-second ad.)

Not everyone sees it that way, though. Obama’s energy policies have been ""surprisingly constructive,"" said Michael Levi, an expert on energy with the Council for Foreign Relations, in a March op-ed for ForeignPolicy.com. In an article titled ""The Driller in Chief,"" Levi argued that Obama’s regulations are aimed at ""dumb and preventable accidents"" that would ""do far more to set back U.S. oil and gas development than some smart minimum standards set out at the federal level.""

Getting back to today’s pump prices, the experts we spoke with were dubious about the impact of any of the above issues -- drilling in Alaska, Solyndra, the Keystone pipeline -- on today’s gas prices.

Gas prices reflect the cost of oil on world markets and tend to reflect long-term trends, expectations for economic growth and geopolitical concerns. One example: Rising tensions with Iran, a major oil exporter.

""Looking at this year, what’s affected prices are the issues with Iran,"" said Jessica Brady, a spokesperson for the travel organization AAA, which monitors gas prices.

What about drilling in Alaska, Solyndra and Keystone? ""Really, none of those three issues have had an impact on the gas prices we’ve been paying,"" she said.

Laskoski of GasBuddy.com said a president’s power over gas prices comes mostly from reducing regulations for domestic exploration and refining, as well as discouraging speculation in the oil market. But even those powers are somewhat limited.

""Those are things that can be done that can bring reductions (in prices),"" Laskoski said. ""All of those things combined might help lower gas prices, but I don’t know how you can quantify it.""

Our ruling

The American Energy Alliance connects today’s higher gas prices to a grab bag of Obama’s energy policies. We can’t see how the failing of Solyndra -- a solar panel company that focused on powering commercial buildings -- has any connection with today’s gas prices. On Alaska, if Obama had approved drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (which, to be clear, he opposes), actual production would still be at least six years away, and that’s a best-case scenario. The Keystone pipeline, meanwhile, is more directly related to gas prices, but even that project would have more impact on future gas prices, not today’s higher prices.

We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A29B780>],/factchecks/2012/apr/19/american-energy-alliance/did-obama-policies-alaska-solyndra-and-keystone-co/
"['Corrections and Updates', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Iraq', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Tommy Thompson says every penny increase at the pump sends $1 billion from U.S. to Saudi Arabia
","
In a March 23, 2012 campaign speech, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson made a billion-dollar claim about a 1-cent increase in the price of gasoline.

Addressing the La Crosse County Republican Party in western Wisconsin, the former Wisconsin governor called for the United States to become ""energy independent,"" then said:  

""Every time, ladies and gentlemen, a penny goes up on that gasoline cost -- and how do you like those $4.25 a gallon? -- every time a penny goes up, it's a billion dollars out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia.""

That’s real money.

Does cash really flow out of the country at that rate -- to a single oil-producing country -- from folks filling their gas tanks?

When we asked the Thompson campaign for evidence, consultant Darrin Schmitz made two points in an email:

1. Thompson meant to say Middle East when he referred to Saudi Arabia.

So, right off the bat, Thompson’s claim appears to be wrong.

2. A 50-cent increase in the price of gas costs U.S. consumers nearly $60 billion per year, according to a March 2012 article in The Atlantic magazine.  

The Atlantic article did say a 1-cent gas price increase would cost U.S. consumers $1.2 billion per year, which puts something of a time frame on Thompson’s statement. But that’s a different measure than $1 billion going from the U.S. economy to Saudi Arabia (or the Middle East, for that matter).

We contacted four experts, each of whom used essentially the same math to evaluate Thompson’s Saudi Arabia claim. They agreed that a 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas indicates that the price of a barrel of crude oil had risen 42 cents.

Jay Hakes is the former director of the U.S. Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of A Declaration of Energy Independence. He  said that on average, the U.S. imported 1,195,000 barrels of Saudi petroleum per day in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration.

If each barrel cost 42 cents more, the U.S. would pay Saudi Arabia $501,900 more per day -- or slightly more than $183 million per year.

That means it would take nearly 5 1/2 years for the U.S. to spend $1 billion more on Saudi oil.

John Kingston is global director of news for the energy publication Platts. He multiplied 42 cents by a slightly different number -- 1,422,000 -- the net number of barrels per day imported from Saudi Arabia in January 2012, which is the most recent figure available.

That comes to an additional cost of $597,240 per day, or nearly $218 million per year. So it would take 4-1/2 years to reach $1 billion.

Jim Williams is an energy economist and owner of WTRG Economics in Arkansas. He took the same approach Kingston did.

Charles Ebinger is director of the energy security initiative at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank. He said that for years, many people have claimed that a 1-cent increase in the gasoline tax would cost motorists $1 billion a year. He said that is roughly accurate, depending on how much gas motorists consume in a given year.

Thompson didn’t mention a gas tax increase in his statement, but let’s take a look.
Ebinger said that if a 1-cent increase in the cost of gas costs motorists $1 billion over one year, about $130 million of that money would go to Saudi Arabia, since about 13 percent of crude oil imports come from that country.

At that rate, it would take nearly eight years for Saudi Arabia to collect an additional $1 billion from the United States.

In any case, although Thompson singled it out, Saudi Arabia isn’t the largest provider of crude to the United States.

The latest figures show that in January 2012, net oil imports from Canada were 2.66 million barrels per day, nearly double the 1.42 million barrels from Saudi Arabia, which ranked second. For all of 2011, Canada ranked first, Mexico second and Saudi Arabia third in the number of barrels imported per day.

And the balance of U.S. imports and exports is improving.

In 2011, U.S. exports of gasoline, diesel and other fuels exceeded imports for the first time since 1949, according to a claim rated True by PolitiFact New Jersey. The biggest contributing factor, however, was the increase in foreign purchases of distillate fuel, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil.

Our rating

Thompson said that every time the price of gasoline increases by 1 cent, ""it's a billion out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia."" His campaign said Thompson meant to say Middle East and cited a statistic that covers a one-year period.

Four experts said it would take roughly four to eight years for a 1-cent increase in gas prices to result in an increase of $1 billion in what the U.S. spends to import Saudi oil.

(Incidentally, we asked Williams, one of the experts, about the Middle East. He said it would take 3-1/2 years for $1 billion to flow from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and United Arab Emirates as a result of a penny increase in gas. So, even if Thompson had said Middle East instead of Saudi Arabia, his statement would be inaccurate.)

We rate Thompson’s claim False.

Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper says Congress’ approval at historic low
","
With the economy still in recovery, an election on the horizon and Congress stuck in what seems like a perpetual state of gridlock, suffice it to say that voters are fed up with politicians and how the federal government is being run.

U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Nashville, reflected on Congress’ unpopularity in a recent op-ed article and compared the legislative branch to a sick patient in dire need of strong medicine.

""Congress as a whole is less popular than it’s been since polling was invented,"" Cooper wrote in The Hill, a newspaper that closely chronicles what’s happening in Congress.

We knew these have not been the best of times to be a federal officeholder. But we wondered if Cooper is right that Congress is more unpopular than ever before, so we called his office and asked for his sources.

His spokeswoman, Katie Hill, said in an email message that the information came from media reports about Gallup polling on congressional job approval. She provided us with links to the Gallup poll and to related articles in The Washington Post and The Hill.

Since Cooper argued that Congress is the most unpopular it has been since polling was invented, a bit of history is in order.

Gallup founder George Gallup is often credited with developing the first scientific methods of measuring public opinion. Gallup was not the first person to do political polling.

According to PBS, newspapers often augmented their election coverage by interviewing voters as they left the polling places. These impromptu interviews were called ""straw polls,"" and the first one recorded in the United States took place in 1824. By the turn of the century, they were common in both local and national newspapers and magazines.

Gallup was among the first practitioners of scientific polling. The Gallup Organization and its predecessor, the American Institute of Public Opinion, have been asking Americans for their thoughts on political and economic matters since 1935. It wasn’t until 1974, however, that Gallup began asking Americans if they approve of the job Congress is doing.

The Gallup poll that Cooper was referencing was conducted Feb. 2-5, 2012, about two weeks after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address and the reconvening of the House and the Senate.

The poll found that just 10 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, the legislative body’s lowest rating ever. The previous all-time low was recorded in December 2011, when just 11 percent of Americans approved of the way Congress was handling its job. Other polls have shown similar results.

A CBS News/New York Times poll conducted just a few days after the Gallup survey -- on Feb. 8-13, 2012 --  put Congress’ approval rating at 10 percent, a near-record low. The all-time low was recorded just a few months earlier, when Congress received a 9 percent approval rating in October 2011. That was the lowest rating recorded since the poll first asked the question in 1977.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Jan. 12-15, 2012, found that just 13 percent of Americans approve of the way Congress is handling its job. The pollsters said it was Congress’ worst rating ever in the survey.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted on Jan. 22-24 also put Congress approval rating at 13 percent, just one point higher than the all-time low in that poll. The all-time low was 12 percent and was recorded back in 2008.

Our ruling

At least four recent polls put Congress’ approval rating at record or near-record lows. Even in those cases where the most recent approval rating is not the lowest on record, the difference between the most recent and the lowest ratings is just 1 percentage point. Thus, Cooper’s statement turns the dial to True on the Truth-o-Meter.

ARC tunnel project overruns would have been New Jersey’s responsibility alone, senator says
","
Backed by billions of dollars from federal and state sources, the canceled Hudson River rail tunnel project had been praised by supporters for its potential to ease congestion and create thousands of jobs.

But had the project exceeded its estimated budget, New Jersey alone would have had to cover the additional bills, state Sen. Jennifer Beck says.

About 18 months after Gov. Chris Christie terminated the Access to the Region’s Core project — better known as the ARC project — the proposal returned to the headlines last week with the release of an report on the project’s history.

In an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck (R-Monmouth) pointed out how federal officials estimated the cost of the project, which would have linked Secaucus to a new rail station deep under West 34th Street in Manhattan, could climb to between $10 billion and $13 billion.

""The project was originally estimated to be $8.7 billion, and New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns,"" she said.

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered Beck is right. Based on a federal rule for such projects, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said.

Beck said it didn’t seem equitable that New York officials wouldn’t contribute anything.

""It didn’t make sense,"" Beck told us. ""It really is a regional project.""

Let’s review some of the history behind the ARC project.

With NJ Transit as the lead agency, New Jersey was to contribute $2.7 billion toward the $8.7 billion project cost. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was to contribute $3 billion, with the remaining $3 billion coming from a federal transit program.

But in their latest estimate before the project was canceled, federal officials said the cost could increase to between about $9.8 billion and roughly $12.4 billion.

After Christie first announced plans to cancel the project, federal officials presented a few options to fund the remaining costs, including federal loans and a public-private partnership to secure additional funding.

But on Oct. 27, 2010, Christie went ahead with terminating what was the largest planned public works project in the nation, citing potential cost increases and the state’s fiscal climate.

Due to the project’s cancellation, there was no final agreement on the responsibility for cost growth, according to a recent investigative report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Still, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion, DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told us. Nisly said in an e-mail that ""it is important to note that we were actively working with NJ Transit to mitigate any potential costs when they decided to walk away from the project.""

According to Nisly, the basis for that responsibility is a 2006 federal rule that includes the following phrase: ""Once the project is approved into final design, any increase in project costs will be borne by the sponsoring agency and its non-section 5309 New Starts funding partners.""

That rule goes on to say that ""any cost increase later in project development is the sole responsibility of the project sponsor.""

Our ruling

In an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck claimed that beyond the $8.7 billion budget for the ARC project, ""New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns.""

Based on a federal rule governing such projects, the senator’s claim is accurate. As a DOT spokesman confirmed, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget.

We rate the statement True.

Chain email claims ACLU sued military to block prayer
","
So has everyone heard about the big legal case going on in Washington?

Not the recent three-day hearing before U.S. Supreme Court about the federal government’s health care law and its controversial individual mandate.

We mean the case about the American Civil Liberties Union suing the U.S. military, according to a widely circulated chain email.

Loyal PolitiFact Georgia reader Robin Fitch asked us to check out a claim she received in her email. inbox

""ACLU has filed a suit to end prayer from the military completely,"" the email said. ""They're making great progress. The Navy Chaplains can no longer mention Jesus' name in prayer thanks to the ACLU and others. I'm not breaking this one. If I get it a 1000 times, I'll forward it a 1000 times! Let us pray...Prayer chain for our Military... Don't break it!""

Fitch, who lives in Atlanta, got it from a friend in Columbus. She didn’t believe it. Turns out her instinct was correct.

This claim has been circulating for a few years. It may have gotten started in 2006, when a Navy court reprimanded and docked the pay of an evangelical Protestant chaplain. Lt. Gordon J. Klingenschmitt was found guilty of disobeying an order by appearing in uniform at a political protest in front of the White House. He had been critical of the Navy’s policies that he said prevented him from saying ""Jesus"" in a prayer.

In 2009, rumors of an ACLU lawsuit to end prayer completely in the military began spreading through the Internet. That year, PolitiFact swatted down a claim that the ACLU filed a lawsuit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed. The one was rated Pants on Fire. The article mentioned the prayer claim.

A year or so later, websites began debunking the specific claim about prayer in the military.

But for the record, we checked with the U.S. military to see if anything has changed since these rumors began.

""That’s utter lunacy,"" said Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a Defense Department spokesman. ""I’m not aware of any notification from the ACLU toward that end.""

An ACLU spokeswoman told us the same thing.

""This email has been widely circulated, but there is no such ACLU lawsuit of this kind pending, nor do we intend to file one,"" spokeswoman Molly Kaplan told us via email.

AARP says telephone companies hired 35 people to lobby Ohio General Assembly on deregulation legislation
","
While an abortion rights or gun control bill draws a crowd of regular citizens for a hearing, it’s the more staid changes to regulations for big businesses that can pack the house with dyed-in-the-Brooks-Brothers-suit lobbyists.

It’s a certainty you won’t be able to swing a wingtip at the Statehouse without hitting a lobbyist when big industries with packs of full-time lobbying staffs on the payroll have a bill up in the legislature.

Such is the case with Senate Bill 271, a bill that deregulates Ohio’s telecommunications industry. It already has passed the Senate and now is undergoing hearings in the Ohio House. Supported by the telecommunications industry, the bill is opposed by a coalition of consumer groups including AARP.

In an AARP news release  March 26 titled ""Don’t Hang up On Ohio,"" the group laid out its case that access to basic telephone service for elderly and rural citizens may be curtailed by the bill. That’s because companies would be allowed to drop certain areas from coverage plans or force customers who want no-frills service to switch to services that cost more, the release stated.

In the sixth paragraph, the advocates levied this claim: ""Large phone companies and their trade association have hired 35 registered lobbyists to influence and pass SB 271.""

Is that true? PolitiFact Ohio started working the phones to find out.

Our first call was to Kathy Keller, communications director for AARP Ohio, who said the news release was a collaborative effort among about a half-dozen organizations that banded together to fight the bill. She said the numbers on lobbyists came from Ellis Jacobs, an attorney who works with the Edgemont Neighborhood Coalition of Dayton, one of the organizations.

Jacobs said he identified 35 lobbyists by going to the Ohio Legislative Activity Center, an on-line database kept by the Ohio Legislative Inspector General’s Office, and counting the registered lobbyists in telecommunications. He said he counted lobbyists from AT&T, Cincinnati Bell, Frontier Communications, the Ohio Telecom Association and Windstream to reach his number.

However, Jacobs said he believes he may have inadvertently double counted a lobbyist or two when he did his initial check, and now believes there are 32 lobbyists. (Lobbyists are listed separately in the database depending on whether they are lobbying the executive, legislative or state retirement systems so there are some duplicative listings to wade through.)  

Not among those lobbyists being counted by Jacobs were four that lobby for CenturyLink, a communications company in 33 states including Ohio. ""I wasn’t really familiar with CenturyLink so I didn’t include them,"" Jacobs said.

Once they are included in the tally, the number of lobbyists working for large companies lobbying on this bill reaches 36 — about the number used by the coalition group led by AARP based on Jacobs' research.

So while the number of phone company lobbyists is about right, what about the rest of AARP’s claim; that the lobbyists were hired ""to influence and pass SB 271."" That implies that the lobbyists were specifically hired to get SB 271 though the legislature.  

But a quick check of the same lobbying database shows that at the beginning of 2011 — long before SB 271 was on the scene — the same five companies plus the Ohio Telecom Association employed 33 lobbyists.

It seems pretty clear that the 36 lobbyists represents the full roster of folks who are working to persuade the legislature on matters related to the telecommunications industry including SB 271. But they weren’t hired just to lobby on that bill.

So where does that leave us as we call for the Truth-O-Meter?

A coalition of consumers looking to stop legislation deregulating the phone industry in Ohio said ""large phone companies and their trade association have hired 35 registered lobbyists to influence and pass"" the legislation.  

Their count is in the right area code. They acknowledged they might have double counted a handful of lobbyists, but PolitiFact Ohio actually found some they missed and ended up tallying 36 who work for large telephone companies.

These companies have staffs who lobby on their behalf all the time and these people weren’t hired just for this specific piece of legislation. That is apparent given that  the companies had 33 lobbyists in January 2011, long before the legislation was being considered. That’s a point of clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, AARP’s claim rates Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967EC900>],/factchecks/2012/apr/19/AARP/aarp-says-telephone-companies-hired-35-people-lobb/
"['Abortion', 'Rhode Island', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Religion', 'Women', ""Jon O'Brien""]","
Catholics for Choice president says only 14 percent of Catholics agree with Vatican's position that abortion, under all circumstances, should be illegal
","
On April 11, 2012, the Rhode Island House Judiciary Committee took testimony on several bills focusing on the abortion issue, including one that would require a doctor to show each woman seeking an abortion an ultrasound image of her fetus before the procedure (although the woman wouldn't be required to view it).

Jon O'Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, was one of the people who presented written testimony to the committee, which held that bill, and others, for further study.

One of the statistics he cited caught our eye: ""Only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal."" We wondered if the support was really that low.

We've looked at public opinion on the abortion question before. On February 12, 2012, we found that in most surveys, more Americans regard themselves as ""pro-choice"" than ""pro-life."" But the gap is narrow and has gotten smaller over the years.

O'Brien was focusing exclusively on Catholics and only on whether they agree with the Vatican's stance, that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, not whether they consider themselves ""pro-life.""

The ""Respect for Human Life"" section of the Catechism of the Catholic Church says, ""Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.""

When we called O’Brien’s office to ask for his source, Catholics for Choice directed us to its 2009 survey of 923 Catholics who were registered voters, a study conducted by Belden Russonello & Stewart.

Only 14 percent said abortion should be illegal in all instances. Another 37 percent said it should be legal in just a few cases, 27 percent said it should be legal in most cases and 21 percent said it should be legal in all cases. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

Among the 356 who said they attended Mass frequently, 31 percent said abortion should never be legal. The rate was 6 percent among the 426 who occasionally attend Mass and 3 percent among the 138 who said they never attend.

We came across a 2004 Quinnipiac University poll which found that 17 percent of Catholics said abortion should be illegal in all cases while 16 percent said it should be legal in all cases.

Quinnipiac asked the same questions in 2009 and found little change among Catholics; 16 percent wanted abortion to be illegal in all instances while 13 percent said it should be legal in all cases.

The Pew Research Center has also looked at the question. Its director of survey research, Scott Keeter, sent us the latest survey, of 2,410 adults -- including 532 Catholics -- conducted from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, 2011. While 16 percent of all respondents said abortion should be illegal in all cases (with a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points), 19 percent of Catholics (with a margin of error of 5 points) felt the same way.

And the Knights of Columbus released their own survey, done by Maris in December 2011, in which 14 percent of Catholics said abortion should always be illegal. The same percentage  said abortion should be available at any time during a pregnancy.

Again, in all the surveys we saw, Catholics split along the same lines as non-Catholics and devout Catholics were more likely to agree with the Vatican stance on the legality of abortion.

Here's the summary: 

Our ruling

Jon O'Brien of Catholics for Choice said that ""only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal.""

Two polls, one commissioned by his organization and one commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, support that precise number. Other, independent, polls show a bit more support among Catholics for the church's official position, but not a lot, unless the question is posed to the most devout.

O'Brien offered a very specific number, without qualifiers. He is very close, especially when you consider that the margin of error grows when such polls pull out the subset of respondents who are Catholic.

But because there is some variation, we rate his statement Mostly True.

President Barack Obama says his administration has nearly doubled rate of China trade cases
","
President Barack Obama touts his administration’s record holding trade partners accountable by drawing a contrast with President George W. Bush over China.

""We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration,"" he said in an April 13, 2012, speech in Tampa, Fla., before a trip to Colombia.

Here’s how he set it up:
  
""Now, one of the ways that we've helped American business sell their products around the world is by calling out our competitors, making sure they're playing by the same rules. For example, we've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration. We just brought a new case last month. And we've set up a trade enforcement unit that's designed to investigate any questionable trade practices taking place anywhere in the world."" 

It’s a claim he’s made before, published in the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times.

We wondered, is it true?

‘The honeymoon’

We asked the White House for support for the president’s claim.

Obama referred to cases brought against China before the World Trade Organization, said spokesman Matt Lehrich. The WTO is a group of more than 150 governments that sets and enforces international trade rules. Since the United States and China are both members, it’s a pivotal place they can go to settle disputes with one another.

There are other important types of trade cases, such as anti-dumping cases brought before the U.S. International Trade Commission, but those are brought by private industry, said Peg O’Laughlin, public affairs officer for the ITC.

Other kinds of enforcement cases include those brought under Section 301 or 201 of U.S. trade laws. They're rare now because, under WTO rules, the United States isn't supposed to regularly turn to that sort of unilateral action, said Paul Blustein, a trade expert with the Brookings Institution.

So while there are a wide range of trade measures available, the experts we consulted said focusing on just WTO cases seemed reasonable.

The Obama administration has brought six cases against China before the WTO in less than one term, while the Bush administration brought seven cases over two terms — thus, the claim ""at nearly twice the rate.""

But there’s a distinction between the two presidencies, what we’ll call China’s ""honeymoon.""

China joined the WTO in 2001, after Bush took office. At that point, member countries essentially gave China a grace period to follow the new rules.

""Business was just rushing into China … those were good days,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow for the Peterson Institute for International Economics who writes about U.S.-China trade and worked in the Carter and Ford administrations. ""Nobody was wanting to bring cases in particular. (China) probably got more of a grace period than would normally be expected because of the business boom.""

The United States became the first country to file a trade case, over trade barriers against integrated circuits, in March 2004.

Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in 2004 that China had needed time to adjust its tax and regulatory policies to comply with WTO standards, but that after two years ""the honeymoon"" was over, according to Congressional Quarterly and other news organizations.

The Obama administration, on the other hand, had no such delay — plus it could take advantage of work started under Bush to file a first case within six months of taking office.

That’s not to say Democrats back in 2004 weren’t arguing the Bush administration could have acted sooner.

""One case brought as a political talking point does not make up for the administration's failure to develop a China trade policy over the past three years,"" Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top-ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, was quoted as saying in Congressional Quarterly in 2004. ""This is an open-and-shut case that the administration should have addressed years ago.""

A Bush-era deputy U.S. trade representative says Bush realistically had five years to bring cases against China — not seven.

""The first year of China's membership was eaten up giving them a chance to prove compliance,"" said John Veroneau, who also worked in the Defense Department under President Bill Clinton. ""The second year was eaten up jawboning about problems and preparing the facts and analysis to be able to bring a WTO case. At the beginning of the third year, we brought the first case.""

That changes the math, putting Bush’s rate of cases much closer to Obama’s.

Rather than nearly two cases a year for Obama vs. about one for Bush, the comparison would be nearly two cases a year for Obama vs. about one and a half for Bush.

Driving factors

The trade policy of the president isn’t necessarily the largest factor driving the rate of trade cases, said Hufbauer, the expert with the Peterson Institute. Other considerations out of Obama’s control (and Bush’s) held greater sway, he said.

• When the country has more trade, you’re going to have more cases. And trade with China has boomed over the decade.

• The economic climate matters. While the government brings cases to the WTO, its staff relies on private companies to come forward with strong evidence of wrongdoing. That requires companies to be motivated to do the legwork. In boom times, there’s less motivation. An economic downturn makes a difference. ""Private companies have been much more aggrieved in the last few years than the first few years.""

• China hasn’t been as welcoming. ""It just isn't as friendly to companies as it was during the Bush administration,"" Hufbauer said. ""That wasn't because of the Bush administration — but because of the times. … This is leading companies to see more of the downside."" That means they’re more willing to spend time to help the government build trade cases.

One piece of evidence that Obama’s administration has been deliberately more aggressive than Bush’s deals with use of safeguards under Section 421 of U.S. trade law, which will be allowed by the WTO through 2013. The section allows U.S. industries to request blocking particular imports from China to protect American companies. While the Bush administration refused several such requests, Obama approved one on tires.

""There is a very sharp change in that,"" Hufbauer said.

But the White House told us Obama’s statistic relied on WTO cases, not other types of trade measures, so we're basing our ruling on that measurement, which independent experts said was a good metric.

Our ruling

Obama said his administration has ""brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration."" Though the statistic takes into account the fact that China didn’t join the WTO until nearly a year into Bush’s term, it fails to acknowledge time for China after it joined to adjust to new WTO regulation. By contrast, Obama's administration could hit the ground running. The math still favors Obama, but not by as much as he claims. Also, there are several external factors that affect an administration's decision to pursue trade cases. Those are important details and context. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A6AA80>],/factchecks/2012/apr/18/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-his-administration-has/
"['Federal Budget', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Virginia', 'Jamie Radtke']","
Jamie Radtke claims George Allen ""voted for 40,000 earmarks""
","
Jamie Radtke wants to tag George Allen, the frontrunner in the June 12 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, as a big spender.

In a recent web video, Radtke’s campaign claims that Allen ""voted for 40,000 earmarks"" during his previous term as a senator from 2001 to 2007. Earmarks are money sent to constituents for pet projects by members of Congress.

Last year, we ruled that Radtke’s claim that Allen ""had 40,000 earmarks"" was False. Her campaign sought to clarify her words, saying Radtke’s statement merely meant Allen had voted for that many earmarks. We did not accept their explanation and pointed out several other claims by Radtke that suggested Allen personally requested all that pork.

This time around, Radtke has altered her verb and given us a new claim to check. Did Allen really vote for 40,000 earmarks during his Senate term?

Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for the campaign, said the number is based on a calculation by the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonprofit group that tracks earmarks and releases annual reports of ""pork projects.""

Allen, as a senator, voted on the budgets from fiscal years 2002 to 2006. The 2007 budget did not pass until late January of that year, a few weeks after Allen left the Senate. He was defeated the previous fall by Democrat Jim Webb.

The five budgets Allen voted on included 52,319 earmarks valued at $121.8 billion, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Hansen said that Radtke’s campaign, seeking to be conservative in its claim, chopped off about 25 percent the Citizens’ numbers and estimated Allen voted for 40,000 earmarks valued at $90 billion.

But there’s an important fact that Radtke omits: Allen did not vote on each earmark individually. They were attached to about four dozen major appropriations bills that Allen supported during his time in the Senate. Those bills authorized a total of about $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending programs -- including defense, education and justice -- and the earmarks added up to less three percent of that total.

Even the watchdog groups that have criticized earmarks as wasteful don’t totally blame Allen for supporting appropriations bills that kept government operating.

""If anyone against earmarks voted against appropriations bills, we wouldn’t get anything done,"" said Leslie Paige, media director for Citizens Against Government Waste. ""We don’t think that’s very telling. We would really rather look at what the member of Congress requested in earmarks and what bills they introduced on their own.""

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Allen didn’t necessarily support ""each and every earmark."" He cited the $225 million ""Bridge to Nowhere,"" connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents.

Allen voted for a  $286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005 that funded the bridge. Later that year, he got a chance vote specifically on the earmark, when a measure came up to move funding from the Alaska project to a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina on I-10 in New Orleans. Allen was one of 15 supporters of the unsuccessful amendment.

Ellis, however, does not not give Allen a free pass on earmarks. He noted a few lawmakers -- including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- who voted against spending bills because they objected to earmarks.  

Allen ""was part of the system and certainly got earmarks when he was in office as well,"" Ellis said. ""You don’t get a total mulligan because the earmarks were part of much larger bills, but it does need that context.""

We don’t know how many of those earmarks Allen actually sponsored or requested. Members of Congress weren’t required to disclose whether they requested a particular line item until the year after he left office in 2008. During Allen’s term, Virginia received 1,135 earmarks, valued at about $1.2 billion, which could have been requested by any of Virginia’s 13-member delegation.

Allen clearly sought pork for Virginia. ""Every single earmark I’ve gotten, I’m proud of,"" he told a town hall meeting in Chesterfield County on March 20, 2006, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article. Allen said then that legislators who attach earmarks to appropriations bills should be identified.

A few months later, Allen and other members of Virginia's congressional delegation refused cooperate with a Times-Dispatch reporter’s request to identify the earmarks they requested during fiscal 2006.  

In this year’s campaign, Allen is calling for a ban on earmarks until the federal budget is balanced. Afterwards, earmarks would require a two-thirds majority.

Our ruling:

Radtke claims that Allen, during his term in the Senate, voted for 40,000 earmarks.

We have one quibble. Allen did not vote on the earmarks individually. The items were attached to massive appropriations bills supported by Allen that kept the federal government operating. The earmarks amounted to less than 3 percent of the spending contained in those laws.

But unlike a few lawmakers, Allen never protested the secretive earmark process by voting against an appropriations bill. He went along with the system and said he was ""proud"" of the earmarks he got for Virginia.

The appropriations bills Allen backed had 52,319 earmarks, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Radtke attaches a smaller number to Allen, but we won’t penalize her for understating her case.

So Radtke’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A408E40>],/factchecks/2012/apr/18/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-claims-george-allen-voted-40000-earma/
"['City Budget', 'Labor', 'Wisconsin', '  AFSCME']","
AFSCME says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett demanded union concessions beyond those in Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining law
","
We know why labor unions stand against Republican Gov. Scott Walker and in favor of recalling him: the 2011 changes that nearly eliminated collective bargaining rights for most public employees.

But why are they so mad at Democrat Tom Barrett, who opposed those limits? The Milwaukee mayor is one of four Democratic candidates vying to face Walker in the June 5, 2012 election. The primary is May 8.

AFSCME Wisconsin, which represents thousands of government workers in Milwaukee and Wisconsin, says it’s because Tom Barrett out-did Walker in putting the hammer down on unions.

Specifically, the Milwaukee arm of AFSCME claims Barrett publicly was ripping the union limits while quietly using the prospect of the law to try to get unusually deep concessions to balance the city budget.

The group embedded its charge in an April 7, 2012 apology of sorts for highlighting a scathing Internet video that claimed Barrett supported Walker’s limits on bargaining. We rated that claim False.

The AFSCME statement on the video mostly served to reiterate labor concerns over Barrett’s relationship with  labor, and underscore its support for Barrett rival Kathleen Falk.

""Unfortunately, Tom Barrett's record is very different (than Falk’s),"" the statement said. ""When our members who work for the city of Milwaukee tried to negotiate with him as Walker was ramming through Act 10, Barrett wasn't interested in working with us.""

Then came the union’s final punch: ""Instead, he demanded concessions that went far beyond those mandated by Act 10.""

Act 10 prohibits government employers from bargaining with unions over benefit levels, working conditions and wage increases over the rate of inflation. It takes effect as existing union contracts expire, allowing communities to unilaterally collect more from workers for health insurance, pensions and more. For unions without an active contract, it took effect right away.

Did Barrett really oppose the bargaining changes and then use them to cut even deeper into union power?

That question gets to the heart of why many unions, some of which sat out the 2010 election in which Walker defeated Barrett, are opposed to the Milwaukee mayor.

The answer to the first part is relatively straightforward. The mayor clearly spoke against such extensive limits on bargaining, we reported earlier, though he also strongly backed Walker’s move to get public employees to pay more for their benefits.

The second question turns on what exactly Act 10 ""mandated."" How you view it partly depends on which side of the bargaining table you sit on.

Let’s rewind the clock.

The sweeping law passed in March 2011 amid chaos at the Capitol but did not go into effect until June 2011 because of court challenges.

Many unions, including AFSCME, sought to extend contracts before Act 10 took effect -- opening talks in Milwaukee, for example, even before the measure came to a vote. And AFSCME, again like many other unions, was willing to accept health and pension concessions in order to get a contract that still offered a host of protections -- and pushed off the day when they would be subject to the full force of Act 10.

But the negotiations in Milwaukee collapsed, leaving Barrett free -- after AFSCME’s contract expired on Dec. 31, 2011 -- to put as much of Act 10 into effect as he wanted.

More on that later.

To learn how the union backs up its claim that Barrett ""demanded concessions that went far beyond those mandated by Act 10,"" we turned to Richard Abelson, the veteran head of AFSCME District Council 48, which represents many city employees.

Abelson sent us the opening proposal from the city of Milwaukee negotiators to the union on Feb. 24, 2011.

The city’s offer included proposals to get a 4.9 percent wage cut (essentially equal to the pension contribution Walker’s bill envisioned), and increase workers’ share of health insurance premiums to 12 percent. Abelson acknowledged those were right out of the Act 10 playbook.

But he contended that Barrett’s proposal to eliminate contractual work rules spelling out overtime provisions, hours of work and duty disability pay went ""far beyond"" the mandates of Act 10.

He also said the city’s side rejected a union proposal for raises of 50 percent and 75 percent of the inflation rate in 2013 and 2014.

""Even Walker’s bill allowed that,"" Abelson said.

Let’s take a closer look.

Act 10 did mandate higher pension contributions from workers at the City of Milwaukee, other municipalities and school districts, and in state government. And it mandated that 12 percent health-care share for state employees and some local employees, though Milwaukee was not included because it’s not part of the state health plan.

At the bargaining table, Barrett went beyond those two specific fiscal concessions.

But so did Act 10.

The measure mandated an end to collective bargaining on health care, pensions, overtime and other work rules. In other words, it allowed employers such as the City of Milwaukee to turn all those items into management rights.

So the city could unilaterally decide to trim payments and benefits that once were agreed to in negotiated contracts.

The greater control over overtime and work rules sought by Barrett’s team was exactly what Act 10 envisioned -- Walker said it would help local governments and school districts offset state aid cuts.

But let’s return to the statement, that Barrett ""demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated.""

First, Barrett didn’t ""demand"" concessions. The city’s proposal was just that, a proposal. It was the starting point in the inevitable give-and-take of negotiations.

To be sure, the city offer was a jolt: No pay raise, new salary deductions for pension and health care, and elimination of overtime and workweek protections that had been part of the contracts for decades. The city wanted a one-year extension; the union wanted two or three years.

Barrett aides say the city saw a massive pension payment coming in 2013, and did not want to get locked into a pay raise while trying to absorb major state aid cuts that Walker’s budget delivered.

Two longtime observers of labor negotiations told us the AFSCME claim is only accurate in a technical sense.

""It is true that Act 10 did not ‘mandate’ changes in work rules,"" noted Dan Thompson, executive director, League of Wisconsin Municipalities. ""But it allowed (Barrett) to change them"" without bargaining.

""It’s worse in a way,"" from labor’s standpoint, Thompson said.

Bottom line: Barrett could have gone even further if he was using Act 10 as a model. In the spirit of Act 10, he could have refused to bargain on all topics except base wages, and ignored all past labor contract language on work rules.

""In some very narrow sense, the union is right, but the statement ignores the big picture"" of Act 10’s effect, said Peter Davis, Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission general counsel.

Barrett also points out that his team left many of the AFSCME contract’s points in place -- on sick leave for rank-and-file workers, health insurance at retirement, vacations and other issues -- and the union was willing to agree to several of Barrett’s changes if a raise accompanied them.

There’s an interesting coda to all this.

In the end, AFSCME’s old contract expired Dec. 31, 2011 with no extension, leaving the city free to have its way on dozens of workplace issues formerly subject to bargaining.

Barrett used what Walker calls the ""tools"" to get major health care savings for his budget. (He never got the increased pension contribution after a city attorney legal opinion cast doubt on its legality.)

But Barrett and the Common Council dug even deeper, eliminating a host of bargained provisions of years past.

Here’s the list and estimated savings for 2012 totalling almost $1 million:

New limits on overtime ($195,000); changes to duty disability payments ($140,000); less make-up pay for days lost to inclement weather ($125,975); lower auto mileage reimbursement ($41,139); and smaller sick leave payouts for management ($120,000).

The city went further on other benefits, eliminating these: clothing and cleaning allowances ($187,114), paid lunches ($84,844), glove and tool allowances ($54,020), educational bonuses ($22,404) and additional money paid to employees released to conduct union business ($14,509).

The city also cut annual sick leave earnings from 15 to 12 days, reduced call-in pay from three hours to two, but said the savings were unpredictable.

Some things got better: Shift differential pay increased in some cases, and funeral leave expanded for some.

Our conclusion

AFSCME said that in labor negotiations, Barrett ""demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated"" by Walker’s bill severely curtailing collective bargaining.

Barrett didn’t ""demand"" concessions.

There’s a kernel of truth in that Act 10 didn’t mandate fiscal concessions beyond pension and health insurance, but in reality it dictated that employers could make many of the kinds of changes Barrett proposed in the AFSCME talks.

We rate the union’s claim Mostly False.

Flier casts transportation funding plan as never-ending tax
","
A flier about a vote to raise money for metro Atlanta roads and transit says the plan would create a tax that may never die.

The anonymous handout appeared at an April 4 Fayette County Commission workshop, where an Atlanta Regional Commission planner spoke about the transportation special local option sales tax, otherwise known as T-SPLOST.

If voters approve it July 31, it will raise an estimated $7.2 billion to build a slate of transportation projects. (The referendum comes with a regional list of projects that total $6.14 billion. In addition, about $1 billion will be sent back to the counties and towns where it was raised.)

The flier listed what it said were 10 transportation facts. This one topped the list:

""This 1% tax is scheduled for a minimum of 10 years with additional renewals authorized,"" it said.

ARC representatives kept the handout. A spokeswoman sent a copy to PolitiFact Georgia when we requested it.

The sentence is a little muddled, but its meaning was clear to PolitiFact Georgia reporters and others who read it: T-SPLOST will last ""a minimum"" of 10 years, and has been approved to last longer than that.

We wondered whether the tax will rise up like a zombie from ""The Walking Dead,"" ready to terrorize metro Atlantans for decades to come.

Some fiscal conservatives are fighting the T-SPLOST because they think the government already spends too much money and will use these tax dollars on the wrong projects. Supporters say it will help untangle traffic in a region that’s become notorious for it.

Transportation fees that don’t expire are a sore point in metro Atlanta. A toll to finance the building of Ga. 400 was set to expire in 2010, but the State Road and Tollway Authority Board voted to extend it for 10 more years.

Gov. Nathan Deal was running for office back then. He promised to revoke the toll by the end of 2011. He didn’t, and earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter.

Now back to our fact check. We tried to track down the flier’s authors, but came up empty-handed.

The handout cited Georgia Statute 48-8-245 (b)2 as the source of information on the tax’s expiration, or lack of one. The statute was written as part of Georgia’s Transportation Investment Act of 2010.

The Transportation Investment Act created a process that lets voters decide by region whether to raise taxes to upgrade transportation infrastructure.  

We read the law and found it does not say what the flier claimed. To the contrary, it lets the proposed tax expire before 10 years are up.

Statute 48-8-245 (b) says the tax ends on the earliest of two dates: after 10 years, or if the state revenue commissioner determines the tax has reached its funding goal. For metro Atlanta, that goal is $7.2 billion, or $8.5 billion over 10 years in today's dollars, according to a June 2011 story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Whether the region reaches its goal ahead of time depends on the economy and how much consumers spend.

Voters must approve any extensions.

Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Debbie Dooley, whose group was not involved in the creation of the handout, said voters might feel that they must continue the tax. The new infrastructure may need costly maintenance. Some projects may go over budget.

Politicians won’t want to give these tax dollars back, Dooley predicted.

""They’ll be back with their hands out in 10 years,"" she said.

Still, the flier needs to be revised to say that voters will decide whether to renew the tax, Dooley said.

We agree. T-SPLOST may indeed survive its 10-year life span, but a zombie tax would be a creature of voters’ own making.

"['Crime', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott said Florida crime rates are at a 40-year low
","
Florida crime rates are at 40-year lows.

Forty-year lows? That’s the kind of dramatic statement that makes fact-checkers sit up and say, ""Really?""

Gov. Rick Scott has made that statement several times when asked about the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford, Fla. His comments seem intended to reassure people that Florida is a safe place to work and live, even while the state investigates the Martin shooting. (See Scott discuss it on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.)

""We are at a 40-year low in our crime rate in our state,"" he said in an April 13, 2012, report from Reuters. ""From a public safety standpoint we are absolutely heading in the right direction.""

Martin died after a resident, George Zimmerman, reported him to 911 as acting suspicious. The operator told Zimmerman not to pursue Martin, but Zimmerman shot Martin a short while later.

Police didn’t arrest Zimmerman, and that angered Martin’s family and others. It also got people talking about Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force when they believe their lives are at risk.

Scott said an official review of the controversial ""stand your ground"" law will begin after the investigation into the shooting itself is complete.

A reader (and Palm Beach Post reporter) on Twitter reported that Scott again said crime rates were at 40-year lows during a forum in West Palm Beach; she asked us to check it out. So we decided to investigate.

Our first stop was with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Crime statistics on the website only go back 11 years, so we contacted the department directly. It provided us with crime statistics from 2010 back to 1971, for a total of 40 years.

The department uses the number of crimes and the population of Florida to calculate crime rates, so different years can be compared. The crime rate shows how many crimes occurred per 100,000 people.

In 1971, the crime rate was 5,668. The rate crept up through the 1970s, peaking in the late 1980s at 8,908. The rate then slowly dropped through the 1990s. In 2000, it dropped below the 1971 mark and continued downward. In 2010, the crime rate reached a new low of 4,105. (See the data for yourself.)

As we dug deeper, we saw that Scott has been touting the statistic since it was first announced by the department almost a year ago.

Do the numbers reflect reality, though? From time to time, there have been allegations that local police haven’t always reported numbers as accurately as they should. We addressed this point in detail in another fact-check. Overall, though, we found no evidence that isolated cases of cheating undermine the larger trend of declining crime rates.

We should also point out that Florida isn’t the only place experiencing historically low crime rates, even during a severe economic recession.

Why are rates declining? Nobody can say for sure.

""I wish we had some really good answers, but we don’t,"" said Ronald L. Akers, a professor of criminology at the University of Florida. ""There have been a number of reasonable hypotheses that fit what we know, but nothing we can really pin down with certainty.""

The theories are highly diverse, and some are fairly controversial, as we noted in previous fact-checks on crime rates.

Here are some of the ideas that have been advanced to explain the lower crime rates: Police are getting better at using technology to prevent crime. More people are in jail and therefore can’t commit crimes. Drug addiction is not as widespread as it once was. Online banking and debit cards mean people don’t have cash at home. Abortions have suppressed the number of poor, unsupervised young men. Low inflation makes stealing non-cash items less attractive. President Barack Obama is setting a positive example for African-American youth. New gun laws establishing the right to carry are deterring criminals. Joblessness means people are at home watching the neighborhood. Extended unemployment benefits and food stamps mean people don’t have to turn to crime. Banning lead paint and leaded gasoline has reduced criminal impulses among young men.

In the case of Scott’s comments, he didn’t get into the causes of the crime rates or claim unearned credit for the trend. Rather, he was pointing out that while individual crimes might receive a great deal of media attention, statistics show that crime rates in Florida are at 40-year lows. The official numbers confirm Scott’s statement.

"['Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott claims 50 election fraud convictions since 2002
","
Texas’ attorney general, Greg Abbott, says he needs the state’s stalled voter identification mandate to ward off fraud at the polls.

When the U.S. Justice Department rejected the Texas voter ID law March 12, 2012, preventing it from taking effect, Abbott issued a press release saying: ""Since 2002 ... election fraud investigations by the Texas Attorney General's Office have resulted in 50 convictions.""

We asked Abbott’s office for backup on his statement, and spokesman Jerry Strickland sent a list of 57 election fraud prosecutions, as well as documents showing how the cases were resolved.

We also asked how many election fraud cases had been referred to the attorney general’s office since 2002. Abbott’s list shows 311 accusations of election fraud spanning 2002-12. The 57 investigations we’re checking represent only those cases that were both prosecuted and resolved.

Six of the prosecutions ended in dismissal or acquittal, Strickland told us by telephone, leaving 51 prosecutions that resulted in convictions.

By our analysis, three-quarters of the cases involved election code violations classified as ""illegal voting"" -- which includes acts such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- and ""method of returning marked ballot,"" often meaning the defendant was accused of having someone else’s ballot.

Only two cases are described as ""voter impersonation"" on the list. Whether voter impersonation is a standing problem has been a hot button in the state’s legislative debates over proposed voter ID laws in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011; Austin American-Statesman news stories say legislators mostly split along party lines, with Democrats claiming impersonation is rare and Republicans claiming the problem is significant. Abbott drew criticism in 2006 for creating a special unit to target voter fraud that by mid-2008 had yielded, according to a May 19, 2008, Associated Press news story, only 26 prosecutions.

Looking at all 57 election fraud prosecutions from 2002 to 2012, we tallied up the resolutions (some had multiple outcomes, when charges were pursued as separate cases): 

For clarification of the middle two categories, we turned to the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, an Austin-based nonprofit that provides continuing legal education and technical assistance to prosecutors.

The group’s executive director, Rob Kepple, told us in an interview that although deferred adjudication falls short of a conviction, he would not consider it a stretch to classify it with the convictions.

In deferred adjudication, Kepple said, the defendant pleads guilty, and then ""the court defers any finding of guilt and places you on probation or community supervision."" If the terms are met, the case is dismissed -- but it remains on the defendant’s record, he said.

This means it can carry the weight of a conviction in later cases, Kepple said. For example, if a person is given deferred adjudication in a domestic violence case and then later is charged again with domestic violence, he said, the adjudication counts as the first offense, making the new charge a second offense.

But a pre-trial diversion is not a conviction, he said. There’s not even necessarily a guilty plea or admission of guilt.

""Basically, they sat down with the defendant and say, ‘Here’s what’s going to happen. You agree not to mess up for 12 months and we’ll just dismiss the case.’ So in no common parlance can this be considered a conviction,"" Kepple said. The case can even be expunged from the defendant’s record, he said.

""There’s no way you can mistake a pre-trial diversion for a conviction, I don’t think.""

We also consulted the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, a group that provides support and education for its members.

Like Kepple, the association’s capital assistance attorney, Rick Wardroup, pointed out via email that the final outcome of a pre-trial diversion or deferred adjudication depends on whether the defendant meets the terms of their probation or supervision.

Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by telephone that the attorney general counts pre-trial diversions as a successful outcome for two main reasons: First, although the defendants do not plead guilty, such agreements are made in order to avoid an expected criminal trial, and second, because the defendant receives a punishment.

After we shared our findings with her, Bean sent us another bit of backup: a section of Texas local government code on court costs that classes deferred adjudication and pre-trial diversions with convictions.

University of Texas law school assistant professor Jennifer Laurin told us via email that clauses like this in state laws indicate the reverse -- they illustrate that these two outcomes are not normally considered convictions. And Kepple said, ""That section is the definition of ‘conviction’ for the purpose of collecting fines and fees. But in common parlance, a deferred prosecution and deferred adjudications simply are not criminal convictions.""

Our ruling

Abbott’s statement refers to 50 ""convictions,"" which he might better have termed ""satisfactory results.""

It looks to us like 60 percent of his cited ""convictions"" were not convictions.

We recognize, though, that our analysis presumes that all the non-convicted defendants fulfilled or will fulfill all terms of the agreements they made to avoid going to trial. That may not be so.

On balance, we rate Abbott’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809767E100>],/factchecks/2012/apr/17/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-claims-50-election-fraud-convictions-2/

Mike Dovilla: Obama's refusal to allow the Keystone Pipeline thwarted ability to reduce gas prices
","Both houses of the Ohio General Assembly approved resolutions in the past 10 months urging Congress to ask Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to approve the controversial TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline project from Alberta to Oklahoma.

The Ohio House acted last June. The Senate passed its resolution in January, as President Obama announced he was putting the project on hold by extending the deadline one year to rule on a permit for pipeline operator TransCanada.

One of the sponsors of House Resolution 97, State Rep. Mike Dovilla, a Republican from Berea who represents the 18th District, wrote to the Strongsville edition of Patch.com that he would introduce a new resolution supporting the pipeline.

Delaying the project hurt U.S. energy security and cost ""the ability to create over 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs,"" he said. Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant ""we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump.""

With the price of gas bubbling under $4 a gallon and becoming a political football, PolitiFact Ohio was interested, immediately, in his statement that permit approval would immediately reduce pump prices. We asked Dovilla's office how he backed it up.

They steered us to the U.S. Energy Information Agency and its statement, ""The single biggest factor in the price of gasoline is the cost of the crude oil from which it is made."" Not approving the pipeline, they said, citing the State Department, would lead to increased imports of oil from unreliable sources, leading to increased speculation that contributes to price fluctuation.

Dovilla quoted a memo of last June 22 from the Department of Energy's deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis, saying that Keystone XL would eliminate transportation constraints. ""Gasoline prices in all markets served by PADD I and III refiners would decrease, including the Midwest,"" the memo said. (PADD stands for Petroleum Administration for Defense District. PADD I is the East Coast, PADD III is the Gulf Coast.)

Supporting Dovilla's statement that prices would drop immediately, his office cited economist and commentator Larry Kudlow, who asserted in 2008 that oil prices dropped more than 6 percent ""on news that President Bush was moving forward with plans to develop new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf despite the fact that the oil would not make it to market for 7 to 10 years.""

""Oil prices,"" Dovilla's spokesman said, ""will react to an announcement regarding future supply long before that supply is actually delivered.""

We looked further. We found that the Department of Energy memo of last June came in response to a paper by energy economist Philip Verleger, an adviser to the Ford and Carter administrations, who heads a Colorado consulting firm on oil market economics. Illuminating the debate among industry analysts about Keystone's likely impact, Verleger says the pipeline would increase gas prices, particularly in the upper Midwest, by about 10 cents per gallon.

The companies involved with Keystone told Canadian regulators that the pipeline will allow Canadians to manipulate prices and add at least $4 billion to the U.S. fuel bill annually, Verleger said. He called Keystone ""a long, torturous way to move crude oil from Canada to China.""

His assessment was echoed in a report in January from the Cornell University Global Labor Institute and by a new study from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group.

Both said that the Keystone XL pipeline is designed to divert heavy crude tar sands oil from the Midwest -- where it has overwhelmed refinery demand and depressed the price of crude -- to Gulf Coast refineries, where much of it can be exported to international markets. They quoted the testimony and studies of TransCanada, the principal company behind the pipeline, in saying that the diversion of heavy crude oil to the Gulf would cut ""discounting"" in the glutted Midwest and bring Canadian oil producers an added $2 billion to $3.9 billion annually.

Our colleagues at the Washington Post's Fact Checker, examining another statement about Keystone XL and gasoline, noted that TransCanada itself makes no claims that the project will reduce prices -- only that it will not increase prices. The company's Keystone XL fact sheet says: ""The price of international oil prices has no impact on the operation of our pipeline and we do not profit from changing market changes,"" TransCanada said. ""Prices are set on a global level.""

Ray Perryman, an economist employed by TransCanada, told Forbes magazine that the pipeline would bring down gasoline prices by 3.5 cents to 4 cents a gallon once fully operational.

Moody's, the investment ratings firm, had a lower estimate: 1.6 cents per gallon.

Even those small reductions would not come until the pipeline was operational, however. The Fact Checker, which was examining the question of whether Keystone XL would lower prices at all, said: ""We could not find any experts to say that the prospect of the pipeline being built in the future would somehow impact the price of gasoline today.""

That would seem to settle the question of whether the pipeline's approval would reduce prices immediately -- except for Dovilla's citation of Larry Kudlow about President Bush influencing prices in 2008. What happened then?

In July 2008, Bush lifted a presidential ban on offshore oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf that was established by his father. It carried symbolic and political significance in an election year, but had no immediate effect on exploration because of prohibitions by Congress against offshore drilling.

Petroleum prices did drop, but they were continuing what was becoming a dramatic retreat from record high prices. Energy analysts and economists pointed to one reason for it: recession.

""Oil markets, analysts said, have been spun around by lower consumption in a U.S. economy weakened by financial instability and by a change in sentiment among financial players, many of whom are scurrying to stem losses or protect much-needed capital,"" the Washington Post reported at the time.

""The overwhelming cause of the collapse in oil prices has been the faltering world economy, which has fueled the drop in consumption,"" the Post reported.

In other words, Bush's announcement was coincidental but not causative.

Energy analyst Joseph M. Dukert, senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former president of the U.S. Association for Energy Economics, expressed it more plainly to the liberal research group Media Matters when it looked at a similar claim:

""Most energy economists applauded President Bush's action in regard to offshore drilling,"" he said, ""but suggesting that this 'caused' the precipitous drop in global oil prices is akin to the rooster's boast that his crowing brought the sun up.""

Even former Bush White House chief economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin discounted a president's impact on oil prices: ""You can‘t change the oil price very much with the U.S. exploration. It certainly can‘t change it quickly,"" he said in a television discussion.

And that returns us to the statement that Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant ""we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump.""

We found debate among oil analysts over the effect the pipeline would have on gasoline prices, especially in the Midwest, where some expect it would drive prices up. And while estimates varied, our research (and that by our colleagues at the Washington Post) found that those experts didn’t expect there would a price impact until after the pipeline were built. Even TransCanada, the company behind the pipeline, expressed doubts about any price impact, and an economist with the company projected that wouldn’t happen until after the line was operational.

That’s a far cry from Dovilla’s claim of immediacy.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Dovilla’s claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB5540>],/factchecks/2012/apr/17/mike-dovilla/mike-dovilla-claims-obamas-refusal-allow-keystone-/

Roger Williams says CBO forecasts Obamacare will cost U.S. 800,000 jobs
","
Republican U.S House candidate Roger Williams of Texas promises to ""end the fraud of Obamacare"" in a mailer to Austin-area voters we spotted April 11, 2012.

His mailer lists among promises broken by President Obama the notion that the 2010 overhaul of health care laws would create jobs. Under ""Promise Broken,"" the mailer says: ""The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs.""

Really?

Williams’  footnoted backup was a Feb. 11, 2011, blog post on AmericanThinker.com saying that Doug Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, had just testified to the House Budget Committee that as of 2020-21, the law was projected to reduce U.S. employment by 800,000.

PolitiFact researchers have explored this testimony and topic before, most recently for a June 2011 Truth-O-Meter article after U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann said in a Republican presidential debate: ""The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs. What could the president be thinking by passing a bill like this, knowing full well it will kill 800,000 jobs?""

Broadly, the projection is open to misinterpretation.

The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will affect the federal budget and the economy. And in August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the just-approved health care law.
   
While the CBO had determined the law would reduce ""the amount of labor used in the economy,"" that was not the same as concluding that 800,000 jobs would be shed.

Let’s begin with the negative effects the health care law could have on employment.

The law was expected to cost some employers money, particularly large ones. Under its provisions, employers aren't required to offer insurance, yet if they don't and their workers make low wages and qualify for tax credits to buy insurance, then the employers will have to pay a fine. (This part of the law takes effect in 2014.) Even so, the CBO has said, fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most.
   
The CBO also projected the effects to be somewhat limited. ""To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced,"" the CBO said in its report. ""It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives.""
   
Still, that's not where the 800,000 jobs number comes from. It primarily comes from workers who choose not to work because they no longer have to work at jobs just to keep their health coverage.

Here's how the CBO put it:
       
""The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law.""
       
Basically, the CBO was saying that that once some people working mostly to keep their health insurance have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a ""small segment"" of the population, about half a percent of the labor force.
       
Notably, the CBO doesn't use the 800,000 jobs number in its report; critics of the law have extrapolated that number by calculating what half a percent of the workforce equals. Then again, as noted, then-CBO director Douglas Elmendorf confirmed that number in his February 2011 testimony.       
       
Elmendorf also explained, though, that the number was an extrapolation, and might not be precise. He said: ""That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers.
       
""In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ...""
       
The CBO report also noted that the health care law could actually help economic productivity: ""To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced. It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives.""
       
PolitiFact rated Bachmann’s claim -- that the law ""will kill 800,000 jobs"" -- Mostly False because it exaggerated the CBO’s conclusions in a misleading fashion and included no qualifiers.

When we inquired, a CBO staff spokeswoman, Deborah Kilroe, had no comment on the earlier PolitiFact analysis. Kilroe did say the CBO had done no additional analyses of projected reductions in employment due to the 2010 law.

Our ruling

The CBO says there could be the equivalent of 800,000 fewer workers in connection with Obamacare, the changes in federal health-care laws ushered into place by Obama.

But these changes would not be due to employers not hiring workers. Rather, such results were predicted primarily because workers wouldn't have to work because health care coverage would be expanded. People working mostly for health insurance would either reduce their hours or leave the job market altogether. There could also be more economic productivity because of the health care law.

We rate Williams’ claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B6880>],/factchecks/2012/apr/17/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-cbo-forecasts-obamacare-will-c/
