Ad: Nevada is No. 1 in unemployment, violent crime, car theft, divorce, robberies and foreclosures
","
""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"" is a common advertising slogan for Las Vegas. And those who oppose the introduction of mega-casinos in Florida say they want those casinos -- and the problems in Nevada -- to stay there. 
In a ""Leave it in Vegas"" television ad that launched Jan. 19, 2012, the group No Casinos claims that Nevada is No. 1 in lots of rankings -- and not in a good way. Set to sinister music, the ad states:

""Big gambling . . .  
They Say Florida's the Next Vegas.
That Nevada's Number One . . .
And its true.
No. 1 in Unemployment.
No. 1 in Violent Crime.
In Car Theft.
Divorce . . .
In Robberies.
No. 1 in Foreclosures.
What happens in Vegas Should Stay in Vegas.
Tell Our Elected Officials: Keep Big Gambling Out of Florida.""

The ad packs an emotional punch with photos of what appears to be a homeless man huddling under a blanket, a jail cell, the flashing lights of a squad car and a for sale/foreclosure sign by a house.

We checked some similar claims about Nevada in the past by the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce -- a group that opposes casino expansion. But the new ad by No Casinos includes two additional claims about Nevada -- car theft and robberies -- and it started airing during the state legislative session, in the heat of the debate about whether to pass a bill to allow casino resorts.

No Casinos pointed us to a document from CQ Press that compares states on multiple rankings and is based on data from the census, Small Business Administration, FBI and administrative office of the U.S. courts. The document is the most recent version of the state ranking book, said Dan Gelber, South Florida chairman of No Casinos.

Unemployment: Nevada’s unemployment rate was 13 percent in November 2011 -- placing it at No. 1 among states, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Crime: For the statistics about violent crime, car theft and robberies we turned to the FBI’s 2010 statistics which show the rate per 100,000 people. (The 2011 data is still preliminary.) Nevada’s violent crime rate was second highest in the country behind the District of Columbia. Nevada's rate for robberies was third, behind D.C. and Delaware. The rate for car theft was third, behind California and Washington state. (The District of Columbia isn’t a state so we won’t hold that one against No Casinos.)

The CQ data cited by No Casinos was for 2009. It showed Nevada at No. 1 for violent crime, robberies and car theft. That data showed Florida at No. 8 for violent crime, no. 6 for robberies and 14th for car theft.

Foreclosures: RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, showed Nevada at the highest in the country for December 2011 with one foreclosure for every 177 homes.

Divorce: CQ used 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate among states reporting (6.7 per 1,000 population) -- and Florida was 9th. We corroborated the data through the National Center.
  
We should note that six states did not collect information for 2009. Center spokesman Jeffrey Lancashire said the group no longer collects detailed divorce data because not all the states collect the information.

The Census also measures marital status rates for each state. The census shows that Nevada had a divorce rate of 12.3 percent for males and 14.6 percent for females between 2005 and 2007. According to the census, Wyoming had a slightly higher rate of divorced males -- 12.6 percent -- but Nevada was No. 1 for divorced females.
  
Another product created by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2010 American Community Survey showed that Nevada had a 12.4 percent divorce rate for women -- placing it in a tie for 9th place with Tennessee -- and a 14 percent divorce rate for men -- ranking it first.
  
Nevada vs. Florida 
We won't address whether gambling is to blame for these indicators. But it's important to note some differences between Nevada and Florida.  
As of mid-January there were conflicting proposals of what a casino expansion would look like in Florida: Some legislators wanted a limit to three casinos, while others wanted to allow Las Vegas-style slot machines in every horse and dog track and jai-alai fronton in the state. But while Las Vegas’ economy is heavily dependent on casinos, Florida already has a diverse tourist economy.

David G. Schwartz, a professor at the University of Nevada, said that the current high unemployment in Nevada is due to declines in gaming and construction and ""most of the foreclosures aren't because of people who live here gambling away their mortgages, they’re because investors got caught up in a bubble....""
   
Dean Gerstein, principal investigator in a major federal study of gambling in the 1990s, said the influx of visitors to Vegas makes statistics for the state difficult to compare to elsewhere.

""Florida is a very populous state, in contrast to Nevada, and it already has a very large tourism industry, most of which has nothing to do with gambling.  So there’s a generic sense in which what might be big in Nevada, for good or ill, cannot possibly be as big in Florida,"" Gerstein wrote in an email.

The goal of the ad here is to show that Las Vegas -- a city famous for casinos -- is in a state with high rates of crime, unemployment and divorce. Florida is now considering whether to allow mega casino resorts but it already suffers from troubling rankings in some of these areas -- fifth in foreclosures and tied for fifth in unemployment, for example. 

Our ruling

No Casinos said Nevada is No. 1 in unemployment, violent crime, car theft, divorce, robberies and foreclosures. Nevada is at the top for unemployment, divorce and foreclosures. Based on 2009 data, Nevada was at the top for the crime measures, but 2010 data showed the state was near the top, but not no. 1.  We rate this claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2012/jan/26/no-casinos/nevada-no-1-unemployment-violent-crime-car-theft-d/
"['National', 'Jobs', 'Mitch Daniels']","
Mitch Daniels says Steve Jobs created more jobs than the stimulus
","
Did Apple founder Steve Jobs do more to boost American employment than the $800 billion federal stimulus program?

In the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said just that.

""Contrary to the president's constant disparagement of people in business, it's one of the noblest of human pursuits. The late Steve Jobs -- what a fitting name he had -- created more of them than all those stimulus dollars the president borrowed and blew.""

Many readers suggested that we check this comparison. First we’ll look at jobs numbers for both Apple and the stimulus, then we’ll discuss whether this comparison is valid.

Apple

Apple, the iconic technology company, was started in 1973. According to its 2011 SEC filing, Apple now employs about 60,000 people, 43,000 of whom work in the United States. Its contractors add another 700,000 to its overall workforce, but few of them work in the U.S.

Daniels didn’t specify in his speech if he was including overseas jobs. But we aren’t in this analysis.

So the job tally for Jobs stands at 43,000.

The stimulus

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed Congress along party lines and was signed by Obama in early 2009. Its purpose was to save and create jobs immediately. How well the program worked in jump-starting employment is a matter of great controversy.

Numerous Republicans have said the stimulus created zero jobs, a claim we rated Pants on Fire.

In this case, we’ll rely on the same figures we have in the past, which come from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.

In this report (see the chart on page 3), the CBO provides high and low estimates for how the stimulus affected the number of people employed and how many jobs it generated. Bear in mind, some of those were temporary jobs (such as work on construction projects) that came and went. On the other hand, jobs that were created and still existed year after year were counted in each year’s totals.

That said, the CBO report credits the stimulus with creating between 900,000 and 4.7 million jobs in 2010 and between 600,000 and 3.6 million in 2011. It projects between 200,000 and 1.3 million jobs will be created in 2012.

We’ve also looked at estimates by other private analysis.

IMH/Global Insight estimated that 1.25 million jobs were created or saved by the end of 2009, 2.45 million were created or saved by the end of 2010, and 1.97 million were created or saved by the end of 2011.

Macroeconomic Advisers projects 2.1 million jobs will be created or saved through early 2012. Moody’s economy.com put the peak of the employment impact in the third quarter of 2010, when the stimulus was responsible for an additional 2.5 million jobs.

This report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, released in July, estimates the Recovery Act ""raised employment by 2.4 to 3.6 million jobs relative to what it otherwise would have been.""

Of all these studies, the single lowest estimate -- CBO’s -- was 1.5 million jobs through the end of 2011.

So based on the raw numbers, the stimulus created about 35 times as many jobs as Apple did. Even the CBO’s lowest estimate of jobs created in a single quarter (200,000 in the second quarter of 2009, right after the law was passed) is more than four times larger than Apple’s current workforce.

""Daniels is not in the ballpark,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Beyond the numbers

But there are issues that complicate any Apple-stimulus comparison.

Bruce Bartlett, a economist and former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, calls it an ""apples and oranges comparison.""

Here are some of the issues raise by Bartlett and other economists:

• The job figures for Apple’s full-time U.S. staff are solid, but the stimulus job statistics are only estimates.

J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, discounts the stimulus job estimates and says ""no one knows, or will ever know"" how many it created. ""In my view, the best one could hope for is that the stimulus did not destroy any jobs, on net,"" Foster said in an email.

• It’s difficult to gauge the indirect impact of Apple on jobs created among suppliers -- or jobs lost by companies that faced competition from Apple.

On the upside, for every U.S. staff job at Apple, some number of additional full- or part-time jobs has been created indirectly, from freelance app designers to short-order cooks in restaurants near Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Estimating how many additional jobs owe their existence to Apple is tricky, but it’s likely a substantial number, making Apple’s actual job footprint bigger than the 43,000 jobs cited above.

Although Daniels' office didn't respond to our request for back-up for his statement, Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for Daniels, told CNNMoney: ""Between Apple and its suppliers, there are hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been created and sustained over years and years ... Meanwhile, a number of credible economists, including Robert Barro of Harvard have questioned whether the stimulus created any net new jobs; if they did, the jobs were temporary and disappeared as the stimulus money ended.""

On the other hand, as Apple has grown, some new jobs have come at the expense of its competitors. As the iPhone took off, did Motorola fire workers when its phone sales slipped? The aggregate loss among competitors is hard to calculate, but it’s likely not a trivial number. And the number is one that should be considered if a full comparison is desired.

""Once you look at what Apple's success does to competitors, then you must eventually conclude that all job creation is a zero-sum game, which bodes ill for unemployment,"" Foster said.

• Apple is a company that created jobs continuously over 30 years, while the stimulus was a government program that was largely over within a couple years.

It’s not clear whether a 30-year, ongoing business concern should be compared directly to a two- to three-year federal program. There are too many differences in scope, duration and mission.

Even so, Foster argues that Daniels’ comparison is valid. ""There's nothing wrong with comparing a company to a nation,"" he said. ""Nationally, jobs are created and destroyed. Even within Apple, not every division grew monotonically. They fired people, and hired them. It's not a common comparison, but that's what makes it interesting and still valid.""

Other economists, including Gary Burtless, an economist for the Brookings Institution, suggest that Daniels’ comparison is speculative at best, and incorrect at worst.

""Perhaps if we assume there were large spillover effects of Apple employees’ consumption and Apple supplier contracts on U.S.-based employment, we might reach an estimated impact of Apple that reaches or exceeds the stimulus total,"" Burtless said. ""On the other hand, some of Apple’s success has come at the expense of competitors who have shrunk, disappeared, or grown more slowly than would have been the case if Apple had not been founded. No one knows the number of people who lost their jobs or failed to find jobs in those competing companies as a result of Apple’s existence, but it is likely to represent a sizeable percentage -- far more than half -- of the employees that Apple hired or caused to be hired by its suppliers within the United States.""

Our ruling

There’s no question that the lack of information -- particularly about Apple’s indirect impact on jobs and how many jobs were lost at its competitors -- weakens how certain we can be about the exact numbers. There’s also a more fundamental question of whether it’s fair to compare Apple (an ongoing business) to the stimulus (a short-term federal program). 
But even if you were to assume that Apple's net impact on job creation was five times the 43,000 jobs the company listed in its SEC report, that would still be just one-seventh of the lowest estimate of jobs created by the stimulus. The ""hundreds of thousands"" of additional jobs from Apple and related companies, cited by Daniels' spokeswoman, also falls far short of the most cautious estimates of the stimulus by a large margin. 
In addition to the huge discrepancy in the numbers, one of the principles of the Truth-O-Meter is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. We will try to verify their statements, but we believe the burden of proof is on the person making the statement. In this case, the best we have from Daniels' staff is a vague extrapolation that Apple created ""hundreds of thousands"" of jobs. We rate Daniels’ statement False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/26/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-steve-jobs-created-more-jobs-st/

Rush Holt says 18 veterans commit suicide daily
","
If the number of U.S. troops killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars isn’t startling enough, there’s another military statistic that has a New Jersey congressman outraged.

""Before this day is out, 18  more veterans will have taken their own lives,"" Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th) said in a December press release. ""That is the daily average, it is intolerable, and it has to stop.""

That would mean 126 veterans every week or 6,570 every year, across the nation. As shocking as that might seem, Holt’s statistic is accurate, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

The statistic was confirmed in a Dec. 15, 2007 email exchange between Dr. Ira R. Katz, deputy chief officer of Mental Health Services at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and Dr. Michael J. Kussman, then the under secretary for health at the Veterans Health Administration, which is part of the VA.

The statistic was cited in a CBS News investigation that revealed 6,200 veterans committed suicide in 2005.

When Kussman, a retired Army brigaider general, asked Katz in an email if reports by a media organization about the statistic were accurate, Katz responded: ""There are about 18 suicides per day among America’s 25 million veterans. This follows from CDC (Centers for Disease Control) findings that 20% of suicides are among veterans. It is supported by the CBS numbers. VA’s own data demonstrates 4-5 suicides per day among those who receive care from us.""

Holt spokesman Thomas Seay referred us to a U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit opinion from May 10, 2011 that cites the same statistic from Katz. The opinion criticized the VA’s handling and processing of claims and benefits for veterans in a lawsuit brought by two nonprofit veterans groups against the VA, several of its officials and the federal government.

The VA said in an emailed statement that the actual numbers of veteran suicides isn’t known, but considers the statistic of an average of 18 per day its best estimate.

Limited data is an issue, Seay said.

""Some efforts are underway to improve data collection, particularly as relates to the effectiveness of specific interventions:  for example, the Vet2Vet program run out of UMDNJ in Piscataway is working hard to measure the impact of its counseling services,"" Seay said in an email. "" Even so, better national data would help to guide better policy.""

Suicide factors for veterans are similar to those for nonveterans, said Jeremy Willinger, director of communications and marketing for the Mental Health Association of New York City.

""In the general population, suicide risk factors include male gender, older age, diminished support (e.g. homelessness or unmarried status), availability of firearms, and co-occurring physical and mental conditions,"" Willinger said in an email. ""This profile describes a large portion of the veteran population.

""Nearly 50 percent of military suicides in 2010 occurred at the hands of privately-owned weapons,"" Willinger added.

Bob Handy, chairman of California-based Veterans United For Truth, one of the suit’s plaintiffs, said 18 veteran suicides a day is accurate but believes the number might be low ""because that’s veterans involved with the Veterans Administration.""

""When we filed our lawsuit on June 23, 2007 until the end of last year there were 29,000 veterans who had killed themselves,"" said Handy, a Korea and Vietnam veteran.

""If a veteran’s family or the veteran himself felt like he or she was thinking of taking his own life pick up the telephone and call 9-1-1 or the appropriate medical people and not necessarily wait for the VA to call them back,"" he added.

Our ruling

In announcing Congressional approval of $40 million that he sought to support suicide prevention programs for the military, Holt in a December press release said an average of 18 veterans commit suicide daily. The VA said that figure is the best estimate it has. A U.S. Court of Appeals  opinion as well as email exchanges between VA officials and a statistical analysis undertaken by a national news network all cite that statistic. We rate the claim True.

McEachin says Gov. McDonnell's budget cuts public education
","
New dollars are scarce at the state capitol and politicians are positioning for a fight this winter over the amount of money that will be sent to public schools.

Democrats are complaining that Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, stiffed education in a two-year state spending plan he submitted to the General Assembly last month.

""Overall in this, his first budget, the governor is cutting pre-K and K-through-12 education by hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said Jan. 11 in the Democratic response to McDonnell’s State of the Commonwealth address.

Is the governor really calling on lawmakers to reduce public school funding in the biennial budget that starts July 1? (We’ll explore McEachin’s claim that pre-kindergarten programs are also being cut at a later date).

Let’s start with some basic math. McDonnell has asked the General Assembly to spend $13.1 billion on public education during the two-year budget cycle that begins July 1. The current biennial budget, which ends June 30, allots $12.6 billion to schools.

So that leaves about a $500 million increase. McDonnell’s office says the exact increase is $497.2 million.

How did McEachin conclude the governor is ""cutting"" public education? Our calls to him were referred to the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus. We spoke to two officials: Steve Pazmino, the executive director, and Katie Mulhall, the press secretary. They told us the bottom-line state budget numbers are misleading.

What throws everything off, they said, is McDonnell’s proposal to inject a record $2.2 billion into the ailing state pension during the coming two-year budget cycle. Of that money, $600 million would go state workers’ retirement plan and Virginia government would pay for that.

The remaining $1.6 billion would go to teacher pensions with localities kicking in $1 billion and the state paying $600 million. The state’s share would be a $342 million increase over what it is contributing to teacher pensions during the current two-year budget cycle. It would account for the lion’s share of McDonnell’s $497 million boost to the state’s biennial public education budget. So most of the new money the governor is seeking, as Pazmino and Mulhall point out, would be invested in pensions, not classrooms.

Even so, there would remain $155 million in new state education money not earmarked for pensions. The bottom-line state allocation to schools, even if we don’t count the increased contribution to teacher pensions, would still go up under McDonnell’s plan.

But these calculations, the Democratic officials told us, form the periphery of McEachin’s contention that the governor’s budget would cut school spending. Let’s go to the core.

Funding public schools is a collaborative effort, with roughly 50 percent of the money coming from localities, 40 percent from the state, and 10 percent from the federal government.  Pazmino told us McEachin based his statement on his belief that cash-strapped localities would be forced to slash their spending on classroom instruction to pay their $1 billion bill for teacher pensions over the next two budget years.

Localities are paying a collective $472 million for teacher pensions during the current budget biennium, according to the Virginia Retirement System.   

""School boards all across the state are screaming and they’re not saying, ‘We’re getting more money,’"" Pazmino said. ""They’re all saying that this thing equals cuts.""

Pazmino sent us about a dozen news articles quoting local school officials across the state saying the pension contributions will create shortfalls in their budgets. The predictions came from educators in Virginia Beach, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, Waynesboro, Roanoke, Staunton and Suffolk. They said the slight increase in state funds their school systems might receive under McDonnell’s proposal would be dwarfed by increased pension payments. Several officials raised the possibility of teacher layoffs or tax increases to balance their budgets.  

Officials at the the Virginia Association of School Superintendents say they recently surveyed 85 of Virginia’s 132 local school divisions and found ""more than 90 percent of them"" were anticipating ""significant shortfalls based on the governor’s budget.""

Locally, Hanover County public schools estimate McDonnell’s budget would increase its pension contribution by $5.8 million while adding only $1.6 million is state aid. Chesterfield County schools would see a $3.1 million rise in state aid while paying $16.7 million more for teacher pensions. Richmond schools estimate paying $8.2 million more in pension contributions next year and the loss of $985,300 in state aid. Henrico County, an anomaly in this debate, would pay $13.4 million more for pensions next year, but receive $14.1 million more in state aid.

Our ruling:

McEachin, speaking on behalf of Democrats in the General Assembly, accused the governor of ""cutting"" education funding in his proposed two-year state budget.

The math doesn’t work for the Democrats here, as the net increase in state funding to public schools would be $497 million under McDonnell’s plan. McEachin and other Democrats point out that most of the money would go to teacher pensions, not classroom instruction. But even if you subtract the pension payments, McDonnell’s budget would increase state spending on public education by $155 million.

That gain, Democrats speaking for McEachin argue, would be more than wiped out by new demands the governor’s budget would impose on local school districts. McDonnell’s plan  would require city and county school systems to spend about $530 million more on teacher pensions during the next two years then they did in the past biennium. To comply, McEachin says localities would be forced to cut their education budgets.

McEachin is mistaken. Teacher pensions are already part of local school budgets. Increased retirement payments would not cause the bottom lines of local education budgets to fall. To the contrary, each locality would have to decide how to pay for a rising expense.

Democrats, speaking for McEachin, say the only realistic option for cities and counties would be to cut other education programs and many may go in that direction. But there are options: some municipalities could decide to raise taxes; others might opt to increase their school budgets by reducing spending for non-education services.

No doubt, McDonnell’s budget would force most localities to adjust priorities.  But it does not cut the overall state appropriation to public education nor the revenues localities use to pay their share for schools.

We rate McEachin’s statement False.

Barack Obama campaign says U.S. dependence on foreign oil now below 50 percent
","
Good news, America: The country is no longer importing the majority of oil it needs.

You might have heard about this from a television commercial sponsored by President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign, the first commercial the president’s team has run in the 2012 race.  Obama for America launched the ad Jan. 18 in Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Virginia, Wisconsin and North Carolina.
   
""For the first time in 13 years, our dependence on foreign oil is below 50 percent,"" the announcer says on the ad.

Obama repeated the claim Jan. 24 in his State of the Union address, too.
       
In the ad, the Obama team listed its source right on the screen: The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in a report dated May 25, 2011. Since the ad was placed in Ohio and we have to fill our gas tanks like nearly everyone else, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the facts.

About the ad: It wasn’t only about oil. It also touched on ""secretive oil billionaires attacking President Obama"" -- a reference to ads placed by an outside group, Americans for Prosperity, backed by billionaires David and Charles Koch. The Obama reelection ad also mentioned Obama’s ""unprecedented record on ethics,"" and this country’s expanding clean-energy industry.

Other fact-checkers have weighed in on some of these already, with FactCheck.org noting that some of the 2.7 million jobs in the clean-energy sector (a boast on the screen) were gained long before Obama took office, although his policies have added to the gains. The president’s commercial cited PolitiFact as its source for saying that Obama ""kept his promise to strengthen ethics rules,"" but the ad failed to mention that PolitiFact later gave a ""Promise Broken"" rating to a related ethics promise, concerning lobbying and the revolving door for former government officials.

But what about the oil?

The Obama campaign is correct that U.S. oil dependence is below 50 percent. According to his own source, the energy administration, it was 49.3 percent in 2010. That’s down from a high of 60.3 percent in 2005.

There are several ways to measure foreign oil dependency, the agency adds, and some of the other measures also show a decline but still have U.S. dependence above 50 percent. But we are writing for the general public, not petroleum engineers and economists, and the energy agency itself, staffed by professional analysts, not politicians, certainly includes the broadest measure (net crude and oil product imports as a share of U.S. total demand).

Yet this decline in dependence has occurred since 2005. Team Obama is correct in saying dependence only recently -- in 2010 -- fell below 50 percent, but the commercial suggests that the current president deserves credit. The problem with that is apparent when looking at the year--to-year drop, because it mirrors the recession, with the biggest annual decline in 2009.

Yes, Obama was president then, serving in his first year. But we’ll let his own source, the energy agency, speak to this. As it says in the very report cited in the commercial:

""This decline partly reflects the downturn in the underlying economy after the financial crisis of 2008. Not surprisingly, demand has bounced back somewhat from a low of 18.8 million barrels per day in 2009, when the U.S. economy bottomed out. But the downward trend in consumption started two years before the 2008 crisis and reflects factors such as changes in efficiency and consumer behavior as well as patterns of economic growth.""

These other factors include increases in domestic biofuels production, natural gas liquids and refinery gains, as well as growth in ethanol production that helped displace traditional hydrocarbon fuels and reduced the need for petroleum imports.

And then there were ""strong gains in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken formation,""  ending decades of contraction in domestic oil production.

In fact, domestic crude oil production is expected to grow by more than 20 percent in the next decade, according to the energy administration’s latest annual outlook, that was released Jan. 23. Domestic crude oil production should reach a level in 2020 not seen since 1994, the report says.

But as PolitiFact has reported before, deep-water production comes after years of exploration and preparation. It does not happen over night and gains made during Obama’s term so far have roots in previous administrations and economic difficulties that have had factories and households paring back.

So does that mean Obama deserves no credit at all?

Well, no.

The energy agency says it expects moderating trends in import reliance to continue even as the economy improves and consumption rises. Energy efficiency, ""driven in part by tighter fuel economy standards, will prove increasingly important,"" the report says. And Obama has, in fact, promoted fuel efficiency, alternative fuels and even offshore drilling, though not as broadly as the energy industry would like.

In its new annual report, issued Jan. 23, the energy administration said that the United States will produce far more natural gas and oil by 2035, reducing imports to 36 percent of liquid fuels. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, said that’s great -- but falls short of what could occur with different regulations and policies.

That’s a debate for the industry and environmentalists. We’re sticking with the facts, and the fact is that part of Obama’s claim is correct: Our dependence on foreign oil is below 50 percent.

But fully evaluating the accuracy of the claim also means looking at the context in which it is made.

Obama clearly claims credit in the commercial; and his own source for the claim makes clear that a number of factors, including the poor economy and gains from drilling -- which began before his administration -- are among them.

These are important details. Without them, the claim in the ad -- made specifically to boast of Obama’s accomplishments -- lacks context. And when factually accurate claims leave out such important context, the Truth-O-Meter’s dial turns to Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-campaign-says-us-dependence-foreign-o/

Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee says the InterLink at T.F. Green Airport is the closest air-rail link in the country
","
One of the key selling points of the new $267-million InterLink at T.F. Green Airport is the easy access it gives passengers coming in by rail to get to their flights.

Because of the intermodal transportation hub that was largely completed in 2010, they can simply hop on a train, get off at the airport’s rail station, and travel a mere 1,570 feet on moving walkways into the terminal.

At a news conference at T.F. Green on Jan. 11, Governor Lincoln Chafee, a longtime champion of the project, called it ""the closest air-rail link in the country,"" according to a story in The Journal.

He was repeating a claim that has been made in various ways by numerous state officials and agencies, including Warwick Mayor Scott Avedesian, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation and the Federal Highway Administration. Most used the superlative ""closest."" 

A PolitiFact Rhode Island reader asked us to check out Chafee’s claim, noting that he had visited several airports that seemed to have closer rail links.

Because we had a request -- and because taxpayers footed most of the $267-million bill for the InterLink -- we decided to get to the bottom of it.

We called T.F. Green, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and Chafee’s office to see if any studies had been done that could answer the question.

While we waited for answers, we found a number of online railroad and airport forums with discussions of this very topic. Although none had clear-cut answers, they included anecdotal information that we used as a jumping-off point.

From that start, we put together a partial list of airports with rail connections. They include Hopkins International Airport, in Cleveland, which in 1968 became the first airport in the country to be connected to a commuter rail system; and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which is connected to a light rail commuter system.

Other major airports also have commuter rail links, including Reagan National Airport, in Washington, D.C., Chicago Midway International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

We also found that Philadelphia International Airport has multiple rail stops that are very close to its terminals.

The rail line bisects the airport, with the terminals on one side and baggage claim areas and parking facilities on the other, according to a map of the complex.

Victoria Lupica, spokeswoman for the airport, said that passengers who get off at any of the airport stations can get into the terminals by riding an escalator one floor up.

""The airport line was designed so you can get off the train and go directly into the airport,"" she said.

We couldn’t find any measurements of the distances from the train stops to the terminals, so we asked Lupica how long it takes to get from one of the platforms into the airport.

""Thirty seconds,"" said Lupica, who rides the train daily. ""You literally get off the train and walk into the building.

While we continued our search, we heard from Dana Alexander Nolfe, a spokeswoman for the DOT, and Patti Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Airport Corporation.

Nolfe said T.F. Green’s InterLink should accurately be called ""the closest air-to-Amtrak rail line in the country.""

""We do not have the closest air-to-commuter rail line in the country,"" she said.

Goldstein agreed and said the Amtrak claim was first made in 1998 at a news conference attended by then-Warwick Mayor Lincoln Chafee, Governor Almond and officials from the Federal Railroad Administration. She gave us subsequent published references to the distance to the rail line made by Chafee (1,200 feet) and former Governor Bruce Sundlun (1,170 feet).

Meanwhile, we heard that Bob Hope Airport, in Burbank, Calif. also has a nearby rail line that serves both commuter trains and Amtrak. There are stops for the two train services outside the airport.

We asked Victor Gill, a spokesman for that airport, how far the Amtrak line is from the closest terminal and he estimated the distance at 300 yards, or 900 feet.

We checked for ourselves on Google Maps and found that the walking distance from the Amtrak station to Terminal B is about 1,056 feet and from the station to Terminal A is about 1,584 feet. The rail line itself is literally across the street from a runway on the southwest side of the airport.

Our ruling

Governor Chafee said the T.F. Green InterLink is the closest air-rail link in the country. Whether he meant closest commuter link or closest Amtrak link, he’s wrong.

Several major airports have closer commuter links, including some that run adjacent to or through their terminals.

And Burbank’s Bob Hope Airport is closer to an Amtrak line. Plus, it has something T.F. Green does not: an actual Amtrak station.

Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor does indeed pass near T.F. Green, but Amtrak trains do not stop at the InterLink. Only commuter trains that are operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority -- and use the Amtrak line -- do.

Officials have talked of having Amtrak trains stop at the InterLink eventually, but it hasn’t happened yet. So at this point it seems irrelevant that the airport is so close to the Amtrak rail line.

We rule Chafee’s statement False.

Was Mitt Romney 'one of the first' to endorse Marco Rubio?
","
The battle for Hispanic voters in the Republican primary is turning ugly, and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is trying to tamp down some of the rancor.

Rubio stepped in when Newt Gingrich went so far as to compare Republican rival Mitt Romney with -- prepare yourselves! -- Charlie Crist.

""We discovered last night that Mitt Romney has picked up Charlie Crist's campaign people,"" said Gingrich at a campaign stop in St. Petersburg on Jan. 24, 2012. ""That sort of tells you everything you needed to know about this contest.""

Gingrich’s mention of Crist drew yelps and boos from the crowd at the Tick Tock Restaurant. Florida Republicans remember well that Crist left the party in 2010 to run as an independent for the U.S. Senate.

The race between Gingrich and Romney has been inflamed by Spanish-language radio ads, web ads on the Drudge Report website and news reports on the conservative website Newsmax that said Romney was using Crist’s former campaign staff.

Rubio was concerned enough about the attacks that he released a statement the same day. (Rubio has said he will not endorse in the race.)

""Mitt Romney is no Charlie Crist,"" Rubio said. ""Romney is a conservative, and he was one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me. He came to Florida, campaigned hard for me and made a real difference in my race.""

Rubio’s comments caught our attention, because our memory was that Romney endorsed relatively late in the race for U.S. Senate. We decided to dig into the archives to see if Romney was in fact ""one of the first national Republican leaders"" to endorse Rubio.

To understand the full web of endorsements at work here, we’ll go back to the Republican presidential primary of 2008. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was then challenging U.S. Sen. John McCain and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for the nomination.

In that race, Rubio endorsed Huckabee relatively early, in 2007. (Rubio was then speaker of the Florida House.)

Crist, meanwhile, waited until just before the Florida primary in early 2008 to endorse McCain. McCain beat Romney in Florida and went on to win the nomination.

In 2009, Rubio was widely considered a long-shot against Crist for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Party leadership got behind Crist early that year, while Rubio secured early endorsements from Huckabee and U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a tea party favorite.

Rubio built up his campaign through 2009. By spring of 2010, Rubio gained endorsements from former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.

In March 2010, Romney was on book tour in Florida and was asked regularly about endorsing in the Crist-Rubio race. Romney said several times that he was undecided and generally didn’t endorse in primaries.

By April, though, Crist’s campaign was in serious trouble. Polls showed he would likely lose. Crist further angered Republicans with a veto of a bill limiting teachers tenure on April 15.

The news broke the next day that Romney was endorsing Rubio, and the official endorsement came April 19.

When he made his endorsement, Romney was certain enough of Rubio’s position in the primary that he publicly urged Crist to stay in the Republican Party and accept a loss.

Rubio went on to a decisive victory over Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek.

We contacted representatives for both Romney and Rubio about this fact-check. Rubio’s staff said his comments spoke for themselves. The Romney campaign sent us the following statement:

""Sen. Marco Rubio is an outstanding advocate for fiscal responsibility and a principled voice for conservative values in the United States Senate. Gov. Romney was proud to support Senator Rubio in 2010 and honored to have campaigned with him across Florida.""

Our ruling

Rubio said that Romney was ""one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me."" Romney did endorse Rubio before Crist dropped out of the primary in 2010. But it was clear at the time that Rubio would have thumped Crist in a primary if Crist hadn’t dropped out.

The main point of Rubio’s comments was to lower the temperature in the Republican race. But it bears noting that Romney’s endorsement of Rubio was something less than a pioneering stand.

Spanish-language ad says Newt Gingrich said Spanish is ""the language of the ghetto""
","
Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are attacking each other on all fronts in Florida ahead of the Jan. 31, 2012, primary -- including en Español.

In one Spanish-language radio ad, Gingrich calls Romney ""anti-immigrant."" (The Gingrich campaign said it was pulling the ad on Jan. 25, 2012, after Sen. Marco Rubio said it was unfair and not true.)

In a rebuttal, Romney attacks Gingrich on radio as not being the Ronald Reagan conservative Gingrich claims. Romney also says that Gingrich said ""Spanish is the language of the ghetto."" Here’s a partial transcript of the ad, which is airing in South Florida (translation courtesy of Patricia Mazzei of the Miami Herald):

""Gingrich enriched himself with Freddie Mac, one of the principle companies responsible for the mortgage collapse that has caused so much damage in our community. Reagan would have never joined forces with Nancy Pelosi as Gingrich did for advancing the extreme left agenda. And Reagan would have never offended Hispanics as Gingrich did when he said Spanish is the language of the ghetto. Now, searching for votes, Gingrich wants to change history. But the facts speak for themselves. Paid for by Romney for President, Incorporated.""

We’ve written about Gingrich’s relationship with Freddie Mac and Nancy Pelosi in other items. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich said, ""Spanish is the language of the ghetto.""

The claim comes from a speech Gingrich gave on March 31, 2007, to the National Federation of Republican Women, as he was considering running for president in 2008.

We tracked down the speech in its entirety through C-SPAN, which originally broadcast the speech and has a wonderful video archive. You can watch Gingrich’s remarks by clicking here; the statements germane to this fact-check begin about 23 minutes in.

""Nobody in the elite world understands this, this is an enormous center-right country,"" Gingrich said. ""This was driven home for me a couple weeks ago when I was doing a press release for English First. They gave me some data. Eighty-five percent of the American people believe English should be the official language of government.""

After breaking for applause, Gingrich continued, ""Now that's according to a Rasmussen poll. Zogby came back and said that's too high -- the number's 84.

Gingrich then pivoted to the founding of the colony of Jamestown, ""when people who believed their rights came from God first stepped foot on this continent."" They had a ""very simple model,"" he said: ""We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and so they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto,"" Gingrich said. ""Second … we should establish that citizenship requires passing a test on American history in English. And if that's true, we do not have to print ballots in any language except English.""

Gingrich’s comments were picked up that day by the Associated Press, which said Gingrich equated bilingual education with ""the language of living in a ghetto.""

In looking at his remarks, he did not directly make that linkage -- his ""language of living in a ghetto"" is juxtaposed with ""the language of prosperity."" But the larger context, particularly the remark about ballot language, suggests that he was referring to Spanish. He was widely criticized for the comment.

The AP article quoted Peter Zamora, co-chair of the Washington-based Hispanic Education Coalition, which supports bilingual education, as saying, ""The tone of his comments were very hateful. Spanish is spoken by many individuals who do not live in the ghetto.""

On April 4, Gingrich posted a video on YouTube to explain the comments. He looked in the camera and spoke -- in Spanish.

""Last weekend I made some comments that I recognize produced a bad feeling within the Latino community,"" Gingrich said in Spanish (his comments in the video are subtitled into English). ""The words I chose to express myself were not the best, and what I wanted to say is this. In the United States it is important to speak English well in order to progress and have success. To achieve this goal, we should replace bilingual education programs with intensive English instruction courses and in this way permit that English be the language that all of us have in common.

""This is an expression of support for Latinos, not an attack on their language. I have never believed that Spanish is a language of people of low income nor a language without beauty.""

Gingrich did not explicitly apologize for his comments in the web video.

Gingrich was asked about the ""ghetto"" comment on Jan. 25, 2012, during an interview with Univision. He sidestepped the question in his answer. ""I said -- about all languages -- I am for English as the common, unifying language,"" he said. ""If I were going to live in Mexico, I would say that Spanish is really important for me to learn.""

Our ruling

A Romney radio ad playing in Spanish in South Florida claims that Gingrich said ""Spanish is the language of the ghetto."" In a speech in 2007, Gingrich said that some language other than English is the ""language of living in a ghetto."" Gingrich didn’t say specifically that he was talking about Spanish, though most people assumed that was the language he was referencing. Gingrich recorded a web video in Spanish a few days later saying he could have worded his comments better. With those caveats in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/25/mitt-romney/spanish-language-ad-says-newt-gingrich-said-spanis/

Mitch Daniels says 'nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today'
","
During the Republican response to the State of the Union address, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels painted a grim picture of American employment today. 
""The president did not cause the economic and fiscal crises that continue in America tonight, but he was elected on a promise to fix them, and he cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse,"" Daniels said in the nationally televised address. ""The percentage of Americans with a job is at the lowest in decades. One in five men of prime working age and nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today."" 
There are a lot of facts in that sentence, but many readers zeroed in on the claim that ""nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today."" So we’ll take a look at it. 
We turned to numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for tabulating employment statistics. The bureau’s website allows users to mix and match the national data by various sub-categories, including age. 
There’s no single category for ""under 30,"" and BLS doesn’t calculate data on those below the age of 16, but we were able to put together an ""under 30"" category by merging four others: 16 to 17; 18 to 19; 20 to 24; and 25 to 29. This also allowed us to compare statistics for those separate groups. 
The purest comparison we did -- one that seems to track Daniels’ statement most closely -- is to divide the number of people employed by the total number of persons in that age group. This statistic is known as the ""employment to population ratio."" We then flipped this ratio around to mirror how Daniels phrased it -- the total of persons not working divided by total population in that age group. 
For December 2011, the most recent month available, we found that 44.4 percent of the 16-to-29 age group was not employed. So, Daniels is in the ballpark. 
But there’s a problem: This is a ridiculous statistic to use. It includes Americans aged 16 to 18 (who are supposed to be in high school) and those 18 to 22 (many of whom are in college). If you leave high schoolers out of the equation and look only at ages 18 to 29, then the percentage who are not working declines to 37.5 percent. If you look only at ages 25 to 29, an age when most people are out of school altogether, it declines further, to 27.1 percent. 
But even this is beside the point if you are trying to craft a credible statistic. 
A more appropriate measure for Daniels would have been the tried-and-true unemployment rate. 
The unemployment rate takes the number of unemployed people and divides it by those who are ""in the labor force,"" which means that they are either employed or are jobless but looking for work. This measurement ignores people who are not seeking work, such as students or individuals who are raising children full-time or are unable to work for whatever reason. 
These statistics offer a significantly different picture. In the broadest age range -- 16 to 29 -- the unemployment rate is 13.6 percent. For those between 18 and 29, it’s 12.9 percent. For those between 20 and 29, it’s 11.9 percent. And for those between 25 and 29, it’s 9.7 percent. 
None of these measures gets Daniels any higher than 13.6 percent of the population -- far lower than the nearly 50 percent figure he cited. 
Our ruling 
We suppose in a narrow sense, Daniels has a point that ""nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today."" But that’s because the number includes many people who have no desire to work -- for instance, full-time high school or college students, stay-at-home parents or others who are unable to work. 
We can understand the concern about the nation’s current high level of unemployment, particularly among youth. Americans age 16 to 19 have an unemployment rate of 23.1 percent, and those who are 20 to 24 have a rate of 14.4 percent -- both well above the 8.5 percent for all age groups, which is itself elevated from historical averages. 
Still, the statistic Daniels chose to document this one is a wildly misleading one. We rate it Pants on Fire. 
UPDATE: After we published our story, a spokeswoman for Gov. Daniels replied to our query. She said that ""the employment-to-population ratio, which captures the number of people working as a percent of the population, is an important indicator of economic activity and the health of the society. For the 16-to-29-year-old cohort, the ratio peaked at 68.2 percent in 1989 and declined by 7.5 percentage points over the next 19 years, reaching 60.7 percent in 2008. The EPOP was 55.2 percent for 2011. So the nearly half -- 44.8% -- is correct. I would not agree that only those captured as unemployed in the unemployment rate are of concern. The total number of people actually working is important. Of course the governor wants students to pursue post-secondary education and has pursued ways to make it easier for them to do so during his tenure as governor."" 
We stand by our original ruling.

Mitt Romney says Newt Gingrich wanted Education Department, then didn't
","
Mitt Romney, who has been accused by Newt Gingrich's campaign of inconsistency, fired back Jan. 23, 2012, in Florida, calling the former House speaker ""erratic.""

One example:

""(Gingrich) voted in favor of establishing the Department of Education, and yet he gets in a debate and says we should get rid of the Department of Education and send all the education issues back to the states,"" Romney told reporters in Tampa.

We wondered, did Gingrich vote under President Jimmy Carter to establish the Education Department, then advocate three decades later for its elimination?

The vote

We asked Romney's campaign for support for his statement. Spokesman Ryan Williams provided us with a record of Gingrich's vote for the Department of Education Organization Act of 1979, which established the federal Education Department.

The congressman from Georgia did vote, ""Aye,"" according to GovTrack.us, a website that relies on government sources.

We also reached out to Gingrich's campaign but didn't hear back.

The debate 
So, Gingrich voted in favor of establishing the federal department. Did he recently say we should get rid of it? 

Williams pointed us to the former lawmaker's comments at the Sept. 22, 2011, debate in Orlando. 
A voter named Stella Lohmann asked candidates a question via video clip, concluding, ""What as president would you seriously do about what I consider a massive overreach of big government into the classroom?"" 
Gingrich said:

""I think you need very profound reform of education at the state level. You need to dramatically shrink the federal Department of Education, get rid of virtually all of its regulations.

""And the truth is, I believe we'd be far better off if most states adopted a program of the equivalent of Pell Grants for K-through-12, so that parents could choose where their child went to school, whether it was public, or private, or home-schooling, and parents could be involved. Florida has a virtual school program that is worth the entire country studying as an example.""

He didn't say he wanted to ""get rid of the Department of Education,"" as Romney claimed. He said the department needed to ""dramatically shrink."" What did Gingrich say he would ""get rid of""? ""Virtually all of its regulations,"" he said.

Not the same thing.

Gingrich's campaign website expands on his debate response, saying that he would ""shrink the federal Department of Education and return power to states and communities. The Department's only role will be to collect research and data and help find new and innovative approaches to then be adopted voluntarily at the local level.""

So he did advocate sending ""education issues back to the states,"" as Romney said, though not ""all."" Gingrich would reserve some limited powers for the federal government.

That's not to say Gingrich's positions on education haven't shifted over time.

For example, a story this month in the nonprofit-funded Education Week pointed out that Gingrich backed a Republican effort in 1995 to get rid of the Education Department or merge it with the Labor Department. In 2009, he joined with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and civil rights activist Al Sharpton to ""call for raising academic standards, lifting state caps on high-quality charter schools and greater accountability.""

Our ruling 
Gingrich did vote to establish the Education Department. But he didn't say in a September debate that lawmakers should get rid of it. 
However, Gingrich's record includes some support for Romney's larger point, that the long-time Washington politician has adapted his positions on education and the Education Department.

Have private-sector jobs grown by 3 million in 22 months, with the best annual totals since 2005?
","
EDITOR’S NOTE: Our original Half True rating was based on an interpretation that Obama was crediting his policies for the jobs increase. But we've concluded that he was not making that linkage as strongly as we initially believed and have decided to change the ruling to Mostly True. The original article is archived here. 
We also wrote an explanation of our reporting and why we changed the rating here. 
During his State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, President Barack Obama offered some evidence about the nation’s improving economy. 
He began by urging listeners to ""remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up. 
""In 2008, the house of cards collapsed,"" he continued. ""We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior. 
""It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. 
""Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005.  American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again. 
""The state of our union is getting stronger. And we’ve come too far to turn back now. As long as I’m president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum."" 
We decided to look specifically at Obama’s claim that ""in the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005."" 
We checked Obama’s claim by using data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for compiling employment data. We found that the U.S. economy has seen 22 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, beginning in Feb. 2010. During that 22-month period, the number of jobs grew by almost 3.16 million, or about 143,000 per month. 
We should note that there has also been a job-growth streak for all jobs in the economy -- not just in the private sector -- but this run of positive jobs numbers has been shorter since job losses in the government sector have offset gains in the private sector for much of that time. If you include both private-sector and government jobs, the economy has seen increases in total jobs for 15 straight months, not 22. But since this isn’t what Obama said, we won’t consider this in our ruling. 
As for whether 2011 was the best job-producing year since 2005, he’s right if you’re counting private-sector jobs, and slightly off if you’re counting all jobs. 
In 2011, the number of private-sector jobs rose by about 1.83 million (if you count from the January amount to the December amount) or 1.92 million (if you count from December to December). Either way, the increase in 2011 represented the highest one-year total since 2005, when the number of private-sector jobs increased by either 2.22 million or 2.31 million, depending on the time period used. 
If you use total jobs, the increase in 2011 was the biggest since 2006, not 2005. But here too, that’s not the measure Obama used, so we won’t consider it in our rating. 
Finally, there's another dimension. In his remarks, Obama described the damage to the economy, including losing millions of jobs ""before our policies were in full effect."" Then he describes the subsequent job increases. This suggests that he’s taking a degree of credit for the job growth, which runs counter to the reality that no mayor or governor or president deserves all the blame or all the credit for changes in employment. 
Our ruling 
Obama is correct on the numbers. By mentioning his policies, he's making a modest linkage that they deserve credit for the improvement when economists say they are just one factor. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/have-private-sector-jobs-grown-22-months-best-annu/

Fighting recall, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says ""double-digit tax increases"" preceded him
","
In his latest TV ad, released on the first anniversary of his inauguration, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker makes a case for why he should not be only the third U.S. governor ever recalled from office.

The Republican takes credit for erasing Wisconsin’s $3.6 billion budget deficit and for saving taxpayers ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" by making government employees pay more for pension and health benefits.

Walker closes the ad, released Jan. 3, 2012, by drawing a contrast with his Democratic predecessor.

""In the three years before I took office,"" he says, without naming Jim Doyle, ""Wisconsin lost 150,000 jobs.  But now, well, employer confidence is up, and since the start of the year, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs. Instead of going back to the days of billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record job loss, let’s keep moving Wisconsin forward.""

That’s some broad language.

So broad, some would think the double-digit increases were a fact of life for most residents. While widespread jobs losses in the recession and the deficit Walker inherited are well known, we wondered what Walker meant by ""double-digit tax increases.""

Walker repeated the ""double-digit tax increases"" claim on Rush Limbaugh’s national radio talk show on Jan. 17, 2012, the day before petitions seeking the recall election were submitted. And he did it again the next day, claiming Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk intends to ""take Wisconsin back to the days"" of double-digit tax increases.

Let’s see if that’s what state Democrats did.

Democrats did boost taxes with the 2009-2011 state budget and a 2009 budget adjustment bill. We found, when rating a $5 billion claim by Walker running mate Rebecca Kleefisch as False, that the two measures raised taxes and fees by just over $3 billion over the two-year period.

Ben Sparks, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Walker’s double-digit claim refers to the same two budget measures. In a document Sparks provided, Walker cites three sets of tax changes to back his claim.

School property taxes

Walker said that, because of the Democrats’ 2009-2011 budget, school property tax levies would have increased an estimated 17.3 percent in 2011 had he not taken the steps he did with his 2011-2013 budget.

Hmmm.

In the ad, Walker flatly claimed that Democrats raised taxes by double-digits. Now he’s talking about a hypothetical -- indeed, one that didn’t occur.

Like any governor, Walker had the opportunity to fashion his own budget. And with a Republican-controlled Legislature, he cut state aid to schools and school districts’ ability to raise property tax revenues. The result: 2011 school levies dropped 1 percent.

What about the other two tax changes Walker cites?

Business taxes

Walker contends Democrats raised business taxes by $456 million, or 28 percent, over two years.

Among other things, he cited the Democratic adoption of ""combined reporting,"" which taxes a relatively small number of Wisconsin-based businesses on income from subsidiaries outside the state, rather than only those within Wisconsin. That tax is estimated to raise $187 million over two years. He also cited elimination of a tax deduction for domestic production, which is estimated to increase corporate income tax payments by nearly $72 million.

Dale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said there isn’t a good base on which to calculate the $450 million increase. But roughly $350 million of that increase is to be paid in corporate income taxes, which is roughly an increase of 21 percent, he said.

So, that material is generally on point.

What’s left?

Miscellaneous taxes

Walker cites a number of double-digit tax increases the Democrats made, including a 42 percent hike in the tax on cigarettes to $2.52 per pack; more than doubling the $75 per-bed per-month assessment paid by nursing homes; and more than doubling the ""tipping fee"" charged to landfills, which is ultimately passed on to garbage generators such as families.

Our own research turned up one Walker didn’t cite.

The Democrats raised the top income tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.75 percent. That 1-percentage-point increase amounts to a 15 percent boost in the rate itself. The change caused a 13.5 percent increase in the actual tax paid by people with an adjusted gross income of $1 million or more, according to the taxpayers alliance.

Our rating

In a TV ad, Walker said the Democratic administration and Legislature that preceded him approved ""double-digit tax increases.""

Bernie Sanders says 12 million have slipped from middle class into poverty since 2000
","
In a tweet sent on July 18, 2011, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said that ""since 2000, nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty."" Sanders ended the tweet with his signature hashtag, #SharedSacrifice.

A reader asked us to check his claim, so we did.

First we contacted Sanders' office, but we didn't hear back from them. 
We then turned to Census Bureau data on poverty. In 2000, almost 31.6 million Americans were officially classified as having incomes below the poverty line. By 2009, that number had risen to 43.6 million. The difference? Exactly 12 million.

So while the data for 2010 is unavailable, the most recent figures confirm that Sanders used a verifiable statistic.
However, we see a number of issues that undercut Sanders’ interpretation and framing of the data.

•  Both the number of people in poverty and the poverty rate have increased from 2000 to 2009, but the increase in the poverty rate hasn't been in a straight line.  
The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans officially counted as in poverty -- started at 11.3 percent in 2000, then climbed every year until 2004, when it hit 12.7 percent. Then it fell for two years in a row, to 12.3 percent in 2006, before climbing for the next three years to 14.3 percent in 2009.

However, it’s worth keeping in mind that the poverty rate in 2009 -- the year Sanders used as his benchmark -- is still lower than some of the rates in the 1990s. In fact, the poverty rate was higher in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and it barely missed being higher in 1991. The highest rate was 15.1 percent in 1993.

•  Some people started out in poverty, rather than slipping into it.

Every year, some American babies are born into poverty, and some newly arrived immigrants end up in poverty when they arrive on these shores. This complicates Sanders’ claim that ""nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty."" Obviously, neither the impoverished infants nor the new immigrants in poverty ""slipped out of the middle class.""

These cases probably represent a small minority of all Americans in poverty, but they can’t be ignored, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""There is no reason to think that all the people newly classified as poor were members of middle class U.S. families in the previous year,"" Burtless said. 
• Some people who slip into poverty may not have been living in the ""middle class."" 

Sanders has a point if you break down the U.S. population into three classes -- impoverished, middle class and rich.  And if Sanders defines the middle class as stretching all the way down to the poverty line, he’d be right that, on a net basis, ""nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty"" between 2000 and 2009.

Defining the American middle class a fuzzy question -- and one that’s likely impossible to settle -- but we’re skeptical about the idea of extending ""the middle class"" all the way down to the poverty line. Both common English and public policy studies have long referred to ""the working poor."" It seems a lot more plausible that many of the people falling into poverty are members of the working poor than they are the middle class. If we’re right, this would make Sanders’ formulation an exaggeration.

•  Sanders’ tweet misses that people move in and out of poverty America. 
The incomes of many Americans are volatile. Someone may lose a job, or get hit by an expensive illness, or lose a spouse. Then, a year later, the same person may get a new job, enjoy improved health or remarry -- and those life changes may well spell the difference between poverty and improved economic fortunes.

""A proper understanding of poverty would show that many Americans do not stay poor for very long,"" Burtless said. ""They become poor temporarily, and then their incomes recover and they become non-poor."" 
Burtless said the number of Americans who go from poverty to riches essentially overnight is small (think lottery winners, pro sports draftees and the like). Much more common is to travel from below the poverty line to a level not too far above the poverty line.

A different data set -- a Census Bureau study known as the Survey of Income and Program Participation -- provides a window into how many Americans fall into, and climb out of, poverty every year. This study is useful because it’s ""longitudinal"" -- that is, it tracks what happens to people and families across time.

The study found that there were nearly 243 million Americans who were not poor in 2004. Of these, 8.8 million, or 3.5 percent, became poor in 2005, and 10.1 million, or 4.2 percent of, were poor in 2006.

At the same time, the study found 28.1 million poor Americans in 2004, and of those, 8.8 million, or 31.4 percent, exited poverty in 2005. By 2006, 11.7 million of them, or 41.6 percent, were no longer in poverty.

So, not only did nearly one-third of poor Americans exit poverty between 2004 and 2005, but the numbers of people leaving and entering poverty (not counting babies and immigrants) were exactly in balance -- 8.8 million out, 8.8 million in. (Because the SIPP data set is different than the official poverty statistics, the numbers don’t square exactly, but the official numbers do show that the poverty rate was pretty static in 2004 and 2005, falling only slightly, from 12.7 percent to 12.6 percent.)

So on the one hand, fewer than the 12 million Americans he cited fell into poverty and stayed there. There was simply too much flux for 12 million Americans to have stayed in poverty year after year.

On the other hand, many more than 12 million Americans experienced a taste of poverty between 2000 and 2009. But in most cases, that taste of poverty was temporary.

So where does this leave us?

On Sanders’ side, he used a solid number, and he’s clearly right about the underlying trend -- despite some ups and downs, there are more impoverished Americans today than there were in 2000, both measured by raw numbers and as a percentage of the population. But we think he goes too far when he suggests these 12 million Americans simply fell from the middle class into poverty. And he ignores the fact that as those 12 million Americans were slipping into poverty, many, many Americans were simultaneously climbing out of poverty. On balance, we rate Sanders’ statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-12-million-have-slipped-middle/

Sen. Alan Hays claims tax dollars not being used to sue voters on redistricting amendment
","
In talking about redistricting -- the redrawing of legislative and congressional districts that figures to be a prominent story for the next year or so -- state Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, recently made the point that he did not vote to spend money on a lawsuit that seeks to overturn a redistricting constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2010.

That amendment, called Amendment 6, says that elected officials cannot draw congressional districts to favor incumbents, political parties or thwart minority representation. (A separate amendment, Amendment 5, includes the same protections for state legislative districts).

In a previous item about whether Hays voted to spend money to fight a lawsuit about one of the amendments, we rated Hays' claim True, noting that the issue did not come up for a vote in the Florida Senate, and that it's the House that has joined a lawsuit trying to strike Amendment 6 down. We also checked a broader claim from Hays that the Legislature has not ""filed a lawsuit to fight"" the state constitutional amendment.

But that doesn't mean we're done with his statement to voters at The Villages during a July 13, 2011 redistricting public hearing.

""Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote,"" a man told legislators during the hearing. ""I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?""

""Did I vote for what?"" Hays asked.

""....These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?"" the man asked.

Later in the meeting, Hays responded:

""No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit. The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money.""

So Hays was right to say he didn't vote to spend money ""to fight that lawsuit."" But was he also right to claim that ""your tax dollars are not being used to sue you?""

The day after Amendments 5 and 6 passed, two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- filed suit seeking to overturn Amendment 6 (which relates to congressional redistricting). They argued that the amendment will negatively affect minority representation. On Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House filed a motion seeking to join the Brown/Diaz-Balart lawsuit, arguing in a filing that: ""It is the Legislature -- not Plaintiffs -- which has the primary responsibility for redistricting. And it is the Legislature -- not Plaintiffs -- whose prerogative will be challenged (and potentially invalidated) under the Amendment,"" the suit says.

The Florida Senate, in which Hays serves, is not a party to the lawsuit.

Regardless, tax dollars are being used for the suit, state budget records show. The House has spent slightly more than $700,000 on contract legal fees for three firms associated with redistricting issues. GrayRobinson, received the highest amount: about $614,000 between July 2010 and May 2011. Latham and Watkins had been paid about $28,000 and Miguel De Grandy about $58,000.

Not all those fees are connected to the Amendment 6 lawsuit, said House spokeswoman Katie Betta. But some are. Betta gave us a ballpark breakdown: about 50 percent of those bills were related to the Amendment 6 lawsuit, 40 percent were for general legal services related to the redistricting process and the last 10 percent were for the required process for the state to seek permission from the federal Department of Justice to go forward with the amendments.

To go a step further, tax dollars are being used to defend Amendment 6 as well.

Through June 2011, the defendant, the Florida Secretary of State, has paid $59,724.26 to lawyer Harry Thomas with the Tallahassee firm of Radey Thomas Yon & Clark. The Secretary of State is the defendant because the office is charged with implementing the amendment.

(Brown and Diaz-Balart are using legal defense funds -- not tax dollars -- to pay for the lawsuits, said David Simon, spokesman for Brown.)

Hays told a group of residents concerned about redistricting, ""Your tax dollars are not being used to sue you the people who voted the 63 percent."" But tax dollars are being used by the House to try to strike down Amendment 6, as well as by the Secretary of State to defend the amendment in court. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/20/alan-hays/hays-claims-tax-dollars-not-being-used-sue-voters-/

Sen. Alan Hays says 'Legislature' didn't file lawsuit to fight redistricting amendment
","
How the Legislature decides to redraw state and congressional legislative districts in 2012 will be one of the bigger political stories of the coming year. So at PolitiFact Florida, we think it's important to stay on top of the claims coming out of the redistricting discussion.

Florida Sen. Alan Hays, an Umatilla Republican, made several claims that we thought worth checking to clarify that debate. They all come from the same exchange with a voter during a July 13, 2011 public hearing at The Villages, a mainly conservative retirement community in Central Florida.

""Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote,"" the voter said to a group of legislators, including Hays. ""I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?""

""Did I vote for what?"" Hays asked.

""....These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?"" the man asked.

The amendments the man was referring to were Amendments 5 and 6, which were approved by voters in 2010. The amendments were sold by supporters as a way to keep the politics out of redrawing legislative boundaries. But two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- are seeking to overturn Amendment 6 (which relates to congressional redistricting) arguing that the amendment will negatively affect minority representation.

""No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit,"" Hays said later in response to the man. ""The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money.""

In one item, we checked Hays' assertion that he ""did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit."" In another, we checked Hays' statement that tax dollars are not being used to fight the lawsuit. In this fact-check, we're seeing if Hays is right to say that ""the Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6.""

As we noted, the amendments were crafted as a way to eliminate gerrymandering and keep elected officials from drawing districts to their benefit. Amendment 5 deals with state legislative districts, and Amendment 6 covers congressional districts. The amendments were approved by the required 60 percent of voters during the Nov. 2, 2010, election. Here are their ballot summaries:

Amendment 5 — Legislative districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries.

Amendment 6 — Congressional districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries.

The day after Florida voters passed both amendments, Brown and Diaz-Balart filed a lawsuit challenging Amendment 6. Brown, who is black and Diaz-Balart who is Hispanic, argued that Amendment 6 would reverse efforts to help minorities -- such as themselves -- get elected to Congress. The lawsuit did not challenge Amendment 5 because that dealt only with seats in the state Legislature while Amendment 6 relates to congressional boundaries.

Records in U.S. District Court show that on Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House, represented by the GrayRobinson law firm, filed an unopposed motion to intervene as a plaintiff. On the same day, the House filed a complaint asking that Amendment 6 be declared unconstitutional. On March 17, the court granted the House's motion to become an intervenor. The case is still pending in U.S. District Court.

The Senate has not joined the lawsuit, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos' Chief of Staff Craig Meyer told us July 15 the Senate has no intention of trying to join the lawsuit. ""The voters spoke; we want to respect the voters,"" Haridopolos said in a Florida Times-Union article in February.

In other words, Brown and Diaz-Balart were the original plaintiffs and the Florida House was added on as an additional ""plaintiff intervenor"" as written on court documents. The Senate isn't a party.

What's important for this fact-check is to know that a plaintiff intervenor is an actual plaintiff. Just like an original plaintiff, in its role as the plaintiff intervenor the Florida House has lawyers and files motions. The two members of Congress and the Florida House are now on the same side of the legal fight in court against the defendant, the Florida Secretary of State (the state agency is the defendant because it is the agency implementing the amendments).

""Because Amendment 6 was enacted wholly outside of the state legislative process and imposes requirements that go beyond simply regulating the 'manner' of congressional elections the Court should declare that it is invalid and grant judgment in plaintiffs' favor,"" attorneys for the Brown, Diaz-Balart and the Florida House wrote in a April 25 court motion.

We sent Hays' claim to a few law professors in Florida to ask if Hays was right to state that the Legislature didn't file a lawsuit to fight the amendments. We also asked if his characterization of being an intervenor in this instance was simply seeking ""clarification."" We interviewed by e-mail Bob Jarvis, at Nova Southeastern University; Michael Froomkin, at the University of Miami and Joe Little, at the University of Florida.

Hays scores points here in a purely technical way because the House wasn't the original filer of the lawsuit and technically intervening isn't the same as being the original filer.

But Hays' comments are disingenuous, Jarvis said.

""The lawsuit was not filed by the Legislature, but the Legislature is spending taxpayer dollars on a court fight whose goal is to have the amendments declared invalid. ... The plaintiff controls the lawsuit; the intervenor comes along for the ride and has much less say in how the case proceeds. So tactically, you usually want to be the plaintiff.""

Here, it does not make much difference, because the plaintiff and the intervenor both want the amendment declared unconstitutional, Jarvis wrote.

Hays' use of the word ""clarification"" is also misleading, Jarvis said, because ""there is nothing for the court to clarify with respect to the amendments -- they either are constitutional or they are not. A clarification would involve, for example, a question regarding how the amendments are to be operationally implemented.""

Little, who emphasized that he hadn't looked at the court filings and was speaking in general, wrote that while the difference between filing a lawsuit and intervening on the side of the plaintiff is a factual distinction, ""On the merits the distinction would be seen by most people as 'without a difference.'""

In most cases the difference between the original filer and the intervenor is ""utterly technical"" once the intervenor is allowed to join, Froomkin wrote. ""For example, if the original plaintiff were to pull out, the intervenor would have a right to continue the suit. When they are both in, both have the same rights as each other."" 
We asked Hays about his claims during an interview July 15. He said he could have been clearer by saying the Senate was not party to the lawsuit, instead of the Legislature. ""Did I speak inaccurately? Perhaps I did. If we are going to split the hair a part of the Legislature did join the lawsuit -- they didn't file the lawsuit.""

Hays also disagreed with the suggestion that the House is ""suing"" the people of Florida.

""If the House was suing the people of Florida, No. 1 the House would have been one of the initiators of the thing. Their purpose would have been to overturn the thing."" Hays said he has heard the House chose to join the lawsuit ""for clarification to determine whether or not that amendment in the Florida Constitution puts us in conflict with the U.S. Constitution."" He said the goal of the two members of Congress is to overturn Amendment 6.

If Hays had said the ""Florida Senate has not filed a lawsuit against Amendments 5 and 6"" that would be a true statement -- the Senate has not joined the lawsuit against Amendment 6 and has no plans to do so. And the lawsuit is about Amendment 6 -- not Amendment 5. But that's not what Hays said -- he said the Legislature has not filed a lawsuit. While that's true on a technical level -- the two members of Congress filed the lawsuit -- the House did join as a plaintiff. Hays later explained that the House joined as an intervenor ""seeking clarification"" but the House is seeking more than clarification -- the House has filed a motion asking that Amendment 6 be declared unconstitutional.

Sen. Alan Hays said he didn't vote to spend money on Amendment 6 lawsuit
","
Florida legislators hit the road beginning in June 2011 for a series of public hearings to collect input about redistricting. The traveling statewide show has drawn many residents who have peppered legislators with questions and criticisms that have put leaders on the defensive. 
PolitiFact Florida previously evaluated a claim by State Rep. Will Weatherford, chairman of the redistricting committee in the House. While at a hearing in Panama City, the Wesley Chapel Republican said, ""There is no $30 million pot of money"" for redistricting in the House -- a claim we deemed False. While there is no $30 million pot of money labeled exclusively for redistricting in the House, there are two pots of money which are available to fight redistricting lawsuits.

This time we will travel -- that is, electronically because we watched a video of the July 13 hearing -- to The Villages, a mainly conservative retirement community in Central Florida.

There, some residents raised questions about public dollars being spent to fight a redistricting state constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2010. One man directed a question to Sen. Alan Hays, a Republican from Umatilla, north of Orlando.

""Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote,"" the man said. ""I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?""

""Did I vote for what?"" Hays asked.

""... These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?"" the man asked. The man was referring to a lawsuit, initially filed by two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- seeking to overturn Amendment 6, which relates to congressional redistricting. The Florida House later joined that lawsuit as an intervenor plaintiff.

Later in the meeting, Hays responded:

""No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit. The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman.

But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money.""

When we hear a politician declare that there is misinformation lurking about our ears perk up. In three separate items, we will dissect three claims by Hays:

• ""No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit"" -- referring to a lawsuit challenging Amendment 6. 
• ""The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6."" 
• ""Your tax dollars are not being used to sue you the people who voted the 63 percent"" in favor of Amendment 6.

In this item, we'll check Hays' assertion that he did not ""vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit.""

First, some background on redistricting.

Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. The task seems simple enough: to logically divide Florida's 18.8 million residents into 120 House districts, 40 Senate districts and 27 congressional districts. But the process is never without accusations of ""gerrymandering"" often brought up against the party in power.

This round of redistricting, however, figures to be even more contentious because of two constitutional amendments -- 5 and 6 -- approved by voters in November 2010 that require districts to be drawn in a way that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties or interfere with minority representation. Some lawmakers say the amendments are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation, meaning that any redrawing of district lines will be open to a legal challenge. Amendment 5 covers state legislative districts. Amendment 6 imposes the same requirements for drawing congressional maps.

As we mentioned, two members of Florida's congressional delegation -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- are challenging Amendment 6, arguing that they believe the changes will reverse gains in minority representation. Hispanics represent more than half of the voting-age population in Diaz-Balart's district while African-Americans represent nearly half in Brown's district, according to their federal court complaint.

Brown and Diaz-Balart filed their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Southern Florida on Nov. 3, 2010, arguing that Florida voters can't change the standards for congressional district-drawing because the issue is governed by the U.S. Constitution, not the Florida Constitution. 
The Florida Secretary of State is defending the lawsuit, and several other entities or individuals have joined as defendants including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Florida State Conference of NAACP branches as well as a handful of Democratic state legislators. In their May 25 motion seeking to dismiss the suit, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs were asking the court to ""nullify the people's decision to require that the Legislature take a fair and balanced approach when drawing Congressional districts. And their motivation is obvious: they are incumbents and they are threatened by the fact that, for the first time ever, there are fair and neutral standards prohibiting the favoring or disfavoring of particular incumbents or parties."" (Kurt Browning, the Secretary of State, opposed the amendments.)

Oral arguments have been set for July 29 in Miami.

On Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House filed a motion seeking to join the Brown/Diaz-Balart lawsuit which was ultimately granted. The state Senate, however, did not join the lawsuit. We'll talk a little more about the distinction in examining another part of Hays' statement, but for this fact-check, it makes things quite clear. 
Because the Senate did not join the lawsuit, there clearly wasn't any vote that Hays could have participated in to set aside money to fight that lawsuit. 
The Senate has money set aside that it could possibly use for redistricting -- including legal fees. But that money won't go toward the Amendment 6 lawsuit. 
And even more generally, there wasn't a vote on budgeting redistricting legal fees in the Senate, both Craig Meyer, chief of staff for Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos, and Sen. Nan Rich, the Senate's Democratic leader, told us. 
Instead, the redistricting dollars go into an overall category that the Senate leadership can spend how it sees fit. 
So, Hays was correct to say ""I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit."" There was no vote for line-item money for the lawsuit initially filed by the members of Congress and now also being fought by the state House -- but not the state Senate.

Club for Growth Wisconsin ad says Senate recall candidate Sandy Pasch voted to cut school aid by $300 million
","
The target in one of the most competitive of Wisconsin’s nine Senate recall races is state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, an architect of a 2011-2013 state budget that reduces aid to public schools by nearly $800 million.

But one of the state’s major political players, the conservative Club for Growth Wisconsin, is turning the tables. It claims Darling’s challenger, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, also backed a sizable school funding cut.

The attack is part of a radio ad that began airing about a week before Pasch won the Democratic primary.

Club for Growth, which advocates for ""limited government and minimal taxation,"" mostly branded Pasch as a tax-and-spender in the ad. But at one point, the female narrator says Pasch voted to ""to cut school aid by nearly $300 million.""

Club for Growth also makes the school aid claim in similar ads that have targeted two other Assembly Democrats who are challenging incumbent Republicans in recall races, according to the La Crosse Tribune.

They are Rep. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, running against Sen. Dan Kapanke of La Crosse; and Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo, challenging Luther Olsen of Ripon. Those elections, and the Pasch-Darling contest, are on Aug. 9, 2011.

When we asked for evidence to back the claim against Pasch, Club for Growth spokesman R. J. Johnson cited a May 2009 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article.

It referred to the 2009-2011 budget submitted by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, which proposed cutting state aid for schools by $290 million. That was before the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, voted on the budget.

But a month later, Pasch joined all but two Assembly Democrats in approving the spending plan. The final budget cut general school aid by $294 million -- to $9.3 billion -- over two years, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

So, Club for Growth Wisconsin is correct in saying Pasch voted to cut school aid nearly $300 million. But is that whole story?

In the same article cited by Club for Growth, Doyle said total spending on public schools would actually rise by about 5 percent because schools would get an additional $877 million in federal stimulus funds. That seemed to indicate that stimulus money would more than offset the state aid reduction. Gillian Morris, Pasch’s campaign spokeswoman, said that was also her understanding of what happened.

But that was not the case.

According to the fiscal bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, the $294 million aid reduction took into account both the cut in state funds and the federal stimulus money that was added in.

In other words, the stimulus money was not enough to offset the state funding cut. The net result for schools was a reduction in funding of $294 million.

In sum, Club for Growth Wisconsin claimed that Pasch voted to cut nearly $300 million in aid to schools. The record shows the claim was on the mark.

David Dewhurst says president's economists say stimulus-created jobs cost $278,000 each
","
In a Twitter post, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst criticized the economic stimulus program that President Barack Obama signed into law two years ago, writing July 5: ""What a nightmare! Obama's own economists say the stimulus cost $278K per job 'created.' "" 
Dewhurst’s tweet included a link to a July 3 blog posting on the conservative Weekly Standard’s website headlined: ""Obama's Economists: 'Stimulus' Has Cost $278,000 per Job."" 
Earlier the same day, the U.S. House speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio, posted a similar claim linked to the Weekly Standard's blog. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a closer look. 
The Weekly Standard item cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers stating that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ""saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011."" That report also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill's outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion. 
The $278,000 per job figure doesn't appear in the report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the report's low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars-per-job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000. 
The blog item contends this statistic ""provides further evidence that President Obama's 'stimulus' did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,"" and insists that ""the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the 'stimulus' and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead."" 
After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were ""based on partial information and simply false analysis."" Carney noted that the stimulus was ""meant to do much more than just create and save jobs; it was also an investment in American infrastructure, education, and industries like clean energy … and investment in the economic future of America's working families."" 
We checked the White House report, and of the $666 billion stimulus total, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; and 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps. 
The remainder, about 24 percent, was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement, health information technology and research on renewable energy. 
The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries — as the blog item implies. Lumping all stimulus costs together and classifying the total as salaries produces an inflated figure. 
Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report's low-end jobs estimate. Had it gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure. 
Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by the 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A ""fact check"" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math ""satisfyingly simple but highly misleading."" 
""Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output — a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,"" the 2009 Associated Press item noted. 
The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually ""has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs."" It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs — or 288,000 more than it has now. 
Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data. 
""It's not that ARRA (the stimulus) is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA's help,"" Zandi told Talking Points Memo DC. ""This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery."" 
The day after the White House responded to the GOP's dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but ""rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000."" 
Then again, this clarification doesn't fit with the blogger's earlier claim that taxpayers would have come out ahead if the government had just cut checks to everyone credited with getting a stimulus-tied job. 
Contrary to Dewhurst's statement, the cited cost-per-job figure was not aired by the Obama administration. At bottom, his statement leaves the misimpression that the money went solely for jobs rather than a range of projects and programs, including tax breaks. We rate his claim False. 
UPDATE, 4:45 p.m., July 20, 2011: After receiving feedback from a reader, we updated this item with further details about Recovery Act costs through March 2011. These changes did not affect our rating of Dewhurst's statement.",/factchecks/2011/jul/20/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-presidents-economists-say-stim/

Johns Creek mayor says transportation vote covers less than 10 percent of need
","
Persuading voters to back next year’s tax referendum to help unclog the region’s roadways may be tough. Divvying up the cash is no cakewalk, either.

Area leaders have asked for billions of dollars in transportation projects they think the region needs, but the proposed 1-cent sales tax can’t pay for all of them.

In fact, it won’t even cover most of them, Johns Creek Mayor Mike Bodker said.

""Let's keep in mind that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered in this referendum,"" Bodker told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent news story.

Less than one-tenth? But won’t the tax rake in billions of dollars?

Before we address Bodker’s claim, let’s take a quick detour into the complex realm of transportation planning.

Since the effects of a single project can cross city and county boundaries, much of the region’s transportation planning is handled by the Atlanta Regional Commission. The planning body helps area governments with issues that need regional coordination, such as clean air, water and aging.

As part of its duties, the ARC drafted Plan 2040, which maps out transportation, land use, environmental, economic, housing and human service strategies covering the 18-county area for the next 30 years.

Plan 2040 estimates what the region needs, what it will cost and how much it can afford. It found that the region needs about $126 billion in transportation projects. It can probably pay for about $60.9 billion, according to a Plan 2040 report.

As the ARC formed transportation plans for metro Atlanta, state legislators worked to find ways to fund needs across Georgia. Their efforts resulted in the 2010 passage of the Transportation Investment Act.

This legislation created special regional transportation tax districts across the state, including one in metro Atlanta. This district includes 10 counties: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale.

A roundtable made up of Atlanta-area elected officials must come up with a list of projects for the taxing district that can be completed with money from a 1-cent sales tax. If voters back the tax in a 2012 referendum, it gets levied and construction begins.

Atlanta-area jurisdictions have submitted $22.9 billion in eligible projects they would like to see funded by the referendum. The roundtable is trying to cut the list down to an affordable level.

This brings us back to Bodker. As mayor of Johns Creek, he thinks the referendum has a better chance at success if leaders promise to use the money to build road projects.

We asked Bodker how he determined that the upcoming referendum would cover ""less than one-tenth"" of the region’s transportation needs.

Bodker was talking about money, he told us. To get the ""one-tenth"" figure, he compared the amount of revenue the tax is expected to raise with the estimated cost of building the projects metro Atlanta needs.

Through Plan 2040, regional planners calculated all the projects the area needs would cost some $120 billion, but the referendum is estimated to bring in only $7.2 billion, Bodker said. That’s less than 10 percent.

The federal government will likely match some of the money metro Atlanta raises from its tax, boosting the amount of transportation projects the region can afford. Still, most of the region’s needs will remain unmet.

We checked Bodker’s figures with those from the ARC, and they are very close. But there’s one small hitch.

A state economist determined that, depending on economic conditions, the 1-cent sales tax could raise between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion in 2011 dollars, according to ARC documents. Since the current Plan 2040 draft says the region needs $126 billion in projects, the potential tax revenue does amount to ""less than one-tenth"" of the need, as Bodker said.  

Furthermore, projects that make the roundtable list will receive only an estimated $6.1 billion of the tax revenue, an ARC spokeswoman said. The remainder will go to localities. The $6.1 billion figure is also less than 10 percent of the regional need.  

The hitch is that Plan 2040’s cost estimate defines the Atlanta region as an 18-county area. The state Legislature designed the planned referendum to cover a smaller, 10-county region. Determining how much of the $120 billion would address needs for the smaller 10-county region is problematic because major projects can affect traffic in multiple counties.  

That said, this quirk does not render Bodker’s statement inaccurate. It may have been more precise for him to say that the 10-county referendum funds less than 10 percent of the 18-county region’s needs, but we think it’s safe to say your average voter doesn’t parse regional definitions this closely.

We therefore rule Bodker’s statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/20/mike-bodker/johns-creek-mayor-says-transportation-vote-covers-/

Was Rep. Bill Johnson's funding request for airport improvements consistent with his anti-earmark stance?
","
Rep. Bill Johnson is one of the Republican budget hawks elected to Congress for the first time last fall. He denounced earmarks and promised to cut spending.

That put him on the radar of political reporter Sam Stein of Huffington Post, who recently made a Freedom of Information Act request for communications between first-term House members and federal agencies.

Stein said the correspondence he received ""reveals that, in private, GOP lawmakers have pressed for tens of millions of dollars in federal help for their districts, even while decrying federal spending in front of the national press corps."" Johnson is the second of 12 lawmakers named in Stein's story.

On March 8, he co-signed a letter from colleague Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Niles, asking the Department of Transportation for a grant to improve a runway at Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport at a cost of more than $4.3 million. The airport, just north of Youngstown, is in Ryan’s district but also serves Johnson’s, which includes some Youngstown suburbs.

Less than a month later, Stein noted, Johnson said on the House floor, ""Our nation is broke. The federal government has maxed out its credit card.""

To Stein, that raised the question ""of whether it was inconsistent for a lawmaker who has repeatedly deplored government spending to privately request his own slice of the pie.""

Stein’s piece caused a stir, getting attention on cable news programs. In light of that story, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Johnson’s position on earmarks on the Flip-O-Meter. Is the request for specific spending consistent with his previously stated position?

The congressman’s press secretary, Jessica Towhey, bristled at the question, but stood by the statement she gave Stein:

""There’s a difference between smart federal spending and the reckless, irresponsible waste of tax dollars the American people are fed up with,"" she said. ""Congressman Johnson joined with Rep. Tim Ryan in a bipartisan request to the FAA for safety improvements at a part of the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport that the FAA has determined is not safe. This airport is a growing hub for travel and business in Northeast Ohio, and there is strong bipartisan support to ensure the safety of travelers and airport employees.""

What's the difference between runway spending and runaway spending? What's the difference between ""smart federal spending"" and a ""reckless, irresponsible waste of tax dollars"" -- apart from Johnson's support? Those are policy questions for others to debate.

But what about Johnson’s position on earmarks?

While campaigning against Rep. Charlie Wilson for the 6th District seat last year, he declared himself opposed to all earmarks. He said he opposed ""out-of-control spending"" and wanted ""to stop funding programs that are not working, like the National Endowment for the Arts and other pork and earmarks.""

So is the request for runway funding consistent with the earmark position?

Earmarks are special requests from lawmakers that direct money to be spent in specific ways, usually to the benefit of a lawmaker's home district. They are often attached to a broad funding bill so that the only way to oppose them is to vote the bill down and stall the budgeting process. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve special interests rather than the national good.

Republicans, including Johnson, approved rules that bar earmarks from legislation when they took control of the House this January.

But the airport request, while it does seek funding for a specific project, is not an earmark. It’s not a directed appropriation from Congress that targets a project. It’s not buried in a larger piece of legislation making it difficult to oppose. Rather, it’s a request to the administration asking it to support the project.

That’s a big difference. On the Flip-O-Meter, we find Johnson’s position on earmarks rates a No Flip.",/factchecks/2011/jul/20/bill-johnson/was-rep-bill-johnsons-funding-request-airport-impr/

Mitt Romney says President Obama was planning to visit Kim Jong-ll, Ahmadinejad, Assad and Chavez in first year
","
A persistent theme in Mitt Romney's campaign for president has been the complaint that President Barack Obama has been coddling U.S. enemies such as Iran, North Korea and Syria.

So when Romney was asked about Iran during a town hall in Wolfeboro, N.H., on July 5, 2011, he noted that it is ""the national sponsor of terror groups across the globe"" and lamented that the U.S. doesn’t do a better job of promoting itself abroad.

""The President, when he was running for office, said he was going to engage Iran, and engage North Korea. Remember in his first year he was going to visit Kim Jong-ll and Ahmadinejad and Assad and Chavez – the worst actors in the world. And how did that work out?""

To check whether Romney was right, we explored two questions: Did Obama actually say he was going to meet in the first year of his presidency with North Korean leader Kim Jong-II, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez? And did Obama say those meetings would take place in the leaders' home countries?

Romney’s campaign pointed us to the transcript of the CNN/YouTube debate in Charleston, S.C. in July 2007.

QUESTION: ""In 1982, Anwar Sadat traveled to Israel, a trip that resulted in a peace agreement that has lasted ever since. In the spirit of that type of bold leadership, would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?""

OBAMA: ""I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them — which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration — is ridiculous. Now, Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward.  And I think that it is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them.""

Obama's remarks drew criticism from his Democratic rival, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, who called Obama’s position ""irresponsible and frankly naive"" and said that agreeing to meetings ""without preconditions"" risked that they could be used ""for propaganda purposes.""

Republican nominee John McCain said Obama's position proved his much younger rival’s ""inexperience and reckless judgment.""

Back in 2008, PolitiFact examined McCain’s contention that candidate Obama ""said again and again"" that he’d be willing to meet with the President Ahmidinejad without precondition, and rated it  True. More recently, we've examined Romney’s claim that in his first year, Obama ""traveled around the globe to apologize for America,"" which earned a rating of Pants on Fire.

Here, Romney is returning to familiar turf to echo those themes. But in doing so, he exaggerated what Obama said at the debate.

First, when he was in that town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, Romney didn’t say Obama said he was ""willing to meet "" the leaders; Romney said Obama ""was going to.""  Those are two very different things in the precise language of diplomacy. And Romney didn’t use the word ""meet,"" as Obama and McCain did. Instead, he substituted ""visit.""

Diplomatic experts told us those changes significantly change the meaning of Romney's statement.

""There is a big difference between visiting a capital and being willing to meet with another government, another government’s leaders -- so it would be unfair to suggest that’s what Obama said. He didn’t say that, and in international politics and diplomacy the difference is quite important,"" says R. Nicholas Burns, a professor of diplomacy and international politics at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Burns was Ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton and Ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush.

Kurk Volker, of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said Romney's statement is ""an exaggeration."" Volker, also a U.S. Ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush who is backing the Presidential campaign of Tim Pawlenty, said he doesn’t see Romney’s charge as coming ""completely out of thin air"" but says it stretches the facts.  ""It's more specific and more solicitous to say he’s going to visit them. And the imagery around that would be very different, to have the president photographed on the other guy’s turf, it would be a different thing.""  

And as things stand, 30 months into President Obama’s term, he has visited none of these U.S. antagonists, nor are there any public plans to do so. In fact, the only documented direct contact Obama’s had with any of the leaders Romney’s named was with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the multilateral Summit of the America’s in 2009. Press accounts characterize their interactions as brief. They took place on the neutral ground of Trinidad.

Our ruling 
There is a small amount of truth in Romney's claim, but his wording exaggerates what Obama really said. When asked if he would be willing to meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea -- ""without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else"" -- Obama said he would. But in the language of diplomacy, that is significantly different than saying he ""was going to visit"" them, which is how Romney characterized it. We find his statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-obama-was-planning-visi/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'Grover Norquist']","
Grover Norquist said the economy has grown or been damaged by capital gains tax changes
","
Nobody opposes tax increases quite like Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. 

For example, comedian Stephen Colbert recently asked Norquist what he would do if terrorists kidnapped all of our grandmothers and threatened to kill them with fire ants. Their ransom demand? Tax increases on the wealthiest 2 percent of all Americans. Would Norquist give in? ""I think we console ourself with the fact that we have pictures,"" he said.

He was kidding, right? It's hard to tell.

In a more serious vein, Norquist was interviewed on July 13, 2011, by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, who also asked Norquist about taxes on wealthy Americans.

""John Paulson, who's a hedge fund manager, he made last year $4.9 billion. Billion with a 'B.' Not million but $4.9 billion. And a big chunk of that income was taxed at 15 percent, not the maximum 35 percent, because it was seen as some sort of capital gains or whatever. Is that fair?"" Blitzer asked.

""Well, certainly the Democrats have been arguing to raise the capital gains tax on all Americans. Obama says he wants to do that,"" Norquist said. ""That would slow down economic growth. It's not necessarily helpful to the economy. Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged. It's one of those taxes that most clearly damages economic growth and jobs.""

We decided to check Norquist's claim on capital gains taxes. We contacted his organization, Americans for Tax Reform, but we didn't hear back.

What are capital gains taxes? If your only income is normal wages, you've probably never paid them. But here's how they work: When you sell an asset, such as a share of stock, for a profit, that profit is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the taxpayer's income and the length of the investment. But most long-term capital gains are taxed at 15 percent, less than many people pay in income taxes. (The top income tax rate is now 35 percent.) The idea is that a lower tax rate encourages investment and economic growth. 

Blitzer, though,  was talking about a loophole that allows compensation paid to investment fund managers, including hedge fund managers, to be treated as capital gains, not income.

Over the years, capital gains taxes have gone up and down, providing lots of fodder for economic analysis. They increased in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan, decreased under President Bill Clinton in 1997 and decreased under President George W. Bush in 2003. We should note that these changes have taken place as part of packages of other tax cuts and tax increases, usually alongside changes to income tax rates.  
We decided to compare charts of annual economic growth rates compared with capital gains tax rates to see what we would find. In one column, we listed the percentage growth using inflation-adjusted numbers for the Gross Domestic Product as compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the other column, we included the maximum tax rate for long-term capital gains taxes, as compiled by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, going back to 1977. The Tax Policy Center's rates tend to be just a bit higher than statutory rates because it accounts for other parts of the tax code that interacted with the capital gains tax rate. We noted exceptions in 1982 (tax rates were lower, but the economy declined); in 1987 (tax rates increased, but the economy still grew); and in 1993 (tax rates increased slightly, and the economy still grew.) 
We looked for other research on the issue and found that Troy Kravitz and Leonard Burman put Norquist’s contention to the test in a simple study published in the respected nonpartisan journal Tax Notes in 2005. They looked at changes to capital gains taxes and compared them with both to stock market performance and overall economic growth. They found a weak relationship between tax changes and the stock market, but virtually no correlation to overall economic growth, measured by gross domestic product (GDP). ""Capital gains rates display no contemporaneous correlation with real GDP growth during the last 50 years,"" they noted. They also tested whether the tax changes had any delayed effects, testing lags up to five years, but found no statistically significant effect. 
On the issue of stock market growth, they noted that pension funds and foreign investors don't pay capital gains taxes the same way that individual investors do. ""Thus, capital gains tax rates can increase significantly, as they did following the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and have little apparent effect on the stock market,"" the report said. ""Likewise, the stock market can fluctuate even when rates remain unchanged."" 
We consulted a number of tax policy experts who considered the study sound and knew of no evidence to contradict it. 
The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analysis agency for the U.S. Congress, compiled research on capital gains taxes and concluded that reductions to capital gains taxes are ""unlikely to have much effect"" on economic growth. ""A tax reduction on capital gains would mostly benefit very high income taxpayers, who are likely to save most of any tax reduction,"" the report said. 
Does this mean reductions in capital gains taxes don't cause the economy to grow? We asked Burman, who conducted the Tax Notes study and is the author of The Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed. ""It doesn't rule out that there could be a connection,"" he said. But in practice, he said, ""It's as likely to do damage as to help."" That's because when the capital gains tax rate is lower than that of regular income, people look for ways to avoid taxes by converting regular income to capital gains income -- just as Blitzer's question suggested.  

In our queries of tax experts, we found a wide difference of opinion on the capital gains tax itself. 

Here's the ""pro"" view, from economist J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation:

""I believe capital gains taxation is a uniquely powerful tool for good or evil in terms of economic growth because it strikes at the heart of the most productive, transformational forms of investment. What kind of investment is that? Long-term, high risk investment. So changes in the tax treatment either way doesn't turn the economic world on a dime. It's a powerful influence, but not one that can be reliably sifted from the data either way.""

Alternatively, here's the ""con"" view from David Rosenbloom, a tax law professor at New York University:

""The best tax policy would not have a difference as between capital gains and ordinary income because there is no compelling reason for any such distinction, and it enormously complicates the Internal Revenue Code. We had such a best policy, briefly, following passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, in Reagan's second term. Everything was taxed at a top rate of 28 percent (with a few minor deviations). Does Norquist think that was so bad? For heaven's sake, why? And we have had extraordinarily low rates on capital gains since the first years of the Bush II Administartion (and still have them today). Does Norquist think the economy has done splendidly during the ensuing years? What have I missed?""

Getting back to Norquist's statement, he said, ""Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged."" Clearly, he intends that as a statement of causation. But the analysis of Kravitz and Burman rebuts that. They found no evidence of a connection between actual economic growth and changes in capital gains tax rates. The actual effect of capital gains tax rates remains a hotly contested issue. We rate Norquist's statement False. ",/factchecks/2011/jul/19/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-said-economy-has-grown-or-been-dam/

Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle uses passage of Libyan budget to shame U.S. Senate over inaction
","
In a news release dated June 24, 2011, freshman Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle, R-N.Y., made a striking comparison.

Buerkle used the release to tout a bill she was offering -- the Just Do Your Job Act of 2011 -- which would ""effectively defund"" the House and Senate budget committees and leadership offices if they failed to pass a budget.

Buerkle argued that ""by not presenting any plan to address the out-of-control debt and deficit, the Senate is contributing to the risk of a national financial crisis."" Later, she added that ""even the Libyan government, in the middle of a civil war, passed a budget on June 15, 2011.""

A reader saw the Libya comparison and asked us to check it out. We considered the possibility that Buerkle inserted the line as a lark -- her staff didn’t get back to us to clarify its purpose -- but even if the comparison was offered in a flip manner, its inclusion in a news release about a serious legislative issue made it fair game for the Truth-O-Meter.

We’ll start by noting that the the U.S. Senate, under Democratic leadership, has not passed a budget since April 29, 2009, and that has recently become something of a Republican talking point.

For instance, on May 19, 2011, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said that ""the Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days ... Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities."" We rated that statement Half True, noting that the math was correct, but adding that Republicans shared some responsibility.

Earlier, we gave the same Half True rating to a similar statement by George LeMieux, a Republican Senate candidate from Florida.

We were able to corroborate the date of the Libyan budget passage through a news report.

In a June 15, 2011, dispatch filed from Rabat, Morocco, Reuters reported that ""Libya's government approved a $31.4 billion budget for the rest of 2011, the official news agency said on Wednesday."" The budget was approved despite a civil war between Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi and rebels based in the eastern city of Benghazi, backed by U.S.-led NATO forces.

So Buerkle was right that Libya’s government passed a budget on that date. But the Truth-O-Meter also takes context into account -- and the question of how accurate this comparison is turns out to be somewhat nuanced.

On the one hand, Gadhafi has been Libya’s dictator for more than four decades, so one would not expect the same checks and balances that the United States government has. As the U.S. State Department describes it, ""Libya's political system is in theory based on the political philosophy in Gadhafi's Green Book, which combines socialist and Islamic theories and rejects parliamentary democracy and political parties. In reality, Gadhafi exercises near-total control over major government decisions.""

Samer S. Shehata, an assistant professor of Arab politics at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that ""I will certainly say what should be obvious to anyone: The Libyan regime under Gadhafi, in power since 1969, is not a legitimate government with serious ‘institutions.’""

Still, one Libyan-born academic expert now working in the U.S. said that the Libyan budget process is a bit more complicated than Gadhafi and a couple of his cronies simply ordering up some spreadsheets.

Karim Mezran, an adjunct professor of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, said that ""despite Libya being a dictatorship, the administration of the state has always been quite serious."" He said that a budget (minus defense outlays) is presented for approval by the Council of Ministers -- Gadhafi’s cabinet -- and once the ministers approve it, it is sent to the General People’s Congress, a legislative body that serves an intermediary between the masses and the leadership. If the General People’s Congress approves it, the budget is signed into law.

""It can be a long process involving negotiation between various centers of power,"" Mezran said.

That said, Mezran agreed that the comparison with the U.S. budget situation isn’t exactly apt.

""The comparison is inappropriate not because of the fact that Libya is a dictatorship but mainly because of the different sizes of the two countries, the complexity of the instrument, the number of interests and the complexity of the negotiations involved,"" Mezran said.

There’s another reason the comparison is problematic: The June budget passage was less an ordinary governmental action than a way for the embattled regime to send a message to the world that it’s still alive.

According to Reuters, the June budget -- a revision of a budget initially approved in January -- was ""apparently aimed at showing (that the Libyan government) was functioning as normal despite air strikes and sanctions.""

The dispatch said the budget approval appeared to be an attempt by Gadhafi ""to show his government was still solvent"" in the face of comments by Libya's former central bank governor, Farhat Bengdara, suggesting that Gadhafi’s government had just $500 million left in cash at the end of February, plus 155 tons of gold bars. Bengdara defected in March.

Sanctions have led both to the seizure of some of Libya’s assets held overseas and to a blockage of oil sales that cut off flows of foreign currency into Libya, Reuters reported.

So where does this leave us?

Buerkle is right about two things: the U.S. Senate hasn’t passed a budget in more than two years, and Libya passed one as recently as June of this year. In addition, the Libyan budget would have had to go through some formal steps of governance.

Still, even if Buerkle intended it to be a lighthearted comparison, we feel she’s wrong to imply equivalence between the two budget processes. Libya is a dictatorship, not a well-established constitutional democracy. Libya’s budget is much less complicated than the U.S. budget, since Libya’s gross domestic product is less than one-half of 1 percent of the GDP of United States. And the passage of the budget in June is seen as demonstrating less about Libya’s normal functioning of government and more about the Gadhafi regime’s need to show the world that it’s withstanding the offensives of the NATO-backed rebels.

We give Buerkle credit for her facts, but demerits for her interpretation. So we rate her statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/19/ann-marie-buerkle/rep-ann-marie-buerkle-uses-passage-libyan-budget-s/

Craig Miller, a Republican who jumped into politics with a 2010 primary run for an Orlando-area congressional seat (he finished third), announced in July 2011 that he would run for the U.S. Senate. That made him a relative newcomer facing Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner and former U.S. Army Col. Mike McCalister. (Haridopolos thinned the field by dropping out less than a week later.) 
Miller, 61, explained his decision to ""take on the career politicians"" in a four-paragraph essay on his website. Here's the third paragraph: 
""Those that have had a chance to lead have failed us. The politicians we have trusted to represent us are the ones who have gotten us into the mess we now face. The time for new leadership is now. I'm a businessman. I've been fortunate enough to live the American Dream, starting in the dish room and working my way up to the board room. Along the way, I've created over 40,000 jobs and I've spent my career in the restaurant industry balancing budgets and meeting payroll. I know the kind of pro-growth and pro-job environment we need to get our economy moving again. My life experiences have prepared me to go to Washington and take on the career politicians and entrenched interests that only know how to spend your money."" 
We saw the same number in a campaign news release a day later and wondered: Did Craig Miller, restaurant executive, create 40,000 jobs? 
Here's how Miller told us he did the math. He explained that he started his executive career with the company that owned Red Lobster in 1973, back when the restaurant chain was only in the Southeast. (The company was called General Mills Restaurants, before General Mills spun it off as the behemoth Darden Restaurants in 1995. Heard of Olive Garden? LongHorn Steakhouse? Yeah, them.) Red Lobster's extraordinary growth — hundreds of new restaurants while Miller was there — meant lots of new jobs. In 1984 Miller joined Uno Restaurant Corp., helping transform pizza joint Pizzeria Uno into Uno Chicago Grill, where he landed his first CEO gig in 1996. By the time he left in 2001, Uno Chicago Grill had grown by more than 180 restaurants, creating yet more jobs. After a quick stint at already troubled Furr's Restaurant Group, he took on a higher-profile role at what became Ruth's Hospitality Group, where he was chief executive from 2004 to 2008. Before he left, he said, the high-end Ruth's Chris had added about 30 steak houses. 
So, to him, the math is simple: More than 700 new restaurants opened during his career, multiplied by an average number of about 60 new employees per restaurant, for more than 40,000 jobs. (For his specific estimates, see box.) Miller said his job claim did not include a National Restaurant Association stat-booster that says every restaurant job supports almost a full position elsewhere in the economy, which he figured would have put his job creation total ""somewhere north of 80,000 or 90,000."" 
""I tried to be conservative, because I come from a financial analysis background,"" he said. ""I wanted to make sure we don't overstate what I've done."" 
With Miller's calculus in hand, we started our own search, chatting with folks and digging through old news clips and earnings releases to piece together the numbers — and Miller's role in them. 
We'll accept the average-employees-per-restaurant figure of 62.5 that Miller used in making his claim — after checking with experts and industry data. And his estimates for the numbers of restaurants that popped up during his tenure at a handful of companies, while not exact, were generally close when we spot-checked them against business stories and earnings reports from the time. 
As for his role: Certainly, the guy has a reputation as a growth machine. 
Chris Muller, the dean of hospitality administration at Boston University, was an expert in chain restaurants at University of Central Florida when he met Miller. He named Miller UCF's restaurateur of the year in 2000 and featured him at a European food service conference. He also invested in Ruth's Chris when Miller took it public in 2005. 
He described Miller's approach as ""very aggressive"" as the head of Uno, which grew from just 10 to 15 restaurants when he joined as a vice president to nearly 200 when he left as CEO, and said he was similarly expansion-focused at Ruth's Chris, where he took the company public, creating additional pressure for growth. 
""So he does have a history of creating positions for people,"" Muller said. 
Of course, that growth also meant Ruth's Chris was stretched thin as the economy started to flail, and its stock price dove. The board asked Miller to leave in 2008. 
Miller's expansionist style had its ""positives and negatives,"" Muller said, but you couldn't deny he was a ""growth-oriented CEO."" 
But what about his role before he was a head honcho? 
Miller's campaign manager pointed us to Bill Bridges, who worked with Miller for most of the 1970s, starting at General Mills as director of personnel the year before Miller came on board. He recalls a bright, hard-working guy who analyzed sites for expansion and made presentations to the executive committee about where to build. 
""From that perspective, he was integral to the growth of the company,"" he said. 
Miller's own two-page biography says he held positions at General Mills in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing. But he was there for over a decade. We had to know: Did he jump in with both feet, spawning Red Lobsters from his first months at General Mills in his early 20s? 
And that's when part of the story got off track. 
In 1996, when Miller was named CEO of Uno Restaurant Corp., the Boston Business Journal wrote a profile. It told of Miller's journey from high-school dishwasher to Vietnam Air Force veteran to accounting major at Florida State University. Then it described his start with General Mills in Tallahassee, after he wrote the company a letter asking about positions at Red Lobster. He didn't yet have his business degree, but ""in 1973 became a part-time auditor of the local restaurant."" Later, the article says, he was asked to audit the books of another Red Lobster in Central Florida. He finished his degree at University of Central Florida in 1974, it says, and started working in payroll. 
Eventually he became vice president of finance. 
Which means Miller claims to have created jobs at restaurants that sprang up as he was a 20-something part-time auditor and then a payroll employee. It's not clear how long it took for him to reach management. 
The claim gets even murkier when you look closely at his own bio. 
General Mills Restaurants' success was led by the blockbuster growth of Red Lobster, which by 1983 — just 15 years after the first restaurant opened — had 350 locations in 36 states and had started to reach into Japan, according to New York Times article at the time. But while Craig Miller's General Mills career started with paper-pushing, the last part focused on a chain with a far less impressive legacy than Red Lobster. As a finance guy, Miller had helped General Mills put together the acquisition of small Mexican food chain Casa Gallardo, according to the Boston Business Journal. His biography notes that after that deal in 1979, his ""primary duties"" were as vice president of the Mexican chain. Starting with just a handful of restaurants — one, according to his bio, or five, according to the Business Journal — Miller and Ramon Gallardo took the Casa Gallardo chain to 34. The goal, said an article at the time, had been 100. Not long after Miller had moved on to Pizzeria Uno, General Mills dumped the chain, which by then numbered just 25. It had been profitable for General Mills, just not profitable enough. ""We didn't get it all put together with the speed that enabled us to capitalize,"" company spokesman Dean Belbas told Minneapolis-St. Paul City Business shortly after the sale. 
Why does any of this matter? Well, in Miller's back-of-the-napkin math, new Red Lobsters made up nearly half the jobs he claimed credit for. But those include new Red Lobsters while he was a part-time auditor. New Red Lobsters while he worked in payroll. New Red Lobsters while he worked in finance. New Red Lobsters as he built Casa Gallardo. 
His campaign's response? 
""He was the top financial and economic adviser to the CEO and was directly involved in all aspects of the company's business, even while serving as vice president of Casa Gallardo,"" campaign manager Paul Ciaramitaro said. ""Craig had a vital hand in the company expansion and job creation at General Mills during the 1970s and into the 1980s."" 
But was Miller ultimately responsible? More so than Red Lobster's founder, Bill Darden, or the man who followed in his footsteps, former Darden Restaurants chairman and CEO Joe Lee? 
Joe Lee did tell the Boston Business Journal in 1996 he considered Miller ""one of the industry's top leaders."" (We attempted to reach him at home, unsuccessfully.) But we would dare to speculate he wouldn't credit Miller with every job at every restaurant General Mills added from 1973 to 1984. 
Where does this leave us? 
Several folks told us that Miller's a respected restaurateur. Like Herman Cain, a former president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, he served in leadership there as chairman of the board. Companies grew dramatically under his corporate leadership. 
But to reach 40,000 jobs created, Miller takes credit for thousands of jobs he wasn't in a position to create. Growth at Red Lobster, early in his career, accounts for 46 percent of his estimate — and it's a stretch to credit him for even half of that. 
He also counts job gains only and not losses — something any politician relying on net job creation numbers can't do. And we can't know how many jobs he actually added to communities — for every Casa Gallardo, a local mom-and-pop may have closed or had layoffs — though in strong economies, every job may have indeed added to the overall total. 
Make no mistake, our reporting shows Miller was a gung ho restaurant CEO who stressed expansion and by extension, job creation. A lower jobs number may have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter. But 40,000 jobs? He just hasn't proved it. We rate this claim Barely True. 
Here's how Craig Miller breaks down his career job creation, with Red Lobster representing nearly half of the total: 
Miller's role: Joined as president and CEO; from Sept. 2006, also chairman of the board 
Restaurants added by company during tenure: 37 
Estimated jobs created: 2,313 
Miller's role: Joined as vice president for administration responsible for development and franchising, became executive vice president/chief operating officer, then in 1996 president and chief executive officer 
Restaurants added by company during tenure: About 185 
Estimated jobs created: 11,563 
Miller's role: Joined as part-time auditor before earning college degree; moved to payroll; held positions in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing; after acquisition of Casa Gallardo in 1979, primary duties were as vice president of Casa Gallardo 
Restaurants added by company during tenure: Casa Gallardo, about 30; Red Lobster, about 325; other brands, about 125 
Estimated jobs created: 30,000 
Sources: Craig Miller campaign, Boston Business Journal

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says unemployment streak is worst since Great Depression
","
Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio accused President Barack Obama of making ""every aspect of life in America today"" worse since his inauguration during a talk about the debt ceiling on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on July 17, 2011. 
Host Bob Schieffer asked Rubio if he literally meant what he said, so Rubio continued: 
""Well, first of all, let -- every president has to be judged by the times in which he lives. This president has now been in charge for two and a half years, okay? He has increased federal spending by 28 percent. Washington went along with his prescription for joblessness, which was the stimulus package, and unemployment is higher than it was when he took over, significantly higher. In fact, we have not had unemployment this high for this long since the Great Depression, with no signs of it getting better."" 
We noticed Rubio evokes a popular historical note of Republicans -- the Great Depression -- to characterize the country's dire jobs outlook. He isn't the first politician to link now with then, though he might be the first whose claim has a ring of truth. 
Previously, PolitiFact gave GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney a False for saying the United States is in the slowest job recovery since President Herbert Hoover (1929-1933). And Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus earned a similar False rating for claiming that recent unemployment rates rival those of the Great Depression. 
Rubio's claim comes with an important distinction. Instead of comparing recent jobless numbers with the 1930s, he says we have not had unemployment this high for this long since the Great Depression. Unemployment during that time was dreadful, as we've outlined before, rising to 15.9 percent in 1931 and then shooting up to 24.9 percent in 1933. It returned to 9.9 percent in 1941. 
Unemployment figures for the current recession first tipped above 9 percent in May 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rates mostly fell between 9 and 10.1 percent for the past 26 months, with the exception of dips in February (8.9) and March 2011 (8.8). The rate for June 2011 is 9.2 percent. 
How does that compare to other periods of time since the Great Depression? 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics only has unemployment data going back to 1948, which means we cannot analyze unemployment statistics from the years surrounding World War II. (We know, however, that unemployment was abnormally low during that time because of the war effort.) 
But since 1948, only one period of time comes close. Unemployment rates of 9 percent of more appeared in the United States in March 1982 and lasted through September 1983. During that 19-month period, the unemployment ranged between 9 and 10.8 percent -- including 10 straight months of unemployment rates higher than 10 percent. 
During the most recent economic downturn, the only time the unemployment rate nosed above 10 percent was for one month, in October 2009. 
So the current economic downturn has a longer period of unemployment rates above 9 percent, but the 1982-83 recession had overall higher unemployment rates. 
No other period in modern U.S. history compares. 
Rubio is right on about the country's current unemployment outlook not being ""this high for this long since the Great Depression."" But he fails to note a comparable period in the early '80s that -- while shorter by seven months -- had several months of higher overall unemployment.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Brian Kemp']","
Kemp claim on fines on the money
","
Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp wasn’t fond of a recent column critical of the state’s voter identification requirements.

Kemp wrote a letter to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution criticizing the newspaper’s columnist Cynthia Tucker’s take on Georgia’s law. She argued Republicans like Kemp support requirements to have voters to show ID at the polls as a covert effort to suppress some traditionally Democratic-leaning groups.

That’s nonsense, Kemp wrote. He said there’s plenty of evidence of voter fraud in Georgia. Kemp’s detailed response included a statistic that a couple of PolitiFact readers asked us to check out.

""The State Election Board has issued nearly $275,000 in fines to violators of absentee ballot laws,"" he wrote.

The number seemed high, considering that most fines are typically in the $500 range.

So what did we find? First, let’s review how absentee voting works in Georgia.

In response to complaints about waiting hours in line to vote, the Georgia Legislature voted in 2005 to make voting by absentee ballot much easier. Voters no longer were required to explain why they wouldn’t be around on Election Day and could vote by absentee ballot.

Georgia law allows someone to fill out an absentee ballot for a physically-disabled person or a family member who is temporarily not in the county where he or she is registered to vote.

Still, there are cases of absentee ballot fraud and they have put election officials and state leaders on the defensive. Those officials still insist there are enough safeguards to spot fraud. ""You have a signature record, a paper trail that can be tracked back,"" then Gov. Sonny Perdue was quoted in a 2006 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article.

Kemp didn’t say over what time span his claim covered, which we worried could be a stumbling block in fact-checking his statement. But Matt Carrothers, media relations director for the office, forwarded us a spreadsheet he put together with a breakdown of each fine for 59 violators of absentee ballot law since 2007. We thought four years was a reasonable time frame to fact-check Kemp’s numbers. The total was actually higher than Kemp’s claim, $329,200.

Kemp, by the way, was appointed to the position in January 2010 after the prior officeholder, Karen Handel, resigned to run for governor.

Nearly half of that total came from one case, resulting in what Carrothers believes is the largest fine against one person that the board has even issued. In 2007, Jackson City Council candidate Larry Pickett filed a complaint with the Secretary of State’s office that his opponent Tommy Raney and campaign worker Debra Brown committed voter fraud in the November 2006 election.

The state’s investigation found Raney helped 50 people file absentee ballots and voter registration applications and didn’t inform election officials, as state law requires. Raney also mailed 27 absentee ballots, a felony, the state said. Brown, the officials said, mishandled 20 ballots in various ways, along with filling out and signing an absentee ballot for a man. The state found 47 ballots were improperly handled in Raney’s race. He won the election by 27 votes.

""I think this is so egregious,"" Handel said during an August 2009 hearing on the matter. ""Here is an individual who was the candidate and...full well knew what the law was.""

Raney’s fine -- $158,000.

Brown was fined $20,000. Raney later resigned his council seat. He and Brown pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit absentee ballot fraud and sentenced to two years probation.

Another case that contributed significantly to the number that Kemp used in his letter was an $80,000 fine the board approved in 2007 on Jerry Metts, who investigators say helped a handful of illegal immigrants cast absentee ballots in Atkinson County in South Georgia during a 2004 county commission race.

Those three fines alone total $255,000, which is close to Kemp’s claim.

We were able to match some cases on Carrothers’ spreadsheet with meeting minutes involving cases of absentee ballot fraud. One case involved wrongly filing ballots for nursing home patients. Another case involved a woman who faxed previously used absentee ballots for members of a church to election officials in DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. The woman said she was unaware her efforts violated Georgia election law.

There were several cases of people who voted in elections in one county, although they lived in another county.

These cases and others we found put the total over the $275,000 mark that Kemp mentioned. We rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/19/brian-kemp/kemp-claim-fines-money/

State Sen. Kris Jordan says 'fracking' has been used more than 60 years in Ohio
","
During a recent debate in the Ohio Senate over a proposed law to allow drilling at state parks, some lawmakers focused on fracking, an increasingly controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from underground.

Republican Sen. Kris Jordan was among those to defend process. He questioned why Democrats and others were so worried, considering fracking’s long history in Ohio.

""The process of fracturing or horizontally fracking the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas in order to make it financially feasible to drill the wells – this process has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio,"" Jordan said on the Senate floor on June 15.

Considering that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracturing’s effects on drinking water and since fracking will remain a topic of interest as more oil and gas companies are expected to tap Ohio’s natural gas deposits, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Jordan’s claim.

So what is fracking?

Fracking -- hydraulic fracturing -- is a technique that uses a combination of water, sand and chemicals to free up natural gas or oil beneath the surface.

First, a well is drilled. Then, the fluid is shot down the well at high pressure, causing rock formations to crack and release natural gas or oil. The fracking fluid is then either recycled, stored in deep underground wells or treated.

Concerns over fracking have grown lately for a variety of reasons. Chesapeake Energy temporarily halted fracking operations in Bradford County, Pa., after a well blew out in April, causing thousands of gallons of fracking fluid to spill into a nearby waterway.

Such incidents have coincided with the increased popularity of the ""Gasland,"" a documentary made in 2010, which attempts to show the environmental dangers of fracking, including a scene about flammable tap water.

We called Jordan to find out more about fracking in Ohio. He said his information came from Thomas Stewart, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association’s executive vice president and lobbyist. ""I’ll trust him as one of the experts,"" Jordan said.

Indeed, we found an April interview in which Stewart said pretty much the same thing as Jordan: ""We’ve been fracturing wells in the state of Ohio since the early 1950s. There’s been over 80,000 wells hydraulically fractured in the state of Ohio,"" Stewart said then.

According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which regulates oil and gas drilling in Ohio, hydraulic fracturing in Ohio began 59 years ago in 1952. From that year to 2009, 80,306 wells were hydraulically fractured.

So it appears Jordan is pretty much on the mark. He was a little off when he said fracking has occurred for more than 60 years, the fact remains the technique has been around for decades.

But Jordan’s and Stewart’s statements are not exactly the same. The difference highlights environmentalists’ growing concerns.

Jordan mentioned ""horizontal"" fracturing while Stewart made no such distinction. Stewart actually discussed the differences between vertical and horizontal fracturing in his April interview.

Horizontal fracturing is related to horizontal drilling, a newer drilling method in which a well is first drilled vertically into the ground, then horizontally for thousands of feet. This allows drillers to access more underground resources through a single vertical well.

Of the more than 80,000 Ohio wells that have been fracked, 39 have been horizontally fractured, according to ODNR. The overwhelming majority of fracturing jobs have been for vertical wells.

An ODNR geologist and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association say both vertical and horizontal fracturing are equally safe when properly regulated.

But to environmentalists, the difference is important.

Ellen Mee, director of environmental health policy for the Ohio Environmental Council, said the more recent, horizontal fracturing method is more dangerous because it uses more water and more chemicals to extract the gas. And the fracking fluid is shot at a higher pressure.

Mee also noted recent accidents at sites conducting horizontal fracking – a preferred method to extract natural gas from shale formations around Pennsylvania and New York.

""The difference is really quite significant,"" Mee said. ""We’re really talking about a significantly risky endeavor.""

Tom Tomastik, an ODNR geologist, disagreed. He said the potential for problems are the same. Tomastik said past problems with hydraulic fracturing in Ohio were due to faulty well construction rather than perceived flaws in the fracking process. Tomastik said the media has irresponsibly hyped the dangers of fracking.

""It’s made it look like this technology is hazardous and causes all kinds of problems when we can demonstrate that it hasn’t,"" Tomastik said.

In a fact sheet available online, ODNR stresses that none of its water well investigations since 1990 have uncovered problems caused by hydraulic fracturing. The fact sheet also addresses fears that fracking could contaminate drinking waters. It is ""impossible for frack fluid to travel upward thousands of feet, or between rock formations and into freshwater aquifers,"" according to the ODNR.

A recent study by Duke University researchers did show that houses near sites that used horizontal fracturing to extract natural gas in New York and Pennsylvania were more likely to have methane contamination in drinking water systems. But the study failed to directly connect the contamination to fracking activity.

""More research is needed across this and other regions to determine the mechanism(s) controlling the higher methane concentrations we observed,"" the report said.

Where does that leave Jordan’s claim?

Jordan correctly cites the statistic for the number of times hydraulic fracturing has been used on wells in Ohio. And while he overstated the time frame slightly, he wasn’t off by much. His underlying point, though, was that hydraulic fracturing is not new to Ohio and, he argues, that the technique is relatively safe.

But he specifically mentioned horizontal fracturing, which is a much newer technique. When we asked him about the discrepancy, Jordan said he assumed all the fracturing in Ohio was horizontal. ""Maybe I didn’t ask if it was horizontal or vertical,"" Jordan said.

That’s an important fact to know, especially since the state says horizontal fracturing has only been used 39 times in Ohio.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the statement Half True.

"['New Jersey', 'Stimulus', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
NRCC says stimulus supported by New Jersey Democrats cost $278,000 per job
","
Republicans in Congress were not functioning independently of one another on their first workday after the Independence Day holiday.

Shortly after noon on July 5, House Speaker John Boehner ""tweeted"" a July 3 blog posting from the conservative Weekly Standard’s website, labeling it ""POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job.""

Around 4 p.m., the National Republican Congressional Committee followed suit with multiple press releases that used the same Weekly Standard blog item to target dozens of Democrats in Congress, including New Jersey’s Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. Its headline: ""New Report Shows Dems’ Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse."" It went on to claim that Holt’s and Pallone's ""government spending spree"" ""delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China.""

By 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: ""President Obama’s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job.""

Our sister website, PolitiFact Ohio, thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, they used his tweet.

The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ""saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.""  It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill’s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion.

The $278,000 per job figure doesn’t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000.

The blog item contends this statistic ""provides further evidence that President Obama’s ‘stimulus’ did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,"" and insists ""the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus’ and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead.""

After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokeswoman Jay Carney said its conclusions were ""based on partial information and simply false analysis."" White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries ""that are critical to America’s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America’s working families.""

The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects.

Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure.

Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report’s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure.

Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A ""fact check"" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math ""satisfyingly simple but highly misleading.""

""Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,"" the 2009 Associated Press item noted.

The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually ""has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs."" It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now.

Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data.

""It’s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA’s help,"" Zandi told TPMDC. ""This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery.""

The day after the White House responded to the GOP’s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but ""rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000.""  

Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply ""cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus?’""

So where does that leave Boehner’s tweet -- and the identical claim from the NRCC -- that a report said the stimulus had cost $278,000 per job? 
On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the tweet (and the subsequent variations of the claim) as False.

Marc Morial says black unemployment has actually worsened during recovery
","
During a discussion of high unemployment on the July 17, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, turned the spotlight on unemployment among African Americans.

""We have a jobs crisis in America,"" said Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans, ""and I think that the debt-ceiling discussion should be decoupled from the deficit discussion, and the nation needs a jobs plan. We have 14 million people out of work. The black unemployment rate is at stifling levels. It's, in fact, increased since the recovery has begun. ""

We decided to check whether the black unemployment rate has gotten worse since the recovery began.

We looked at federal Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers starting in June 2009 -- the month the National Bureau of Economic Research determined was the end of the last recession and the start of the recovery.

In June 2009, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 14.9 percent. In the most recent month, June 2011, the rate was 16.2. So the black unemployment rate definitely did rise over that period.

If you look closer at the numbers, they have actually zig-zagged a bit. The rate peaked at 16.5 percent in March and April 2010, before falling as low as 15.3 percent in February 2011. Since then, the rate has climbed almost a full percentage point over four months.

Still, in the period Morial specified, the black unemployment rate increased by more than a full percentage point.

We should note that Morial has some justification for focusing on black unemployment rates.

Of the four major ethnic groups tracked by BLS -- whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asian Americans -- only blacks saw unemployment rise over the period Morial cited.

White unemployment dropped from 8.7 percent to 8.1 percent from June 2009 to June 2011. Hispanic unemployment dropped from 12.2 percent to 11.6 percent. And Asian unemployment dropped from 8.2 percent to 6.8 percent. All told, the overall unemployment rate fell from 9.5 percent to 9.2 percent.

In fact, some segments of the black labor force showed even higher rates of unemployment. For instance, the most recent unemployment rate for blacks between the ages of 16 and 24 years was 31.4 percent.

We find nothing amiss in Morial’s claim that ""the black unemployment rate (has) increased since the recovery has begun."" So we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/18/marc-morial/marc-morial-says-black-unemployment-has-actually-w/
