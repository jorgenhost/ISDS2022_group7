Josh Mandel says Sherrod Brown has sided with Washington bureaucrats and fringe extremists on fracking
","
Note to Athens, Ohio, residents: Your mayor and other elected officials in your part of Ohio are fringe extremists.

You may disagree with that statement, but then, you probably support the Washington bureaucrats who halted leasing in the Wayne National Forest for fracking. What’s that? It wasn’t a Washington bureaucrat who made that decision but, rather, a forester in Ohio?

Well, as Emily Litella used to say on Saturday Night Live: Never mind.

With apologies to the late Gilda Radner, these claims about fringe elements and Washington bureaucrats owe themselves to Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer. Mandel, a Republican now running for U.S. Senate, criticized incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat,  after Brown told Ohio Public Radio on Nov. 28 that he supports a local decision to remove 3,302 acres of national forest in southeast Ohio from a federal auction of land for oil and gas exploration.

The land is in a part of the state where hydraulic fracking could yield big dividends, although there are a lot of uncertainties. Fracking is shorthand for fracturing, and it involves drilling deep into the ground and injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to fracture the shale and release the natural gas or oil trapped there. Geologists and energy industry officials say a potential windfall of gas lies in the Utica shale formation, and to a lesser extent the Marcellus shale, beneath eastern Ohio.

Fracking has its critics, including those who say the chemicals used in the process might contaminate groundwater. A number of experts, including the geologists at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, say fracking is safe and that human error, the real cause of problems, can be avoided with proper state regulation.

We mention that because Anne Carey, supervisor of the Wayne National Forest, was concerned about fracking’s impact on the Wayne National Forest. She recommended that the forest be removed from the Dec. 7 federal auction until there could be further review. That could take up to six months, and will deal with fracking’s effect on forest land, not groundwater. A Wayne National Forest already allows for other drilling -- and there are 1,300 shallow wells there -- but fracking could require removing far more trees, according to The Columbus Dispatch.

In an interview, Brown said he supported Carey’s decision, noting that numerous local officials had concerns about fracking in the area.

Mandel then criticized Brown.

In a Dec. 2, 2011, column Mandel wrote in The Wall Street Journal, the treasurer said: ""Adding to the public outrage here is the position taken by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who this week announced his support of the federal government's job-killing decision. Even though the vilification of Ohio's abundant coal, oil and gas disproportionately hurts jobs and energy prices here, Mr. Brown has chosen to side with Washington bureaucrats and fringe extremists in the attacks on our natural resources.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at the last part of his claim; that Brown has chosen to side with bureaucrats and fringe extremists.

We started with the part about ""Washington bureaucrats.""

Carey, who made the recommendation, told The Athens News that her entire career with the Forest Service ""has been at the local level.""

Jane Cliff, the media officer for the U.S. Forest Service’s eastern region, headquartered in Milwaukee, told us that Chuck Myers, the region’s forester, accepted it and the Wayne National Forest was removed from the auction. Myers also is based in Milwaukee.

As for the ""fringe extremists,"" among the people who wanted to apply the brakes in the Wayne National Forest were Roderick McDavis, president of Ohio University; the Athens County commissioners, and Athens Mayor Paul Wiehl.

Wiehl won re-election recently in what could be called a landslide, getting 71 percent of the vote, according to The Athens News. Granted, Athens is a university town with a lot of Democrats, and Wiehl wants to keep fracking out of the city. But so did his Republican opponent, according to news coverage.

Wiehl told PolitiFact Ohio his concern is that there is a gold rush-like frenzy to frack because of the potential for prosperity, without what he considers to be enough caution. An accident in the forest near the Hocking River basin could affect Athens’ drinking water.

""I don’t consider myself to be fringe-like,"" he said. ""I consider myself to be cautious or a little bit conservative as to how this is done.""

There has been a lot of debate about this issue in southeast Ohio. Mandel has tapped into that, with his spokesman calling this ""a defining  issue over the next year"" and Mandel saying that the fracking boom represents a way out of economic stagnation.

But does the removal of acreage in Wayne National Forest represent a real setback to this boom? We asked Tom Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, how much land in the scheme of Ohio fracking this represents.

""The bulk of eastern Ohio is leased,"" he said. ""I don’t know what that acreage would be. It would be a huge number.""

In other words, fracking is going on in so many other places that the Wayne acreage represents a mere blip. The Plain Dealer and other newspapers have reported that one company alone, Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy, has leased 1.5 million acres in Ohio so it can drill 12,000 wells. And The Plain Dealer reported in October that gas and oil-rich shale may lie under 5 million acres of rural Ohio landscape.

That compares with 3,302 acres that the Wayne has taken off the table for now.

So let’s recap:

Josh Mandel is all for fracking if it follows safe, acceptable practices. He sees it as a potentially huge economic win for Ohio. Sherrod Brown says he, too, is for fracking, but he says he understands the concerns of the Wayne National Forest supervisor, the mayor of Athens, the county commissioners and the university president, and he supports the decision for a delay to allow further study.

It would be easy to just say that Brown’s support for fracking comes with more qualifications, or that he deferred to the local officials. It would be true. But it would lack outrage, and outrage, apparently, is what Mandel was going for. He said that Brown sided with ""fringe extremists,"" when these individuals happen to be a mayor, county commissioners and a state university president. And Mandel said Brown sided with ""Washington bureaucrats,"" when the woman making the call was in Ohio. Her boss who signed off was in Wisconsin.

Political criticism is fair game. But it’s a stretch to equate a national forest supervisor in Southeast Ohio and her boss in Wisconsin as Washington bureaucrats.

And when rhetoric gets ridiculous -- when a public official running for office implies that an Ohio mayor, county commissioners, a major university president and a federal forest supervisor are fringe extremists -- PolitiFact Ohio has one rating for it: Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1226C0>],/factchecks/2011/dec/07/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-has-sided-washingto/

Newt Gingrich says unemployment only dropped because of people who stopped looking for work
","During a Dec. 5, 2011, news conference, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich tried to take the wind out of White House celebrations about the previous week’s jobs report. The statistics for November 2011 were generally regarded as a political plus for President Barack Obama, since they showed the unemployment rate falling to 8.6 percent from 9.0 percent in October, its lowest level since March 2009, just two months after Obama took office.

""I think the president has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing, he kills jobs in virtually every part of American life. I mean, notice -- the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created.""

We’re going to check this statement in two parts. In this item, we’ll check the claim that ""the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created."" In another item, we’re checking the claim that President Barack Obama ""has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing.""

First, some background about how the unemployment rate is put together. Using a survey of Americans, the Bureau of Labor Statistics determines which respondents are working (either full or part time), which respondents are not working but are looking for work and which ones are not looking for work. The unemployment rate is determined by taking the number of people who are unemployed but are looking for work, and dividing it by the sum of two categories -- those who are employed, plus those who aren’t employed but who are looking for work.

In other words, the third broad category of survey respondents -- those who are able to work but who are not actively searching for jobs -- are ignored by this statistic. These may include people who have decided to return to school, who have chosen to take care of their children, who have become dejected and stopped looking or some combination of these categories.

What this means is that either of two factors could combine to push the unemployment rate lower -- either more people become employed or more people could stop looking actively for work.

So in a literal sense, Gingrich is wrong that the shrinking labor force is ""the only reason the unemployment rate is going down."" It’s a combination of a shrinking labor force and the increase in jobs.

What about the notion that the shrinkage in the labor force was twice the size of the increase in jobs?

Judging by the November 2011 data that was widely reported in the media, Gingrich would seem to be right. There were two headline numbers. One was that the economy created a net 120,000 jobs, specifically an increase of 140,000 in the private sector and a decrease of 20,000 government jobs. The other was that the number of people either employed or actively looking for work declined by 315,000.

Using these statistics, Gingrich actually undersold the numbers. The shrinkage in the labor force was 2.6 times the size of the increase in jobs, not merely twice the number.

But while these numbers are fine to use in isolation, Gingrich runs into problems when he links them, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. That’s because the two numbers originate with different surveys that have different methodologies.

As we noted, the unemployment rate is calculated using a survey of Americans that asks whether they are working, looking for work, or not actively looking. This is called the Current Population Survey, or CPS. While the CPS does calculate the number of jobs gained or lost per month, the usual measurement for jobs gained or lost comes from a survey of employer payrolls known as the Current Employment Statistics.

Because the CES is almost always the source of employment figures used in government and media reports, it’s understandable why Gingrich turned to it as his benchmark. However, a comparison such as the one he made is one of the exceptions to the rule that CES employment numbers are preferred. To be statistically consistent, Burtless said, you have to use figures from the Current Population Survey.

Due to some methodological quirks -- for instance, self-employed Americans are counted by CPS but not by CES -- the monthly increase or decrease in jobs tends to vary somewhat between the two surveys. For November 2011, the CES found a net increase of 120,000 jobs, but the CPS found a net increase of 278,000 jobs. That’s a whole lot closer to the 315,000 Americans who dropped out of the labor market.

So, using the CPS numbers, the decline in the labor force is not twice the number of jobs created, as Gingrich said -- it’s only 1.1 times the amount.

Our ruling

Gingrich would have been correct if he’d simply challenged the White House’s spin by reminding voters that the big drop in the unemployment rate came not just from the jobs created in the previous month but also from workers who left the labor force. However, he overplayed his hand by arguing that ""the only reason the unemployment rate is going down"" is because of labor force shrinkage. It was by no means the only reason. There were thousands of jobs created too.

Gingrich also erred by using the wrong survey in his numerical comparison. (We feel for him: Until Burtless straightened us out, we had thought Gingrich had reported the numbers accurately.) Using the appropriate survey data, the decline in the unemployment rate stemmed in roughly equal parts from job creation and a shrinking labor force. He can't put the blame ""only"" on people who stopped looking for work. So we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736a198d-c5ed-4d2e-80ae-5aa7ada93f14",[<zip object at 0x0000028097280040>],/factchecks/2011/dec/06/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-unemployment-only-dropped-becau/

Newt Gingrich says Barack Obama has killed jobs in energy, manufacturing
","During a Dec. 5, 2011, news conference, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich took aim at President Barack Obama’s record on jobs.

""I think the president has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing, he kills jobs in virtually every part of American life. I mean, notice -- the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created.""

We’re going to check this statement in two parts. In this item, we’ll check the claim that President Barack Obama ""has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing."" In a separate item, we’ll check the claim that ""the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created.""

For this item, we're focusing on Gingrich’s claim’s about energy and manufacturing jobs.

We used data showing net changes in jobs -- that is, jobs created minus jobs lost -- rather than just jobs lost (or ""killed""). We are also interpreting Gingrich’s comment to mean that Obama is the cause for killing existing jobs, not that Obama has prevented theoretical future jobs from materializing.

Now, to the numbers, which are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We looked at two time periods -- one between January 2009 and November 2011, which represents the entirety of Obama’s time in office, and the other between January 2010 and November 2011, which covers the period starting one year into his presidency, a point at which one would assume that Obama’s policies have begun to have some impact.

Energy jobs

For energy, we found two relevant categories in the BLS data, oil and gas extraction and mining.

During the entire Obama presidency, employment in the oil and gas extraction sector grew by 18,800 jobs, or an increase of 11 percent. Over the same period, jobs in mining declined by 9,200, or 4 percent. Combining the two categories, energy jobs grew by 9,600 jobs, or 2 percent.

Beginning one year into Obama’s presidency, oil and gas extraction jobs increased by 27,500, a rise of 18 percent. Mining jobs grew by 14,900, or 8 percent. Combined, the two sectors increased by 42,400 jobs, or 12 percent.

So over both periods, the energy sector grew in absolute terms -- and if you measure beginning in January 2010, the increase has been quite healthy at 12 percent over two years.

Manufacturing jobs

During the entire Obama presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined by 795,000, or 6 percent. Since January 2010, though, the number of manufacturing jobs has increased by 299,000, a rise of 2.6 percent over two years.

The increase since January 2010 is modest -- a bit over 1 percent per year -- and it hasn’t come close to bringing manufacturing employment back up to the level it was when Obama was inaugurated in the midst of a severe recession. Yet the rise in Obama’s second and third year becomes more robust once it’s put into historical context.

In general, manufacturing employment has declined more or less steadily since the mid-1970s. The last time manufacturing jobs saw such a large and sustained numerical increase was in the early 1990s. So while the increase in years two and three of the Obama presidency is relatively small, it is the best in about two decades.

One way to illustrate the long-term decline of manufacturing jobs is to look at how the numbers have moved during the past few presidencies. In the list below, we began counting from one year into each president’s tenure through to the end of their term. Using that methodology, here are the numbers of manufacturing jobs gained or lost per year:

Barack Obama: Increase of 157,368 manufacturing jobs per year in office
George W. Bush: Decrease of 434,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office
Bill Clinton: Increase of 37,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office
George H.W. Bush: Decrease of 336,000 manufacturing jobs per year in office
Ronald Reagan: Increase of 1,429 manufacturing jobs per year in office
Jimmy Carter: Increase of 15,333 manufacturing jobs per year in office

So by this measure, manufacturing jobs have actually increased by more under Obama than under any of his recent predecessors.

A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter.

Our ruling

Gingrich is free to argue that environmental regulations, tax policies and the like have prevented  the energy and manufacturing sectors from creating as many jobs as they otherwise might. But in this case, Ginrgich said that Obama ""has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing."" That’s a different standard, one which means that Obama’s policies have destroyed existing jobs on a net basis.

Right off the bat, we need to downgrade Gingrich’s statement due to its allocation of blame. The job market is subject to many factors, not just Obama’s policies, so it’s unfair to lay all of the blame on the president. But even on the numbers, the claim’s accuracy is mixed at best.

Combined, energy extraction jobs have increased in absolute numbers since Obama took office and have risen quite rapidly over the past two years. Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs are down over the course of Obama’s presidency, but they are up during the past two years at the fastest pace in two decades. On balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/050fd79e-a562-4189-902e-5f16a84d8b04",[<zip object at 0x000002809C079940>],/factchecks/2011/dec/06/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-barack-obama-has-killed-jobs-en/

Oregon district attorney puts opposition to capital punishment at 25 percent
","Death penalty politics are back in vogue after Gov. John Kitzhaber’s recent decision to suspend capital punishment for the remainder of his term.

Carla Axtman a contributor to the Democratic blog Blue Oregon got into the discussion over the governor’s executive move by posting a short news excerpt and some quick encouragement: ""Well done, Gov.""

Naturally, this set off a pretty long debate that pulled in, among others, Clatsop County District Attorney Josh Marquis, a longtime supporter of the death penalty. In one of his responses on the blog, he told opponents that they ""were in a minority of about 25 percent.""

That caught our attention. Could it be that only a quarter of Americans oppose the death penalty?

Our first stop was Gallup, the polling organization, which has recorded the national appetite for capital punishment for more than seven decades. Gallup’s most recent survey, conducted October 2011, asked respondents whether they were ""in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder."" The response was 61 percent in favor, 35 percent opposed and 4 percent without an opinion.

Generally, the data that Gallup has on hand shows a growing discomfort nationally with the death penalty. In the mid-1960s, opposition eclipsed those in favor, but it soon began to fall until the mid-’90s when opposition hit an all-time low of 16 percent. Since then, the tide has turned again, and opposition has been on a slow climb. Of course, it’s still clear the majority of those polled favor capital punishment in some cases.

One other poll from late September 2011, this one done by CNN, showed that 50 percent of respondents favored life in prison as a penalty for murder, while 48 percent favored the death penalty.

We called Marquis to see whether he had any evidence to back up his claim. He had a lot to say.

First, he clarified that he wasn’t talking nationally, he was referring to Oregon specifically when he made that 25 percent comment. As for his evidence, he said that back in 2002, there was a group that was considering mounting a campaign to abolish the death penalty in Oregon. But, he said, they backed off after polls showed just 20 to 25 percent opposed.

We pointed out that Gallup showed similar numbers 10 years ago, but since then the number opposed has changed. Marquis was unconvinced. He said the poll’s question made the issue appear too black and white. He also felt that the national poll wasn’t representative of Oregon.

""Most importantly what about OREGON? You say that the numbers I cited from 2002 are too old but unless someone has documented numbers from OREGON, not nationally, where 15 states do NOT have capital punishment, I don't see how the comparison can be made,"" he wrote in one of several follow-up e-mails.

In subsequent e-mails, he pointed us to polls in California (where 68 percent supported the death penalty), and Connecticut (where 67 were in support). He then cited a national Angus Reid poll conducted in October that showed support at 70 percent and opposition at 20 percent.

Finally he presented us with this argument: ""The last ‘poll’ of any significance was the 1984 vote in Oregon which was 75% in favor.""

There, he is referring to the year in which Oregonians put capital punishment back on the books after abolishing it decades earlier.

Oregonians voted on two related measures in 1984. One exempted the death penalty from the part of the Oregon Constitution that bars cruel and unusual punishment. That measure passed with 55 percent in favor. The second granted a separate sentencing hearing before the trial jury to those convicted of aggravated murder and gave juries the power to sentence convicts to death. That was the vote that passed with 75 percent of the vote.

Still, those votes were taken nearly 17 years ago before DNA evidence in several states cleared a number of convicts on death row and doubts about eyewitness testimony were widely publicized. In addition, officials in some states have flip-fopped, citing the public cost of protracted death penalty appeals.

We talked to Stuart Elway, an independent pollster up in Seattle who works regionally. First we asked him what he thought about the Gallup poll and whether Marquis’ criticism seemed fair. He said it’s possible that the question, if asked differently, could elicit a slightly changed result -- but only a couple points in either direction. ""In a question where public opinion is pretty settled the wording makes less difference than when asking about some tax policy that (a respondent has) never heard about before.""

He did, however, agree with Marquis that it wasn’t necessarily fair to tie the national polls to Oregon. Attitudes differ regionally and could certain affect the results by 5 to 10 points.

Still, Elway said, the fact that Oregon was trending with the nation in 2002, probably indicates that the trend Gallup has found over the past few decades is somewhat present in Oregon as well.

All that said, the facts are these: There is no recent Oregon-specific polling regarding the death penalty and national polls tend to vary pretty wildly, depending on how the question is asked.

Marquis is basing his statement on numbers from at least a decade ago. The Gallup and CNN polls seem to indicated that the national mood is changing. How true this is for Oregon, we can’t say, but neither can Marquis. With PolitiFact, the burden of proof is always on the speaker.

Marquis’ statement might have the smallest grain of truth, but it ignores some important details. We give his statement that death penalty opponents are ""in a minority of about 25 percent"" a Half True.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Thomas Brown']","
Were DeKalb construction projects completed under budget?
","
DeKalb County Sheriff Thomas Brown recently took to the microphone at a few radio stations to talk about education.

Surprised? We were. And so we continued to listen.

Brown was on the airwaves before the Nov. 8 elections to encourage DeKalb residents to vote for continuing a 1 percent sales tax to fund education construction projects.

The sheriff explained his interest in the topic. A large number of the inmates in the county jail don’t have high school diplomas, and it costs about $50 a day to house and feed them. Brown then made a claim that had us reaching for the Truth-O-Meter.

""Most of, if not all of, the projects always came in on or were under budget,"" the sheriff told V-103 during the popular Frank & Wanda morning show the day before the election.

Brown repeated similar versions of that claim on other radio programs that day.

Ballot initiatives on education spending usually pass with ease, but this was no sure thing. Several former DeKalb school officials, including former Superintendent Crawford Lewis, are awaiting trial on corruption charges.

Despite that dark cloud, about 60 percent of DeKalb residents voted to continue the tax. We still wondered whether the sheriff deserved high marks for his claim or was he wrong.

Walter Woods, the communications director for the DeKalb County School System, gave us a spreadsheet with 134 projects that have been funded by the latest version of the tax, called the SPLOST III Capital Improvement Program. The program has a budget of about $513 million. Most of the projects under SPLOST III are scheduled to be completed by June 2012.

Of those projects, 103 have been completed. Many of the completed projects were for work such as security lighting or carpet replacement. We didn’t consider them as construction projects. We examined projects such as roof replacements (which often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars), renovations and work to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.

About 85 percent of those projects were done on or under budget. Some of the projects that exceeded the initial cost doubled the earlier budget. They included the track and tennis court at Chapel Hill Middle School, which had an original budget of $125,000 and have a current contract of $255,522. Another was the natatorium work at Lakeside High School, which had an original budget of $150,000 and now has a current contract of $288,506. Others went slightly over budget, such as ceiling, lighting and air conditioning work at Fairington Elementary School, which had an original budget of $1,917,131 and has a current contract of $1,947,809.

Many of the projects that were done below the original budget came in 30 percent to 50 percent below costs.

Lynn Deutsch, a DeKalb parent who closely watches how the school district spends its money, believes the Great Recession, which took hold in the latter months of 2008, has caused construction costs to drop, which is why most of the projects completed have come in on or under budget.

""Things got cheaper,"" she said.

Ken Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America, told us that construction costs dipped after the recession and have since gradually increased. Simonson, however, said the decline in construction work across the country has prompted more companies to bid on government projects, thus driving down bids and the cost of the work. The association represents more than 33,000 firms and started in 1918.

Simonson gave us a chart that shows prices for new school construction increased nearly 12 percent in 2008 and dropped nearly 3 percent the year after. The data came from the federal government’s Producer Price Index.

Woods said the district has not seen an uptick in costs for materials during the past 18 months. He did say bids by construction companies for DeKalb district work have been lower.

""Vendors are more competitive,"" he said. ""I think there’s not a lot of work out there.""

Minutes from a March 2009 meeting of the SPLOST citizen’s advisory committee make a reference to ""favorable construction prices."" The minutes were shared by Ernest Brown, a former co-chairman of the committee.

Ernest Brown, no relation to the sheriff, recalled discussions about the recession’s impact on construction bids.

""It drove down labor costs because people were being more competitive, and it saved money for the taxpayers,"" he said.

Woods also defended the quality of the work, which has been a concern of some DeKalb parents who closely watch the district’s spending. He did say some subcontractors have been late in meeting deadlines.

The DeKalb school district’s spreadsheet and what we saw ourselves backs up much of Thomas Brown’s argument. The recession has apparently helped lower bid prices -- even though a few projects were still seriously over budget.

We rate Brown’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C079100>],/factchecks/2011/dec/06/thomas-brown/were-dekalb-construction-projects-completed-under-/

U.S. Chamber of Commerce targets Sherrod Brown votes on energy, taxes
","
There’s not much love lost between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown.

Nearly a year before Brown, a Democrat from Avon, Ohio, is up for re-election, the world’s largest business federation has targeted him with a pair of negative television ads as it launched a nationwide 2012 election effort  the group promises will be the ""largest voter education and grassroots mobilization campaign in its nearly 100 year history.""

The Chamber says it spent more than $1 million on the initial round of political ads that target races in Ohio, Iowa, Montana, Washington, Pennsylvania and Nevada.

The first Ohio ad criticizing Brown on energy issues started to run Nov. 16. Claiming that Washington’s energy policies could leave Ohio families in the cold this winter, it says: ""When Sherrod Brown had the chance to help cut energy costs, he said no. Instead, Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes.""

Over the Thanksgiving weekend, the group substituted a second ad with an illustration of Brown peeking through window blinds as an announcer suggests he’s ""hiding from his tax-raising, job killing record."" It goes onto assert that Brown ""supports raising energy taxes."" It also faults his votes for last year’s health care reform law. Both ads tell voters to call Brown’s office.

Chamber spokesman J.P. Fielder says Brown is being targeted because his 9 percent level of support for U.S. Chamber voting positions is among the U.S. Senate’s lowest.

""With the economy in the state it is in, and notably, the way the economy is in Ohio, we think it is all the more important to highlight for voters where candidates stand on business issues,"" Fielder said.

Since energy was sole topic of the Chamber’s first ad and a key point of its second one, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. We’re focusing on the group’s claim in the first ad that Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes.

The chamber cited votes that Brown made on May 17 and May 18 of this year.

One of those votes was on a measure that would have eliminated $12 billion in tax breaks to big oil companies over 10 years as a way to reduce the budget deficit. It targeted five companies: Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, Conoco Phillips, and BP.

Republicans, like Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, argued its passage would increase gasoline costs and reduce domestic oil production. Democrats, like California’s Barbara Boxer, contended the measure would not raise consumer prices because the oil companies are flush enough with profits to forsake such ""corporate welfare."" Despite Brown’s backing, It failed to get enough votes to warrant Senate consideration.

The second measure - which also failed to get enough votes to warrant full U.S. Senate consideration - would have expanded offshore oil and gas drilling. Brown opposed bringing it to the Senate floor. Republicans, like Utah’s Orrin Hatch, predicted the measure would reduce energy prices and the nation’s reliance on foreign oil. Democrats, like Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said the plan would cut oil prices by a mere three cents a gallon in 20 years while risking spill damage on the nation’s coasts.

PolitiFact previously has found that new domestic drilling won’t have much impact on oil prices much because of the many years it would take to realize production gains and because any contribution to the global oil market would be too small to significantly shrink prices.

Fielder said the claim that Brown supports raising energy taxes, which is made in each ad, also is derived from a third vote he cast. Brown opposed an April 2009 budgetary amendment that would raise a parliamentary point of order against any legislation that would impose a national energy tax on individual taxpayers who make $200,000 or less, or couples with a top income of $250,000. According to the U.S. Senate website, a point of order is ""a claim made by a Senator from the floor that a rule of the Senate is being violated. If the chair sustains the point of order, the action in violation of the rule is not permitted.""

Brown spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak said the measure Brown voted against ""wouldn’t affect energy taxes by one dime"" because it was a procedural amendment to prevent any Congressional debate over energy issues.

Where does that leave the Chamber’s allegation that ""Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes""?

There is an element of truth in the claim. Brown’s vote to repeal tax breaks to big oil companies could be deemed a vote to ""increase energy taxes."" But those taxes would be on big oil companies - not the Ohioans whom the ad says ""need economic help, not higher energy taxes.""

PolitiFact has noted in previous items that the assertion that Brown’s opposition to the offshore drilling measure was ""a chance to help cut energy costs"" is dubious, since the consumer price impact of offshore drilling would be minimal and in the far future.

And the Chamber argues that  Brown’s opposition to establishing a parliamentary ""point of order"" against debating energy tax legislation means that he ""supports raising energy taxes.""  But that’s not what that vote was about.

His vote indicates that he wouldn’t bar discussion of such ideas, not that he supports them.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s claim Mostly False.

David Axelrod calls Newt Gingrich 'the godfather of gridlock'
","
During an interview on the Dec. 5, 2011, edition of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to President Barack Obama, coined a new description for Republican presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: ""the godfather of gridlock.""

Discussing a newly released Gingrich ad that portrays the former speaker in a soft light, Axelrod told host Chuck Todd that he was amused by the ad ""because he talked about (how) he was going to bring the country together to solve problems. You're talking about the godfather of gridlock here, the guy who two decades ago really invented the kind of tactics that have now become commonplace in Washington. So, this is a whole new Newt.""

We wondered whether it was really fair to pin today’s policy gridlock on tactics engineered by Gingrich. So we sought comments from historians, political scientists and other political observers. We thought analyzing this quote might prove too subjective, but we found concrete evidence to both bolster and undermine Axelrod's claim. 
Gingrich the fighter 
Some historians and analysts say Gingrich's bare-knuckled tactics created a sharp partisanship that continues today.

Gingrich came to national attention when he led a group of fellow backbenchers to challenge the ethics of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Their challenge led Wright to resign in 1989, driving the ousted speaker to decry the ""mindless cannibalism"" consuming Congress.

It was a watershed moment for Gingrich, and only solidified his belief that confrontation, not compromise, was what Congress needed.

Beginning in 1989, Gingrich bided his time as House minority whip, serving under a more conciliatory Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois. By 1993 and 1994, -- when a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was in the White House and the 40-year Democratic House majority was looking shaky -- Gingrich upped the ante.

""The Republican strategy in 1993 and 1994 was to vote as a parliamentary minority, in unison against the new president's initiatives, and that was as much or more Newt's idea as anybody's,"" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ""Clinton's economic program, his first big initiative, took almost eight months to pass, denying him a big early victory and making the eventual passage look like a humiliation. The same approach had success with a crime bill and, of course, with health care reform.""

Michel’s impending retirement cleared the way for Gingrich to become speaker if the GOP managed to take over the House in the 1994 election. And they did.

Once in office, Gingrich continued his confrontational strategy, most notably in the budget fights of 1995 that led to shutdowns of the federal government. Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman cited Gingrich's ""defamatory misuse of the C-SPAN morning one-minute diatribes to an empty chamber, his over-the-top-rhetoric and his dogged pursuit of Clinton’s impeachment. It’s become much worse, and for reasons hardly exclusive to any individual’s nastiness, but Newt was a major contributor to the nastiness that prevails today.""

Gingrich developed wedge issues to divide the Democratic majority and magnets to pull voters into the Republican orbit, said Steve Gillon, a historian at the University of Oklahoma and author of The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation.

University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis argues that Gingrich’s attacks on Congress itself have harmed the institution in the long term. Though Gingrich is a historian by training, Loomis said, he ""ignored the importance of maintaining (Congress’) legitimacy, which has haunted us since.""

Gingrich the deal-maker

But Loomis and others also say Gingrich's legacy is not black and white. After Gingrich lost the public relations war over the shutdown to Clinton, he became more willing to compromise with his rival.

""What Axelrod's comment does not account for is the change that took place in Gingrich after the 1995 budget battle,"" Gillon said. ""Both Clinton and Gingrich realized they had more to gain by working together than they did by fighting each other. Both men saw their poll numbers rise.""

This period of cooperation lasted until the emergence of the Monica Lewinsky affair in 1998, which Gingrich played a significant role in promoting.

So what did Clinton and Gingrich accomplish during this era of (relatively) good feelings? Here are a few notable bills, each of which passed with broad, bipartisan majorities.

Telecommunications Act, 1996 -- described by the Federal Communications Commission as ""the first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years."" The House passed the final version of the bill by a 414-16 margin, with 236 Republicans and 178 Democrats supporting it.

Welfare reform, 1996 -- a landmark bill to end cash payments and instead encourage recipients to find work. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 328-101 margin, with 230 Republicans and 98 Democrats.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996 -- a law that allowed people to change jobs without fearing the loss of their health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, as well as provisions dealing with health information privacy. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 421-2 margin, with 227 Republicans and 193 Democrats.

Taxpayer Relief Act, 1997 -- which established a child tax credit, tuition tax credits, and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for education expenses and first-home purchases, as well as a decrease in the capital gains tax and limitations on the estate tax. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 389-43 margin, with 225 Republicans and 164 Democrats.

Balanced Budget Act, 1997 -- a bill that cut spending in order to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 346-85 margin, with 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats.

At the presidential bill-signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Gingrich called for ""‘bipartisan leadership across the planet"" to put aside party differences and address other nagging problems that, like the deficit, worry the public,"" the Washington Times reported. ""‘We will meet the moral integrity test in peacetime of not spending our children's and grandchildren's money,"" he said. ""We have a chance over the next three and a half years to work together . . . to accomplish a lot.’""

""Overall, Newt’s four years as speaker can be characterized as gridlock followed by greased wheels,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, who served as the Republican staff director of the influential House Rules Committee before and during Gingrich’s tenure as speaker. Wolfensberger is now director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, agreed, and added that the Senate -- long the home of blocked nomination hearings and a filibuster rule that allows one senator to stand in the way of legislation -- has been at least as much a force for gridlock in Washington as the House. ""The Senate deserves far more blame for gridlock than the House,"" Abramowitz said.

So Gingrich has been more of a prince of partisanship than a godfather of gridlock.

Axelrod ""is mixing up apples and oranges,"" said John Feehery, a longtime House Republican spokesman who worked under then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., among others. ""Intense partisanship does not necessarily lead to gridlock, and gridlock is not necessarily the result of partisanship.""

Gillon, who wrote the book on the Clinton-Gingrich relationship, calls the former speaker ""a very complicated figure. He is a man who will use the most ruthless methods in order to gain power, but who can be restrained, creative, and bipartisan once he has power... The political people in the Clinton White House viewed Gingrich as the antichrist. But many of the policy people – Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles – painted a portrait of a pragmatic, though temperamental, policymaker.""

Our ruling

So while Gingrich was sharply partisan, there are solid examples where he short-circuited gridlock to push bills to enactment. On balance, we rate Axelrod’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096770FC0>],/factchecks/2011/dec/05/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-calls-newt-gingrich-godfather-gridlo/
"['Israel', 'Florida', 'Karen Harrington']","
Karen Harrington says Debbie Wasserman Schultz blamed Republicans for the creation of Hamas
","
Republican Karen Harrington is making her second attempt at unseating U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston -- and she is going after one of the incumbent's bases -- the Jewish vote in a district with a significant Jewish population.

Harrington, a Catholic who lost to Wasserman Schultz by about 22 percentage points in 2010 and is now running in a GOP primary, wants to define herself as the candidate who is the stronger supporter of Israel.

Harrington talked up her support of Israel and her Jewish voter outreach in this Nov. 12, 2011, interview with a conservative blogger at BlogCon -- a gathering of bloggers held in Denver and hosted by FreedomWorks, a conservative organization. When the blogger talked about ""the president's failed stance on Israel,"" and called Obama an ""antagonist"" to Israel, Harrington responded:

""Debbie's latest thing as well as her lack of support for Israel -- is 'cause she has to stand by this president -- she also has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas -- that's been her latest thing. This president asked them to stop building in the settlements, asked them to return to the '67 borders and just the other day was caught with (French President Nicolas) Sarkozy saying negative things about Israel. This is a country and a nation that needs to stand by Israel as our history has shown us to. And Debbie supports this president and his policies, and you are right -- Israel has become more endangered over there because of our approach and lack of strong support of Israel.""

That's a whole lot of claims about Wasserman Schultz and Obama rolled into one paragraph (read about the Sarkozy-Obama conversation about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu here). But we wanted to know: Has Wasserman Schultz blamed the Republicans for creating Hamas?

What Wasserman Schultz actually said about Hamas

Harrington's campaign sent us a link to the Shark Tank, a conservative blog, that posted this Oct. 31, 2011, video of Wasserman Schultz from a town hall in Pembroke Pines under the headline ""Wasserman Schultz blames Bush for Hamas' rise to power."" The gathering was part of a string of meetings the Jewish congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair held in South Florida in an attempt to shore up Obama's Jewish support and portray him as a strong ally of Israel.

The Shark Tank video shows just a clip, and we'll start from the relevant part where Wasserman Schultz talks about keeping tabs on the Arab Spring countries:

""We are very, very watchful. We are sticking to them like glue. All of those countries that have gone through the Arab Spring to make sure that the forces that would be interested in ... changing their nations' aggression or lack of aggression toward Israel are held at bay and that we give support to allowing these nascent democracies to begin to survive. And we have to be careful. Here is the thing about democracy. You kind of never know what you are going to get. We have to be careful with be careful what you wish for scenarios. Remember when President Bush pushed for democracy in Gaza and the West Bank, and we got Hamas in charge of Gaza, and you know there was a massive rift and the rise of Hamas is thanks to 'democracy.' So making sure that we keep a close watch and close communications with those countries and help them through the development of those nascent democracies is going to be critical for us in helping to make sure Israel remains strong and isn't overwhelmed.""

Wasserman Schultz was making a point about the potential perils of democracy and using a Hamas victory, after President George W. Bush promoted democracy, as an example. Harrington used a sliver of that statement to claim that what Wasserman Schultz did was ""blame the Republicans for the creation of Hamas."" But before we pick apart Harrington's and Wasserman Schultz's words, let's review some history about Hamas.

 Origins of Hamas

Hamas is the largest and most influential Palestinian militant movement, according to this background information about Hamas we pulled directly from The Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank: ""Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, a religious and political organization founded in Egypt with branches throughout the Arab world. Beginning in the late 1960s, Hamas' founder and spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, preached and did charitable work in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, both of which were occupied by Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. In 1973, Yassin established al-Mujamma' al-Islami (the Islamic Center) to coordinate the Muslim Brotherhood's political activities in Gaza. Yassin founded Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood's local political arm in December 1987, following the eruption of the first intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas published its official charter in 1988, moving decidedly away from the Muslim Brotherhood's ethos of nonviolence.""

The Council on Foreign Relations also provided this information about Hamas:

""In January 2006, the group won the Palestinian Authority's (PA) general legislative elections, defeating Fatah, the party of the PA's president, Mahmoud Abbas, and setting the stage for a power struggle. Since attaining power, Hamas has continued its refusal to recognize the state of Israel, leading to crippling economic sanctions. Historically, Hamas has sponsored an extensive social service network. The group has also operated a terrorist wing, carrying out suicide bombings and attacks using mortars and short-range rockets. Hamas has launched attacks both in the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and inside the pre-1967 boundaries of Israel. In Arabic, the word 'hamas' means zeal. But it's also an Arabic acronym for 'Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya,' or Islamic Resistance Movement.""

 Hamas under President Bush

We're fact-checking Harrington here, but since she cites Wasserman Schultz's comments about Hamas under President Bush, we sent both candidates' statements to experts on the Middle East including Aaron Miller, a former adviser to six Secretaries of State on Arab-Israeli negotiations, 1978-2003, who now works at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, and Elliott Abrams, who was the deputy national security adviser handling Middle East affairs in the George W. Bush administration and now works at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Bush called for the Palestinians to hold elections in a 2002 speech: ""My vision is two states, living side by side, in peace and security. There is simply no way to achieve that peace until all parties fight terror. Yet at this critical moment, if all parties will break with the past and set out on a new path, we can overcome the darkness with the light of hope. Peace requires a new and different Palestinian leadership, so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror.""

And in his second inaugural address in January 2005, Bush also spoke about supporting ""the growth of Democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture."" Bush was warned that Hamas could win.

In January 2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian Parliament beating the governing Fatah, the party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The Washington Post wrote that the ""election results stunned U.S. and Israeli officials, who have repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas, which both countries and the European Union have designated as a terrorist organization."" Bush defended his efforts to promote democracy despite the outcome. (Liz Cheney, who served in the state department under Bush and is the daughter of Bush's vice president Dick Cheney, later said that Bush made a mistake.)

The election that Hamas won was in February 2006, and Hamas took over Gaza by military coup in June 2007, Abrams said in an e-mail.

""So we did not 'get Hamas in charge of Gaza' due to the 2006 election,"" Abrams wrote. ""The rise of Islamist movements is global, from Pakistan to Nigeria to Tunisia, and is not the result of 'democracy.' Palestinian politics is no exception, and Hamas had been growing in strength for many years before 2006. The most one can say is that the 2006 election allowed Hamas to demonstrate the support it had, just as elections in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco appear to be showing that Islamist groups have considerable support there, too. The rise of Hamas can’t be explained by any one cause but certainly reflects distaste for the corruption of the rival Fatah Party, greater religiosity, and support for violence against Israel.""

This Vanity Fair article takes a critical look at the Bush administration's role -- including Abrams -- in pushing for elections.

It's possible to argue that Bush may have misjudged the results of the election, but he isn't to blame for Hamas' victory, Miller said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida.

""Whenever you have fair and free elections anywhere in the Arab and Muslim world the Islamic parties are going to do extremely well -- they are the most organized, disciplined and their messaging and control is really on the money. ... The question is do you blame the Bush administration for the rise of Hamas? The answer is no. You could criticize the Bush administration for pressing for elections when they didn't realize what the outcome would be, but you cannot blame the Bush administration for the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and Islamists in Gaza. That rise is attributed to Fatah's corruption, Hamas' discipline, the existence of the Israeli occupation. There are so many forces that would be standing in line before President Bush to take responsibility for that.""

 Wasserman Schultz's words

Words matter in every PolitiFact ruling, but especially in this one.

Harrington said Wasserman Schultz ""has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas."" But read Wasserman Schultz's comments again:

""Here is the thing about democracy,"" she said. ""You kind of never know what you are going to get. We have to be careful with be careful what you wish for scenarios. Remember when President Bush pushed for democracy in Gaza and the West Bank and we got Hamas in charge of Gaza and you know there was a massive rift, and the rise of Hamas is thanks to 'democracy.' ""

She's not saying Bush or Republicans created Hamas. She's saying that there can be a downside to pushing for democracy in that when you advocate for change, you can't control what that change ultimately looks like.

Jonathan Beeton, Wasserman Schultz's office spokesman, explains in an interview:

""That was a broader conversation about the Arab Spring and democracy. In a democratic election, in a situation like that, you can end up with electing people who might not be favorable to Israel or America. ... It was elections pushed for by the Bush administration that ultimately did bring Hamas into a more formal leadership control over Gaza.""

Our ruling

Harrington said Wasserman Schultz ""has blamed the Republicans for the creation of Hamas."" Harrington didn't explain what she meant during the interview, but her campaign points to a statement Wasserman Schultz made about democracy in the Middle East.

Only, Wasserman Schultz didn't blame the Republicans or President George W. Bush for the ""creation"" of Hamas, although she did suggest that Bush's push for democracy led to Hamas taking charge of Gaza.

We are fact-checking Harrington's words here and she has misquoted Wasserman Schultz -- blaming Republicans for the creation of Hamas is different than blaming a Republican administration for promoting democracy and then charging that that led to Hamas being in charge of Gaza. When Wasserman Schultz said ""the rise of Hamas thanks to 'democracy' "" she isn't talking about the original birth of Hamas -- she is talking about their increased role in Gaza. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3A980>],/factchecks/2011/dec/05/karen-harrington/gop-challenger-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-blame/
"['China', 'Economy', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Eric Cantor says U.S. economy is three larger than China's
","
Congressman Eric Cantor recently weighed in on how the United States’ economy compares to the domestic output in China, which is seen as an rising economic rival.

""Our economy is three times as big as China’s,"" Cantor, R-7th, said when asked about China’s currency during a Nov. 14 meeting with reporters.

There’s been plenty of speculation on about just how much progress China’s economic engine has made in catching up to the United States, so we wanted to check to find out if Cantor was correct.

We ran the congressman’s statement past Derek Scissors, a research fellow in Asia economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Scissors said that when measuring the two countries by a standard comparison of each nation’s gross domestic product, Cantor is almost on target. For 2009, Cantor’s number is right, Scissors said.

But using the latest annual numbers from 2010, he’s off just a bit.

""For 2010, it’s more like two and a half to one (advantage for the U.S.),"" Scissors said.

We asked Cantor’s office where he got his information for the statement. Megan Whittemore, a Cantor spokeswoman, cited numbers from the World Bank, showing that U.S. GDP in 2010 was about $14.6 trillion while China’s GDP was nearly $5.9 trillion.

""So the U.S. economy is about 2.5 times the size of China’s economy, but the congressman rounded up to three,"" Whittemore said in an e-mail.

Cantor is not alone in making the claim that the U.S. economy is outpacing China’s by a 3-to-1 ratio.

In a Jan. 19, 2011, joint news conference with Chinese President Hu Jintao, President Barack Obama said the U.S. economy is still three times larger than China’s, according to a USA Today blog post.

A March 11, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service said that after three decades of brisk economic growth, China has the second largest economy in the world behind the United States. But the report added that despite China’s rise, ""the United States’ economy is three times larger than China’s.""

But that’s not the end of the story.

There are different ways of measuring a country’s Gross Domestic Product. One way is to compare each country’s GDP using nominal exchange rates that convert China’s economic data into U.S. dollars, according to a 2007 Congressional Research Service report.

It’s by that measure that the U.S. economy is three times bigger than China’s.

But that Congressional Research Service report noted there’s been considerable debate among economists over the actual size of China’s economy. Many economists, the CRS noted, contend using the nominal exchange rate significantly understates the size of the Chinese economy.

Another way to gauge GDP is to use purchasing power parity, or PPP, a measurement that converts foreign currency to U.S. dollars based on that currency’s purchasing power, the CRS report states. That measurement gives a huge boost to China’s GDP, making it much closer to the size of U.S.

Data from a September 2011 report from the International Monetary Fund said that when measured on a purchasing power parity basis, China’s 2010 GDP was about $10.1 trillion, while the U.S. was at $14.5 trillion. By that gauge, the U.S. economy is only 30 percent larger than China’s.

The Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook puts more stock in measuring China’s economy by using the purchasing power parity measure. It notes that measuring China’s GDP by the lower official exchange rate understates the China’s output compared to the rest of the world.

""In China’s situation, GDP at purchasing power parity provides the best measure for comparing output across countries,"" the CIA’s factbook states.

But using that GDP larger measure also has drawbacks, Scissors wrote in an April 2011 report. He said that purchasing power parity estimates change over time, noting that the World Bank cut the size of its 2005 purchasing power parity GDP estimate for China by 40 percent.

Since 2005, Chinese inflation has outpaced that in the U.S., meaning the latest purchasing power measurements are out of date, Scissors wrote. He added that measuring GDP by that method overstates Chinese GDP.

And we should also note that the 2007 Congressional Research Service report urged caution in using purchasing power GDP estimates for China, noting the prices of many goods and services in that country are distorted due to price controls and government subsidies.

Our Conclusion:

Cantor said that the U.S. economy is three times the size of China’s. By a standard and commonly-used measure of Gross Domestic Product, he’s pretty close. Annual figures from 2010 show the U.S. economy is two and a half times the size of China.

That gives credibility to what Cantor is saying.

But by a second measure, adjusting for purchasing power, the U.S. output is still larger than China’s, but the gap is much smaller. The U.S. economy by that score is only one-third larger than China’s.

Neither set of statistics is universally accepted as the only way to gauge the size of China’s output. Both measures garner support and criticism from analysts.

We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096773B80>],/factchecks/2011/dec/05/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-us-economy-three-larger-chinas/
"['New Jersey', 'Federal Budget', 'Transportation', 'Frank Lautenberg']","
Lautenberg says federal highway spending last year exceeded total given Amtrak over 40 years
","
Amtrak has always needed a money train.

The nation’s rail system has been criticized by numerous lawmakers for always operating at a deficit and seeking financial boosts from Congress. But when compared with federal highway spending, Amtrak’s balance sheet doesn’t look so bad, according to Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), a major proponent of rail transportation.

""Last year we spent more than $40 billion on highways. And Lord knows we need that. But that's more than we spent on Amtrak in its entire 40-year history,"" Lautenberg said in an article on nola.com, the online home of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

Can it be that after 40 years of operation the money spent on Amtrak didn’t even equal one year of federal highway spending? PolitiFact New Jersey found the claim is right on track.

Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration in Washington, DC confirmed that highway spending for Fiscal Year 2010 (Oct. 1, 2009 to Sept. 30, 2010) exceeded $40 billion. Highway spending generally increases a small amount each year for inflation, he said.

By comparison, Caley Gray, Lautenberg’s communications director, said Congress has spent $37.9 billion on Amtrak from Fiscal Year 1971 to Fiscal Year 2011, according to Amtrak.

That’s a bit more than Amtrak’s total, but it supports Lautenberg’s statement.

""In the forty years of Amtrak’s existence, the Federal government has invested a total of $36 billion in the Amtrak system – a figure that represents both operating and capital funding,"" Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said in Amtrak’s General and Legislative Annual Report to Senate President Joseph Biden Jr. and House Speaker John Boehner. Amtrak’s Comprehensive Business Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 was included with the report dated Feb. 7. ""Between 1971 and 2008, by contrast, the Federal government has invested more than $421 billion in aviation and over a trillion dollars in the nation’s highways.""

Rod Diridon, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, Calif., suggested that Lautenberg wasn’t dismissing the need for highway funding, but pointing to other transportation needs for the nation.

""His statement is accurate and I think his intent is to indicate that – certainly not to denigrate the highway system, but to note the world is in transition now, to move away to petroleum-based transportation to electrically based transportation.""

Diridon didn’t suggest people give up their vehicles, but said having an upgraded electric rail system can have many benefits: efficiency in moving people, less reliance on foreign oil and reduced environmental impact.

Lautenberg touched on those points as well as increased ridership in a July 5 letter sent to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) supporting Amtrak’s $2.2 billion funding request for Fiscal Year 2012. Murray is chairman and Collins is a ranking member on the Appropriations Committee for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Lautenberg and 19 other U.S. senators signed the letter.

Amtrak got $1.41 billion in assistance for its nearly $3.9 billion budget, said Clifford Cole, media relations manager for Amtrak Media Relations/Government Affairs in New York.

Our ruling

In an article about expanding rail routes and access in Louisiana, Lautenberg said Congress spent more than $40 billion on highways last year, more than has been spent on Amtrak in the national rail system’s 40-year history. The Federal Highway Administration confirmed the highway spending figure, as did Amtrak in a letter requesting $2.2 billion in federal assistance for its Fiscal Year 2012 budget. There’s nothing off the rails here. We rate this statement True.

"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Alan Simpson']","
Alan Simpson says U.S. military spending outpaces totals from the next 14 largest nations, combined
","
Former Sen. Alan Simpson says two big obstacles stand in the way of cutting the federal deficit: the unbending rigidity of political parties and a herd of ""sacred cows"" in the budget.

The Wyoming Republican who co-chaired the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, told the City Club of Cleveland on Nov. 18 that one of the fattest sacred cows is the Pentagon.

Simpson wasn’t questioning the need for a strong military. His point was that the military budget had become so immense that it operated without restraint. To put it into perspective, he offered this remark:

""Our defense budget is larger than (the combined totals of the next) 14 major countries of the world -- and if you think all of it is there for national security purposes, you're terribly wrong.""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered just how the numbers check out and took a look.

Simpson said that simply grasping the size of the military budget challenged the Bowles-Simpson commission, and offered some examples to the City Club.

""We said, How many contractors do you have in the Defense Department? and they said, 'Well, we don't know. It's quite a spread, it's between 1 million and 10 million,'"" Simpson said.

""When Dwight Eisenhower said watch out for the military-industrial complex, we should have listened. The ties are deep and they're opaque and there's no way to audit the Defense Department. We said, Can you give us some audit material? and they said, 'We're unable to audit the Defense Department.""

He said it had been a losing, bruising battle trying to rein in programs like the health care plan for working-age military retirees.

""There are only 2.2 million of them,"" he said. ""I met one the other day that had never served on active duty, had been in the National Guard the entire time and was a brigadier general.

The health care plan called Tricare carries a premium of $470 a year and no co-pay and covers all dependents, he said. The annual cost to the federal government is $53 billion.

To gauge where the U.S. military budget stood, PolitiFact Ohio checked the State Department's table of world military expenditures, for which the latest year posted was 2005. It was compiled from a blend of actual figures from other nations and some estimates.

The United States led the list with expenditures of $503 billion. The next 14 countries had combined total spending of $403.5 billion -- backing up Simpson's statement.

China was second with $85.3 billion. The United Kingdom was third, with $55.9 billion.

The State Department table also listed military spending per capita. The U.S. ranked first, spending $1,700 per person. The only countries close were Kuwait ($1,670 per capita) and Israel ($1,600).

Among major industrialized nations, Britain spent $925 per capita; France, $841; Germany, $458, Russia, $258; and China, $65.

Some more-recent and detailed figures came from the much-quoted Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. Its Military Expenditure Database was updated in June. It, too, is based on a combination of actual figures and estimates.

It showed U.S. defense spending in 2010 as just under $700 billion, about 43 percent of the world total. Spending for the next highest 14 highest in 2010 came to an estimated combined total of $646 billion. The U.S. total was about six times that of China, its nearest rival, which was estimated at $119 billion.

Among its other findings: 

State Department data from 2005 and more recent 2010 data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute both support Simpson’s statement: U.S. military spending is greater than the next 14 countries combined.

Did Santorum's unemployment numbers add up this time?
","
So what’s a college degree worth?

Apparently a lot if you want to keep your job, according to numbers relayed by one Republican running for president.

Rick Santorum came to the Atlanta area last week to convince grass-roots party activists that his candidacy -- despite low poll numbers -- is ascending.

The former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania castigated ""Obamacare,"" among other topics. What caught our attention was that Santorum offered some very specific statistics on college education in relation to unemployment.

""We need to create the hope and opportunity for those who in this economy have been left behind, and that’s a lot of blue-collar workers,"" the candidate told an audience of about 75 people at a hotel in Duluth. ""The unemployment among those who are college-educated in America is 4.4 percent. Among blue-collar and noncollege-educated, it’s over 10 percent.""

The comments were made to the Georgia Republican Party’s 7th District Committee, which has invited the GOP candidates for president to speak.

Santorum has talked about this subject before. During a Nov. 9 debate, the candidate said: ""The unemployment rate among [the] noncollege-educated is well into the double digits in America. It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees.""

Our friends at PolitiFact National checked out that statement and rated it Half True. In Georgia, Santorum offered a more detailed claim.

So did Santorum do better this time on the Truth-O-Meter?

We used a table by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that tracks unemployment rates for Americans older than 25 by their educational level. In October, the unemployment rate for high school graduates with no college education was 9.6 percent, according to the BLS. The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma was 13.8 percent. There was no breakdown for ""blue-collar"" workers.

Since Santorum said ""noncollege-educated,"" we decided to combine workers with and without high school diplomas. There are a combined 49.2 million Americans in the workforce who fit that description, according to the BLS. About 5.2 million of them are unemployed, which equals an unemployment rate of 10.6 percent. That is over 10 percent, which Santorum told the audience in Gwinnett.

And what’s the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher?

In October, it was 4.4 percent, according to the BLS. In this category, the numbers haven’t changed much in the past 12 months.

Santorum’s numbers were on target for college-educated workers. The former senator apparently did his homework this time about the unemployment rate for noncollege-educated workers. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE8E40>],/factchecks/2011/dec/05/rick-santorum/did-santorums-unemployment-numbers-add-time/

Trump retweets manipulated video falsely suggesting Biden played ‘F--- Tha Police’ at Florida event
","Before speaking at a event in Florida, former Vice President Joe Biden paid a tribute to Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi, who introduced him moments earlier, by taking out a cellphone and playing Fonsi’s hit love song ""Despacito"" through the microphone. The next day, President Donald Trump twice retweeted a misleading and manipulated video of the tribute that appeared to show Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, broadcasting a different tune: hip-hop group N.W.A.’s 1988 anti-police anthem ""F--- Tha Police.""  ""What is this all about?"" Trump wrote in the first retweet.  What is this all about? https://t.co/AAmBGgHhyR ""China is drooling. They can’t believe this!"" he said when he reshared the video hours later. The manipulated 27-second clip gives the false impression that Biden was bobbing his head while listening to rapper Ice Cube run through the song’s opening lines. The incendiary first verse includes obscenities and a line proclaiming that ""police think they have the authority to kill a minority."" The verse begins: ""F--- the police, coming straight from the underground."" But Biden did not play ""F--- Tha Police"" during the Sept. 15 event in Kissimmee, Fla., which was billed as a celebration of Hispanic heritage month and featured speeches from singer Ricky Martin and actress Eva Longoria in addition to Fonsi. Biden played Fonsi’s ""Despacito."" ‘I’ll tell you what, if I had the talent of any one of these people, I’d be elected president by acclamation,"" Biden said after he turned the music off. Unedited footage of Fonsi’s handoff to Biden can be viewed here, via PBS NewsHour.  Twitter labeled the edited video that Trump retweeted as ""manipulated media"" according to its policy regarding ""synthetic and manipulated media,"" a Twitter spokesperson confirmed.  The ""manipulated media"" tag links to tweets about the event from news outlets and reporters, some of whom noted that they were in the room as Biden played ""Despacito."" Trump and his allies have falsely and repeatedly claimed that Biden wants to defund the police — and they have sometimes selectively edited or manipulated media to misrepresent Biden’s stance. Biden has rejected that position and instead proposed investing more in a program for community police. ""F--- Tha Police"" surged on music streaming platforms following the May killing by police of George Floyd in Minneapolis, according to Rolling Stone.  The song was also controversial at the time of its release. Radio stations banned it, and the FBI wrote a letter to Priority Records, which distributed N.W.A.’s music, the Daily Beast reported. That said, Biden didn’t play it in Florida.

""The answer is simple: because US maps only show US data."" The natural resources department in Canada keeps updated information about the wildfires in its country here. As of Sept. 9, the last time the ""National Wildland Fire Situation Report"" was updated, there were five uncontrolled fires, 11 that weren’t anticipated to grow considering the current circumstances, and 47 controlled fires, meaning they’re contained and will be extinguished.  ""Following a years-long series of extreme wildland fire seasons, 2020 has been one of Canada’s quietest since the 1990s,"" the agency says on its website.  In the United States, meanwhile, 87 large, active fires have burned more than 4.6 million acres in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Only four fires are contained.  Hayhoe also addressed this difference between the two countries in a Twitter thread addressing ""popular wildfire myths.""

Climate change is the long-term trend over decades,"" she wrote.  Some social media posts have shared this map and suggested that it disproves that the fires are connected to climate change, something that affects the entire world and is not sequestered to the United States. Online, people are arguing about what caused the fires — poor forest management, arsonists, or global warming. Most wildfires in the lower 48 states are ignited by humans, but they’re burning a much greater area due to drier conditions caused by climate change, Hayhoe said.    As we’ve previously reported, climate change has affected the environments where the fires are burning on the West Coast right now, making them more conducive to wildfire.

Houston Texans stayed in their locker room for both songs
","The NFL season kicked off on Sept. 10 with the Kansas City Chiefs beating the Houston Texans. But before the game started, according to a Facebook post, the Texans drew attention for a protest.  ""Houston Texans coming out for the Black National Anthem then going into the locker room for THE REAL NATIONAL ANTHEM IS DISGRACEFUL,"" the post says.   It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Written by civil rights activist James Weldon Johnson in 1900 and set to music by his brother, John Rosamond Johnson, the song was adopted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as its official song in 1918 and is often referred to as the Black national anthem.  During the Chiefs-Texans game, Chiefs players and coaches stretched across one of the end zones while a video of Alicia Keys singing the Black anthem played on video boards, USA Today reported, while the Texans remained in their locker room.  When the song ended, the Chiefs jogged off the field and players stood on the sideline for the national anthem. One player, defensive end Alex Okafor, took a knee. The Texans continued to remain in their locker room until the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" ended. At that point, the Texans ran onto the field and ""both teams came together at the center of the field for what the public address announcer called ‘a moment of silence to support racial equality in our country,’"" according to USA Today.  ""The Texans had discussed staging a protest during both anthems in an attempt to continue to draw attention to the ongoing problems of police brutality against people of color and systemic oppression,"" the newspaper said.

Climate change created conditions for the West Coast fires, experts say
","At a rally in Nevada on Sep. 12, President Trump claimed that the wildfires currently raging across the West Coast have resulted from poor ""forest management."" Trump, who denies the existence of climate change, has made similar statements before in talking about a deadly firestorm near Paradise, Calif., in 2018 and again in 2019. We rated these statements False for being overly simplistic and reducing a complex issue to a single cause.   A Facebook post parrots Trump’s language, dismissing the possibility that global warming has contributed to the fires. ""Climate change my a--,"" it reads. ""CA fires are due to total lack of forest maintenance.""  Another post makes a similar claim: ""Bad forestry practices and 60 yr. old power lines caused the Calif. fires not the climate change hoax.""  The wildfires, which include some of the largest infernos in the recorded history of the Western U.S., have claimed 35 lives so far and washed the skies of West Coast cities in orange.  We asked experts what’s fueling them — poor forest maintenance or human-caused climate change. They agreed that while good forest maintenance is critical to mitigating wildfires, it’s climate change that’s making them burn so forcefully. Climatologists, ecologists and wildfire experts all told us that climate change has not only fueled the fires but also worsened their impact.  The regional climate has warmed considerably over the last few years, with 2014-18 being California’s five hottest years on record. In the last four decades, the area burned by wildfires has expanded tenfold. According to Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, ""about half"" of that increase is attributable to the effects of global warming.  There are many lines of evidence that climate change has exacerbated the likelihood of fires by modifying environments across the region. Climate change has raised overall temperatures along the West Coast, contributed to a long period of drought, reduced snow deposits in the mountains, and dried out vegetation, essentially covering forest floors with fuel. All of these developments have increased the risk of wildfires and the probability that they spread over great distances.  An article in Science written by a group of researchers breaks down this process in detail. Simply put, forests in mountainous regions of the Western U.S. get moisture during the spring and summer months from melting snowpacks. The warming of the climate has led to drought, which means that there’s less snow on the ground left over from the winter. Since temperatures are now rising earlier in the year, the already reduced amount of snow melts much quicker than it used to, leaving dried out twigs, pine needles and grasses on the forest floor. All of this dehydrated vegetation essentially turns forests into big tinderboxes, increasing their flammability. Climate change has also made other types of ecosystems more likely to catch fire. Rising temperatures have lowered the amount of vapor in the air, which leads the atmosphere to suck more moisture out of the soil, drying it out and making it more conducive to wildfires.  Under these conditions, all environments in the Western U.S. have become more likely to catch fire during ignition events like lightning strikes, heavy winds, downed power lines, or sparks from pyrotechnic devices, such as those used in a gender reveal party blamed for a fire in Yucaipa, Calif. ""There are always accidental sparks, but the conditions don’t favor extremely large wildfires all the time,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. ""As the background conditions shift in that direction, it’s much more likely for these sparks to start a catastrophic blaze."" A study published in August 2020 by Diffenbaugh, Swain and their colleagues found that the number of days per year with extreme wildfire weather in California has more than doubled since the early 1980s, primarily due to increased dryness in the soil.  Wildfires ""are increasing in their likelihood,"" said Diffenbaugh. ""They’re increasing in their intensity. And managing those risks requires an acknowledgement that the climate is warming."" The role of climate change in making wooded areas more flammable doesn’t negate the importance of forest management. There are a number of steps forestry departments can take to decrease the risk of widespread fires, including thinning out small trees, setting strategic burns to prevent the buildup of dry vegetation, and clearing brush.  Swain said that a strict fire suppression policy set by federal forest agencies has likely contributed to the frequency of intense forest fires. Small, contained fires actually lower the risk of high-intensity fires by burning through dry fuel collected on the forest floor. However, many federal agencies followed a policy of extinguishing all fires, regardless of their scope. In doing so, they inadvertently allowed dry vegetation to pile up, increasing the likelihood of massive infernos like the ones we’re seeing. Trump has blamed California agencies for poor forest management, but the state owns just 2% of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60%. The sharp increase in the frequency of wildfires over a wide range of locations can’t be explained by forest management practices alone. Swain noted that the majority of wildfires actually aren’t forest fires at all. ""Most fires aren’t burning trees, they’re burning other forms of vegetation,"" he said. ""Forest management isn’t relevant unless you live in a forest."" Many of the experts we spoke with were frustrated by the way that the debate over the West Coast fires has been framed. Claiming that either poor forest management or climate change is the single factor behind the wildfires doesn’t capture the fact that they are complex phenomena that result from a confluence of conditions.  ""It’s really inaccurate to attempt to reduce the rising occurrence of large, highly destructive wildfires to one ingredient alone,"" Diffenbaugh said.  Climate change has already ensured that fires will occur at a higher intensity and frequency than they did in the past, and forest management is one of the most important techniques that the West Coast can use to cope with that reality.  ""We have to adapt to climate change, and forest management is part of that set of tools that we can use,"" said Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington.  Viral Facebook posts dismiss the possibility that climate change is fueling the West Coast wildfires, instead citing ""bad forestry practices"" and ""a total lack of forest maintenance."" Experts told us that climate change has undoubtedly contributed to the frequency, intensity and scope of wildfires along the West Coast, and that forest maintenance can be used to mitigate those effects in forests.  We rate these posts False. ​",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D6E80>],/factchecks/2020/sep/15/facebook-posts/climate-change-created-conditions-west-coast-fires/

North Carolina's Dan Forest cherry-picks data on kids, COVID-19
","North Carolina’s lieutenant governor is among the biggest critics of Gov. Roy Cooper’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican who’s running against Cooper, says kids should be allowed to go to school. Currently, students in kindergarten through 12th grade are only allowed to attend in-person classes in some counties — and only at a reduced capacity. In an interview posted Sept. 2, Forest said Cooper’s restrictions on in-person learning aren’t necessary. ""There’s no evidence anywhere in the world that our kids should not be in schools. There’s no evidence of that anywhere. All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus,"" he said. Is it true that children are ""17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?"" Forest has repeated similar claims at other events.  We asked Forest’s campaign where he was getting his information. Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn pointed to a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal.  Citing analysis from The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a think tank, the Journal wrote: ""Fatality rate comparisons between Covid-19 and the flu are inapt because they affect populations differently. Children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia, assuming 150,000 coronavirus deaths this year."" Even if the Wall Street Journal’s description of the study is accurate, Forest isn’t representing it correctly. First, Forest ignores the paper’s disclaimer that comparisons between COVID-19 and the flu are ""inapt because they affect populations differently."" Then, he misrepresented the math. The WSJ reported a mathematical range: ""between 6.8 and 17 times."" Forest cherry-picked the top of that range and has stated it as if it is an accepted fact. Then, Forest misquoted the study. The Journal mentioned deaths, and Forest has repeatedly said ""ill effects."" By doing this, Forest downplays the risk to children. The flu appears to be more of a serious threat to children than the novel coronavirus, as PolitiFact reported in August and September. But the CDC hasn’t said how much higher the risk is for the flu. And the CDC’s website distinguishes between healthy children and those with pre-existing conditions. For healthy children, the risk of complications ""is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,"" the CDC said. Meanwhile, kids with underlying medical conditions ""are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19."" The term ""ill effects"" is squishy and vague. Let’s look at how many children have been hospitalized by the two illnesses. (PolitiFact Wisconsin reported these figures in its Sept. 8 fact-check of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.) During the 2018-19 flu season, the hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children.  For COVID-19 patients in that age group, the CDC says the hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children. (For those interested in the math: 39 is 6.5 times higher than 6.) While children do appear to be more affected by the flu than by COVID-19, we struggled to find stats that match Forest’s quote. We asked experts: Is there a consensus in the medical community that children are ""17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?"" ""I’m not familiar with such a statistic,"" said Bill Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Neither is Alan Schroeder, critical care physician at Stanford Children’s Health. Schroeder said he hesitates to put a number on the likelihood of children suffering from the flu more than COVID-19. ""The notion that kids aren’t getting really sick is by and large true. But the disparities between influenza and COVID-19 have narrowed considerably,"" he said. Schroeder noted that, generally speaking, between 100 and 200 children die each year from the flu in the U.S. (And those deaths occurred at times when the nation isn’t limiting travel or practicing social distancing.) Meanwhile, with the novel coronavirus in the U.S. for less than a year, the number of pediatric deaths is still rising. As of Sept. 10, the CDC estimated that 62 children, from infants up to age 14, have died from COVID-19. In the CDC’s 15-24 age bracket, coronavirus has killed another 315 people. Researchers think school cancellations this spring prevented up to even more deaths. The American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that COVID-19 had killed 90 people under age 20 by mid August. ""They’re really oversimplifying the issues at hand,"" Schroeder said of Forest’s quote. In the context of school reopenings, Schroeder said there’s a lot more to consider — children who have underlying conditions, child-to-adult transmissions — than a healthy child’s likelihood of dying when compared with the flu.  ""And for that reason I don’t find it to be a useful comparison,"" he said. Forest said, ""All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus."" He misrepresented a line in the Wall Street Journal, which said ""children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia."" He cherry-picks the highest number and incorrectly uses ""ill effects"" rather than deaths.  Are kids ""17 times"" more likely to suffer from the flu than COVID-19? It’s possible, but not conclusive at this point. Is death an ""ill effect"" of coronavirus? Of course. But Forest's phrasing doesn’t accurately represent the Wall Street Journal’s op-ed. Forest’s claim contains an element of truth. But it isn’t supported by ""all"" evidence, as he claims, and it downplays the risks of COVID-19 by focusing only on death.

Face masks for wildfire smoke protection and COVID-19 play different roles
","As dangerous fires ravage the West Coast, posts about the efficacy of face masks against wildfire smoke are swirling online.  One Facebook post shared an announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said cloth masks — which are recommended and routinely used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 — offer little protection against wildfire smoke because they don’t catch the small particles found in the smoke. But the post’s caption questions why cloth masks are recommended for COVID-19, claiming that the virus’ particles are smaller than the ones found in wildfire smoke: ""CDC announces that ordinary (non-N95) masks (which most people are wearing) will do nothing to protect you against wildfire smoke because ‘they do not catch small particles,’"" the person wrote. ""Fun fact: smoke particles are far larger than SARS-CoV-2 particles. Enjoy your useless mask wearing."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This post has a couple of factual inaccuracies. It jumps to the wrong conclusion about ""ordinary"" masks and COVID-19. The role of masks in preventing smoke inhalation is different than the role masks play in preventing the spread of disease. Additionally, it’s wrong about the comparable sizes of particles in smoke and those from SARS-CoV-2. RELATED: Antifa activists did not start the West Coast wildfires  Wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, affect the immune system, and make people more prone to lung infections, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  The CDC says the greatest protection against wildfire smoke is to reduce exposure by limiting time outdoors and seeking cleaner air spaces or shelters. Cloth masks are not effective for filtering wildfire smoke. ""Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke,"" the health agency says on its website. ""They do not catch small, harmful particles in smoke that can harm your health. Although N95 respirators do provide protection from wildfire smoke, they might be in short supply as frontline healthcare workers use them during the pandemic."" When it comes to COVID-19, the CDC recommends people wear cloth masks as a form of source control — if the wearer coughs, sneezes, laughs or talks, the mask blocks their respiratory droplets from spreading to others. The CDC recommends that adults and children two years and older wear a mask to help limit the spread of the virus, especially when social distancing isn’t possible. ""Cloth masks and medical masks used in health care settings (such as surgical or procedure masks) are important tools in the fight against the spread of COVID-19, however, they are not a type of respiratory protection,"" the agency says. RELATED: Face masks, including homemade ones, are effective COVID-19 protection, experts say  Respiratory protection refers to respirators, like N95 masks, to help reduce the wearer’s exposure from breathing in air that contains contaminants, such as small respiratory droplets from a person who has COVID-19. Source control, on the other hand, protects others and refers to the use of masks to help reduce the spread of large respiratory droplets to others when the person talks, sneezes or coughs.  The post’s claim that ""smoke particles are far larger than SARS-CoV-2 particles"" is misleading because both come in several different size ranges. ""There are particles of all sizes. Some smoke particles are larger, but there are also ultra-fine particles that are down in the size range of the airborne virus,"" said Dr. John Balmes, professor of environmental health sciences at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. Balmes also told PolitiFact it’s correct that cloth masks generally don’t offer much protection against wildfire smoke particles, because smaller ones  —  particularly the microscopic particles that are about 2.5 microns in size — can get through the cloth. But that isn’t the point for COVID-19.  ""It's not to protect the wearer from other people, it's to protect other people from the wearer,"" Balmes said. ""Respiratory droplets, which are what we cough and squeeze, are big enough to be contained inside the masks, but they don't protect breathing in really fine particles.""  A Facebook post suggests wearing cloth masks for COVID-19 is ""useless"" because the CDC announced that non-N95 masks don’t offer protection against wildfire smoke because they don’t catch small particles, and says that smoke particles are larger than SARS-CoV-2 particles. This is wrong. Wildfire smoke particles come in a range of sizes, experts said, and some are comparable to COVID-19 particles.  Cloth masks are recommended as a way to help stop the spread of COVID-19 because they block the wearer’s larger droplets, such as those emitted during coughs and sneezes, from infecting others.

No evidence for rumor that Antifa cut down utility poles to start fires on the West Coast
","Public safety officials battling dozens of deadly wildfires on the West Coast have also found themselves battling online misinformation. Some rumors claimed that antifa, a broad coalition of left-wing activists, was behind the fires, which have killed at least 33 people. Others said law enforcement had arrested several arsonists associated with the movement and that Black Lives Matter activists shot at firefighters. Police departments, fire officials and journalists have all debunked those claims. But that hasn’t stopped the flow of misinformation about the wildfires, which span from California to Washington. ""ANTIFA is now carrying chain saws, and cutting down utility poles, and starting more fires,"" reads a Sept. 13 text post, which has been shared more than 3,300 times. ""Is there any doubt that we have a war on our hands now?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but we haven’t heard back. (Screenshot from Facebook) Downed power lines are thought to have played a role in multiple wildfires on the West Coast. But strong winds, not antifa, are to blame. The claim in the Facebook post may stem from some comments at a Sept. 10 meeting of the Clackamas County commission, which were later unscrupulously reported by conspiratorial websites like the Hal Turner Radio Show. During the Zoom meeting, the commission, which governs an area southeast of Portland, Ore., spoke with Capt. Jeff Smith of the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office. Smith told commissioners that the office had received reports about ""extremist groups"" that were ""suspected antifa."" ""This is more specific to the Estacada (Ore.) area — reports and sightings of people armed with chainsaws and the goal was to fall telephone poles in hopes of starting further fires,"" he said. Smith also said the sheriff’s office had received reports of people staging full tanks of gas around the county to start more fires. ""But this is some media thing — it hasn’t been confirmed,"" said Jim Bernard, chair of the commission. ""No, that part has not,"" Smith responded. ""But the antifa part — there have been reliable sightings and reports. Not confirmed, but I mean, it's pretty specific: being armed with chainsaws falling telephone poles in the hopes of starting further fires."" Later in the meeting, when pressed on the source of his information about antifa sightings in Clackamas County, Smith said he heard it from a ""sergeant on the street.""  ""I don't know who his informants are at this time,"" he said. We reached out to the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office for more information, but we haven’t heard back. We can’t verify whether a sheriff’s sergeant in Clackamas County did or didn’t receive reports about people trying to down power lines and start more fires.  The Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office has issued statements debunking rumors that it arrested arsonists suspected of setting fires nearby. It also put a patrol deputy on administrative leave after a video surfaced showing him making obscene comments about antifa activists starting fires in the area. ""As soon as I was made aware of this incident, I moved swiftly to place this deputy on leave while we investigate,"" said Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts in a statement. Multiple police departments and fire officials across the state say there’s no evidence that political extremist groups are to blame for dozens of fires burning on the West Coast. The FBI’s Portland field office has also debunked the rumors. Reports that extremists are setting wildfires in Oregon are untrue. Help us stop the spread of misinformation by only sharing information from trusted, official sources. pic.twitter.com/ENc4c3kjep ""FBI Portland and local law enforcement agencies have been receiving reports that extremists are responsible for setting wildfires in Oregon,"" said Special Agent in Charge Loren Cannon in a Sept. 11 statement on Twitter. ""With our state and local partners, the FBI has investigated several such reports and found them to be untrue."" Investigators say some fires were set deliberately, such as one near Eugene, Ore., that burned hundreds of acres, another in Phoenix, Ore., and a small fire in Puyallup, Wash. But extremist groups are not thought to be connected to them, and arson appears to be the exception among causes for the wildfires, not the rule.  So what is causing the wildfires? All evidence points to a mix of weather, downed power lines and fires set by people trying to enjoy the outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Many of the fires currently burning in Oregon are still under investigation, so I don’t have confirmation of cause,"" said Joy Krawczyk, a public affairs manager for the Oregon Department of Forestry.

What an attack about Biden’s votes on Social Security omits
","President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden have attacked each other’s records on Social Security. Biden’s critics have culled their attacks from decades-old votes Biden made while he was a senator representing Delaware. ""In 1983, Joe Biden voted in favor of taxing 50% of Social Security — and it passed,"" said a Sept. 7 Facebook post. ""In 1993, Joe Biden doubled down and was the deciding vote in raising the percentage taxed on Social Security from 50% to 85%."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Senate, including Biden, did vote for those tax changes for Social Security 1983 and 1993. Biden wasn’t the ""deciding vote"" in 1993. (Read more about Biden’s positions on Social Security over his decades-long career here.) RELATED: Ad Watch: Biden exaggerates Trump’s Social Security action The Facebook post is correct that Biden voted in favor of changes to Social Security in 1983. The legislation had wide bipartisan support in order to prevent Social Security from running out of money. When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, federal economists warned that the system was in dire financial straits. That prompted Reagan to try to overhaul Social Security by creating a bipartisan commission (known informally as the Greenspan commission). In 1983, revenues were starting to move below the existing level of benefit payments, said Eugene Steuerle, an Urban Institute economist.  ""Seniors then dependent upon benefits they already had been receiving were threatened with a cut in their existing benefit levels unless Congress enacted some tax increases or benefit cuts, or as provided in the 1983, legislative compromise, some combination,"" Steuerle said. The commission’s recommendations led to amendments that authorized the taxation of Social Security. The 1983 legislation required beneficiaries to pay income tax on up to 50% of their benefits if their modified adjusted gross income — which includes one-half of Social Security benefit income — was greater than $25,000 for single individuals and $32,000 for married couples. The legislation also postponed cost of living increases, required federal workers to join the system and gradually raised the retirement age to 67 by 2027. The legislation passed in March 1983 with bipartisan support, including Biden’s. The Senate passed the legislation 88-9 and then agreed to the conference report 58-14. Reagan signed the legislation.  ''By working together in our best bipartisan tradition, 'we have passed reform legislation that brings us much closer to ensuring the integrity of the Social Security System,'' Reagan said. In 1993, President Bill Clinton aimed to reduce the deficit. House and Senate negotiators agreed to increase taxes on high-income Social Security recipients as part of a nearly $500 billion deficit-reduction plan.  The bill’s provision on Social Security required recipients with incomes of more than $34,000 for individuals (or $44,000 for couples) to pay taxes on 85% of their benefits, up from 50%. The change affected upper-income and some middle-class retirees.  The legislation also created a new top income tax bracket of 36% on taxable income above $115,000 (single) and $140,000 (married). It’s common in political rhetoric to attack a politician as casting the ""deciding vote,"" but that label only applies if the politician was the final holdout or played a particular last-minute role. Biden, who voted in favor of the bill, wasn’t the deciding vote. Major news outlets reported that Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., was the last senator to announce his intentions and voted in favor, assuring passage. So in one respect, Kerrey could appropriately be described as having provided the ""deciding vote."" But that mantle ultimately ended up going to former Vice President Al Gore who, faced with a 50-50 tie in the Senate, cast the deciding vote in favor. RELATED: Social Security: A critical program with an uncertain future A Facebook post said that ""in 1983, Joe Biden voted in favor of taxing 50% of Social Security"" and in 1993, Biden ""was the deciding vote in raising the percentage taxed on Social Security from 50% to 85%."" Biden voted for both measures on Social Security in those years, but more context about the legislation and circumstances is needed. The 1983 legislation allowed up to 50% of benefits to be added to taxable income if a taxpayer’s total income exceeded certain thresholds. The legislation, signed by President Reagan, had wide bipartisan support. And, yes, Biden voted in favor of 1993 legislation that aimed to reduce the deficit and required some recipients to pay taxes on 85% of their benefits, up from 50% previously. The change affected upper-income and some middle-class retirees. But Biden was not the ""deciding vote."" Gore as vice president cast the deciding vote after the Senate split 50-50.

Fact-checking Mark Kelly on Martha McSally’s stance on Medicare
","As Arizonans contemplate who should represent them in the U.S. Senate, Democratic contender Mark Kelly claimed Republican Sen. Martha McSally isn’t really looking out for seniors. In a Sept. 2 post on his campaign website, Kelly said McSally wouldn’t protect Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for people over 65. ""And despite saying she would protect seniors, McSally supported a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and ‘shift costs’ onto seniors, according to the AARP,"" Kelly’s website said, referring to the advocacy group for seniors. ""McSally even supported raising the retirement age."" Is Kelly right about McSally’s record on Medicare, vouchers and raising the retirement age? Kelly’s campaign pointed to October 2017 reporting from the Arizona Daily Star that said McSally voted in favor of a Republican budget plan for fiscal year 2018 that ""would gradually change Medicare to a voucher program."" (McSally served in the House at the time.) A Republican summary of that proposal said it would save and strengthen Medicare ""by moving to a premium support system,"" lowering costs for beneficiaries and the government through increased competition, and maintaining the option for traditional Medicare. Under a premium-support or voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the voucher approach is to slow the growth in Medicare spending. AARP in 2017 argued that such a switch could shift more costs to beneficiaries over time. Experts at the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a March 2017 blog post that proposals to convert Medicare to a voucher system could lead to higher Medicare premiums and cost-sharing for seniors already enrolled in the program. It may be the case that not all seniors would see costs go up, but some would, Tricia Neuman, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told PolitiFact. Although McSally endorsed a move to a premium-support or voucher system in 2017, she voted against her party in 2015, when she supported a motion that instructed House conferees to prevent Medicare from becoming a voucher program, among other things. McSally was one of only three Republicans who supported the motion offered by then-Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland. McSally embraced a more conservative voice during a 2018 Senate primary race. Before that she was generally perceived as a moderate Republican. Motions to instruct conferees and concurrent resolutions are not binding, so they do not directly stop or allow changes to Medicare or other matters. Budget resolutions lay out a plan. When she first ran for Congress in 2012, the Green Valley News asked McSally if Social Security was sustainable and whether she supported changes such as raising the retirement age. McSally said Social Security was unsustainable and needed measures to strengthen it for future generations. ""For younger workers, we need to consider approaches such as gradually increasing the retirement age and allowing them to invest a portion of their Social Security payments in ways that will allow them to maximize their returns,"" McSally said. We asked McSally’s campaign about her position in 2020, but did not hear back. Kelly said McSally ""supported a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and ‘shift costs’ onto seniors"" and ""even supported raising the retirement age."" McSally has a mixed voting record regarding a transition of Medicare into a premium support or voucher program. Kaiser Family Foundation experts in 2017 said proposals to convert Medicare to a voucher system could lead to higher costs for seniors already enrolled in Medicare. McSally in 2012 stated support for potentially raising the retirement age. Her campaign did not say where she stood on that issue in 2020. Kelly’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

In tying Trump backer Karen Handel to Trump, Lucy McBath errs on Handel votes
","In a rematch of a race that helped flip control of the U.S. House to Democrats, Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath tied her opponent to President Donald Trump. A McBath TV ad starts with Republican Karen Handel bragging that she supported Trump 98% of the time. The ad cites three examples, but it gets some things wrong when it claims Handel voted with Trump on ""gutting health care for millions, supporting horrific child separation policies"" and for ""abortion bans."" The 6th District rematch is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. Handel served in the House from June 20, 2017, to Jan. 3, 2019, after winning a special election to fill the remainder of the term of  Tom Price, who resigned. She is the former chairwoman of Fulton County (Ga.) Board of Commissioners and the former secretary of state of Georgia. McBath defeated Handel in Handel’s bid for re-election in November 2018. McBath became a gun-control advocate after the shooting death of her teen son in 2012. McBath’s ad alludes to the American Health Care Act, a Trump-supported Republican bill that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).  The bill, which did not become law, was approved by the House, with only GOP votes, in May 2017.  That was before the special election that put Handel in the House. As a candidate, Handel did say Obamacare needed to be repealed and replaced. She called the House vote a good first step. It goes too far to say the bill would have been gutting health care. The bill would have retained Obamacare provisions such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage for a pre-existing health problem, although subsidies to keep insurance affordable would have been reduced dramatically. The ad also alludes to an August 2018 incident on the House floor over the Trump administration’s policy to separate children from their parents at the southern border. With Handel acting temporarily as the House chair, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., played a recording of children crying in a detention center. Handel asked him to stop, citing a House rule that forbids the playing of electronic devices. She banged the gavel and ordered him to stop several times, but he continued playing the recording for several minutes. Handel had expressed opposition to the policy two months earlier, however, saying: ""We must find a more humane, compassionate approach — one that keeps families together to the fullest extent possible — as U.S. immigration authorities determine appropriate next steps."" Handel did vote in October 2017 for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, backed by Trump, which would have made it a crime to perform an abortion ""if the probable post-fertilization age of the fetus is 20 weeks or more."" It passed the House but did not become law. McBath’s ad gets some details wrong in saying that when Handel was in the House, she voted with Trump, ""gutting health care for millions, supporting horrific child separation policies"" and for ""abortion bans."" Handel supported repealing Obamacare, but a House vote on a Republican replacement bill occurred before she took office. Handel opposed Trump’s policy of separating children from their parents at the southern border. She did vote for a bill that would have outlawed certain abortions. We rate McBath’s claim Half True.

Handel’s own ad disproves her claim that McBath backs ‘those who attack police’
","In a rematch of a race that helped flip control of the U.S. House to Democrats, Republican Karen Handel accuses Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of ""supporting those who attack the police."" Handel makes the accusation in a TV ad. Handel lost the Atlanta-area seat to McBath in 2018. The 6th District rematch is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  The key scene in the ad shows McBath participating in a demonstration, where one marcher behind McBath holds a sign comparing police to the Ku Klux Klan.  But the demonstration is against police misconduct, not against police — and McBath is shown marching alongside the local police chief. Handel served in the House from June 2017 to January 2019, after winning a special election to fill the remainder of the term of  Tom Price, who resigned to serve in the Trump administration. She is the former chairwoman of the Fulton County (Ga.) Commission and the former secretary of state of Georgia. McBath became a gun-control advocate after the shooting death of her teen son in 2012. She defeated Handel in Handel’s bid for reelection in November 2018.  Handel opens her ad, over video clips of violence, vandalism and fires in the streets, by saying: ""Neighborhoods and businesses trashed. People attacked; police, demonized. It’s hit too close to home."" Then she appears on the screen and says: ""Standing up for law enforcement used to be a bipartisan issue. Sadly, today, it’s not."" A clip of McBath holding a megaphone and marching with others in a street appears. Then the focus turns to a sign, held by someone behind and near McBath, with a message that compares police to the Ku Klux Klan.  ""My opponent? She’s supporting those who attack the police, playing partisan politics and making things worse,"" Handel claims. ""In our community, police officers have always had our back. In Congress, I’ll have theirs."" The clip showing McBath and the sign is from a demonstration June 13 in Roswell, a suburb of Atlanta. An Atlanta Journal Constitution news story carried this headline: ""Hundreds, including police chief, march in Roswell against misconduct.""  The main photo with the story shows the sign in the background with McBath walking and talking alongside Roswell Police Chief James Conroy, who told the demonstrators police agencies must change. Conroy has spoken about the need for accountability, racial tolerance and diversity in police departments. The AJC caption says hundreds of peaceful marchers joined in the march to protest racism and police brutality. Asked to substantiate the claim that McBath is supporting those who attack the police, Handel’s campaign sent PolitiFact a statement that begins by saying: ""McBath marched beside signs comparing the police to the KKK. She’s endorsed by groups and members of Congress who are vocal supporters of the defund the police movement — which, in our viewpoint, is an attack on police.""  But McBath can’t be held responsible for the actions of other people in a demonstration. And groups or members of Congress endorsing McBath is not the same as McBath supporting efforts to defund the police. Beyond the ad, Handel’s campaign cited to PolitiFact votes cast by McBath, such as a vote favoring a bill that would require the release of certain prisoners deemed not to be a risk for violence and a vote against a bill that would have required a study of antifa.  But neither vote amounts to an attack on police. Handel claimed McBath ""is supporting those who attack the police."" Handel’s TV ad, which shows McBath participating in a march, attempts to link McBath to a marcher holding a sign that compares police with the KKK. But the march was to protest police misconduct and racism, and the ad itself shows that McBath marched alongside the local police chief.

Joe Biden’s offshoring attack on Donald Trump needs context
","In a Labor Day event, Joe Biden told workers that President Donald Trump’s claims about supporting the average person aren’t supported by the facts. ""He gave big tax cuts to corporations without making them bring jobs home,"" the Democratic nominee said Sept. 7. ""He let federal contractors double offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office."" That last part about offshoring — when companies move jobs overseas to save money — caught our ear. As we drilled down, we found that the numbers behind Biden’s statement are reasonably correct, but the underlying government data aren’t robust enough for firm conclusions. The Biden campaign relied on a report from the labor-backed project Good Jobs Nation, which is part of a group called Change to Win. The report looked at companies that won government contracts between the time Trump won the election and the first week of June 2018. The first thing to note is the period included about three months before Trump took office, which isn’t what Biden said. The report then looked at companies with workers who were at risk of losing their jobs because the company planned to move work overseas. That second list comes from the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program, an effort that’s been around for about six decades to help workers displaced by foreign trade. When someone loses their job, they can apply for retraining and financial assistance to move into a new job. The Good Jobs Nation report took the top 100 government contractors — which included companies such as Boeing, General Motors, Siemens and United Technologies — and counted up the number of jobs that appeared under their names in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The study included jobs at risk due to production shifting overseas. The report found that collectively, these firms accounted for 8,363 lost jobs per year. In contrast, the average rate was 3,100 during the Obama administration. The Trump rate is about two and a half times higher, so that’s the basis for Biden’s statement. To be clear, the report had a narrow focus. The report’s author, George Faraday, a lawyer and policy analyst with Change to Win, said it was written in response to Trump’s signature effort in 2016, before he took office, to stop the air conditioning company Carrier Corp. from sending jobs to Mexico. (We rated that a Promise Kept.)  ""Our point was that Carrier was a one-off and there was no serious follow up,"" said Faraday. ""The administration was willing to award these companies contracts worth billions of dollars from taxpayers, with no expectation that they would invest in the country."" Faraday said he never updated the study beyond the June 2018 cutoff point. It’s important to understand what the trade adjustment job numbers mean, and where the report’s numbers aren’t as precise as they appear. For example, it says Boeing Co. was awarded over $29 billion in contracts, and had 2,681 jobs show up in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. In fact, the government ultimately found that over 5,275 jobs were threatened.  We found a few instances where the Good Jobs Nation report overshot the government figures by a few hundred jobs. On balance, the numbers we found indicated that the thrust of the report’s findings holds up, even if the numbers are off at certain points. It’s worth noting that the government numbers don’t necessarily count people who lost their jobs. The estimates include actual separations, people whom the company thinks it might need to lay off and workers who might see their hours and wages cut back. And it also counts contract workers, which in Boeing’s case involves a large number of firms that provide Boeing with workers who have special skills. Even if the numbers in the report check out, it’s reasonable to scrutinize the findings a little more. We looked at whether total U.S. employment at some of the largest firms rose or fell during the period the report covers. We were able to get hard numbers only from Boeing. Between 2016 and 2017, the company shed about 9,000 jobs. The comparison isn’t perfect. The figure doesn’t include contract workers, and the time period doesn’t align perfectly with the 18 months in the Good Jobs Nation study. But the decline suggests the report spotted a real trend. On the other hand, what happened at Boeing in 2018 and 2019 points to the biggest limitation in Biden’s claim — it considers a narrow time frame. The Boeing press office told us that the number of workers rose over the next two years, and by 2019, the total was 5,000 higher than in 2016.  It’s also worth noting that Biden spoke only about federal contractors and jobs sent out of the country. Looking at all companies and jobs affected by trade — which includes jobs lost when production shifts to outside U.S. borders, but also when imports displace domestic production — the average number of displaced workers is lower during the Trump years than during Obama’s second term. The difference is about 4,000 jobs, or a decline of about 5%. The flip side of offshoring is reshoring, or bringing overseas jobs back to the U.S. The data on that is limited. The Reshoring Initiative, a project of a private business consultant Harry Moser, tracks press releases and news reports to count jobs brought back to the U.S. That’s a bit informal, but in any case, Moser said Trump’s record is mixed, largely due to his policy of imposing tariffs. ""Reshoring grew solidly thru 2015, soared in 2016 when Trump was elected, accelerated higher in 2017 with lower taxes and regulations, then declined in 2018 and 2019, primarily due to business uncertainty from the trade war,"" Moser said. But the bottom line is that claims about both sending jobs overseas and bringing them home should not be taken at face value. Biden said that in his first 18 months in office, Trump allowed government contractors to offshore jobs at twice the rate as before. Biden accurately quoted a report, and its findings are reasonably accurate. But the report’s job count actually began before Trump took office, and the government’s tallies include jobs that are at risk, not necessarily ones that are lost. That way of counting jobs, however, would apply equally to the Trump and Obama years. There’s a measure of accuracy in Biden’s statement, but it requires more context.

No, Trump didn’t denigrate Africans with this offensive comment
","President Donald Trump is regularly criticized for comments deemed insensitive, racist and more. But at least one comment attributed to him on social media is baseless.  A Sept. 11 Instagram post shows an image of what appears to be a newspaper clipping from Oct. 27, 2015, with a headline in quote marks: ""‘Africans Are Lazy, Good At Sex, Theft.’"" Under the headline is a picture of Trump with his mouth open as if he were photographed mid-sentence. The first sentence of the story reads, ""Business magnate Donald Trump has expressed his deep distrust for Africans by referring to them as lazy fools only good at eating, lovemaking and thuggery."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence Trump said this. Social media users have revived the old claim in this fabricated newspaper clip despite the fact that it was debunked by other fact-checking organizations as long ago as 2015. PolitiFact searched news archives for any record of Trump saying the quote or anything similar, and found nothing. Snopes reported that several African websites in 2015 claimed that Trump, then a candidate for president, made the comments in Indianapolis. But there is no evidence any U.S. or international news outlet reported on the comments, which would have been considered newsworthy. What’s more, his campaign events leading up to Oct. 27, 2015, when this false news story was supposedly published, were in Jacksonville, Fla., and New Hampshire. He was not in Indiana during this period. Even stories that focus on offensive things the president has said do not include this quote. The closest we found: In his 1991 memoir, former Trump business associate John O’Donnell wrote that Trump once called Black people lazy. ""I think that the guy is lazy,"" the quote attributed to Trump says. ""And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in Blacks. It really is; I believe that. It’s not anything they can control."" An Instagram post shows an image of a newspaper story that claims Trump said ""Africans Are Lazy, Good At Sex, Theft."" There is no evidence Trump said this.
