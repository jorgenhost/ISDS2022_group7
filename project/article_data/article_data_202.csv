Is New York a 'giver state' to federal treasury?
","In the campaign’s final days, Democrat Nathan McMurray has discussed the Republicans’ recent tax bill, signed into law last year. McMurray seeks to unseat Republican Chris Collins in New York’s 27th Congressional District. As he criticizes Collins' vote for the bill, McMurray tells audiences that New York residents send more money to Washington than they get back in benefits. ""Do you know that New York State pays out way more than we ever get back,"" McMurray said during a debate at St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute in Tonawanda. ""We’re a giver state, while there’s other states that are taker states."" Is McMurray right? Several analyses in recent years have reached similar conclusions. Generally, states with high-income earners send more money to Washington than states with low-income populations. States that consume more federally taxed products, such as alcohol and gasoline, also send more money to Washington. Meanwhile, states with more federal workers and contracts, such as Maryland and Virginia, or those with higher health care costs and poverty rates, receive more in federal spending. There are other drivers of how much states get in federal funds. Florida, with a lot of retirees, receives more Social Security payments than other states.   State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report on the balance of payments between New Yorkers and the federal government in October. DiNapoli, an elected Democrat whose office reports on state finances, concluded that for every dollar New York sent to the federal government in federal fiscal year 2017, it received just 90 cents in benefits. The average return for all states was $1.19 for every dollar they send to Washington, D.C., DiNapoli said. DiNapoli’s latest findings are consistent with what he has found in analyses conducted in two prior years. In 2013, the state received 91 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, and in 2016, it received 84 cents for every dollar it sent. In fiscal year 2017, New York sent $24.1 billion more in tax payments to Washington than it received, DiNapoli found. New York sent nearly $250 billion to the federal government, while federal funds spent in New York totaled $225.7 billion. New York’s high per-capita payment to Washington relative to other states is driven by its higher-than average contributions in corporate taxes, individual income taxes, and social insurance taxes, such as Social Security and unemployment, the comptroller found. Meanwhile, New York receives less per capita than other states when it comes to federal workers’ wages and defense spending, but more than other states for Medicaid. New York is just one of 11 states that sends more to the federal government than it receives, DiNapoli said. New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut fared worse than New York when it comes to federal taxes paid and benefits received. New Mexico has the most favorable balance of federal taxes and received benefits. The Rockefeller Institute for Government, a nonpartisan public policy think tank in Albany, prepared an analysis during the debate about President Trump’s tax bill. ""New York’s negative balance of payments was the largest of any state by far, roughly equaling the combined shortfalls of #2-ranked New Jersey and #3-ranked Illinois,"" according to a Rockefeller analysis of fiscal year 2015, published in September 2017. On a per-capita basis, New York had the third-worst balance of payments. More than a decade ago, an analysis from the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, found that in 2005 New York received 79 cents for every dollar it sends to Washington. In a system of progressive taxes, where wealthier people pay more in taxes, it’s not surprising that some states pay more to the federal government than they receive, analysts said. ""Because one goal of the federal system is redistribution, it is not surprising that some states ‘give’ far more than they ‘get,’ while the opposite is true for other states,"" according to an analysis from the SUNY-affiliated Rockefeller Institute of Government. An economist from the Tax Foundation, which raises about a third of its support from businesses, wrote in 2006 that strictly considering whether a state gets as much as it pays in isn’t ""a very civic minded view of federal government. Presumably citizens pay federal taxes to provide for the common defense and to support other national programs that benefit the nation as a whole."" McMurray said that New Yorkers send ""way more"" money to the federal government than the federal government sends to New York. Whether it is a good idea or not that every state receives back from the federal government what its residents and businesses paid to Washington, McMurray’s statement is accurate, based on the latest available data and analyses.   We rate his claim True.  ",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/nathan-mcmurray/new-york-giver-state-federal-treasury/

Democrats' attack on Gov. Rick Scott's immigration stance out of date
","An attack ad on Facebook features a Hispanic family sitting around the dinner table, bemoaning Gov. Rick Scott’s immigration policies. ""This is our family, but if Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida,"" said the narrator. ""He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S. Families belong together. Rick Scott turned his back on ours."" Two Democratic groups, Priorities USA Action and the Senate Majority PAC, paid for the ad and placed it on a Facebook page, Nuestra Florida, which translates to Our Florida. Scott, a Republican two-term governor, is challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. The lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): ""Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship."" But this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore. This attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010. The video cites a sentence from a 2010 TIME magazine article about the Florida 2010 governor’s race. It says, ""Scott favors Arizona’s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law."" Scott did promise then to bring a law similar to Arizona’s SB 1070 to Florida. The 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling, prompting state officials to add to the law that police ""may not consider race, color or national origin."" Scott argued in 2010 that the law wasn’t racial profiling and said, ""I clearly don't believe in racial profiling."" But Scott never pushed for such a law after he was elected, breaking his promise. A spokesman for Priorities USA Action said the result shouldn’t matter to people who saw the Facebook post. ""We say that he vowed to implement laws like Arizona,"" Priorities USA Action spokesman Josh Schwerin said. ""Just because he didn’t get it done doesn’t mean he didn’t pledge to do it."" In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court found parts of the Arizona law unconstitutional but upheld the central requirement calling on officers to check the status of people they suspect were undocumented immigrants. This attack zeroes in on Scott’s statements against Dreamers early in his tenure. It, too, ignores that his more recent position is more favorable to this group of immigrants. Dreamers are immigrants brought over to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children. Just weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against a DREAM Act bill in Congress. ""I'm against the Dream Act,"" he said in December 2010. ""Why? I don't believe in amnesty."" In 2013, Scott vetoed a bill to let Dreamers get driver’s licenses. Scott criticized the Obama administration’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals as a policy ""absent congressional direction."" (DACA allowed these illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status — Trump later rescinded it.) Scott also argued that the Florida driver’s license bill was unnecessary because those with a federal employment authorization card could already obtain a temporary driver license. But in 2014 as he was seeking re-election, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition. ""Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition,"" he said. That was a Full Flop from 2011 when he said ""with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it."" In September 2017, when Trump was deciding whether to dismantle DACA, Scott issued a statement saying, ""I do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents."" ""These kids must be allowed to pursue the American Dream, and Congress must act on this immediately,"" he said. He elaborated on his point in a January 2018 USA Today calling for Congress to ""secure the immigration status of Dreamers,"" a reference to Trump saying he would extend protections to Dreamers. Scott called on Congress to ""do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams."" While an extension of deferred action is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott moderated his view and became more open to Dreamers having a way to legally stay in the United States. A Facebook ad by Democratic groups said, ""If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S."" This ad leaves viewers with the misleading impression that these are current Scott policies. Neither is true. Scott did promise in 2010 to bring Arizona’s immigration law to Florida. Immigration advocates feared the law would lead to racial profiling. Once Scott was elected, he never pursued the idea. Scott was a bit more active in his earlier opposition to allowing Dreamers to stay in the country, but that has also changed. He publicly objected to Obama’s deferred action program for people who came into the country illegally as children, saying Obama bypassed Congress. Scott also vetoed a bill to give Dreamers driver’s licenses. But in 2014, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition and in the past year he has spoken in favor of helping Dreamers. In total, the ad creates a misleading impression that Scott is anti-immigrant by only drawing on part of his record.

Did West Virginia lead the way in construction job growth?
","Did West Virginia lead the nation in the growth of construction jobs jobs in 2017? The West Virginia Republican Party says it did. On Sept. 14, the party tweeted, ""Did you know West Virginia added the highest percentage of new construction jobs in 2017 in the United States, at 14.4%? This amounted to 4,300 additional jobs! In fact, #WV was the only state with double-digit growth! Read more about the #WVcomeback.""

In fact, #WV was the only state with double-digit growth! Read more about the #WVcomeback: https://t.co/S6ygb08HxK   The tweet linked to an article from the Wheeling News-Register citing those numbers. But we wanted to confirm this with original data. It turns out that the source of the 50-state comparison is a report by the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade association in the construction industry. The comparison is drawn from data collected from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here are the five states with the biggest percentage increases during 2017.
  State Increase in jobs Twelve-month percentage increase West Virginia 4,300 14.4 percent California 75,500 9.8 percent Nevada 7,800 9.7 percent New Mexico 4,300 9.7 percent Idaho 3,800 8.7 percent So the party’s tweet was accurate. We also took a longer-term look at construction employment in the state. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction employment in West Virginia bottomed out in the second half of 2016 and rose consistently through the first quarter of 2018 before stabilizing. Still, the current level of construction employment in West Virginia hasn’t returned to its nearly three-decade peak in the period before the onset of the Great Recession.   It’s worth noting that construction jobs, while important for people within the industry and within adjacent industries, only account for about 4.5 percent of non-agricultural employment in the state -- about 34,000 construction jobs in August 2018 out of 752,000 nonfarm jobs in all. ""Total job growth clearly matters more to West Virginia citizens than employment in just one not-so-big industry,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Still, as far as the tweet’s limited claim goes, it is accurate. The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted that ""West Virginia added the highest percentage of new construction jobs in 2017 in the United States, at 14.4%? This amounted to 4,300 additional jobs! In fact, #WV was the only state with double-digit growth!"" A look at the original data shows that the No. 1 ranking, the percentage increase, and the raw increase in jobs are all correct. So is West Virginia’s distinction as the only state with double-digit growth in 2017.

Medicare for All expands Medicare, does not obliterate it, as Donald Trump says
","President Donald Trump has picked up a time-tested Democratic attack line. ""A vote for Democrats is also a vote to destroy Medicare,"" Trump said at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Oct. 26. When Democrats said Republicans ""voted to end Medicare"" in 2011, we called it the Lie of the Year. Trump is also wrong here. In rallies across the country, Trump has been claiming health care coverage for the elderly is under threat by Medicare for All, a plan Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced in September 2017. ""The Democrat plan would – it would just obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage ... Do you know about this? Has anyone heard this? It will obliterate 700,000 North Carolina seniors who have been paying for this for years (and) will not be taken care of anymore."" Trump said the same thing in a Wisconsin rally. First, there are a wide array of approaches Democrats have proposed to expand health care coverage. Medicare for All is the most aggressive plan that offers most benefits to seniors, but it is certainly not supported by all Democrats. It had 16 co-sponsors in the Senate, which is fewer than half the Senate Democrats. Similar legislation in the House has 123 co-sponsors. It has been referred to a Senate committee, but nothing more has been done with it. While the Sanders bill would likely change Medicare, it would not get rid of it or ""obliterate"" it. The Sanders bill would transform the health insurance system from a mix of private and public coverage options that depend on age, employment and income, to a single-payer system where everybody would be insured through the government. ""It would mean people who are currently enrolled (in Medicare) would get something much more generous and comprehensive than they are currently getting,"" said Linda Blumberg, health policy fellow with the Urban Institute. Medicare serves almost one out of six Americans. It primarily covers people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. Medicare has four main parts, but three – B, C and D – are optional. People can decide to use them and pay premiums for the coverage. Anyone who qualifies gets the coverage for part A. Medicare Advantage is the C component; it’s run by private companies and offers the services Medicare does and more, such as dental or vision coverage. About a third of Medicare enrollees are signed up for such a plan. Under Sanders’ plan, after a four-year transition period, all of these components would be replaced with a health care plan that includes vision, hearing and dental coverage, as well as stronger financial protections. There would be no premiums or cost-sharing requirements, other than limited cost-sharing (up to $200 per year) on prescription drugs. Patients would be allowed to go to any provider, not limited by a network. Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst at the RAND Corporation, said provider access might change when the federal government is in charge of negotiating and potentially setting rates for services. The amount of services providers are willing to offer, for example, may decrease if the prices are too low. Tricia Neuman, director of the program on Medicare Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said Sanders’ bill includes a provision that would allow doctors to opt out of the program, just as they can under Medicare. ""For this to create widespread access problems, doctors would need to have enough patients who are wealthy enough to pay whatever fees the doctors charge out of their own pockets,"" Neuman said. ""So far, this happens very rarely under Medicare."" But the effect it would have remains to be seen. The same goes for cost; the revenue options are not incorporated in the legislative language. But Sanders has proposed funding through payroll taxes as well as income taxes for the highest earners. That would only affect the highest-earning seniors. The same benefits would be extended to all citizens; the plan would eliminate employer-based coverage and replace virtually all private insurance. Trump said, ""The Democrat plan would just obliterate Medicare and terminate Medicare Advantage ... seniors who have been paying for this for years (and) will not be taken care of anymore."" Not all Democrats support Medicare for All. The proposed new system gets rid of Medicare and Medicare Advantage as they stand in order to expand health benefits. Nobody would lose their health care coverage. We rate this statement False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/donald-trump/medicare-all-expands-medicare-does-not-obliterate-/

Baldwin bipartisan Tomah VA bill claim scores but comes with caveat
","The opioid crisis has devastated communities, claimed lives and become a major campaign issue. In the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, Republican challenger Leah Vukmir has slammed U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, over an overprescription scandal at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In response, Baldwin launched her own campaign ad featuring the parents of late Marine Jason Simcakoski that claims that -- in the wake of the death -- Baldwin ""brought both parties together to help pass a law"" to ""make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of"" opioids. That’s what we want to look at here. The background To be sure, Baldwin’s ad sidesteps what happened in Tomah and the role she and her office played in handling information from a whistleblower. As we have noted in earlier items: Problems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors had been handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place ""Candy Land."" Prior to that, on Aug. 29, 2014, Baldwin’s office received a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General following a 2½-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time. A day later, Simcakoski died of a ""mixed use toxicity"" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol. In fact, after months of criticism about inaction on a whistleblower’s complaints about Tomah, Baldwin acknowledged her office had made mistakes, leading her to fire one staffer, demote another and dock the pay of her chief of staff. Vukmir has hammered Baldwin for months over the issue. During a September 2018 appearance on  ""Capital City Sunday"" on WKOW-TV, she said Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation ""to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids"" at the Tomah VA, ""later a veteran died"" and Baldwin ""covered it up."" We rated Vukmir’s overall claim Mostly False. We found that Baldwin was the only one with the report and that she didn’t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news. But she received the report only a day before the veteran died and -- while she did not publicize it -- an investigation by the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee into allegations of a coverup found the complaints lacked merit. Now to Baldwin’s claim What happened next In her claim, Baldwin is referring to legislation she co-authored -- the ""Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act."" On the campaign trail, Baldwin has referred to it as ""Jason’s Law."" And that’s what Baldwin’s campaign pointed to when we asked for evidence to support her claim. ""Jason’s Law includes multiple measures designed to hold the VA system more accountable for the care of veterans and provide stricter opioid prescription guidelines,"" said campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt. ""Since being signed into law, Jason’s Law has helped improve the VA, where they’ve seen lower opioid prescribing rates and increased numbers of physicians who receive updated training."" Now to the specifics: Bipartisan bill: According to a June 22, 2015 news release, Baldwin and U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., introduced the initial measure. The news release shows supporters at the time included 11 other senators -- nine of them Democrats and two of them Republicans. Among the Republicans: Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. A July 13, 2016 report from WSAW TV and the Associated Press said Baldwin’s bill and one from U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat, were included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, made up of 12 bills. That measure passed the Senate in a 94-1 vote. On July 22, 2016, President Obama signed the package into law. Johnson himself referred to the measure as ""a bipartisan step."" VA accountability/overprescribing: That portion of the claim is supported by a May 9, 2018 appearance by VA Deputy Under Secretary Carolyn Clancy on C-SPAN. In the interview, Clancy said ""we’ve seen a 47 percent decrease in the number of veterans on chronic opioids in Tomah, which is a little ahead of the national average. We’ve made great progress overall. For the proportion of patients on both a benzodiazepine and an opioid, which has a very high risk of adverse events, the decrease has been 76 percent at Tomah which is a little bit ahead of the national decrease."" In April 2018, the Tomah VA became one of 18 veterans hospitals across the country involved in the ""Whole Health"" program. The program considers the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and environmental elements that work together to provide the best quality of life for each veteran, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs. ""We will never eradicate the need for opioids, but I think by combining it with the nontraditional therapy and taking the whole look at the veteran and veterans' needs, we will be able to manage pain and still let the veterans have a quality of life that they need,"" Victoria Brahm, director of the Tomah VA, said in an April 23, 2018 Associated Press story. So, on the narrow points of Baldwin’s claim, she is on target -- even as she ignores missteps by her office that could have mitigated the problems. Alec Zimmerman, spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Baldwin had left ""our state’s heroes in danger"" and that rather than taking immediate action ""was trying to save her political future."" Our rating A Baldwin campaign ad claims she ""brought both parties together to help pass a law"" to ""make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of"" opioids. The action came only after the overprescription scandal made headlines -- something ignored in the ad. Likewise, the ad sidesteps key missteps by Baldwin’s own office. Nevertheless, the claims in this ad are narrowly drawn. We rate Baldwin’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-bipartisan-bill-claim-scores-comes-caveat/

Sen. Tarte's Full Flop on tolls
","""Based on information from NCDOT, I am still in favor of tolling I-77 since this option solves the problem sooner rather than much later and will generate additional dollars for local road projects,"" Tarte wrote in the article. ""Simply doing nothing is not an option."" - Sen. Jeff Tarte to the Charlotte Observer on July 1, 2014 ""I totally support no tolling"" -Sen. Jeff Tarte to WSOC-TV on June 14, 2014 Drivers in Charlotte spend an average of 23 hours a week stuck in traffic, according to Inrix, a company that analyzes transportation and traffic data. It’s no wonder there are plans to help alleviate some of this congestion by adding lanes on I-77, an interstate that wraps around the western part of Charlotte. The North Carolina Department of Transportation began in 2007 to seriously look into expanding the stretch of the interstate that runs from Mooresville to Charlotte. These lanes will use tolls to pay for the expansion, which will open near the end of this year. Only two of these lanes will have tolls. Many drivers aren’t happy with the decision to charge tolls, and some don’t think it will help with the congestion. And with election season coming to a close soon, the I-77 tolls have been a popular topic of discussion between state Sen. Jeff Tarte and Democratic challenger Natasha Marcus. They are running to represent North Carolina’s Senate District 41. Tarte wrote an op-ed in the Charlotte Observer in 2014 saying he is ""in favor of tolling on I-77 since this option solves the problem sooner rather than later."" However, in a recent Charlotte Observer article highlighting the Marcus-Tarte race, Tarte, a Republican from Cornelius, said in an interview with the Observer, ""At no point have I been in favor of this specific project."" The project Tarte is referencing is the state’s contract with Cintra, a Spanish firm responsible for building the lanes. Tarte told the Observer the governor should cancel the contract. Cintra would also maintain the toll lanes for 50 years. Tarte also said he ""totally supports no tolling"" to WSOC-TV on June 14, 2018. The North Carolina Democratic Party disagrees, and has a webpage dedicated to saying Tarte gave the project the ""green-light before being against them."" The decision to use tolls to pay for the expansion of I-77 came in 2010 according to NCDOT’s timeline of the project. Tarte was the mayor of Cornelius, a town north of Charlotte, at the time of the decision. He was elected to the state Senate in 2013. April 29, 2009 There are minutes from a meeting in 2009 — when Tarte was mayor of Cornelius — of the Mecklenburg-Union Metropolitan Planning Organization that shows Tarte expressed some support for managed lanes, which means lanes that are operated using some types of restrictions or with tolls. ""Mr. Foxx asked Mayor Tarte about constructing I-77 lanes as managed lanes. He replied that he had no concerns with that,"" according to the minutes. The Mr. Foxx here is Anthony Foxx. He represented Charlotte on the planning organization for Mecklenburg and Union county, and went on to serve as the U.S. secretary of transportation under President Barack Obama. May 24, 2013 During Tarte’s first year as senator, he called the tolls ""the least onerous of the alternatives"" for expanding I-77, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. Tarte said in a phone interview with PolitiFact in 2018 that he supported tolls prior to 2014 because the state said there were no other ways to finance the project. June 14, 2014 In an email exchange between Tarte and Anthony Tata, the former state transportation secretary, Tata said Tarte supported the project. The email, from Tarte on June 24, 2014, reads: ""I am requesting that our State Auditor, and elected officials of the NCGA, selected by President Pro Tem as well as the Speaker, to be allowed to perform a review of the contract between NCDOT and Cintra prior to authorizing the signature of this contract."" Tarte got a response from Tata, the same day which tells a different tale: ""At the conclusion of the meeting you indicated that you were comfortable that the I-77 project was a ‘good deal for the state.’ As you know NCDOT Director of Technical Services Rodger Rochelle and the team of professionals, some of whom were in the meeting yesterday, have performed detailed due diligence on this project."" These emails were noted in an audit released from the office of the state auditor, Beth Wood, in June 2018. July 1, 2014 In the Charlotte Observer, Tarte wrote an op-ed asking for Gov. Pat McCrory to properly vet the contract with Cintra — a consistent message from Tarte. ""Based on information from NCDOT, I am still in favor of tolling I-77 since this option solves the problem sooner rather than much later and will generate additional dollars for local road projects,"" Tarte wrote in the article. ""Simply doing nothing is not an option."" Tarte says in the article that he takes issue with the contract with Cintra, but not with tolling. July 18, 2014 Tarte supported the idea of high occupancy toll lanes, according to WFAE, an NPR affiliate. This article again says Tarte had questions about the specific contract that would be signed with Cintra. High occupancy tolls means that cars with a high number of passengers would be able to drive on the interstate for free. In the managed lanes being built on I-77, the price of tolls is free to fluctuate based on the number of cars. Any vehicle with three or more passengers won’t have to pay the toll. June 29, 2015 Tarte told the Carolina Journal he had plans to introduce a bill to stop the project because most people are opposed to it, and there are new ways to finance the expansion of I-77 without using tolls. Nov. 13, 2015 Tarte was one of four legislators who wrote a letter to McCrory asking for the project to be stopped, according to the Charlotte Observer. They say the tolls would hurt business in the area and the lanes were being built below standard. Dec. 11, 2015 Tarte was described by the Courier-Tribune as someone who ""once supported tolls."" At this time, Tarte was asking for NCDOT to look at the entire interstate again to see if there were other ways to fund the construction. June 21, 2016 An effort to stop the project failed in the General Assembly. Tarte expressed his disappointment to the Charlotte Observer. The article says Tarte had plans to introduce a bill in the following session to try to stop the project again. June 24, 2018 During session early this year, state senators passed a bill giving Gov. Roy Cooper until October to either change the contract with Cintra or cancel it entirely. Tarte was the sponsor of this bill. ""I totally support no tolling,"" Tarte said in a phone interview with WSOC-TV. Tarte says he originally supported using tolls to pay for the widening of I-77 because they were not presented with other options. Based on his public statements, he has consistently been against the contract with Cintra and asked for the contract to be vetted. However, that doesn’t change the fact that he went from supporting the tolls to completely opposing them. We rate this a Full Flop.

Democrat Tony Evers misfires on education spending claim against Republican Scott Walker
","Schools have been front and center throughout the race for Wisconsin governor, which pits the state schools superintendent against a Republican governor who famously took on teachers’ unions. In one volley, Democrat Tony Evers zeroed in on school spending under Gov. Scott Walker. ""Do you trust Scott Walker on education?"" asks the TV ad, released Sept. 25, 2018. ""He’s the politician who cut $800 million from our schools."" That’s very similar to an Evers claim we fact-checked in April -- that Walker ""has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools."" We rated that Mostly False. Does the reduced figure change things? State aid dollars short of $800 million figure Evers’ team said the number in the ad referred to cuts in 2011-’13, under Walker’s first budget. Though much of that funding has since been restored, Evers spokesman Sam Lau argued that doesn’t make the claim less true -- and doesn’t lessen the impact of the reduction. ""Each and every year of a student's education matters,"" Lau said in an email. ""Scott Walker's $800 million cuts to Wisconsin's public schools were devastating and continue to be felt today."" The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided numbers for our April fact check on this topic, and we’ll rely on those again. The chart below has a lot to take in, but we’ll focus on a couple numbers we’ve designated with asterisks. This looks at general purpose revenue (GPR) routed to schools, which includes per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids. It starts with the 2010-’11 budget, the last one under Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s the baseline for the comparison. State fiscal year GPR school aids Change to prior year Change to 2010-’11 Cumulative change to 2010-’11 2010-’11 $5.27 billion       2011-’12 $4.85 billion -$426.5 million -$426.5 million -$426.5 million 2012-’13 $4.91 billion +$68.9 million -$357.6 million -$784.1 million* 2013-’14 $5.03 billion +$119.8 million -$237.8 million -$1.021 billion 2014-’15 $5.19 billion +$160.5 million -$77.3 million -$1.1 billion 2015-’16 $5.2 billion +$3 million -$74.3 million -$1.17 billion 2016-’17 $5.4 billion +$197.3 million +$123 million -$1.05 billion 2017-’18 $5.58 billion +$176.9 million +$299.9 million -$750.6 million 2018-’19 $5.84 billion +$267.1 million +$567 million -$183.6 million*   The numbers do show a large drop when Walker first took office. The state had GPR school aid of $5.27 billion the last year under Doyle. The ""cuts"" Evers alleges come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what funding would have been if it remained at that $5.27 billion level annually. The GPR school aids dropped by $426.5 million in 2011-’12 and then rose by $68.9 million in 2012-’13. Taken together, that reduced school aid by $784.1 million in the two-year budget. That’s in the ballpark of Evers’ claim, but it leaves out a lot of information. The missing pieces It’s critical to note the 2011-’12 funding reduction did not happen in isolation. Act 10, enacted in 2011, required public employees to pay more toward their pensions and decreased their collective bargaining power. That allowed schools to save money that would have gone toward employee pensions and to charge employees more for health insurance. When all districts were tallied in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, now the Wisconsin Policy Forum. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011. So across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study). Another important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget. Thus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began. In reality, after the initial cuts, Walker has increased GPR school aids every year, hitting a high of $5.84 billion this year. That’s above the last year of Doyle’s term, though that doesn’t account for inflation. Those increases mean most of that $784 million in cuts has been returned to the budget. The right-hand column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what it would have been cumulatively if the schools budget remained $5.27 billion every year since 2011. That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million. Our rating In the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget. But that ignores changes made through Walker’s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it’s referring only to cuts from 2011-’13, so viewers wouldn’t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction. Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/tony-evers/democrat-tony-evers-misfires-education-spending-cl/

No evidence for Norman Thomas quote on Democrats embracing 1940s socialism
","Eighty-three years after the Social Security Act was signed into law and 53 years after the enactment of Medicare, fears of socialism continue to define American politics A Facebook post quoting prominent socialist Norman Thomas is making the rounds, garnering about 31,000 shares since Oct. 12. It suggests that the Democratic Party has been using the Socialist Party agenda of the 1940s. It claims that Thomas, in a 1944 speech, said, ""The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under the name of 'liberalism,' they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened."" The meme goes on to quote Thomas as saying, ""I no longer need to run as a Presidential Candidate for the Socialist Party. The Democratic Party has adopted our platform."" Thomas was a Presbyterian minister, social worker, pacifist, prolific author, and co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. He ran for president six times. The meme being spread says, ""If you aren't scared, you're not listening."" The author of the Facebook post, Vincent Schmuki, says (in all caps), ""IT WAS ALL PART OF THEIR PLANNED TAKEOVER OF AMERICA!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact often checks on whether famous people actually uttered the words attributed to them. In this case, the lack of evidence suggests the answer is no. We found plenty of places on the Internet that were using the quotation, but none cite a checkable source. Many say it comes from a Thomas speech in 1944, although no day or venue is offered. Another says it was during a 1948 interview during one of Norman's presidential campaigns but, again, with no reference and indication where the interview was published. Ronald Reagan, 20 years before he became president, used the first part of the quote in a 1961 radio address attacking Medicare as socialized medicine and asserting that Norman said it in 1927. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, editorial advisor at the State Net Capitol Journal, wrote in ""Governor Reagan: His Rise to Power,"" that the quotation was one of his favorites. ""This is a suspect quotation, and Reagan gave no reference for it,"" Cannon wrote. ""If Thomas said this, I have been unable to find evidence of it, and Reagan told me in 1968 that he did not know its origins,"" Cannon said in a footnote. ""Thomas often did say, however, that both major political parties had borrowed items from the Socialist Party platform, including Social Security."" More to the point, Cannon said, ""Reagan was vulnerable to using bogus quotes in his speeches because he clipped so many items out of newspapers in which such quotations abound."" One example Cannon cited was a fake quote from Alexis de Tocqueville about the goodness of America. Cannon reported in that 2003 biography that, ""By the 1960s, the deeply pacifist Thomas was more of a social democrat than a socialist, and the United States was not then or every close to 'going socialist.'"" Two of Thomas' best-known biographers have died: W.A. Swanberg (author of ""Norman Thomas: The Last Idealist"") in 1992 at the age of 84 and Harry Fleischman (a prominent socialist in his own right and author of ""Norman Thomas: a biography"") in 2004 at the age of 90. Our attempts to track down Thomas biographer Raymond F. Gregory though his publisher were unsuccessful. We also looked for the quote in some of the Thomas writings available online, including, ""How Can the Socialist Party Best Serve Socialism"" (1949), ""What's Behind the 'Christian Front'"" (1939), ""Democracy versus Dictatorship"" (1937) and ""Why I am a Socialist,"" (undated). None included the quote. The same was true of Murray B. Seidler's 1961 biography of Thomas, ""Norman Thomas: Respected Rebel."" Finally, we contacted the New York Public Library, which has a collection of Thomas' writings that fills the equivalent of 193 boxes. Thomas G. Lannon, assistant director for manuscripts, archives and rare books wrote to say that among the transcripts from radio broadcasts and stump speeches from 1944, the quote in the Facebook meme ""cannot be found. In fact, there are many speeches in which Norman Thomas suggests people should vote Socialist up until election day, Nov 7, 1944. Many if not all of his speeches before the November election in 1944 were opposed to the two party system. The idea that Norman Thomas would have said the Democratic Party had adopted the Socialist Party platform runs counter to all the text of speeches that still exist from those Thomas delivered in 1944."" Until someone -- anyone -- can offer evidence that the quote came from Thomas, we rate this post False. Update: This story was updated after publishing to include comment from Thomas Lannon at the New York Public Library. The rating remains unchanged.""",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/blog-posting/no-evidence-norman-thomas-quote-democrats-embracin/

No, Jared Golden does not want to use Social Security funds to pay for other programs
","Just days before voters head to the polls, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a new ad blasting Jared Golden, the Democratic candidate running for the U.S. House seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. The ""Golden Years"" ad targets senior voters by claiming that Golden will ""steal"" their golden years to ""pay for his reckless agenda."" Here's the NRCC ad in full: ""They call them the golden years, when you’re supposed to enjoy the life you worked so hard to build. But politician Jared Golden wants to turn your golden years into his. Golden supports a reckless bill to end Medicare as we know it. And he supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs. Jared Golden would steal your golden years to pay for his reckless agenda. Maine seniors can’t afford that risk."" The ""reckless"" bill the ad refers to is Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ""Medicare for All"" proposal, which Golden has said he supports, following improvements to the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives have continuously said that such a system would end Medicare ""as we know it"" by creating a new program funded by the government and open to everyone, not just those 65 and older. (See this fact-check.) Here, we are going to focus on the accusation that Golden ""supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs."" The claim is based on Golden’s one-time support of a statewide referendum, often referred to as ""Homecare for All,"" that will appear on the ballot in Maine on Nov. 6. The initiative would raise taxes on wealthier Mainers to help pay for a universal home care program. While there is debate over who the tax will affect, it has no direct ties to Social Security, would not cause people to lose their benefits and Golden does not support it in its current form. The citizen-initiated referendum would fund a home care program for elderly and disabled Mainers by implementing a tax on higher incomes in the state. It would also create a government board to administer the funds. The ballot question seeks to fund the system by adding a 3.8 percent surtax on incomes of more than $128,400. The Maine home care program would be paid for by collected on households earning income above $128,400. Funds would be managed by a board made up of industry representatives and home care recipients. The effort intends to solve a long-term problem in Maine’s home health care system, where aides make an average hourly age of $12.41, according to the Maine Labor Department. It is worth noting, too, that Maine holds the top spot as the oldest state in the country, according to a 2017 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which found the median age in Maine was 44.6, essentially unchanged from 2016. It wouldn’t. The closest connection is the threshold in which the Maine home care tax would kick in, on incomes more than $128,400. That’s because the government funds Social Security by taxing incomes up to $128,400. The NRCC cites Golden’s one-time support of the initiative as an attempt to erode seniors’ Social Security to pay for the program. The group pointed to a May 2018 op-ed Golden penned in the Portland Press Herald. ""If you’re like more than 98 percent of people in this state, you already pay a tax on all of the income you earn in order to fund Social Security, and your employer does the same,"" Golden wrote in the op-ed. ""Individuals who are paid more than $128,400 a year, however, currently do not pay any Social Security tax on income greater than that amount. The referendum would ask them to pay a bit more of their fair share on all of their income, like the rest of us already do."" But Golden’s campaign said he wrote that before language changed in the final wording of the bill. Golden actually no longer supports the bill, because it could apply to families earning more than $128,400 a year as opposed to individuals. Golden’s campaign manager Jon Breed told us that while Golden believes there is a growing problem in Maine's home health care system, he ""does not agree that families with incomes over $128,000 should face a 3.8 percent tax increase."" Since the bill’s language was altered, several analyses have concluded the measure would include married couples filing jointly. The NRCC also pointed us to a report on the proposal by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a left-leaning research and policy organization. At one point in the analysis, it says that ""Mainers will be asked whether to partially close the Social Security tax loophole to fund a universal home care program."" The report says the initiative would be the first of its kind in the country, and creates a new tax structure for high income earners that picks up where Social Security taxes leaves off. The tax also applies to non-wage income, which is currently untaxed by payroll-type taxes. What does that all mean for Social Security? Not much, as the threshold is the referendum’s only link to Social Security. The home care program would be funded through a new tax on high earners, not Social Security. The National Republican Campaign Committee said Golden ""supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs."" The group is referring to Golden’s previous support of a state referendum that will appear on the ballot in Maine and would implement a tax on wealthier Mainers to fund a home care program. (Golden’s campaign says he no longer supports it after a recent change.) The program would not result in cuts to Social Security. The NRCC distorted a thin link, as the Maine tax would be levied above the current Social Security cut-off of $128,400. Again, it would not result in a decrease of senior’s Social Security benefits.

Spoof website goes too far when calling California candidate Young Kim a tax cheat
","Imitation isn’t always a form of flattery, and a website created by California Democrat Gil Cisneros’ congressional campaign shows why. The site has a name, YoungKimforCongress.org, that makes it easily mistaken for the website of Cisneros’ opponent, Young Kim. But the Democrat-created website’s content and slogan -- ""Just like Donald Trump"" --  are anything but flattering to Kim, a Republican. The site has a lot to chew on, but standing out to PolitiFact was a section on Kim’s personal taxes. It says Kim is ""a tax cheat"" who ""illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in,"" had ""multiple tax liens placed on her"" as a result and ""owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes."" ""Cheat"" and ""illegally"" are serious words. To understand them fully here, let’s look at the facts, with a little teaser to get started: The property taxes we’re discussing amounted to $387. If you own a home, you pay property taxes on it. But many states give a tax break to people who live in their homes. This is called a homeowner’s or homestead exemption, and in California it is relatively small. By claiming it, a California homeowner can reduce the assessed value of his or her home by a maximum of $7,000 -- which saves the homeowner about $70 a year in actual taxes. Kim and her husband, Charles, owned a home in the Orange County community of La Habra, and had a homeowner’s exemption through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. But Kim had moved to a different home in a different community, Fullerton, in late 2012, and in January 2013 changed her voter registration to reflect this. She moved again to a third home, in Fullerton, in 2014. Kim and her husband still owned the home in La Habra -- renting it out as income property -- and still got the homeowner’s exemption. Under California law, homeowners are only supposed to get the exemption if they live in the home. This meant the Kims continued to get a $74 annual benefit she and her husband weren’t entitled to. After Orange County realized this, it filed two liens against the Kims for ""unsecured property taxes,"" one for $197.96 and the other for $189.39, on Oct. 13, 2015. Such liens typically included a penalty and interest, Orange County Assessor Claude Parrish told us. The county lifted the liens on Sept. 30, 2016, after the Kims paid. The total penalty: $387. These basic facts, most of them noted or available through links in the spoof Kim website, were confirmed independently by PolitiFact through Orange County public records, interviews and a financial disclosure form Kim filed after she was elected to the California State Assembly in 2014. But none of these address an important point: Did Kim dupe the county -- was she a ""tax cheat"" -- so she could save $74 a year? Parrish, the county tax assessor, told us the liens should never have been issued. Parrish said this in 2016 as well, when the matter arose during Kim’s unsuccessful re-election campaign for the State Assembly. Parrish, whose office is nonpartisan but who has served as a Republican in previous offices, issued a statement during that race, saying Kim had notified his predecessor in 2014 ""that she was no longer living at the home in question as of December 2012 and thus was not eligible for the homeowner’s exemption."" ""Unfortunately,"" his statement continued, ""notices from the county in regard to this property were mailed to Ms. Kim at an old address and not forwarded to her, a common problem when people move. Through no fault of her own, a lien was placed on her property for a small amount of taxes due. This happens to innocent taxpayers like Ms. Kim all too often, and is a direct result of the notices not being properly forwarded by the U.S. Postal Service."" In a telephone interview, Parrish told us, ""This could happen to anybody."" Parrish has crusaded on this very issue -- thousands of liens issued for very small amounts, potentially harming the credit of residents -- for several years. He said that 62 percent of his county’s 45,331 liens in 2015 were for $200 or less, many a result of oversight or mistakes. Parrish pushed successfully for a 2017 California bill that authorized counties to stop issuing tax liens if the amount owed is $200 or less. Regardless of the amount, did Kim owe the money? If Kim notified the assessor’s office in 2014 of a move that occurred in late 2012, that suggests at least a year went by before giving the proper notice. The mail issues then complicated matters, as did the fact that, according to Kim’s current campaign, she paid her property taxes through the escrow account on her mortgage. In Kim’s 2016 state Assembly race, her political opponent, Sharon Quirk-Silva, said these were excuses that didn’t exempt Kim from her obligations as a taxpayer. Quirk-Silva’s campaign at the time issued a critical statement from a retired Los Angeles County tax assessor, Kenneth P. Hahn, who said, ""The law is clear. Failure to receive notice from the U.S. Postal Service does not absolve an individual from paying their taxes."" Kim’s current campaign says this is a bit much. The discussion, after all, is over $74 a year, or $387 after penalties and interest. The Cisneros campaign also noted on its faux Kim website that Kim and her husband owe $10,000 to $15,000 to the IRS. This information comes directly from the financial disclosure report Kim filed this year as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Under creditors, she listed $10,000 to $15,000 owed to the IRS, with the description, ""Installment of taxes due for 2009 & 2010."" Patrick Mocete, Kim’s campaign manager, told us the debt is a result of taxes due from her husband’s employment as a self-employed consultant, and he set up an installment payment plan with the IRS. That’s perfectly legal. The Cisneros campaign says Kim is ""a tax cheat"" who ""illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in,"" had ""multiple tax liens placed on her"" as a result and ""owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes."" The IRS debt is more substantial than the property tax, but there is no information to show it has anything to do with cheating. ""Cheat"" implies motivation, and news stories have used the word to describe people who purposely violated homestead exemption laws to save on taxes -- typically saving much more than $74 a year. Nic Jordan, the Cisneros campaign spokesman, told us the campaign used the word colloquially. Whether a mistake or not, Kim had two liens and owed $387 to the county as a result of an improperly recorded homeowner’s exemption. The law is the law, as Kim’s last opponent said. But it was a minor civil matter, and one that the current property assessor says never should have resulted in liens. Cisneros focused on the $7,000 annual reduction in the house’s assessment, not mentioning on the spoof website that it made a difference of $74 a year. This makes it sound far worse than it was. With these elements combined, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/gil-cisneros/spoof-website-goes-too-far-when-calling-california/

Walker scores with 'illegal aliens' tuition and driver's licenses claim against Evers
","In a TV ad launched days before the Nov. 6, 2018, election, Republican Gov. Scott Walker went after his Democratic opponent on immigration. The spot — released Oct. 23 — dings Tony Evers on taxes before saying the longtime state schools superintendent ""wants to give in-state tuition to illegal aliens … and driver’s licenses, too."" The ad includes clips of Evers taken from the Oct. 19, 2018, debate sponsored by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association. They show Evers saying he would support legislation ""that would allow DACA students … to have in-state tuition,"" and that he supports driver’s licenses ""for undocumented folks."" Do those clips justify the ad’s summary that Evers supports tuition and licenses for ""illegal aliens?"" Let’s take a closer look. Defining the terms The truth of this claim hinges on the definition of a few different immigration terms, notably ""illegal alien."" That’s the preferred verbiage by many on the right for undocumented immigrants. Whatever the term, it refers to people who entered or reside in the country in violation of the law -- such as without visas or passports. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas found the term ""illegal alien"" crops up a few times in federal law, mostly in section headings, but it is never officially defined. Similar terms are used -- and defined -- by the federal government, however. For instance, the IRS defines ""undocumented alien"" as one ""who entered the United States illegally without the proper authorization and documents, or who entered the United States legally and has since violated the terms of his or her visa or overstayed the time limit."" Meanwhile, the tuition question focuses specifically on DACA, or Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals, a program that has been in the news since President Donald Trump’s administration took steps to end it a year ago. Federal courts have so far halted that effort. Those protected under DACA are often referred to as ""Dreamers."" The U.S. Department of Homeland Security program launched DACA in 2012 under President Barack Obama to allow certain people who came to the country illegally as children to request a two-year deferral of immigration action. It also allows them to legally work. DACA status, which is granted at the discretion of prosecutors, is open to people who: Were under age 31 as of June 2012 Came to the U.S. prior to their 16th birthday Have lived in the U.S. continually since at least June 2007 Were in the U.S. in June 2012 and had no lawful status then Are currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED or have been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors With that background, let’s look at the two parts of the claim in more detail. Evers on in-state tuition In the debate, Evers was asked whether DACA students should get in-state tuition. Evers’ response: ""I would propose or support legislation that would allow DACA students to be a part of, to have in-state tuition."" Former Gov. Jim Doyle signed a measure in 2009 allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities if they graduated from high school here, but Walker repealed that in 2011. As noted, those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. But DACA students by definition are those who are in this country without proper documentation, even if they were brought here by their parents as young children. DACA allows the person to defer immigration action but ""does not provide lawful status,"" according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And that’s not a position unique to the present administration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under Obama, defined DACA immigrants as part of the group that should be counted as ""unauthorized resident immigrant population."" Evers on driver’s licenses This statement is pretty clear cut. From Evers during the debate: ""Do I think that we should have permits, driver permits for undocumented folks that are working in the state of Wisconsin? The answer is yes. Undocumented folks are working hard at jobs all across the state of Wisconsin, paying taxes, paying Social Security. They should have the opportunity … to have permits."" Evers said an added benefit is that requiring a permit means undocumented residents ""have to learn how to drive safely in Wisconsin."" Evers uses ""undocumented"" instead of the ""illegal aliens"" term the Walker ad invokes, but the terms are substantially similar in common usage. Currently, someone in the country illegally cannot get a driver’s license in Wisconsin, though immigrants who have obtained the DACA designation can, said Davorin Odrcic, a Milwaukee immigration attorney. Our rating Walker claims in a TV ad that Evers supports granting driver’s licenses and in-state tuition for ""illegal aliens."" Walker is clearly on point on the driver’s license issue. As for in-state tuition for DACA students, Evers backs that, too. There is a wrinkle though, in that those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. That said, by definition they are not in the country legally. Their DACA status delays official action against them, but it doesn’t change the lack of legal status. So the statement is accurate, but it requires some clarification and detail on DACA status. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/nov/02/scott-walker/walker-scores-illegal-aliens-claim-against-evers/

Glenn Beck says President Obama is out of step with the nation on Arizona's immigration law
","With the stroke of a pen, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer catapulted herself into the national spotlight. On April 23, 2010, she signed into law what many call the toughest bill on illegal immigration in the country. The bill makes it a crime to stay in the country illegally, requires all aliens to carry immigration paperwork, and sanctions employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. Facing criticism that the law would legalize racial profiling, the Arizona Legislature modified the law on May 1, 2010. It now states that police officers cannot use race as the sole grounds for suspecting that someone is in the country illegally.

The law produced mixed reactions among political leaders. President Barack Obama commented that it threatened ''to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.'' But some people argue that President Obama's reaction is unfounded, given that the majority of Americans actually supports Arizona's immigration law. During his May 27 show, talk host Glenn Beck said that ""Sixty-four percent of Americans support the Arizona immigration law. Yet we're going to -- we're actually -- our government is going down there to fight them. Eric Holder is fighting them in court. They're becoming more and more brazen each and every day."" Beck is referring to an announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder that the U.S. Department of Justice may challenge the law in court.

Given the public outrage over the law, is Beck correct that more than 6 in 10 Americans stand behind Arizona? We decided to find out.

The number that Beck cites comes from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll that was conducted in early May. The poll found that 64 percent of Americans were either somewhat or strongly supportive of the law. There are other polls, however, that show a slightly different result.

• An April 27-28 Gallup poll found that of those Americans who have heard of the law, 51 percent support it. Among all Americans, 39 percent favor it, 30 percent oppose it, and 31 percent either had no opinion or have not heard of the law.

• A Pew Research Center poll conducted between May 6 and May 9 found that 59 percent approve of the law.

• A May 19-24 poll by the Quinnipiac University found 51 percent of American voters support the Arizona law. Moreover, 48 percent say that they want their state to pass an immigration law similar to Arizona's.

All of the polls that we've looked at show that more Americans favor the law than oppose it, but the numbers vary widely.

To recap. Glenn Beck said on his program that 64 percent of Americans support Arizona's new immigration law. That statistic, however, comes from a single poll. Other polls show slightly lower approval ratings. Still, his underlying point that most Americans agree with Arizona is correct. We rate this one Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/03/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-president-obama-out-step-nation-ar/

Miller: State Board of Education 'more than quadrupled' the number of historical figures students must learn about
","The state's social studies curriculum standards fell under the microscope this year as members of the State Board of Education squabbled over what should be taught to Texas students.In a May 18 opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman -- before the board gave final approval to revised standards May 21 -- Kathy Miller of the Texas Freedom Network, which bills itself as a watchdog group that monitors ""far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders,"" wrote: ""Teachers despair that the standards, rather than simply identifying major concepts students should master, are far too long and detailed. For example, a Houston school district analysis found that the board more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about.""That sounds like a lot of names and dates to remember. We decided to look it up.In response to our inquiry, Dan Quinn, the network's communications director, pointed us to an entry on School Zone, the Houston Chronicle's education blog, reporting that the Houston school district's social studies curriculum managers had expressed concerns about some proposed changes to the standards during an April 29 district school board meeting.According to the post, the managers, Angela Miller and Michael Dorsey, said the proposed standards contained ""262 historical figures that students must learn about from elementary through high school,"" compared with the current count of ""60 people."" That's more than four times as many as now.But there's a hitch. The numbers in the Houston school district analysis differ from those reported in the Houston Chronicle blog. The actual counts are 64 required historical figures under the current standards and 252 under the proposed ones -- four names short of a quadrupling.At the time of the Houston analysis, the proposed standards included changes the state education board had already made to recommendations from board-appointed ""writing groups"" made up largely of teachers. (The new standards are set to be implemented in 2011-12, and classroom materials and tests based on the standards are scheduled to take effect in 2012-13.) In a document prepared for the Houston school board, Angela Miller and Dorsey said they were concerned about the growth in the ""number of people who are now required topics of instruction"" primarily because ""teachers have fewer opportunities to tailor their instruction to address the needs and interests of their students and communities. And, two, the effort to create a 'balanced' list of required individuals inevitably results in very long lists of names as each constituency advocates the inclusion of individuals representative of their interests.""In her Statesman article, Kathy Miller followed up: ""Historians have warned that such a 'laundry list' approach ... is a lazy and ineffective way to teach and sets up our schools -- and our children -- to fail as they struggle through a blizzard of names and facts."" A little background: There are two ways to figure out how many historical figures the curriculum standards require that students be taught. You can read the standards and count the individuals who are named. Or, you can consult the lists of names that the Texas Education Agency has created for both the current and proposed requirements. Some names appear more than once on the lists -- and are counted each time -- because they are studied in more than one grade. At the time the Houston analysis was done, the proposed standards specified more than 40 names more than once. For example, economist Adam Smith was to be taught in both high school economics and world history classes.Houston officials used the first method, making their own grade-by-grade comparison -- between the current standards and the proposed ones -- of the number of historical figures that must be taught in kindergarten through eighth grade, as well as for mandatory high school social studies classes: world geography, world history, U.S. history, government and economics.To tally historical figures that students must be taught now, Angela Miller said, she and a colleague combed the current standards, adopted in 1997. For the proposed standards, Miller said, she relied on the list of names produced by the education agency; it reflected all the changes made to the proposals by the state board through March 2010. For comparison, we consulted the education agency's lists of required historical figures in the current and proposed standards. (To ensure a valid comparison, we removed any names that were part of the curriculum standards for psychology and sociology courses; those classes are electives and were not included in the Houston school district's analysis.) Our counts differed slightly from the Houston district's: 71 now vs. 250 in the proposed standards, 34 names short of a quadrupling.Angela Miller told us that she and her colleague could have erred as they perused the current standards. We also found that a difference in interpreting some objectives in the standards may explain variations in the counts.For example, the TEA list of required historical figures in the high school world history curriculum contains three names: Hammurabi, Emperor Justinian I and John Locke. All three come from this objective in the current standards: ""The student is expected to identify the impact of political and legal ideas contained in significant historic documents, including Hammurabi's Code, Justinian's Code of Laws, Magna Carta, John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, and the Declaration of Independence.""Angela Miller said the three names were not included in the Houston school district's analysis because knowledge of the document, not the individual, is what is required of the students.Bluntly, counting the figures required to be taught in social studies classes is not a perfect science.And there's a postscript: The proposed curriculum standards changed again when the State Board of Education met in May -- after Kathy Miller's opinion piece ran in the Statesman.Monica Martinez, TEA's managing director of the curriculum division, said that short of watching the videos of the two days of 15-hour meetings during which the state board worked on those changes, we would have to wait for the agency to release updated documents to determine the final number of historical figures that must be taught. She said the agency hoped to have those ready later this month. Based on changes made during the first day alone, indications are the total will drop from what it was when Miller made her statement.Summing up: Kathy Miller leaned on a news report quoting research by the Houston school district. Unfortunately, the blog had the wrong numbers, overstating the number of historical figures required to be taught under the proposed standards being considered at the time. That led Miller to overstate the facts in claiming that the State Board of Education ""more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about.""Had she relied on the original research, which was linked directly to the Chronicle blog, Miller wouldn't have goofed making her point. The changes made by the state board up to that point meant students were going to have to study a lot more historical figures than they do now -- but it's less than four times as many.We rate Miller's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/03/kathy-miller/miller-state-board-education-more-quadrupled-numbe/
"['Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Scott Maddox']","
Maddox says Putnam ""doubled-down"" on oil
","Scott Maddox, Democratic candidate for Florida commissioner of agriculture, is trying to portray his Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, as supporting oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico -- despite the recent oil spill.In an e-mail to his supporters, Maddox said:""While the oil slick has not yet made it to Florida’s shores, it gets closer and closer with every day that goes by. It’s nothing short of a ticking time bomb for our incredible beaches and tourism economy.""The Florida legislative leaders who pushed for oil drilling in state waters – as close as three miles from our beaches – have even backed off. But not Putnam. He doubled down saying all energy sources, including oil drilling in the Gulf, should be considered just days after the oil spill started."" Maddox's campaign said the email was dated May 25, 2010, but the copy we received was May 27, 2010. Maddox, a former Tallahassee mayor, has been using the oil spill -- and his challenge to Putnam to permanently rule out increased drilling -- to draw attention to the race. Maddox's Tallahassee law firm is suing BP and Transocean, which managed the rig, on behalf of fisherman and seafood restaurants. Maddox spokesman Steve Vancore pointed to Putnam's efforts to broker a deal on oil drilling in 2006 as evidence that he's been supportive in the past. At that time, he proposed allowing drilling ""as close as 50 miles from shore"" and got 13 other Florida Republicans to sign along, leading to passage in the House, the St. Petersburg Times reported April 2, 2010. Putnam's campaign manager Trey McCarley didn't dispute that position but noted that the bill gave important power to the states. They could petition the federal government to allow drilling between 50 and 100 miles from the shore. But if not, a 125-mile ban would be in effect.To back up the new claim from Maddox, Vancore pointed us to an article in the Panama City News-Herald posted on April 24, 2010 -- four days after the rig collapsed -- to show Putnam's support for oil drilling. The article, about Putnam's visit to a paper mill and talk at a GOP dinner, said: ""Putnam said he disagreed with Maddox’s anti-drilling mantra of 'No, baby, no' and that he thought all energy sources should be considered.'The government should avoid picking winners and losers in exploring new energy,' he said. 'I have been generally supportive of opening up those areas, and specifically supportive of opening up those areas that are well off shore.'""Vancore told us in an email that's a ""double down"" because ""Putnam not only restates his support of drilling but ups the ante by specifically restating his support of drilling in areas that are 'well off shore'. ... He matched his bet when he said he is generally supportive"" of near shore drilling and doubled-down when he said 'specifically supportive' of all others. But in exploring Maddox's claim about Putnam, we find some sleight-of-hand in his timing. There is no dispute that Putnam had supported increased oil drilling in the past and continued to support it a few days days after the initial explosion. But the quotation that Maddox cites that shows Putnam's comment came four days after the accident, before the magnitude of the oil spill was truly known. A look back at the news coverage of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and an AP timeline shows that it took nearly a week after the April 20 rig collapse for it to be clear that a major spill had occurred.On April 23, one of the dominant stories was that the search had ended for the 11 missing workers. At that point, an oil sheen had been reported but no leak detected. In fact, the headline from one AP story on that day was: ""Coast Guard: No oil leak from sunken rig off Louisiana."" But officials feared ""as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil a day could be rising from the sea floor nearly 5,000 feet below.""On April 24 -- the day that Putnam made his statement -- oil was found leaking from the well for the first time but the amount was unknown. Then, in an April 25 AP article, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said ""This is a very serious spill, absolutely."" By April 28, Coast Guard increased the estimates of the leak from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels of oil a day.By May 2, the large magnitude of the spill was clear. A Miami Herald article May 2 stated that Florida emergency managers ""acknowledged Saturday that the state can't protect every stretch of coastline threatened by an uncontrolled undersea gusher spewing a massive oil slick that has spread across the Gulf of Mexico faster than expected."" Gov. Charlie Crist warned that Florida could face a catasprophe.On May 3, Maddox held a press conference to attempt to ""shame"" Putnam into preventing expansion of drilling, according to a May 3, 2010 blurb in The Buzz, a blog of the St. Petersburg Times.""I think it's astounding that four days after the explosion Adam Putnam was reaffirming his position in favor of off-shore and near-shore oil drilling,"" Maddox said. ""The most important thing is that we don't face this type of risk very close to our shores."" Putnam's campaign replied the same day, according to the May 3 blog: ""I am deeply concerned about the economic and ecological damage the oil spill is causing. Everyone from the president on down has correctly said we should have a thorough investigation of its causes and the lack of preparedness of the industry to respond to a disaster before proceeding with any new exploration.""By then, Florida politicians were making an about-face on oil drilling -- including Putnam. In a May 3, 2010, statement on his web site he said: ""I am deeply concerned about the economic and ecological damage the oil leak is causing. This is a national disaster. It is clear to every elected official, from the President on down that consideration of any new exploration closer to shore needs to be taken off the table and we need to have a thorough investigation into what happened and the inability of the industry to effectively respond.""To recap: It's clear that Putnam had long supported an expansion of oil drilling before the spill. And he held the same position on April 24 when he was quoted by the Panama City newspaper. But the magnitude of the spill wasn't clear until a day or two later. Maddox is right about Putnam's comments, but he's playing fast and loose with the timing and his statement is misleading. We find it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/02/scott-maddox/maddox-says-putnam-double-downed-oil/

Critz touts Democratic role in low taxes, job creation
","On May 27, 2010 -- less than 10 days after winning a House seat in a special election -- Rep. Mark Critz, D-Pa., took to the House floor to tout what his fellow Democrats have been doing to improve the nation's dismal economy. ""The Democratic Congress has already taken significant steps to create jobs and jump-start the economy, resulting in the lowest tax rates in over 50 years and the creation of over 500,000 new jobs so far this year,"" Critz said. We'll analyze his points one by one. • Are tax rates the lowest in over 50 years? It depends on the definition of the phrase ""tax rate"" -- whether you literally mean the rate, or whether you look at how the tax burden falls on the average American. If you only look at the rate for the federal income tax, the lowest bracket -- currently applying to families earning up to $16,750 -- has been 10 percent since 2002. That's the lowest it has been in the past 50 years, with the exception of the period 1977 to 1986, when it was zero (but when there was no standard deduction, as there is today). If you look at the top tax bracket, the rates today are also low, though -- as is the case with the lowest bracket -- not the lowest in 50 years. Since 2003, the top rate, which is currently levied on families earning above $373,650, has been 35 percent. The only period when it was lower was between 1988 and 1992, when the top rate ranged from 31 to 33 percent. (And it's been far higher: As late as 1963, the top rate was 91 percent.) Of course, Americans also pay state and local taxes. The rates vary widely by state, but the most recent available national average, for 2008, is 9.7 percent. That's well within the historical range: Since 1977, the national average has remained within a narrow band of 9.3 percent to 10.3 percent. So tax rates today are fairly low, but not at absolute record lows for the past 50 years. What about tax burden? Although he didn't use that word, when people talk about rates, they often mean the overall burden. The most complete accounting we've seen is a table of tax data assembled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that measures the average federal income tax rate -- that is, federal income taxes paid divided by income -- for four-person families at three representative levels of income. The data covers the years 1955 to 2009: At half the median national income and at the median income, the rates for 2008 and 2009 are the lowest on record, and at twice the median income, it is lower than every year since 1967 except for one (2003). In fact, a family at half the median income (which calculates to roughly $38,000) actually got 8.33 percent of their income back from the government in 2008 and 8.28 percent back in 2009. (That's due to refundable credits, mainly the Earned Income Tax Credit.) The rate for median families ($76,000 last year) paid just 3.54 percent of their income in taxes in 2008 and 4.63 percent in 2009, while families at twice the median income (nearly $152,000) paid 12.35 percent of their income in taxes in 2008 and 12.58 percent in 2009.  Other measures confirm the general trendline. The Tax Foundation, an independent tax-research group in Washington, has found that the average taxpayer's combined tax burden accounted for 26.6 percent of income in 2009 and 26.9 percent in 2010, the lowest since 1965. And according to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, total federal tax receipts were 14.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, the lowest percentage since 1950. So Critz is on safe ground when he says that the rate of taxes paid to income earned is at low levels compared to the past 50 years. He probably should have used the phrase ""tax burden"" rather than ""tax rate,"" but the terminology he used isn't incorrect. So for this portion of his statement, we rate him Mostly True. • Have 500,000 new jobs been created so far this year? Politicians love to talk about ""jobs created,"" but in reality, there's no statistic that specifically calculates the numbers of jobs created. Instead, this number usually refers to the net increase in jobs from one time period to another. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the net monthly increases were 14,000 jobs for January, 39,000 for February, 230,000 for March, and 290,000 for April. If you add these up, they total 573,000 jobs, making Critz's statement correct. We'll note that the March and April figures are preliminary. But given what we know now, we rate this part of Critz's statement True. • Does the Democratic Congress deserve credit for the low tax rates and the jobs created? Let's take jobs first. To the extent that any political entity deserves credit for the job growth, the Democratic Congress would qualify. Along with President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, they have exercised unified control of the government since January 2009. But it's a huge stretch to say all the job gains are the work of the Democratic-run government. There is considerable debate among economists about how much the Democratic stimulus bill truly helped the economy. And given the many factors that help shape the national and international economy, many observers have argued that the president and Congress usually get too much credit during good times and too much blame during bad times. On taxes, it's also complicated. The Democrats can rightly take credit for the inclusion of tax cuts in Obama's economic stimulus bill since only three Congressional Republicans voted for it. The administration says that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $288 billion in tax relief, of which roughly $163 billion has been paid out so far. And stimulus money helped many states stave off tax increases that they might otherwise have been forced to impose had there been no stimulus. But economists we interviewed emphasized that two other major factors have also played a role in keeping taxes low -- and Congressional Democrats can hardly claim credit for these. The first is the Republican-driven tax-cutting measures passed in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were largely opposed by Democrats, but established today's relatively low federal income tax rates. The second factor is the recession. By nature, all recessions depress taxation rates, as individuals and families shift to lower tax brackets and, as a result, pay out less of their income in taxes. The Bush tax cuts and the recession are ""hardly facets of the issue that a newly minted Democrat should be touting,"" said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Overall, then, Critz was mostly right on the stats -- that taxes are relatively low right now, and that 500,000 jobs have been created this year. But it's a stretch for him to suggest that the Democrats deserve any more than partial credit for the shape of today's tax landscape. So we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/02/mark-critz/critz-touts-democratic-role-low-taxes-job-creation/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Cathie Adams']","
GOP chair says the health care law provides free Viagra for convicted rapists and sex offenders
","In a recent fund-raising letter, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party of Texas, associates Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, with abortion, higher taxes and federal legislation to cap emissions of greenhouse gases. Adams also charges White with undue silence on the recently adopted federal health care overhaul, listing among criticisms an eyebrow-raising benefit for certain men. It ""was recently revealed that ObamaCare will use your tax dollars to provide free Viagra to convicted rapists and registered sex offenders,"" Adams writes. How, um, uplifting. Is government really fronting free erectile-dysfunction drugs to rapists and sex offenders? The GOP didn't respond to our inquiries, but we found an April 2 memo on the topic prepared by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), which analyzes issues for members of Congress. At the request of Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican opposed to the Democratic-steered health care plan, the CRS examined whether the legislation that Obama signed into law in March ""would prohibit a health insurance plan that participates in an American Health Benefit Exchange created (by the act) from covering drugs prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction if the plan beneficiary is a convicted rapist, child molester or other sex offender."" Some background: By 2014, under the law, states must create exchanges where individuals can buy insurance from a choice of four plans that must meet minimum standards, though premiums, out-of-pocket costs and benefits may differ. To limit costs for indigent residents, premiums and costs such as deductibles and co-payments will be subsidized for people with incomes between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2009 ranged from $29,327 to $88,200 for a family of four. For example, people with incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level will only be responsible for one-third of their out-of-pocket costs; the federal government will pay for the rest. Any legal resident who doesn't have access to affordable health insurance through their employer (and isn't incarcerated) would qualify for the exchanges. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, about 704,700 sex offenders are registered in the United States (including the District of Columbia and U.S. territories). About 59,000 live in Texas. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does number-crunching for Congress, estimated in March that by 2019, approximately 24 million people would purchase their own coverage through the insurance exchanges. Of those, about 19 million are expected to be subsidized. So while not everyone who participates in the exchanges will qualify for federal subsidies, the vast majority will. The CBO also estimates that the average subsidy will amount to $6,000 per person, costing $350 billion by 2019. CRS said that an insurance plan through the health exchange must include basic coverage, including prescription drugs, and the law does ""not appear to prohibit... coverage for drugs prescribed to treat ED for a non-incarcerated beneficiary who was previously convicted of rape, child molestation or another sex offense.” Nor, the memo states, would those individuals ""appear to be excluded from enrolling in a qualified health plan offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange in their state solely because of that conviction."" Coburn tried to create such an exclusion in March, when he introduced an amendment to the health care bill. Coburn said then that ""the vast majority of Americans don't want their taxpayer dollars paying for this kind of drug for those kinds of people."" The amendment also prohibited coverage of drugs that induce an abortion. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., encouraged his colleagues to reject the amendment, which failed 57-42. ""This is a serious bill,"" Baucus said. ""This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy."" Democrats argued that any amendments would attract negative votes, effectively killing the bill, since the margin for passage was so thin. Coburn made the CRS memo public in April. ""Providing child molesters with taxpayer-funded Viagra shows the folly of government-run health care. Senators who allowed this to happen will be haunted by this vote for years to come,"" said Coburn spokesman John Hart, according to Roll Call, a Capitol Hill publication. Jim Manley, spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said: ""This is just another attempt at hype by Sen. Coburn as he goes about trying to make a mockery of the legislative process."" This isn't the first time sex offenders using government aid to obtain Viagra has drawn attention. A May 2005 audit by New York comptroller Alan Hevesi showed that between January 2000 and March 2005, 198 sex offenders in New York had received Medicaid-reimbursed Viagra after their convictions, according to an article by the Associated Press. The comptroller's office discovered the state was helping sex offenders pay for Viagra by comparing Medicaid pharmacy expenditures against the state's sex offender registry. A survey by the Associated Press found that 14 states, including Texas, had provided Medicaid-funded Viagra to nearly 800 sex offenders. In a letter to Health and Human Services, Hevesi urged the department to ""take immediate action to ensure that sex offenders do not receive erectile dysfunction medication paid for by taxpayers."" The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promptly sent a letter to state Medicaid directors directing them to ""prevent inappropriate Medicaid payment for such drugs in the case of a sex offender."" ""Under the Medicaid statute, states are obligated to prevent fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically unnecessary care, among physicians, pharmacists and patients,"" the letter says. ""A state can find that the use of certain drugs and the treatment of impotence for such individuals could constitute fraud, abuse or inappropriate use. We believe that, in accordance with such provisions, the use of these drugs in the case of a sex offender is not appropriate and Medicaid should not pay for the cost of such drugs in such circumstances."" Also that month, in Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott examined records dating to 1999 and found that nearly 200 registered sex offenders had obtained Viagra and other sex-enhancing drugs using Medicaid benefits. The Legislature soon approved an amendment, which passed into law, instructing the Health and Human Services Commission to deny erectile dysfunction drug coverage to sex offenders through Medicaid. Whither Adams' charge? She frames the prospect of free Viagra for sex offenders too simply. Yes, the CRS memo says plans offered through the exchanges aren't barred by the new law from offering just such a benefit. But the plans won't be finalized until 2014. Besides, anyone who joins such a plan will have to qualify for subsidies based on income. Also, no drugs will be free.

Obama blames 30-day legal limit for role in oil spill
","As anger grows over the massive, uncontained oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the procedure for issuing federal drilling permits for the Gulf Coast has begun to attract intense scrutiny. During a May 27, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama -- under pressure for the failure to stem the underwater leak -- laid a large portion of the blame on the existing law that governs the permitting process, as well as the regulations to implement that law, which were drawn up by the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office that oversees oil and gas leases.""What's also been made clear from this disaster is that, for years, the oil and gas industry has leveraged such power that they have effectively been allowed to regulate themselves,"" Obama said. ""One example, under current law, the Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived. And this is just one example of a law that was tailored by the industry to serve their needs instead of the public's. So Congress needs to address these issues as soon as possible, and my administration will work with them to do so.""We wondered whether the president is correct that the law mandates such a short period for an environmental review.The law in question is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The law was originally passed in 1953, though the amendments relevant to the Obama's statement were added in 1978.Under the law, a proposal to drill must pass through several stages before it can be approved. First, the Interior Department must choose the locations it will open to leasing. Then, the department puts those areas up for lease. Once a lease is purchased by an energy company, the leaseholder must submit an ""exploration plan"" to the Interior Secretary before exercising its right to drill. Interior Department regulations specify that the regional supervisor of MMS has 15 working days after receiving a proposed plan to rule a submission packet complete. At that point, a 30-day clock starts ticking. If the secretary finds problems during this period, modifications can be ordered or, if modifications are insufficient to solve the problem, the lease can be canceled. But if the secretary finds the plan acceptable, it must be approved within that same 30-day window.So Obama is correct about the law's 30-day limit. He's also correct that complete waivers of environmental impact reviews are common. The Interior Department says that in recent years, MMS has granted 250 to 400 waivers annually for Gulf of Mexico projects alone. (The department was unable to provide PolitiFact with the number of cases in which a waiver was not granted.) The Deepwater Horizon project had been given a ""categorical exclusion"" from detailed environmental review more than a year before the disaster occurred -- a decision that is supposed to be granted to projects that are expected to have minimal environmental impact.Meanwhile, on Obama's assertion that 30 days is too short a window to conduct a credible environmental review -- much less a plan to respond to a major malfunction -- many experts we spoke to agreed with the president. In general, then, Obama's statement is on target. But we think it's worth noting that the 30-day limit is not the only factor that explains the failure of MMS to study the environmental impact of Gulf of Mexico projects.The exploration plan Obama referenced is not the only environmental study that is supposed to be conducted during this process. Studies are also required when the lease locations are chosen and when the leases are sold, and they don't have statutory time limits.Critics say that, in their current form, these earlier-stage studies do not include enough detail on the specific drilling locations to qualify as a full-scale environmental assessment. But if MMS -- or Congress, or the industry -- had wanted to beef up these earlier studies as a way of getting around the 30-day limit, they could have done so. But they never did. In their absence, the courts have sometimes stepped in: In 2009, a federal appeals court threw out the initial five-year leasing plan for drilling in Alaska's Chukchi Sea, citing shortcomings in the plan's environmental assessment.Holly Doremus, a law professor at the University of California-Berkeley who has studied the MMS permitting process, called it ""a bit disingenuous"" for Obama to focus solely on the 30-day limit.""The categorical exclusion has never been formally justified by the short time line, and so far as I know MMS has never -- until after this blow-out -- asked Congress for more time to review exploration plans,"" she said in an interview. ""I think rather that MMS has thought, and acted, as if it didn't need to do detailed environmental review at the exploration plan stage"" because it does them at the two earlier stages. ""If that review were more thorough, and considered true worst-case scenarios, it might well be the case that 30 days would be enough to look at the environmental impacts of exploration in a particular location,"" she said.Meanwhile, some say that Congress ought to shoulder a portion of the blame for letting an inadequate permitting process fester for more than 30 years.""If that is too short for a review, then Congress should change it,"" Gary Wolfram, an economics and public policy professor at Hillsdale College. ""My suspicion is that, as with all central planners, Congress doesn’t know the proper amount of time it takes to review a project.'' Belatedly, Congress -- prodded, also belatedly, by the Obama administration -- is looking to change the rules. On May 11, 2010, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar released a legislative package that includes a proposal to eliminate the 30-day deadline. ""Changing this 30-day mandatory deadline to a 90-day timeline that can be further extended to complete environmental and safety reviews, as needed, would provide MMS more time to conduct additional environmental analysis on an exploration plan,"" the department said in its announcement.Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sought to attach the change to a supplemental spending bill before the congressional Memorial Day recess, but the effort was unsuccessful. Supporters vow to push on. ""I am not aware of any pending free-standing legislation on this, but I do know that Congress will revisit the topic when it gets back,"" said Bill Wicker, a spokesman for Bingaman.Ultimately, Obama was correct on everything he said about the law -- the 30-day limit, the difficulties of conducting a full study in that time frame, and the frequent waivers. But we're marking him down slightly for implying that the 30-day limit tied the administration's hands. If the administration had wanted to change MMS procedures short of rewriting the law, it could have done so by proposing more stringent requirements for the other environmental assessments undertaken during the permitting process, which are not time-limited under the law. And it could have pushed earlier to rewrite the law. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/01/barack-obama/obama-blames-30-day-limit-law-role-oil-spill/

California Senate ad accuses Meg Whitman of selling porn on eBay
","Things have gotten downright dirty in the Republican primary for governor of California.In a web-only video ad, Steve Poizner essentially accused his opponent Meg Whitman of peddling smut.Here's how the woman doing the voice-over put it:""When Meg Whitman joined eBay, the company sold everything, from guns to 'genuine' paintings by famous artists for five bucks to hardcore pornography. Whitman cleaned up the site. No more guns. No more fake paintings. But pornography? Whitman started a separate division that only sells porn. Under Whitman's leadership, the porn site became one of the largest on the Internet.""And in an especially creepy moment toward the end, the video shows a slouching teenage boy on a laptop computer. Enough said.The ad says Whitman is ""all about the money"" and accuses her of ""bad judgment"" and ""wrong values.""Web-only video ads are often among the edgiest attack weapons in modern campaigns. And this one is no different.It's true that eBay has an ""adult only"" section in which people sell pornographic magazines, videos, adult toys etc. But Whitman didn't introduce the idea to start selling adult material on eBay. People were already auctioning adult products on eBay when she came on board as the company's president and CEO in 1998. Rather, not long after taking over, Whitman created the ""adult only"" section essentially to wall it off from children.By way of research, we went onto eBay to check it out the adult section (we swear, this was new to us). The ""adult only"" section isn't listed among the favorite categories on the home page. Nor is it in the immediate drop down menu for categories. We found it by clicking on the ""everything else"" category at the bottom. In order to get in, you've got to sign in, attest to being an adult and provide credit card information. That doesn't sound completely child-proof, but there has been some effort to make it more difficult for kids to get there. And it's not prominently displayed or promoted on the home page.Nonetheless, the section has been successful.In a story under the headline ""Republican Meg Whitman's secret past as a porn-peddling CEO at eBay,"" SF Weekly said porn has been an eBay profit center -- ""albeit a relatively tiny, multimillion-dollar one in a company with annual revenues of more than $8 billion."" And, the story said, it appears to be a growing part of eBay's revenue stream.The SF Weekly story quoted Scott Newman, former eBay vice president of customer support, saying the Adult Only section posed a quandary for Whitman.""There was a lot of concern whether we should continue having a mature audiences site or not,"" he said. Whitman ""had often gone on the record saying, 'I wish we hadn't started that thing.' But it was kind of like, now it's out of the bag, and to stop it would have caused kind of a big deal, I guess, with the sellers who made their living on the 'mature' site.""Whitman apparently pushed for a policy to prohibit the use of PayPal to purchase material from the Adult Only section, but ultimately deferred to company directors who advised against such a ban. On March 27, 2009, Business Week published a Q & A between Whitman and Rajiv Dutta, who had previously served as president of eBay Marketplaces, PayPal and Skype.Dutta: ""Now, there was one call that you and I disagreed on. And the issue was: Should we enable Paypal for legal adult and gaming sites?"" Whitman: ""I said no.""Dutta: ""Right, that this was out of character for the company to do. And my comeback was that PayPal is a currency, and we cannot use it in some places and not in others. And so, we had this spirited debate, and you let me do what I wanted to do, which was enable PayPal."" Whitman: ""Yes."" Dutta: ""Why?"" Whitman: ""Well, that's a very good question. Why did I do that? No, I'm teasing. Companies are led by collections of individuals. I mean, yes, I was president and CEO of eBay, but you are only as good as the people you surround yourself with. Whether it's a nonprofit institution or a university, you're only as good as the people you surround yourself with. And I think if you want to get the very best people, you need to give them degrees of freedom, you need to give them latitude within a set of defined points of view, rules, if you will. And you need to let them figure it out. And PayPal was a separate division in eBay, which of course is a separate division from Skype. And this was a gray area.""Frederick S. Lane, author of the book Obscene Profits, a study of the business of pornography on the Internet, said he found the suggestion that Whitman was a porn peddler is ridiculous.""What Whitman did was carve out a separate section on eBay for adult content,"" Lane said. ""It was done to limit children's access. They perceived like everyone else that the real issue was not exposing children to this material, and the way to do that was to get people to register and indicate that they were adults."" Requiring credit card verification is one of the most reliable ways to ensure sites are being used by adults, he said. ""I'm uncomfortable characterizing her as the operator of an adult business,"" Lane said. ""I think that's ridiculous."" eEbay is essentially a huge flea market, he said, where independent contractors sell things.""It's not like they are producing or directing the production of content,"" Lane said of eBay. ""They don't produce or distribute anything.""Still, he said, ""it's legitimate to say she profited from these sales. But to suggest that she was running an adult business, that's not an accurate characterization.""For it's part, the Whitman campaign has dismissed Poizner's ad as ""desperate.""""Is Steve Poizner seriously trying to tell us that eBay is a pornography site?"" said Dan Comstock, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. ""eBay's millions of users, including my grandmother, will find that a little hard to believe.""So is Whitman just another version of (Hustler magazine publisher and onetime California gubernatorial candidate) Larry Flynt, as Poizneer's press secretary suggested recently? We think that's a big stretch.",/factchecks/2010/jun/01/steve-poizner/california-ad-meg-whitman-selling-porn-ebay/

Jindal slams Feds over skepticism about Louisiana plan to build sand barriers against the oil spill
","Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal lamented the federal response to the state's plans to erect sand barriers to keep oil out of marshlands in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.Jindal talked about a meeting he had had with President Obama where Jindal explained what the state wanted from the feds.""The area we spent the most time was on our plan, the state's plan, to build sand booms to keep this oil out of our wetlands. Now, we have said for weeks now we'd much rather fight this oil on a sandy barrier island than fighting inside our wetlands. We've got miles and miles of these islands that have been eroded by Katrina, by storms, and over time. We proposed a plan, 24 segments, to rebuild, to refortify these islands. After weeks -- and if they'd approved this when we first asked, we could have built 10 miles, 10 miles of sand barriers.""Host Jake Tapper interjected here: ""The president says that more is not always better, and the Army Corps of Engineers took the request seriously, evaluated it, decided it was okay for certain areas, but they didn't necessarily think immediately the plan that was suggested was the right plan. Is that not a fair response?""""Yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers approved 6 segments out of 24, over 40 miles out of 100,"" Jindal replied. ""But here's where our concern was: The federal government only ordered BP to pay for to do one of those six segments. That's 2 miles out of 100. Our message to the president today was: Make BP pay for this. The federal government shouldn't be making excuses for BP. This is their spill, their oil. They're the responsible party. Make them responsible.""We wanted to check Jindal's claim that the federal government only ordered BP to pay ""to do one of those six segments."" The Obama administration has said over and over that the oil company BP will pay for the clean up, and we wondered how to reconcile that with Jindal's statements.It turns out that Jindal is right about BP paying for one of six segments of sand barriers, but there's more to the story. As Tapper's comment suggested, the feds aren't so keen on the idea of building sand berms. Federal agencies are chiefly concerned that they can't be constructed quickly enough to intercept the oil, and that they will divert money and attention from other efforts.Nevertheless, on Thursday, May 27, 2010, U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said the government would give permission for the construction of six barriers and authorize BP to pay for one, as a test to see if the barrier plan is feasible. That one barrier would cost $16 million and be paid for by BP or the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.""Louisiana's original proposal called for the dredging of more than 92 million cubic yards of material over a six to nine month period to build temporary barrier islands,"" said a statement issued by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command. The group approved a more limited project because ""implementation of the proposal in all areas approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, in the midst of an active spill, would not be prudent or provide effective protection—especially considering the complications of a major construction project occurring in the midst of a response encompassing more than 20,000 personnel and 1,300 vessels.""The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers listed 33 separate conditions that had to be met, including protections for navigation channels and wildlife.Allen said the approval was meant as a test case. ""There are a lot of doubts whether this is a valid oil spill response technique, given the length of construction and so forth,"" he said. ""But we're not averse to attempting this as a prototype."" Some environmentalists also criticized initial proposals for dredging sand for the barriers too close to shore, according to a report in the Times-Picayune newspaper. After changes were made to address those concerns, the cost estimates for the barriers rose from $250 million to $350 million.The state government could move to build the barriers with state money, but Jindal has rejected that idea without a guarantee of reimbursement.So Jindal is right that the federal government has authorized payment for only one of six barriers. But he leaves out the fact that the government has doubts about the plan and whether it will work or not, and the first barrier is meant as a test case.

"['Afghanistan', 'National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Colin Powell']","
Obama has increased troops in Afghanistan
","Appearing on ABC News' This Week, retired Gen. Colin Powell answered questions about whether the U.S. had enough troops in Afghanistan.Host Jake Tapper reminded Powell of the military thinking that many call ""the Powell doctrine,"" the idea that military operations should have large enough troop deployments to achieve their objectives. Tapper described it first as ""overwhelming"" force, but Powell said it is better described as ""decisive"" force. Is the Obama administration ""adhering to the Powell doctrine?"" Tapper asked.Powell didn't give a yes or no answer, instead explaining, ""The president has added close to 68,000 troops in the last year, since he came into office, not just the 30,000 you hear, but the others that were added before that. So 68,000 troops were added to it. That is a significant number. And, remember, they're not going after a fixed enemy. They're trying to control ground. They're trying to give some comfort to people that their life is going to get better.""Powell said the rest will be up to the government and people of Afghanistan. ""The challenge here -- and the president will have to face this late next year, as he said he would -- is, okay, we have had this additional input of 68,000 soldiers, bringing it to over 100,000 soldiers. We have done what we said we were going to do. Have the Afghans done what they must do, build an army that is capable, an army that is connected to the central government, an army that the people believe in? And do we have a police force that is not corrupt? And do we have a government in Kabul that is really reaching out and connecting the people together into some kind of political system that people believe in?""We wanted to fact-check Powell's statement that Obama has added 68,000 troops, ""not just the 30,000 you hear.""After weeks of deliberations, Obama in late 2009 decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. He announced his decision in a major address at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., on Dec. 1, 2009.But Obama had sent more troops to Afghanistan long before that, to fulfill a campaign promise. On Feb. 17, 2009, Obama issued an order to send two additional brigades -- each with about 2,500 troops -- to Afghanistan. With those troops plus other additions, the total deployment steadily increased from the roughly 34,000 that were in Afghanistan when Obama took office.Last week, the Pentagon announced there were 94,000 troops in Afghanistan. The number was a milestone because it was the first time troops there had exceeded the number of troops in Iraq, which now has 92,000. (At the height of the Iraq war, there were between 130,000 and 172,000 troops there.) About 4,000 more troops are expected to deploy to Afghanistan by the summer, bringing the total to 98,000.So 98,000 minus the 34,000 that were there when Obama took office gives us 64,000 troops, a little shy of the 68,000 Powell mentioned. But he might be counting additional NATO troops from countries that include Britain, France, Germany and Italy. NATO countries pledged an additional 5,000 troops last year, but the numbers have fluctuated as actual deployments have occurred.One thing we've learned about fact-checking troop numbers: Troops rotate in and out of countries on a regular schedule, which means troop levels are approximate numbers and change as time goes by.Still, we find Powell's numbers very close to the mark. Obama took office with about 34,000 troops. There are now 94,000 troops and closing in on 98,000 troops by summer. When you count small additions by NATO, that gets us close to 68,000.

Smith says Mexico hands out brochures showing migrants how to avoid Border Patrol, enter U.S.
","U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith told Fox News on May 20 that the United States needs Mexico's help in stopping their citizens from entering the United States illegally but that ""we get just the opposite.""""They hand out brochures showing individuals how they can avoid our Border Patrol, how they can get into our country,"" Smith said May 20, referring to the Mexican government. His statement came to our attention from Lainey Melnick of Austin, the Democratic nominee challenging Smith in November.Smith backed off his statement slightly when the Fox News interviewer, Bill Hemmer, asked: ""You are saying that the Mexican government is passing out leaflets on how to cross the border?"" Smith's reply: ""They have done that in the past, on how to, of course how to be safe, and maybe how to get food and water, but also how to avoid detection.""Has Mexico really been giving its citizens advice on how to sneak into the United States without running into the Border Patrol? We looked into it.In response to our inquiry, Jamie Zuieback, who works for Smith as an aide to the House Judiciary Committee, pointed us to an opinion piece that aired on National Public Radio on Jan. 27, 2005. In it, commentator Gustavo Arellano reacts to a pamphlet produced by the Mexican foreign ministry called ""Guia del Migrante Mexicano,"" or ""Guide for the Mexican Migrant."" Earlier that month, The New York Times reported that about 1.5 million copies of the guide had been distributed across Mexico in December 2004.In his commentary, Arellano said the 32-page booklet ""advises Mexicans who are thinking of leaving their homeland on the best ways to do it."" Arrellano noted that the publication riled some American lawmakers, who described it as a manual on how to enter the country illegally -- a position aired at the time by then-U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., in an opinion article published in the Jan. 9, 2005, Austin American-Statesman. (Hayworth is challenging U.S. Sen. John McCain in Arizona's 2010 Republican primary.)Several weeks later, Francisco Alejo, who was then the Austin-based Mexican consul general, responded to Hayworth with an opinion piece in the Statesman. He wrote: ""In no way does the guide promote undocumented immigration into the United States. As it is clearly stated in the guide’s introduction and on the back cover, the safe and appropriate way to enter any country -- including the United States -- is with a valid passport and visa.""Alejo said the guide was produced to advise ""people of the risks involved in, as well as the legal consequences of, crossing into the United States."" His article also said the Mexican government had produced similar guides in the past. Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies international migration, said his reading was that the purpose of the brochure was humanitarian, to prevent migrants from being stranded in the desert or dying.In the January 2005 Times article, Geronimo Gutierrez, then Mexico’s undersecretary for North American affairs, said that the year before, ""over 300 Mexicans died in their attempt to enter the United States, the vast majority if not all of them in search of a job. ... The Mexican government obviously has an obligation to take all actions possible in order to avoid the loss of life.’’ Let's recap. Smith first said that the Mexican government is currently handing out leaflets telling people how to avoid the U.S. Border Patrol and ""get into the country."" He amended that to say that Mexico has handed out such leaflets in the past and that they included information on how to ""be safe."" And the Mexican government acknowledged a few years ago that it was distributing information about safely crossing the border.That leaves two significant questions. Are the leaflets still being distributed? And do they -- or did they ever -- advise border-crossers how to get into the country while avoiding detection?Seeking answers, we tried to find a current copy of the handout, which is no longer available on the Mexican government's website. However, we resurrected the pamphlet using an Internet archiving tool. We then matched the Spanish text of the document with an English translation of excerpts published in the Times in 2005, supplemented with translation by Spanish-speaking colleagues at the American-Statesman.The introduction to the brochure we found -- it's undated -- says it was designed to dispense ""practical advice"" and notes that the safe way to enter another country is to do so legally, by acquiring a passport in Mexico and a visa from the destination country. It is illustrated with comics-like drawings.It warns migrants of the perils of crossing over. For instance, they are told that crossing the river -- unnamed in the brochure, but presumably the Rio Grande -- can be perilous and that wet, heavy clothing makes floating or swimming difficult. For desert crossers, this section advises migrants ""to walk during hours when the heat is not too intense.""It also describes the dangers of getting involved with human smugglers and advises migrants not to use false documents or carry packages for someone else. If detained, they are told not to resist arrest or try to escape, and that they have certain rights while in custody. And there are tips for migrants to keep a low profile once they are settled in the U.S.: Avoid noisy parties, fighting, domestic violence, carrying weapons, illegal activities, driving while drinking or driving without a license or insurance.There is no information on where to cross the border or how to avoid the Border Patrol or U.S. authorities when doing so.When we noted the lack of such specific advice, Zuieback, Smith's committee aide, pointed out illustrations that she said show ""illegal immigrants watching the border for an opening to enter and, later, running from the Border Patrol."" She also said the advice to cross the desert when the heat is less severe is ""a clear message to cross at night.""Zuieback also interpreted the tips on keeping a low profile as information on ""how to avoid detection by law enforcement while in the United States.""As for showing migrants how to ""get into our country"" -- per Smith's statement to Fox News -- the closest such reference we spotted was a sentence urging people to ""use power lines, train tracks or dirt roads as guides"" if they get lost.Next, we tried to find out whether the migrant guide was still being distributed. Zuieback said Smith was not aware of ""additional publications"" since the guide prompted a flurry of news articles in 2005. However, we came across 2005 reports of similar publications by at least one Mexican state, Yucatan.Using Google Scholar, we found an academic article on the ""Guide for the Mexican Migrant"" published in 2009 by Bruno Lutz, a professor at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Xochimilco, on the outskirts of Mexico City. Lutz wrote that the brochure was published and distributed from 2004 to 2006; that was confirmed by Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington. When President Felipe Calderon came to power in 2006, the paper says, the guide was substituted on the government's website with a guide for the ""Mexican traveler,"" which Lutz describes as ""limited to giving very general indications about required visas and tourist attractions in each country.""We then read the ""Guia del Viajero Mexicano"" on the website of Mexico's foreign ministry and found information on travel alerts, consular services and visa requirements, but nothing on illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.So where does that leave us? Smith was right when he told Fox News that the Mexican government handed out brochures offering advice to people planning to immigrate to the United States without authorization. And there is an element of truth in Smith’s statement that the information in the pamphlet shows people, as Smith says, ""how they can get into our country,"" but the part of the publication that deals with crossing the border focuses on safety.Significantly, Smith incorrectly declared, initially, that Mexico currently gives out the guide. We found no evidence to support that statement.Also, the congressman's description of the ""Guia del Migrante Mexicano"" -- that it tells how to avoid the Border Patrol -- was misleading. While two illustrations appear to show migrants in flight from law officers, the text does not contain information on how to avoid law enforcement while crossing over. In fact, it advises cooperation if apprehended.  We rate Smith's statement as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/may/30/lamar-smith/smith-says-mexico-hands-out-brochures-showing-migr/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
Cornyn says the Arizona immigration law bans racial profiling
","
Simmering over the immigration bill Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law in April, Mexico President Felipe Calderon told a joint session of Congress May 20 that the tough law invites racial profiling. 
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has urged the federal government to increase border security, including sending unmanned aircrafts to survey the Texas-Mexico border, quickly took Calderon to task for lecturing Americans on their state laws. 
""I wish that the president of the United States, the president of Mexico, the attorney general, and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security would have done what anybody can do with Internet access, which is to download a copy of the Arizona bill and read it for themselves,"" Cornyn said on NBC's Meet the Press May 23. ""It expressly bans racial profiling."" 
Does it? 
Generally, the law makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. 
Right away, though, whether the law encouraged police officers to choose who to stop based on race proved a provocative question. The law's phrasing — saying officers ""may not solely consider race"" — prompted critics to condemn the law for effectively permitting officers to single out racial or ethnic characteristics to justify interrogations. 
On April 30, Brewer reacted by signing into law the removal of ""solely"" from the provision, which now says: ""A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution."" 
In a news release, Brewer said that with the change, it's ""crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal and will not be tolerated in Arizona."" 
Not necessarily, legal experts say, pointing out that what's permitted under the U.S. and Arizona constitutions — specifically, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal document — has fed conflicting court rulings. 
The Fourth Amendment, which prohibits ""unreasonable searches and seizures"" was tested in a case in the 1970's concerning conditions the U.S. Border Patrol had to meet to ask motorists about their citizenship. 
A roving patrol unit had stopped a vehicle in California near the Mexican border and questioned its occupants about their immigration status. In 1975, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the questioning didn't violate the amendment. The court said that while ""the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry ... because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer ... may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances."" Any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause, the court said. 
In the opinion, Justice Lewis Powell wrote: ""The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor,"" even though ""standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens."" In other words, racial factors can be used in profiling, the court held, just as long as they are not the only factors — language reflected in the Arizona law's original wording. 
However, Daniel Capra, a professor of law at Fordham University, pointed to a later case (United States v. Whren in 1996). Here, plainclothes policeman patrolling a ""high-drug area"" in Washington observed two black men driving a truck turn suddenly without signaling and speed off. The officers stopped the truck and saw plastic bags of cocaine. Facing federal drug charges, the men sought to suppress the evidence, arguing the stop wasn't justified by either reasonable suspicion or probable cause they were engaged in illegal drug activity. The Supreme Court found that because the men violated traffic laws, the stop didn't violate the Fourth Amendment, and also spoke to their claim that allowing police officers to investigate other legal violations after a routine traffic stop could lead to stopping cars based only on a driver's race. The court noted that the ""Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race,"" citing the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants ""equal protection of the laws."" 
In 1997, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that under the Fourteenth Amendment, ""citizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws at all times. If law enforcement adopts a policy, employs a practice, or in a given situation takes steps to initiate an investigation of a citizen based solely upon that citizen's race, without more, then a violation of the Equal Protection clause has occurred."" Here, the defendant had argued that airport officers in Cincinnati seized his carry-on bag — which contained cocaine — solely because of his race. 
And in 2000, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — a federal court whose jurisdiction includes Arizona — ruled that stopping someone because of that person's Hispanic appearance is impermissible because ""the majority of people who pass through the checkpoint in question (in El Centro, Calif.) are Hispanic."" The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that its conclusion contradicted some language in the Brignoni-Ponce case. Yet, it said, in ""suggesting that ethnic appearance could be relevant, the (Supreme) Court relied heavily on now-outdated demographic information."" By 2000, the court said, there were so many more legal U.S. residents of Mexican ancestry, it was no longer reasonable to stop someone because they look Hispanic. 
Brewer said the latest changes to Arizona's immigration law ""lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling."" Checking her statement, PolitiFact.com spoke with legal experts who said that, at a minimum, conflicts among the various court decisions needs to be resolved. Besides, while the revised Arizona law bans unconstitutional racial profiling, it still permits profiling based on cues such as clothing or behavior. Experts told PolitiFact the law draws a hazy, perhaps unenforceable line between permitted profiling and illegal approaches. 
Another concern: Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis and a specialist on immigration law, said he worries that local police inadequately trained in immigration law could engage in racial profiling, intentionally or unwittingly. ""If Arizona state and local police considered 'Mexican appearance' as permitted by Brignoni-Ponce, some would say that is racial profiling,"" Johnson told us. 
PolitiFact concluded that the revised law has too much wiggle room to back up Brewer's statement that it lays ""to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling."" 
Of course, Cornyn didn't venture as far as Brewer. He simply said the law expressly bans such profiling, and it does — though the law also expressly leaves room for profiling that passes constitutional muster, a significant and legally squishy factor that Cornyn's statement doesn't acknowledge. Experts expect the profiling topic to be thrashed out for years to come. 
We rate Cornyn's statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/may/29/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-arizona-immigration-law-bans-racial-pr/

Then Boxer turns into a large blimp with loudspeakers on top and TV screens around the bottom, floating over the California landscape, broadcasting inanities. (No, we're not making this up. See the ad for yourself.)

A creepily cheerful narrator says: ""Soon her elitist self-image grew so that it overwhelmed the capital and drifted west ... westward, to tell us all how to live our lives ...""

At seven and half minutes, the video runs too long to be a TV ad and is clearly aimed at an online audience. At about the halfway mark (after the senator-blimp has floated over what appears to be the L.A. skyline), the ad introduces Republican Carly Fiorina as a better alternative and a ""successful leader.""

We decided to check one of the ad's more concrete criticisms of Boxer: That she's ""passed only three bills in 18 years"" into law.

""One named a local courthouse. One named part of a river -- in Virginia. And the third brought California some money to retrofit bridges. Three bills,"" the narrator said.

Following our standard practice, we contacted the Fiorina campaign for back-up. They told us they were counting only bills passed into law where Boxer was listed as the primary sponsor. But they also told us since the ad was made, they ran across two other bills, so the actual number they found was five. They contrasted this unfavorably with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who they said was the primary sponsor on 14 bills that became law.

Of Boxer's legislation, the ad mentions a 1994 law that funded bridge retrofits; a 2007 law to name a U.S. courthouse in Fresno, Calif., the ""Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse; and a 2008 law to  designate a portion of the Rappahannock River in Virginia as the ""John W. Warner Rapids.""

The other two laws are a 2004 measure to provide for ""the development of a national plan for the control and management of Sudden Oak Death, a tree disease caused by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum,"" and a 2009 law to re-name a San Diego post office as the ""Cesar E. Chavez Post Office."" (We verified that both passed.)

But Fiorina's narrow accounting is misleading because it ignores the collaborative way that bills become law. Any single bill that lists a single senator as author is often the collective work of many senators. In some cases, entire bills become amendments to other bills that pass.

We found that Boxer co-sponsored at least 72 bills since 1995. A good number of these were for less significant resolutions or post office namings. But some were more prominent pieces of legislation, such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, which removed barriers so women can sue for gender-based pay discrimination, and the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of 2008, which aimed to reduce counterfeiting and piracy of intellectual property. ""It's the nature of the process that everybody participates,"" said Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie. ""No one writes a bill all on their own with no other input.""

In the case of particular bills, it's often possible to piece together which senators contributed to a piece of legislation through research and reporting. But there's no standardized way to count meaningful contributions on a broad scale.

""There is no good, strong, objective, consistent way to measure productivity as a legislator,"" said Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The statement in the Fiorina ad is ""meaningless,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter whether it's narrowly, factually accurate. It has nothing to do with Boxer's record as a legislator,"" he said.

Ornstein also pointed out that Boxer is chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, so she's steered important legislation on energy and offshore drilling. Committee chairs don't always author the original legislation themselves, but they play a critical role by greenlighting bills they support and stopping bills they oppose. Boxer has used that power to advance her legislative agenda, Ornstein said.

The Boxer campaign said she has contributed to several pieces of legislation that she didn't directly sponsor. She co-authored a successful amendment that permitted companies to claim a one-time tax reduction on profits made overseas if money is invested into the domestic American economy. They said she also contributed to laws that protected California wilderness areas, funded after-school programs, and set rules for 401(k) plans limiting how much employers could force employees to hold in company stock.

We looked into a few different accounts of Boxer's legislative accomplishments. CQ's Politics in America 2008 edition noted that she had ""pushed through"" the tax change on overseas profits. It also said that she had ""led efforts in 2001 to help communities deal with abandoned industrial sites."" However, the 2010 edition said that ""Getting major legislation passed has not been the trademark of Boxer's career,"" and noted the bridge retrofits bill. But it also said that she is very active in promoting environmental issues and has been a longtime proponent of ""cap and trade"" legislation to address carbon emissions and climate change. Such legislation is still pending in Congress and has yet to become law.

In ruling on the statement in the ""Hot Air"" ad, we find a lot lacking. The Fiorina ad said that Boxer ""passed only three bills in 18 years"" into law. But now even the Fiorina campaign admits that number is wrong -- there are five. And more importantly, experts on Congress say the Fiorina campaign's methodology is a misleading way of assessing a senator's legislative accomplishments. The Fiorina campaign could still make a case that Boxer is not an effective legislator, but the campaign has failed to do it here. Using the count of bills authored is simplistic and doesn't reflect the reality of the legislative process. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2010/may/28/carly-fiorina/hot-air-movie-not-accurate-boxers-laws/

PAC says Texas public schools employ one non-teacher for every teacher
","
Urging Texans to find out how public schools are spending their money, Michael Quinn Sullivan, president of the conservative-leaning Empower Texans, which advocates for limited government, suggests that maybe too many non-teachers are soaking up taxpayer dollars that could be spent on classroom instruction. 
""Everyone says public schools in Texas are underfunded, but are they?"" Sullivan says in the May 14 Web video, pointing out that more than half of the public school system's funding is spent on expenses outside the classroom. ""You might say there's a little overhead."" 
""There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. There are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools,"" he continues. ""Do we really need one non-teacher for every teacher on the public school payroll?"" 
We're not weighing in on the value of non-teachers in the schools, but we wondered if Sullivan got his ratio right. 
He pointed us to the Texas Education Agency website, which has annual ""snapshots"" of public education in Texas both statewide and by district. The reports cover 90 statistics including student demographics, average college admission test scores and how many people each district employs broken down by job type. 
According to the most recent snapshot, 634,942 full-time employees worked in the public education system (not including charter schools) in 2008-09. Of those, 321,092 were full-time teachers and 313,850 staff members held other jobs. 
Who are all these non-teachers? 
According to the snapshot, teachers accounted for 51 percent of the schools' workforce in 2008-09. Auxiliary staff — such as security, public information officers and grant writers, according to TEA — were the next biggest grouping, 28 percent, followed by educational, at 10 percent, professional support staff, 8 percent, and administrative staff, 4 percent. This adds to more than 100 percent, the agency said, because some full-time employees divide time between positions. 
Sullivan said Empower Texans isn't suggesting that ""all 'non-teachers' are bad — clearly many are needed,"" but that the one-to-one teacher to non-teacher ratio ""seems a bit high."" 
In the Web ad, Sullivan sounds a critical note, saying: ""Hey, we've got bureaucrats to pay. If you think our classrooms are underfunded — and they probably are — the money should be pretty easy to find. Just walk down to your nearest administrative complex."" 
There's a counterpoint. Debbie Ratcliffe, the TEA's communications director, said: ""It takes a village to run a school district."" 
""There naturally are going to be a lot of people on school payrolls that aren't teachers,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Just think of the number of bus drivers and custodians and all those kinds of folks. Could you make a school run without them? Yeah, but it sure is a lot harder."" 
Ratcliffe shared a more recent ""standard report"" that breaks down the full-time school employees for 2009-10 in detail. 
As of March 2010, the report says, statewide school district personnel totaled 661,285. Teachers made up about half of that, accounting for 333,090 full-time staff. Almost all the employees that fall under teaching staff are pre-kindergarten through 12th grade teachers. About 400 are labeled ""not applicable,"" which Ratcliffe said includes tutors and study hall monitors. The 2010 count puts the number of administrative staff at 25,525, or 3.9 percent of all workers. 
So who are the other 302,670 employees — the bulk of the ""non-teachers"" in Sullivan's claim? About 5,136 are librarians, 11,082 are counselors, 5,916 are nurses and 3,924 are speech therapists, among others. Some 178,140 are classified as auxiliary staff, a category that includes security personnel, public information officers and grant writers. 
How does Texas stack up nationally? On par, according to the the National Center for Education Statistics' most recent data. In 2007, teachers accounted for 51 percent of all elementary and secondary public school employees. In 20 states, teachers accounted for less than 50 percent of total staff, including Virgina (35 percent). In 30 states, teachers made up 50 percent or more of all staff, including South Carolina (72 percent). 
According to another report, released in November, instructional aides accounted for about 12 percent of all full-time public school staff nationwide, instructional coordinators and supervisors made up 1 percent, guidance counselors (2 percent), librarians (1 percent), student and support staff (23 percent), school administrators (3 percent), school district administrators (1 percent) and administrative support staff (7 percent). 
Where does all this leave Sullivan's statement? 
He correctly cites the number of teachers and non-teachers, per the education agency's latest snapshot report. More recent data available from the agency shows both have increased; still, the ratio of teachers to non-teachers is about the same. 
But Sullivan's online call to action doesn't do justice to the state's actual mix of school workers. The majority of non-teachers aren't administrators or paper shufflers; they're people who work directly with students including counselors, librarians, therapists and bus drivers. 
We rate Sullivan's statement as Mostly True. 
This story was updated to correct the total number of public school employees to 634,942.",/factchecks/2010/may/28/empower-texans/pac-says-texas-public-schools-employ-one-non-teach/

Rick Scott says Florida has high regulatory burden
","Rick Scott, a former health care executive who's running in Florida's Republican gubernatorial primary, took aim at the state's business climate in a May 25, 2010, campaign event with young Republicans in Tampa.""We're 45th out of 50 states'' for regulatory climate for business, Scott said in a speech. ""It's ridiculous the regulation we have in this state. It impacts job growth.""That's a pretty specific charge, suggesting that the state is overregulated. So we decided to track it down and see if it was supported.As it turns out, there are at least three recent rankings of the 50 states by their regulatory climate for business, and one of them indeed has Florida in 45th place.That one is the ""U.S. Economic Freedom Index: 2008 Report,"" produced roughly every five years by the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank based in San Francisco. The Scott campaign confirmed that this was the study he was citing.The authors of the study ranked the 50 states in each of five areas: fiscal policy, regulatory policy, judicial climate toward business, the size of government and ""welfare spending."" In the regulatory category, Florida ranked 45th, just as Scott said it did. (The Sunshine State fared better in the other four categories; overall, its ranking was 28th.)But the other two rankings of regulatory climate had happier news for Florida businesses.One study, ""Freedom in the 50 States: An Index of Personal and Economic Freedom,"" was published in February 2009 by the Mercatus Center, a free-market program at George Mason University in Arlington, Va. The categories in the Mercatus study were fiscal policy, regulatory policy, personal freedom and economic freedom, which were combined into an overall ranking. In the regulatory category, Florida ranked 19th. (In the overall category, Florida ranked 22nd.)The other study, by Forbes magazine in 2008, ranked ""the Best States for Business,"" by business costs, labor policy, regulatory environment, economic climate, growth prospects and ""quality of life."" In the regulatory ranking, Florida ranked 22nd. Overall, Florida fared the best it did in any of the three studies: 8th highest in the nation.So we have three studies. How did they come up with such different results? The quick answer is that they used a different mix of statistics when calculating each state's regulatory climate.There are some similarities. Forbes' study, for instance, used PRI's rating as one factor in its regulatory calculation. And the PRI and Mercatus studies have a number of statistics in common, such as minimum wage levels, labor union laws and the state's worker compensation system.But PRI and Mercatus also use some divergent factors. Mercatus, unlike PRI, includes utility deregulation, health insurance mandates, land-use restrictions, liability system quality and eminent domain laws. By contrast, PRI uses a more extensive list of occupational licensing and continuing-education requirements, covering everything from auctioneers and acupuncturists to embalmers and opticians. PRI also factors in gun control policy, school choice and seat belt laws, which Mercatus included in a category separate from regulatory policy.We asked Jason Sorens, the political scientist at the State University of New York at Buffalo who co-authored the Mercatus report, why the studies came up with such divergent rankings. He said that even with the difference in statistical factors, he was surprised at the wide difference in scores. Sorens suggested that the variation could have stemmed from two factors included in the PRI study but not the Mercatus study -- procurement rules (such as mandates for state government to buy American-made products, recycled products and alternative fuels) and environmental protection standards (such as standards for indoor air quality, pesticides, mercury, lead, ""children's environmental health,"" asbestos and other toxic compounds). It's possible that Florida's laws in these areas, or perhaps in other areas measured only by the PRI study, are more stringent than those in other states, Sorens said.It's important to note that all three studies were produced by groups with free-market, pro-business orientations, and their selection of inputs inherently reflects value judgments that not all Floridians will agree with. Certainly labor union members will not appreciate having ""right to work"" laws counted as a plus, and environmentalists (even those who are fiscally conservative) will likely chafe at the prospect of a state being marked down for strong wetlands-protection and endangered-species laws. Finally, lots of Floridians could take issue with whether it's desirable (or even valid) to include gun-control laws and seat belt laws (as PRI does) or smoking restrictions (as Mercatus does) in a calculation of a business-climate study.In other words, many Floridians may see benefits in some of the government regulations that count as demerits in these studies, and might well prefer, on balance, to live in a state that ranks poorly on these regulatory lists.That said, we won't take sides on the question of whether state regulation is a positive or a negative. Rather, we'll focus only on the narrower question of whether Scott portrayed the data accurately.Is there a single, ""correct"" ranking? We don't think so. Even though the three studies produced different results using different inputs, the authors of the Forbes and Mercatus studies told PolitiFact that they respect the PRI study and its methodology. With that kind of endorsement, we'll stipulate that there's no ""right"" score for Florida -- just three different estimates.So if the three separate rankings are more or less equivalent, then Scott's statement is not incorrect -- but it's also not complete. He has cited the least favorable ranking, while two other studies rated Florida substantially higher. If Scott had said, ""According to one study, Florida ranks 45th out of 50 states'' for regulatory climate for business, he would have been 100 percent accurate. As it is, his statement is technically correct, but gives an incomplete impression about the extent of Florida's regulatory climate. So we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/may/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-has-high-regulatory-burden/

Bill McCollum sends mixed signals on Arizona's immigration law
","Arizona's controversial immigration law has proven problematic for Florida Republicans, who in large part appear wary of fully endorsing a proposal that's supported by a majority of Floridians but one that also could cost votes among Florida's Hispanic population. The tightrope-walking act is perhaps no more apparent than when it comes to Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican running for governor.McCollum's primary opponent , Rick Scott, unabashedly supports the law, which will require local law enforcement officials, once police stop a person, to verify the immigration status of those they reasonably suspect of being in the country illegally. The law is also supported by a 58 percent of Floridians, according to a May 2010 St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald/Bay News 9/Central Florida News 13 poll. We decided to rate McCollum's statements on the Arizona law using our Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent someone has been when taking a position on an issue.Before we get to that, though, we need to give you a quick history of how the Arizona law came to pass.The bill in question originally was signed into law on April 23, 2010, by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. An amended version of the bill -- one to lessen the prospects that racial profiling could occur -- passed and was signed into law on April 30.  The new version of the law says: ""A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.""The prior version had said that an official ""may not solely consider race"" in such circumstances.The change in the bill -- though its impact can be debated -- is important to note when discussing McCollum's position, since his first comments refer to the first version of the bill, while later comments refer to the second version.McCollum's first published comments about the Arizona law came on April 27, after the original bill had passed.He was asked whether he would like a Florida version of Arizona's law.""I think Arizona has its own unique problems,"" McCollum said. ""I don't think Florida should enact laws like this -- quite that far out.""Then in stories on May 13 and May 14 -- after the amended version of Arizona's law passed -- McCollum about-faced and said he would support a Florida version. ""As state and local law enforcement officials in Arizona begin to implement the state's aggressive new border security law to crackdown on illegal immigration, I applaud Gov. Brewer and the Arizona Legislature for stepping up their enforcement efforts at a time when President Obama's administration has let states down,"" McCollum said. ""I support Arizona's law as amended, and if the federal government fails to secure our borders and solve the problem of illegal immigration, I would support a similar law for Florida.""And he also said: ""Arizona leaders recently made needed changes that address concerns I had that the law could be abused and misused to perform racially profiled stops and arrests. I do not support any measure that would result in racial profiling or other unintended consequences for law-abiding American citizens.''Then, on May 16, came another comment to a television reporter in Port St. Lucie. This time, McCollum said he didn't think an Arizona-style immigration law was needed in Florida.""I didn't change my position, but Arizona changed its law after they passed a law that was very bad (and) that had that the potential for racial profiling,"" McCollum said.He was then asked if it was realistic that a similar law might be passed in Florida. ""We don't need that law in Florida,"" he said. ""That's not what's going to happen here.""McCollum's most recent comments were picked up on by the Scott campaign, which highlighted the quote in a television ad.McCollum called the original version of the Arizona immigration law far out, but then said he would support the amended law being adopted in Florida. Since there's a debate over how much difference the amendment ultimately will have in how the law is enforced, it's hard for us to properly measure whether McCollum's position shift in this instance is a complete flip-flop.But what does strike us are McCollum's comments on May 13 and May 16 -- both in reference to the amended version. On May 13, McCollum said he would support implementing the Arizona law in Florida. Then on May 16 he said Florida doesn't need that law.Which is it? McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said McCollum's position since the final version of the law passed has been consistent. She says McCollum supports the law Arizona passed, in large part because of failures at the federal level. However, McCollum thinks an Arizona-style law is not currently needed in Florida because of the state's unique issues dealing with immigration. But McCollum's statements to the media on May 13 and May 16 are just too different to us, and warrant a rating of Full-Flop.",/factchecks/2010/may/27/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-sends-mixed-signals-arizonas-immigra/

Kendrick Meek's position on offshore oil drilling remains mostly consistent
","With the Gulf oil spill threatening Florida's pristine beaches and public support for offshore oil drilling waning, Democratic Senate candidate Kendrick Meek of Miami has accused his rivals of backing oil drilling at one time or another, and says he's the only candidate to consistently oppose expanded offshore exploration. He made the argument on his campaign website, where he encouraged people to sign a petition against offshore oil drilling. This is what he wrote: “The recent disaster in the Gulf just underscores the need for a moratorium on any new offshore drilling, but Charlie Crist is busy flip-flopping his stance and Marco Rubio refuses to rule drilling out. Kendrick Meek is the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling.” Meek has largely opposed increased offshore drilling during his congressional tenure. But is he the only candidate consistently opposed to it? We checked with the other major Senate candidates on the issue. Those who have held public office -- Gov. Charlie Crist, former House Speaker Marco Rubio and former Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre -- have publicly declared their positions to various media. Libertarian Alexander Snitker and Jeff Greene, both of whom have never held public office, each stated - for all intents and purposes - their opposition.Here's a more detailed look at each of the candidates: Gov. Charlie Crist: As a candidate for governor in 2006, Crist was unequivocal that he would never support oil drilling off Florida's shores. In 2008, Crist, who was considered a vice presidential running mate with Republican John McCain, backed off his previously staunch opposition. The April 20, 2010, spill convinced him it was risky, and as a result, Crist again became opposed. Clearly, Crist's position on offshore oil drilling has been anything but consistent. Marco Rubio: Rubio has declined to rule out additional offshore drilling. On May 5, 2010, he spoke to reporters in Washington, D.C., about the issue. ‘I've not heard anyone say you cannot safely drill for oil because there are thousands of rigs drilling even as we speak that are not leaking, that are not causing this ecological disaster,'' he said in a story published by the Miami Herald. He later added: ''The question is: 'Should the United States have access to all of its energy resources?' And the answer to me is yes. It has to be done in a way that's safe and clearly not destructive to your environment, to your ecology, or to your economy."" Rubio has been consistent, though he does not share Meek's position. Maurice Ferre: The former Miami mayor says he has always been opposed offshore oil drilling. In his position paper, which he shared with PolitiFact Florida, he bluntly wrote that ''the juice from drilling off the Florida coast is not worth the squeeze of putting our larger economy at risk.'' He said he authored the paper with the help of the Everglades Foundation, an opponent of offshore oil drilling. Jeff Greene: Newcomer Greene told the Miami Herald that he has always opposed drilling off Florida's shore. He told the Century Village Democratic Club in West Palm Beach on May 25: ‘‘Why do people come to Florida? The ocean, the coasts, the beaches. This is not a fun extra thing that we have. This is the lifeline of our state. We're not going to have any offshore drilling in Florida. I was against it before, I'm against it now, and I'll be against it forever.’’ Having not held public office, this represents his first public comments on the subject. Alexander Snitker: The Libertarian candidate supports offshore oil drilling, but only under certain conditions. He wants oil companies held responsible for damage and wants the $75 million cap on damages removed, saying it ''creates a ''moral hazard'' for oil companies. Environmental groups who follow Congress on the issue say the four-term lawmaker has remained consistent in his opposition to offshore oil drilling. The League of Conservation Voters, which grades lawmakers on their environmental votes, gives Meek high marks for opposing oil drilling, as does Environment America, which tracks votes on environmental issues. Among the votes they monitored: in 2007 he voted against an amendment that would have lifted a drilling moratorium off the Eastern seaboard from Florida to Delaware starting 3 miles off the shore. Meek also was one of 100 U.S. House members in 2003 to sign a letter urging congressional leaders not to open Florida's coastline to offshore drilling. He signed a similar letter in 2005, and in 2006. He also voted in 2006 against a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration within 50 to 100 miles of most coastlines, and within 234 miles of Tampa Bay. When President Barack Obama issued a call in March for expanded offshore oil drilling, Meek gave it a tepid review. But when looking at Meek's voting record since joining Congress in 2003, we found one taken Sept. 16, 2008, on the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill included a provision that would have allowed oil drilling 50 miles beyond shores. First, let’s put the nation's political climate into context. In the fall of 2008, the presidential campaign between Obama and McCain intensified over oil drilling. Amid soaring gas prices and cries of ""Drill, Baby, Drill,'' many politicians, including Obama and McCain, reverse coursed and embraced oil drilling. President George W. Bush also had lifted a presidential moratorium on offshore oil drilling, potentially opening the way for drilling within 3 miles of some coastlines. Hammered by the calls, House Democrats began to move away from their longstanding opposition to drilling, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiling the legislation to open up parts of the U.S. coastline, including Florida, to drilling. On Sept. 16, the House voted 236-189 in favor of the bill. Voting ‘‘yes’’ were 221 Democrats, including Meek, and 15 Republicans. Voting ‘‘no’’ were 13 Democrats and 176 Republicans, according to the roll call vote. Pelosi declared the bill's passage as a ‘‘a new direction in energy policy'' and a ""bold step forward."" Florida Democrats said at the time that the bill stuck by a 2006 compromise that gives Florida's coastline at least a 125-mile buffer in the Gulf of Mexico. But Republicans lampooned the legislation as a sham, designed to give Democrats the illusion of supporting oil drilling, while actually keeping most oil (which happens to be within 50 miles of shore) off limits. House Republican Leader John Boehner condemned it, calling it “a hoax on the American people.’’ The Bush White House also threatened a veto, stating that ""this bill purports to open access to American energy sources while in reality taking actions to stifle development."" That threat from Bush doomed passage of the legislation in the Senate, where it was never brought up for a vote on the floor. “The issue you raise is not about (Meek’s) change of heart, it's about responding to the Bush administration's decision on the moratorium, and the (House GOP) proposal. Faced with those circumstances, Democrats acted to limit offshore drilling, because otherwise it would have been open season,’’ said Adam Sharon, Meek’s spokesman. That gets us back to Meek’s original statement that he's ""the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling.""Meek did vote at least one time to expand drilling -- though the legislation only allowed it in limited cases and under specific conditions that probably would never have happened. And his Senate opponents either don’t share his opposition to offshore oil drilling or have not held public office to warrant a documented account of their stance on the issue. So, given the political posturing over the 2008 vote, we rate Meek’s claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/may/26/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meeks-position-offshore-oil-drilling-rema/

La bonne vie? Democratic chairman says Perry is living large, a la Louis XIV
","Boyd Richie, who chairs the Texas Democratic Party, took a fresh swing at Gov. Rick Perry and his sweet state-funded digs, saying in a May 20 e-mail blast: “He’s spending Texans’ hard-earned money to live like Louie XIV.” Quelle horreur--really? Not really, replied Kirsten Gray, the party’s spokeswoman. “It was a humorous analogy, not based in fact,” she told us in an e-mail. We guessed as much. Allow us to have some fun, too, by taking a look back at France's Sun King. First: How did the king, who lived from 1638 to 1715, make it day to day? Like his father before him, biographies suggest, he often was on the move, waging war (the “natural condition of nations” in the era, recapped Nancy Mitford, in her book, “The Sun King”) or hunting while staying in palatial abodes capped by his beloved chateau at Versailles, which he proclaimed the seat of government in 1682. Versailles, of late a spectacular tourist attraction, grew on the king’s watch to include picture-perfect gardens, a theater holding 3,000 spectators, a vast hall of mirrors, hundreds of imported orange trees (many planted indoors in silver tubs)--all of that a far cry from the rustic hunting lodge his father had enjoyed there. That building, which his son preserved, consisted of just (only) (barely) 20 rooms plus a men’s dormitory. Tuneful aspect of the king’s lifestyle: He was seldom without music, awakening each morning to the playing of a live band, according to Mitford. So, how does Perry fare comparatively? We’re unaware of live bands playing as Perry awakens. And the governor doesn’t routinely hunt (though he recently said he shot and killed a coyote during a jog) nor is he known to bounce from palace to palace nor has he declared war -- except on Washington. Then again, Perry incorrectly maintained last year that Texas could secede; his intimation could be seen as war-like. Yet Perry's temporary home, in a gated community in the hills 11 miles southwest of downtown Austin, hardly compares to the spread at Versailles, which Placesinfrance.com describes as having 700 rooms, over 1,200 fireplaces and 67 staircases. PolitiFact Texas noted in April that the monthly rent for the 4,600-square-foot home--where Perry and his wife settled in fall 2007 so the Governor's Mansion could be renovated--is $9,000. This month, the Associated Press reported that total monthly costs for the seven-bedroom, five-bathroom house exceed $10,000, counting rent, utilities and upkeep. The house has a gourmet kitchen, three dining rooms and seven bathrooms, the AP reported. That gives Perry more private thrones with plumbing than the king who, given his times, was limited to chamber pots. The AP's article itemizes various state-covered expenses at the rental home: $18,000 for ""consumables"" such as household supplies and cleaning products, $1,001.46 in window coverings from upscale retailer Neiman Marcus, a $1,000 ""emergency repair"" of the governor's filtered ice machine, a $700 clothes rack, and a little more than $70 for a two year subscription to Food & Wine Magazine. Maintenance on a heated pool on the property’s three acres has cost taxpayers at least $8,400, the AP said, and the tab for grounds and lawn maintenance has topped $44,000. All told, taxpayers have spent at least $592,000 for rent, utilities, repairs, furnishings and supplies since Perry moved in. By comparison, the AP noted, the governor's mansion is wholly owned by the state — there is no rent or mortgage to pay. As configured, it has about 9,900 total square feet, but most is public space packed with historic artifacts. Only 2,750 square feet is dedicated to the governor's residence. Perry critics have floated alternative temporary housing ideas. The governor could occupy a mobile home (as Mike Huckabee boasted of doing while governor of Arkansas). Of late, the Texas AFL-CIO offered to rent a manufactured home to the governor for $1 a year. Or Perry could bunker in at a hotel. At the La Quinta Inn at the Texas Capitol, the nightly rate for a suite, starting June 1, would run $120 plus tax, though a room with a standard King bed, plus a refrigerator and microwave, would cost $90 plus tax, according to the assistant general manager, Zina Carter. There's also a pool, the hotel website says; we'll guess it's not heated. Summing up: Louis XIV had it all for his age. He gamboled, he hunted, he warred; lived large. Though Perry’s hardly giving the king a run for his money, he has had a bonanza of a run as well--healthy wife, children, multiple elections with nary a loss. He’s often said he has the world’s best job. We’ll speculate he’s good with his rental quarters. But ça suffit, as they say in France. The Democrats said Richie was joshing. We’ll grant they’re kidders. We rate his statement Pantalon en Feu.",/factchecks/2010/may/26/boyd-richie/la-bonne-vie-democratic-chairman-says-perry-living/
