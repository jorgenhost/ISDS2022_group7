Smith’s statement on MoDOT’s debt adds up, but needs context
","Infrastructure is one of Gov. Mike Parson’s top priorities in the 100th legislative session, and some representatives have followed suit. House Budget Chairman Rep. Cody Smith, R-Carthage, presented a budget plan to fund road and bridge improvements throughout the state. Smith said his plan would fund the infrastructure improvements without raising taxes or accruing new debt. Smith wanted to do this by appropriating funds from general revenue to state infrastructure instead of taking out more bonds. ""Our state transportation department already has a heavy debt load and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in just the last two years,"" Smith wrote in a Capitol report sent by his office. Has the Missouri Department of Transportation really paid more than $700 million in debt payments in the last two years? Let’s take a look at the numbers Documents from MoDOT show that his numbers are on point. MoDOT’s 2018 Financial Snapshot shows the department paid a little more than that, totaling $702 million in 2017 and 2018. ""My preference is to avoid debt when possible,"" Smith said. But, the debt paid doesn’t tell the whole story. The department paid $412 million in debt in 2017. The department’s average payment since 2004 is about $242 million a year. The number was higher in 2017 than past years because the agency paid off some of its debt early. ""In 2017, $117.8 million of bonds were paid off early, saving future interest costs of $29.4 million,"" said Sally Oxenhandler, MoDOT interim spokeswoman. This helped inflate Smith’s point when he said MoDOT’s debt reached more than $700 million in just two years. This graph of MoDOT’s borrowed funds and annual payments helps visualize the amount of debt MoDOT paid in 2017, compared to debt payments in the past. (Look for the mountain peak.)  Graph courtesy of MoDOT’s Financial Snapshot, November 2018 Compared to other state transportation departments, Missouri does not have a lot of debt, said Todd Grosvener, MoDOT assistant financial services director. Still, Smith wants to limit the state department accruing any more debt. ""Keeping our road funds stable over the coming years is of the utmost importance,"" Smith said. ""When MoDOT takes on more debt, it has fewer dollars to improve our roads and bridges."" What is the borrowed money used for? The borrowed funds were and are still being used for ""hundreds"" of road and bridge projects throughout Missouri, the agency said. The department borrowed the most money in 2010 when it took on an additional $100 million to replace the Mississippi River Bridge in St. Louis. In 2010, the department also borrowed $685 million for the Safe and Sound Bridge Improvement Program. This three-and-a-half-year project replaced or rehabilitated more than 800 bridges across the state. ""On behalf of the House of Representatives, I’ll be keeping a close eye on the amount of debt the state takes on to improve and maintain our transportation infrastructure,"" Smith said. Smith said, ""Our state transportation department already has a heavy debt load and has paid more than $700 million in debt payments in just the last two years."" His numbers match MoDOT’s records. They need clarification, however, because MoDOT paid off a big chunk of debt early, in order to avoid more interest accumulation. Because the statement is accurate and needs clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[],/factchecks/2019/may/08/cody-smith/smiths-statement-modots-debt-adds-needs-context/

Beto O'Rourke says 60 million Americans have unsafe drinking water. That's exaggerated
","Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said he would launch a 10-year, $5 trillion plan to combat climate change, which he considers the country’s greatest threat. O’Rourke said he’d invest in infrastructure, because aging systems and climate change impact the quality of water Americans drink. ""Sixty million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe,"" O’Rourke said April 29. Flint, Mich., became a campaign stop and political talking point in the 2016 presidential election as the city grappled with lead-contaminated water. (We examined the city’s water quality progress a year ago.) Is O’Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, right about 60 million Americans not having safe drinking water? O’Rourke based his claim on an August 2017 investigation by News21. We found that his framing is more conclusive than the investigation and needs context. News21 is a national student investigative initiative at the Walter Cronkite School School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University. Its reporters analyzed 680,000 violations logged over a 10-year period (starting Jan. 1, 2007) in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Safe Drinking Water Information System. News21 examined violations by active community water systems, a type of public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round. (This does not include, for example, schools, factories, hospitals, or campgrounds where people don’t stay for a long time.) The review homed in on violations for health, monitoring and reporting. The team documented EPA violations around the country, from rural communities in California to New York City boroughs. They found that many local water treatment plants — especially in poor, minority and small communities — didn’t have the money to buy the equipment needed to filter out contaminants. Those include arsenic found naturally in rock, factory chemicals and fecal matter from farming. The finding most relevant to this fact-check: As many as 63 million people were exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once during the 10-year period analyzed. O’Rourke’s statement reflects the News21 estimate, but leaves out the nuance — the story didn’t outright say 63 million are actively affected, and it noted that some places had resolved their water issues. (Further, the EPA acknowledged that the database might not include all violations and that some information may be incorrect.) The majority of people in affected areas ​might have been exposed to unsafe drinking water only for a very short period of time, said Newsha Ajami, director of Urban Water Policy for the Water in the West initiative at Stanford University. O’Rourke’s number is ""broadly reasonable,"" said Manny Teodoro, an associate professor in the department of political science at Texas A&M University. But he emphasized that it needed the caveat of being ""potentially"" unsafe. Generally, while many systems have improved, regulations have also become more stringent over time, and new contaminants are always being discovered, he said. We kept looking for other estimates of Americans drinking ""unsafe"" water. Nationwide, nearly 21 million people relied on community water systems in 2015 that violated health-based standards, according to a 2018 study from the University of California, Irvine and Columbia University. It was unclear how many customers had contaminated water at their tap, said one of the authors of the paper, Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of water economics and policy at the University of California, Irvine. While drinking water contaminants over a long period of time can be harmful, many contaminants don’t pose immediate health risks and many only last for several weeks or less, she said. Allaire’s study did not include monitoring and reporting violations, unlike News21, because she said it’s unclear how to interpret those violations  — some of them stem from administrative errors or delays that don’t directly impact water quality. Data from the EPA for fiscal year 2017 provides a similar estimate for community water systems with health-based violations. Among other limitations, however, the EPA data does not say how many people actually received water that didn’t meet standards. According to the EPA’s website, ""there is no way to know."" According to the EPA, about 30.6 million were served by community water systems with violations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 (October 2018 through December 2018). For the most part, U.S. water systems are safe and reliable, experts said. And short-term violations are different from failing systems that cannot provide safe drinking water over long periods of time. Those failing systems are often found in rural and low-income communities. Better data tracking is needed. Currently, the system for monitoring water quality depends on self-reporting. For smaller systems, that’s an issue, due to lack of employees, technology and finances, said Ajami, the water policy expert. Plus, there is no data on the water quality of private wells. O’Rourke said that ""60 million Americans live in a place where the water they drink is unsafe."" Overall, it’s difficult to say how many people in the United States have unsafe drinking water. The EPA said about 22 million people were served by community water systems with reported health-based violations in fiscal 2017. But the EPA could not determine how many people actually received water in violation. The agency also said that some violations can be as brief as an hour. O’Rourke’s claim is an imprecise interpretation of a complicated report by News21. News21 said that as many as 63 million people were exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once during a 10-year period starting in 2007. That doesn’t necessarily mean all currently have unsafe water, as O’Rourke concluded. Moreover, experts said that monitoring and reporting violations are important, but do not directly indicate water safety. O’Rourke’s statement is more definitive than the data available and than the report on which he based his claim. We rate his claim Mostly False.","[('Beto O’Rourke, climate change plan, announced April 29, 2019', 'https://betoorourke.com/climate-change/'), ('Email interview, Beto O’Rourke campaign spokesman Chris Evans, April 29, 2019', 'No link'), (""NBC News, Hillary Clinton: 'What Happened in Flint Is Immoral', Feb. 7, 2016"", 'https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/flint-water-crisis/hillary-clinton-what-happened-flint-immoral-n513296'), (""The Guardian, Flint residents bristle at Donald Trump's visit to beleaguered city, Sept. 14, 2016"", 'No link'), ('Politico, Sanders voices outrage in Flint, Feb. 25, 2016', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/donald-trump-flint-visit-water-plant-tour'), (""PolitiFact, Who's to blame for the Flint water crisis?, Feb. 15, 2016; Bernie Sanders has a point: Water in Flint much more expensive than in Burlington, March 7, 2016"", 'No link'), ('News 21, Troubled Water —\xa0Millions consumed potentially unsafe water in the last 10 years, published Aug. 14, 2017', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-flint-michigan-campaign-stop-219798'), ('EPA.gov, Information about Public Water Systems', 'No link'), ('PNAS.org, National trends in drinking water quality violations, February 27, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/15/whos-blame-flint-water-crisis/'), ('PunditFact,\xa0Is Michelle Wolf right that Flint still doesn’t have clean water?, May 1, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email and phone interview, Newsha Ajami, director of Urban Water Policy for the Water in the West initiative at Stanford University, May 1-2, 2019', 'https://troubledwater.news21.com/millions-consumed-potentially-unsafe-water-in-the-last-10-years/'), ('Email interview, Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of water economics and policy at the University of California, Irvine, May 1, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Manny Teodoro, an associate professor in the department of political science at Texas A&M University, May 2, 2019', 'https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/information-about-public-water-systems'), ('Email interview,\xa0Office of Media Relations, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\xa0May 3, 6, 2019', 'No link'), ('EPA,\xa0Population Served by Community Water Systems with No Reported Violations of Health-Based Standards', 'https://www.pnas.org/content/115/9/2078')]",/factchecks/2019/may/07/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-60-million-americans-have-unsafe/

Yes, small businesses account for 99% of all Wisconsin companies
","The first full week in May is National Small Business Week, which has prompted a series of lawmakers to tout the role of small business in Wisconsin. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson — a longtime businessman himself — joined the chorus with a May 6, 2019 tweet: ""99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses,"" the Wisconsin Republican wrote. ""This week, we celebrate the 1.2 million Wisconsinites who work for small businesses—nearly half of our workforce."" In a manufacturing state dotted with a lot of physically imposing buildings, do we really have that many small businesses? Let’s get to work on that. Johnson’s office said the stats come from a state profile generated by the U.S. Small Business Administration. 99.4% of businesses in Wisconsin are small businesses. This week, we celebrate the 1.2 million Wisconsinites who work for small businesses--nearly half of our workforce. #SmallBusinessWeek pic.twitter.com/BYMVBN2SDn The important note here is that the agency’s definition of a ""small"" business is, well, rather large. The categorization under federal standards varies by industry, but the SBA generally considers any business with fewer than 500 employees to be in the ""small"" category. In Wisconsin, 99.4% of businesses do indeed have fewer than 500 employees, according to the 2019 Small Business Profile from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy. The data is the latest available from the U.S. Census Bureau, though it comes from a 2016 analysis. RELATED: Is Wisconsin a Top 10 state for business (from 2017) In line with Johnson’s tweet, the SBA reports those small businesses employ 49.9% of all workers in Wisconsin. The report puts the tally at 1.3 million, however, not the 1.2 million Johnson referenced. That percentage would of course drop dramatically with a smaller definition of ""small."" Businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for about 500,000 jobs in 2016, which would be around 20% of the state workforce. None of that speaks to whether Wisconsin is a good state for small business. The Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship tackles that task to an extent, using a variety of datasets to gauge each state’s rate of new entrepreneurs, number of new businesses starting due to opportunity (i.e. if the owner is coming from unemployment or another job), jobs created by new businesses and percentage of new businesses that survive their first year. Across all those measures, Wisconsin ranked 46th among the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in 2017. That’s up from dead last in 2016 but still the fourth straight year in the bottom 10. That’s just one of many potential indicators of the state’s business climate, based on surveys and data analysis. Some are more positive on Wisconsin, but most place Wisconsin at or below average. That led then-Gov. Scott Walker to get a Mostly False rating in 2017 for picking the most glowing of the recent results to claim Wisconsin was a Top 10 state for business. Johnson’s tweet said small business is a big deal in Wisconsin, accounting for more than 99% of all businesses and half of all employment. That claim — based on the federal definition of a ""small"" business — is in line with the latest data. We rate his statement True.","[('Twitter.com,\xa0Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson), May 6, 2019', 'https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson/status/1125426638811017217'), ('Small Business Administration,\xa02019 Small Business Profile — Wisconsin , accessed May 7, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Ben Voelkel, spokesman for Sen.

Fact-checking Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Ukraine
","  Editor's Note, Sept. 23, 2019: This story was first published May 9, 2019; we have since published additional coverage that incorporates new developments here.  Shady self-dealing in the Ukraine? It’s not just the Republican side that does that, says a social media meme that makes the charge against Democrat Joe Biden. The episode involved his son Hunter Biden’s work on behalf of a Ukrainian energy company at a time when the elder Biden was vice president and a key figure in U.S. policy on Ukraine. The story has been public for years, but it received new attention with Biden running strong among 2020 Democratic presidential contenders. One viral image being shared on social media used a bit of reverse psychology, asking what Americans would think if the details of this story involved the Trump family rather than the Biden family. (Trump’s 2016 campaign chair Paul Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud for laundering millions in income he earned working for Ukrainian politicians.) Here’s the text, which is accompanied by a photograph of Hunter Biden embracing his father. ""Did you know that Donald Trump Jr. was named a director to Ukraine’s largest private gas producer following a Ukrainian visit by President Trump? Trump later threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn’t fire a prosecutor looking into Don Jr.’s company. Just kidding! That was Joe Biden when he was VP, and his son Hunter Biden."" Is it true, as the image suggests, that Hunter Biden was serving as ""a director to Ukraine’s largest private gas producer"" when the elder Biden ""threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn’t fire a prosecutor looking into"" the gas company? • Hunter Biden did hold a directorship for a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president. Experts agree that Hunter Biden's acceptance of the position created a conflict of interest for his father.  • Vice President Joe Biden did urge Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, with the threat of withholding U.S. aid. But that was the position of the wider U.S. government, as well as other international institutions.   • We found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son's interests in mind, as the message suggests. It's not even clear that the company was actively under investigation or that a change in prosecutors benefited it. Hunter Biden did hold a directorship with a natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, beginning in the spring of 2014. Reuters reported at the time that a statement on the company’s website said the younger Biden ""would help the company with ""transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion,"" and other issues. The company also retained the law firm where Biden had been working, Boies Schiller Flexner. The position with Burisma came at a time when the younger Biden had joined with Christopher Heinz (the stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.) and Devon Archer (a Kerry family friend) in a string of investment and consulting firms. Firms run by Biden and Archer ""pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,"" the New York Times reported. Biden’s Burisma directorship attracted attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor F. Yanukovych who subsequently went into exile after a popular revolution. After Yanukovych was ousted, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business. In 2015, Ukraine’s newly appointed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.) Shokin was ousted as prosecutor in 2016. Shokin is the prosecutor the viral post is talking about (more on that later). The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that the vice president learned about his son's role on the board through media reports and never discussed anything related to this company with his son. In a White House press briefing on May 13, 2014, spokesman Jay Carney was asked about it, and whether it presented the appearance of a conflict of interest. Carney said, ""I would refer you to the Vice President’s office. I saw those reports. Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the Vice President or President. But I would refer you to the Vice President’s office."" A year and a half later, the New York Times published an article that suggested that ""the credibility of the vice president’s anti-corruption message may have been undermined"" by Hunter Biden’s dealings with the company. In that 2015 article, Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the vice president, played down any impact on the elder Biden’s policies. ""Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer,"" she said. ""The vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The vice president has pushed aggressively for years, both publicly with groups like the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings with Ukrainian leaders, for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week."" Hunter Biden told the New York Times this month in a statement that ""at no time have I discussed with my father the company’s business, or my board service, including my initial decision to join the board."" The post said Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion unless the prosecutor -- Shokin -- was fired. Biden didn’t just make a threat to withhold aid unless Shokin was sacked -- it succeeded. Biden proudly recounted the moment during an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018. Here’s the relevant portion of Biden’s remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience: ""I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team … that we should be providing for loan guarantees. … And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn’t. ... ""They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we’re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, ‘You have no authority. You’re not the president.’ … I said, call him. I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."" Shokin’s ouster came in March 2016, when he was stripped of his position by a wide margin in the legislature. There’s a strong case that Hunter Biden’s position with the company had nothing to do with Biden’s position on Shokin’s ouster. That’s because Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin’s removal, arguing that he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively.  For instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that ""it’s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue"" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate. Steven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that ""virtually everyone"" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine ""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office."" Anders Åslund, a resident senior fellow at Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread Shokin ""failed to prosecute anybody of significance, protecting both the Yanukovych circle and the Poroshenko group,"" Åslund said. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, tweeted earlier this month that Shokin’s firing was not about protecting the company Hunter Biden was working for. The firing ""was obviously not because the prosecutor wanted to investigate Burisma & Zlochevsky,"" she wrote. Meanwhile, accounts differ on whether Shokin was poised to prosecute Burisma at the time he was removed. In an interview with the Ukrainian website Strana.ua this month, Shokin said the cases were indeed active. However, Vitaliy Kasko, who had been Shokin’s deputy overseeing international cooperation before resigning in February 2016 citing corruption in the office, produced documents to Bloomberg that under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma had been dormant. ""There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,"" Kasko told Bloomberg. ""It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015."" We found wide agreement among Ukraine policy experts that Hunter Biden’s decision to become a director for Burisma presented a serious conflict of interest. ""It’s not a crime, but it is a lapse. It’s troubling,"" said Lincoln A. Mitchell, an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University’s Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies who has written about governance in the former Soviet Union. Pifer, who expressed reservations about the arrangement to the New York Times in 2015, said subsequent developments have only confirmed those concerns. ""It was a mistake for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma board, particularly given that the vice president was the senior U.S. official engaging Ukraine,"" Pifer said. ""Hunter Biden should have been more mindful of his father's position."" And Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin professor who previously headed the university’s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia, said Hunter Biden’s hiring echoes the strategy common within Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, in which powerful interests try to secure influence on foreign policy by leveraging family members and associates of key leaders. ""Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,"" Herrera said. ""Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father."" The viral image said that when Hunter Biden was serving as ""a director to Ukraine’s largest private gas producer,"" his father ""threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn’t fire a prosecutor looking into"" the gas company. The image gets individual pieces of this assertion right -- Hunter Biden was a director of the company, and Joe Biden did leverage U.S. aid to fire a prosecutor. But it overreaches by assuming that Joe Biden acted to protect the company his son was affiliated with. In reality, there was widespread agreement in the West that the existing prosecutor had to go, and it’s not clear that the company would have benefited from his ouster anyway, given evidence that its cases had long been dormant. That said, experts criticize the Bidens for their arrangement, saying it could have been a significant conflict of interest. We rate the statement Half True.

No, this photo does not show a young girl being sold to Muslims as a child bride
","A picture is worth a thousand words, and one photo of a young girl crying with a man’s arm around her shoulder and an ISIS flag in the background is provoking a lot of words — and assumptions — on social media. But the image, now turned into a meme, is spreading an inaccurate message about what’s really going on. On social media, text above and below the photo says, ""To all you misguided, uninformed liberal ‘women’ demonstrating in favor of embracing Islam.

A reverse-image search led us to a 2014 report on the contest by Morocco World News, which explains that the girl began to cry during the event after she made mistakes during her recitation: ""The video shows the ISIS member, who was misleadingly presented as the young girl’s groom, having a small chat with her before she recites verses of the Quran. Feeling embarrassed for making several mistakes during her recitation, Ghada, the young girl, starts crying before the man returns. He then clearly tries to comfort her and boost her spirits."" AFP Canada (along with other fact-checking websites) also evaluated the miscaptioned photo, and an Arabic-speaking AFP journalist confirmed from the video that the girl is reciting chapter 112 of the Quran. ""She made some errors so the man helps her, and he says, ‘Ma sha Allah (Bravo), can you give me two other chapters?’"" the AFP journalist is quoted saying in the story. ""She recites the chapter 113 and the man asks the crowd, ‘Who is the winner?’ Apparently the girl wasn’t happy after the crowd's answer, so she started to cry."" We could find no other account in which the girl was reported to be a child bride or a Christian who just witnessed her father being ""beheaded and her mother raped."" We know that child marriage is a serious global issue affecting the lives of one in every five girls who is married or in a union before age 19, according to the United Nations Population Fund.

No, Valerie Jarrett never said she seeks to ‘change America to be a more Islamic country’
","An old rumor targeting a former senior official from the Obama administration has reappeared on social media. A post on Facebook claims that Valerie Jarrett, who served as the senior White House advisor to President Barack Obama, once made a statement about being ""Iranian by birth"" and declared that she seeks to ""change America to be a more Islamic country."" The claim asserts she said this during her time as an undergraduate student at Stanford University in the late 1970s. The spurious quote, in full, reads: ""I am Iranian by birth and of my Islamic faith. I am also an American citizen and I seek to change America to be a more Islamic country … My faith guides me and I feel like it’s going well in transition of using freedom of religion in America against itself. - Valerie Jarrett Stanford University 1977."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, there is no record of Jarrett ever saying this, and no mention of the quote from any media organization over the last 40 years.The complete lack of scrutiny of such an inflammatory statement coming from someone who held a high-profile position in the White House for years suggests the quote is fabricated. Next,  Jarrett was indeed born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1956. But she was born to American parents, Dr. James and Barbara Bowman. The family lived in the country for about six years because Jarrett’s father became chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital. The family then moved to London for about a year before Bowman accepted a position at the University of Chicago in 1962, when Jarrett was five years old. Finally, we found no evidence that Jarrett is or has ever been Muslim. As well, the name ""Valerie Jarrett"" is misplaced, since Valerie Jarrett did not yet exist in 1977. At the time, she went by her maiden name, Bowman. She married William Jarrett in 1983. Stanford University spokesperson Ernest Miranda also told PolitiFact the quote is fabricated. ""We reviewed both the 1977 and 1978 Quad yearbooks (Valerie Bowman is in the ’78 edition),"" Miranda wrote in an email, ""and neither contains any student quotes."" An old rumor claims former White House senior adviser to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett, said in the ’70s that she is an ""Iranian by birth"" and seeks to ""change America to be a more Islamic country."" No record or evidence can be found of Jarrett ever saying this and no media organization has ever reported on the brazen statement. Also, Jarrett has never identified as Muslim in all her years in the public and private sphere. While she was born in Iran, her parents are American, and she has lived in the U.S. since she was five years old. We rate this Pants on Fire! Update, May 8, 2019: This story has been updated to include a statement from a Stanford University spokesperson verifying the absence of this quote in university yearbooks.

No, these photos of Neil Armstrong’s space boots and a footprint don’t disprove the moon landing
","Nearly 50 years have passed since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and yet conspiracy theories that the moon landing was fake seem to be timeless. ""Am I missing something?"" reads the text of an April 23 Facebook post showing a photo of the bottom of ""Neil Armstrongs (sic) Space Boots"" and another photo of ""Neil Armstongs (sic) footprint."" The boots look relatively smooth while the footprint has a tread—they don’t match. But this post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) What the theory fails to take into account are the so-called ""lunar overshoes"" the astronauts wore when they actually rested their feet on the moon’s surface. These overshoes are what left the footprint that is being scrutinized in this post. First, let’s look at the photo of the footprint. Apollo 11 carried cameras for collection data and recording the moon landing mission. The photo of the footprint in question was taken by astronaut Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong. And, according to a series of images on the Lunar and Planetary Institute’s website, it’s a photo of Aldrin’s own footprint, not Armstrong’s. The institute, perhaps aware of this particular conspiracy theory, also draws readers’ attention to another image of Aldrin descending onto the moon. The soles of Aldrin’s boots and the footprint match. Armstrong left a similar footprint with the same kind of tread. That’s because while the photo of his space suit is authentic (you can see lots of images of it here, including the soles of his shoes)  both Armstrong and Aldrin wore these lunar overshoes that were left behind. According to a 2017 Forbes story, Armstrong and Aldrin abandoned about 100 tools, gear and pieces of trash on the moon’s surface. ""NASA wanted the mission to bring back as many samples of lunar rocks and dust as possible,"" the story says, ""which meant the crew needed to leave behind everything they didn’t actually need for the trip back to earth."" Moon landing conspiracy theories endure, but so do the first footprints on the moon’s surface. There’s no wind to blow them away, according to NASA, and they’ll be there for a million years.

No, NYC isn’t banning the sale of hot dogs to stop climate change
","First New York City came for your jumbo-sized sodas. Now does the local government have its sights set hot dogs? ""New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio is now banning hot dog sales to stop climate change!"" reads an April 27 Facebook post, misspelling de Blasio’s name. ""You can’t make this stuff up!"" it says. Actually, you can. Let’s look at how the sausage is made. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because the city plans to phase out its purchase of processed meat, not put hot dog carts out of business. On Earth Day, April 22, the city unveiled its Green New Deal. Not to be confused with the federal legislation that was proposed by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and bears the same name, New York City’s plan aims to reduce approximately 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. One way it seeks to accomplish that goal is by reducing ""carbon intensive consumption."" ""The city will end unnecessary purchases of single-use plastic foodware, phase out the purchase of processed meat, reduce the purchase of beef by 50% and commit to a carbon neutral city fleet by 2040,"" says an outline of the plan on the city’s website. So, the city is instituting rules for what the city government purchases and sells. It doesn’t propose an end to New York’s famous hot dog street vending scene. In fact, the report doesn’t even mention hot dogs and the city isn’t prohibiting citizens or businesses from buying processed meat. But readers can be forgiven for thinking so after some news headlines like this one: ""NYC to ban hot dogs and processed meats to improve climate."" That’s misleading, but the Facebook post goes a step further and says the city is banning the sale of hot dogs, which isn’t true. And the city’s effort to phase out its own purchases of processed meat isn’t just about the climate. It is also about health. According to ""A Livable Climate,"" an April report that lays out New York City’s plans to become carbon neutral, there are two mentions of processed meat. Both are in a section about adopting ""more sustainable consumption practices in city government operations."" ""The city will shift away from goods that have an outsized impact on the environment and identify opportunities to reduce waste and cut (greenhouse gas) emissions throughout city government,"" the report says. ""Through updates to our Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) and executive action, we are ending the purchasing of unnecessary single-use plastic foodware, reducing the purchasing of beef, and phasing out the purchasing of processed meat."" The second reference is about health: ""Processed meat consumption is linked with increased risk of cancer and is often high in saturated fat and sodium which is linked with heart disease. This policy would offer health benefits to the most vulnerable New Yorkers."" In another April report—""Healthy Lives,"" about reducing inequities in health—processed meat is mentioned again under a section called ""expand health food choices."" The report says: ""The city will also update the NYC Food Standards to phase out purchases of processed meat, which has been linked with increased risk of cancer and is often high in saturated fat and sodium which is linked to heart disease. Processed meat will be replaced by healthier proteins, including an increase in plant-based options."" The city’s 11 public hospitals have started offering such options, the report says, and starting next school year all schools will serve vegetarian meals on Mondays (aka ""Meatless Mondays""). Our ruling New York City plans to phase out its purchase of processed meat—like hot dogs—as part of its efforts to confront the climate crisis and improve health inequities among residents. But that decision is limited to the government’s purchases, which means that while you might not be able to buy a hot dog at a public hospital cafeteria, feel free to stock up at the grocery store or get a link at any other private business that sells them.   We rate this Facebook post False.","[('Facebook post, April 27, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/patriotsmerica/photos/a.225596454935943/438225810339672/?type=3&theater'), ('The New York Times, ""New York’s ban on big soda is rejected by final court,"" June 26, 2014', 'No link'), ('OneNYC 2050, visited May 3, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/patriotsmerica/photos/a.225596454935943/438225810339672/?type=3&theater'), ('OneNYC 2050: A Livable Climate, April 2019', 'No link'), ('OneNYC 2050: Healthier Lives, April 2019', 'https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/#main-content'), ('New York City website, ""Action on global warming: NYC’s Green New Deal,"" April 22, 2019', 'No link'), ('106.7 Lite FM, ""NYC to ban hot dogs and processed meats to improve climate,"" April 23, 2019', 'https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/G_OneNYC_2050_Interior_r5_v3_ALivableClimate_190422_web.pdf')]",/factchecks/2019/may/07/viral-image/no-nyc-isnt-banning-sale-hot-dogs-stop-climate-cha/

Bernie Sanders says 1 out of 5 can't afford prescription drugs
","In his press to deliver Medicare for All, Bernie Sanders says the core problem with health care is that it produces enormous profits for insurance and drug companies. ""Last year the top 10 drug companies, for example, made $69 billion in profit,"" Sanders told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin April 30, ""while one out of five Americans cannot afford the cost of prescription drugs when doctors prescribe medicine to them."" The Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate often brings up the unaffordability of drugs, and the one-in-five stat he used in his exchange with Baldwin was virtually identical to his words during his CNN town hall event a few days earlier. As part of our ongoing effort to check health care talking points in the presidential election, we took a closer look at whether one out of five people can’t afford their prescription drugs. • The most reliable data show that about 10% of people say the cost of drugs imposes a significant hardship. • About 20% to 30% say that due to cost, they didn’t take a drug as the doctor recommended. • About one out of three people use some strategy to reduce prescription drug costs, which includes asking their doctor for a cheaper drug. Not all surveys are created equal. One of the most reliable is the government’s National Health Interview Survey. It reaches about 25,000 households and in 2017 it asked them how they tried to reduce the cost of their prescription drugs. About 11% said they did not take medications as prescribed. That could include not filling a prescription or stretching out one they had by not taking as much of the drug as they should. If that’s the measure of affordability, then about one out of 10, not one out of five, can’t afford their medications. But the survey revealed other strategies to cut costs that push the fraction higher. About 5% said they use alternative therapies, and nearly 20% said they ask their doctor for a cheaper drug. Another well-regarded survey confirms the government results, and adds a few wrinkles that make it harder to draw simple conclusions. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable source of neutral health policy data, reported in February that 9% of respondents said it was very difficult to afford the cost of their prescription drugs. But another 15% said it was difficult. This is based on prescription drug users. Out of all adults, 6% say it’s very difficult and 9% say it’s somewhat difficult to afford their medications. These results highlight the ambiguities in Sanders’s statement. There’s no precise point where a drug becomes unaffordable. ""While having difficulty paying for medicine isn’t the same as not being able to afford it at all, it can be closely related and can lead to cost-related nonadherence — not taking the drugs as prescribed,"" Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, told us. ""In some cases, this can be worse for people than not taking the drugs at all."" Dusetzina, and Sanders’ policy team, pointed to another part of the Kaiser survey that asked if people had not filled a prescription because of the cost. Nearly 20% answered, yes. Another 12% said they had skipped a dose or cut their pills in half. ""It is very hard to define affordability, especially for drugs,"" said University of Pittsburgh pharmacy professor Inmaculada Hernandez. ""They are very important goods since they can save lives, so people may forgo use of other services or products to afford them."" Hernandez said that if people scrimp on basics such as food or clothing to pay for their drugs, that basically says that affordability is a significant problem. On the other hand, the Kaiser survey data suggests that people might not see every prescription as vital to their health. Out of those who didn’t take a prescription as recommended, two thirds said their condition did not get worse. The third survey comes from Gallup, which produced a report on behalf of West Health, a group focused on lowering health care costs for seniors. Gallup found that about 20% of people said that at some point in the past year, they had been ""unable to pay for medicine or drugs"" because they ""didn’t have enough money to pay for them."" Looking at that and the Kaiser data, Stanford University health policy professor Michelle Mello said nearly 30% of people don’t take a prescription drug as recommended due to cost. She said, ""Sanders's estimate is on the low side."" Sanders said that one out of five people can’t afford their prescription drugs. There is some evidence for this. About 20% of people in a Kaiser survey said they had not filled a prescription because of the cost, and another 12% said they took less than the prescription called for. But affordability is hard to measure. Only about 10 percent said it was very difficult to pay for their medications. Another 15% said it was difficult. These are subjective terms, and neither says that people went entirely without their medications. The experts we reached said affordability is a significant issue. The survey data don’t precisely match up with Sanders’s words, but they support the idea that many people are pressed to pay for their medications. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('CNN, Newsroom with Brooke Baldwin, April 30, 2019', 'https://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1904/22/se.03.html'), ('CNN, Town hall with Bernie Sanders, April 22, 2019', 'No link'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Strategies Used by Adults Aged 18–64 to Reduce Their Prescription Drug Costs, 2017, March 2019', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db333.htm'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Health tracking poll, February 2019', 'No link'), ('West Health/Gallup, The U.S. healthcare cost crisis, 2019', 'http://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-KFF-Health-Tracking-Poll-February-2019#page=21'), ('Email interview, Josh Orton, policy adviser, Sanders for President, May 3, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Stacie Dusetzina, associate professor of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University, May 4, 2019', 'https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_SHprWWMwNWFNTXdtb1FjVmQyMEFwLTdiTkkw'), ('Email interview, Inmaculada Hernandez, assistant professor, University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, May 3, 2019', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/may/06/bernie-sanders/sanders-1-out-5-cant-afford-prescription-drugs/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden claims he was a staunch liberal in the Senate. He wasn’t
","Joe Biden is pushing back against the perception that he’s not progressive enough for today’s Democratic Party. Long seen as his Achilles’ heel in this Democratic primary, Biden’s 35-year Senate voting record reveals a history of breaking with liberal orthodoxy on a variety of issues, from his vote to authorize the Iraq War to his backing of measures that led to mass incarceration. Biden, in a recent interview, sought to turn the narrative on its head by claiming progressive credentials. ""I was always labeled as one of the most liberal members of the United States Congress,"" the former Delaware senator told ABC News in an interview that aired May 1. After a review of sources that grade lawmakers based on ideology, we found Biden’s claim to be inaccurate. By a variety of measures, Biden’s record has been that of a moderate Democrat. We examined several different ideology ratings to assess Biden’s claim. One of the most widely cited among academics is the Voteview database, which is maintained by UCLA. Voteview derives lawmakers’ ideological grades from roll call votes. (Read their full methodology here.) Below is how Voteview ranks Biden from 1973 through 2008: The purple line shows how liberal Biden was compared to the full Senate, while the blue line shows how he measured up among Senate Democrats. (In the chart below, the most liberal senator would be rated 100 percent and the least liberal senator would be rated zero.) Biden was on average more liberal than about 75% of the Senate overall. Among Democrats, he was in the middle of the pack. On average, he stood at almost exactly his party’s center line.  By either measure, it’s misleading for Biden to claim he was always labeled one of the most liberal members. ""I think it’s fair to say that Voteview does not, and has not, so labeled him,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a political science professor at UCLA who runs the database. Some years saw Biden align more closely with progressive members of his party than others. His first noteworthy break came early in his Senate career, when he opposed busing as a means to racially desegregate schools.   ""Biden, who once participated in sit-ins to desegregate restaurants along U.S. Route 40, startled his colleagues in 1975 when he broke liberal ranks to win Senate approval of an anti-busing amendment,"" reads a profile of Biden from Congressional Quarterly. ""Suddenly, he was allied with Southern conservatives on an emotional national issue."" Biden’s position may have helped him get re-elected in 1978. As his campaign was underway, a controversial busing plan was taking effect in New Castle County, Del., ""outraging voters in the white suburbs,"" according to CQ. ""With this anti-busing position offsetting his liberalism on some other social issues, Biden seemed unbeatable in 1978,"" his CQ profile states. It notes that his opponent was unsuccessful in painting Biden as ""too far left for the state."" Nevertheless, Biden’s first taste of disunity with liberal Democrats seemed hard for the young senator to swallow.   ""It is not a comfortable feeling for me,"" Biden said at the time, according to CQ. ""I mean, I’ve never been there before.""  But it would not the last time he broke with Democratic ranks. As we’ve noted, recent progressive attacks on Biden’s record have some merit. Biden’s image as someone willing to buck his party’s liberal wing on social issues was cemented by the early 1980s. ""On cultural issues, he often does not support positions associated with liberal Democrats,"" read a profile of Biden in the 1984 issue of the National Journal’s Almanac of American Politics, considered by some to the the Bible of U.S. politics. A spokesman for the Biden campaign defended the former senator and vice president’s progressive record. ""Vice President Biden has been a force for progressive action throughout his career — from campaign finance reform to climate change to systemic racism to organized labor to marriage equality,"" said Biden aide TJ Ducklo. ""He's never been afraid to be the first to speak out, and has worked tirelessly in Congress and as vice president to write, pass and implement progressive policies into law.""   The campaign noted that shortly before leaving the Senate to become Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden notched some high marks for liberalism. He received a 94% overall liberal score in 2007 from the National Journal, and Voteview found he was more liberal than 75% of the 110th Senate. But Biden has not always been labeled one of the most liberal members — not by the National Journal or the other rating systems we looked at — which is what he’s claiming. PolitiFact located two decades’ worth of National Journal ratings and found Biden’s average liberalism score was 76%. His lowest National Journal score we found was 59% in 1997, the year Biden was one of a handful of Democrats who joined Republicans in a failed effort to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget. Biden’s position as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee during this era often found him in the crosscurrents of emotional political debates.   ""The issues that arise here — abortion, flag-burning, capital punishment, crime control — cut deeply,"" reads his profile in the Almanac. ""And for years the cultural liberals in the Democratic Party differed sharply on most of them from the constituents Biden saw in Delaware every day."" The Biden campaign’s reference to his Voteview score cited only his ranking among senators of both parties. Among Democrats in the 110th Senate, Biden was in the 51st percentile for liberalism. Another group that ranks legislators by ideology, GovTrack.us, failed to support Biden’s claim. A GovTrack.us analysis of bills that Biden sponsored and cosponsored from 2003 through 2008 shows Biden’s liberal record in Congress was not superlative. Like Voteview, GovTrack places Biden in the middle of his Senate Democratic cohort too.  Source: GovTrack.us One reason for Biden’s middling score on the ideological scale is his track record of bipartisanship. ""He seems drawn again and again to try to reconcile the economic and cultural liberalism of the national Democratic Party, of which he is one of the leaders, with the economic and cultural conservatism of so many of those he grew up with: to explain one to the other, to reconcile them, to enable them to live happily together,"" reads a 1996 profile of Biden in the Almanac of American Politics. During Biden’s time in the Senate, just over 40% of the bills he co-sponsored were introduced by Republicans, according to an analysis by Benjamin Hammer of GovTrack. In his last two years as a senator, Biden crossed the aisle more than even Amy Klobuchar, who GovTrack ranks as the most moderate of the Senate Democrats running for president in 2020, Hammer said. Josh Tauberer, who founded GovTrack, summed up his group’s findings this way: ""We rate Biden's claim as false.""   Biden said, ""I was always labeled as one of the most liberal members of the United States Congress."" A review of several databases that grade lawmakers based on ideology shows Biden has not always earned high grades for liberalism, and occasionally earned low marks. Among Senate Democrats, he was in the middle of the pack in terms of liberalism. Over his 35 years in the Senate, he showed a willingness to buck the left wing of his party and cross the partisan aisle. We rate this False.

","In February, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker made good on a campaign promise by signing into law Illinois’ first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade. His plan to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next six years — making Illinois the first state in the Midwest to do so — succeeded without a single Republican vote. Members of the state GOP argued Pritzker’s move belied a post-election promise he made to work across the aisle. Asked to reflect on the governor’s first 100 days in office during a TV appearance last week, state Sen. Dale Righter, a Mattoon Republican, said the plan Pritzker backed would cost Illinois jobs. ""The last time Illinois raised the minimum wage in 2006, the very next year this state lost 50,000 jobs,"" Righter said. ""The prediction this time is, we’ll lose 90,000 jobs."" Did Righter have his numbers straight? We decided to check. The first beat of Righter’s claim deals with the immediate impact of legislation signed into law in late 2006 that raised the state’s minimum wage by a dollar in July 2007, followed by a series of smaller increases that topped out at $8.25 in 2010. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, show Illinois added — rather than lost — roughly 48,000 jobs overall in 2007. So we reached out to Righter’s office to see what he was referencing. A spokeswoman responded with an email saying his 50,000 figure was actually in reference to the increase in unemployment Illinois saw during that time, when the ranks of unemployed Illinoisans grew by more than 70,000. Those stats come from a different set of BLS data, which does not provide annual averages, so Righter’s spokeswoman pointed to the change in unemployment between December 2006 and December 2007. There are several problems with that comparison, however, starting with the fact that Righter when on TV referred to job loss rather than unemployment growth. The most glaring issue, though, is that the nation’s economy was already beginning to spiral by late 2007. ""We’re rapidly heading into the Great Recession,"" said Dale Belman, a Michigan State University professor who studies the effects of the minimum wage. ""If you look at every other state in the United States, including a number of those that didn’t change their minimum wage, you would find very comparable increases in the unemployment rate. It’s just a silly comparison."" Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, noted that given the mid-year effective date of the dollar increase in question, it would also make more sense to compare employment in 2007 to 2008, rather than to look at the difference between 2006 and 2007, as Righter did. That, he said, would likely show some ""recession-driven job loss."" ""This is a national phenomenon, it’s not about the Illinois minimum wage,"" Fazzari added. ""There’s basically nothing here."" What’s more, Righter left out another case study worth considering: Illinois upped its minimum wage by 35 cents in 2004 and by a dollar in 2005. And in the years that followed each of those increases, BLS data show, employment increased and unemployment declined. This suggests the connection Righter suggested between overall employment levels and Illinois’ 2006 minimum wage increase is questionable. It wasn’t entirely clear from Righter’s remarks what he was talking about when he predicted the state’s upcoming wage hike would lead to the loss of 90,000 jobs. His spokeswoman told us the figure was cited by the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business association with a history of opposing both state and federal minimum wage increases, when the group testified during a legislative committee hearing in Springfield. But she did not provide any further details, including when that testimony was given or by whom. We called up NFIB’s Illinois director, Mark Grant, who sent us an analysis the organization conducted in 2017 of a bill that would have set the state’s minimum wage on a path to $15-an-hour over the course of four years. It forecasted there would be 93,000 fewer jobs ten years after the bill would have gone into effect than if the minimum wage remained at $8.25. But that analysis was conducted on a different piece of legislation than the one Pritzker signed by what could hardly be considered an impartial source using a simulation model that, absent more detailed information, makes the validity of those results nearly impossible to assess. Righter said, ""The last time Illinois raised the minimum wage in 2006, the very next year this state lost 50,000 jobs"" and that ""the prediction this time is, we’ll lose 90,000 jobs."" Federal employment data show Righter had his facts backwards: Job numbers for 2007 rose nearly 50,000 higher than they were in 2006. A spokeswoman said Righter was actually referring to unemployment, which did increase that year. But experts noted that spike was likely due to broader economic forces at play as the nation headed into the Great Recession. What’s more, Illinois saw unemployment decline following wage hikes that took effect in 2004 and 2005. Righter’s prediction that Illinois’ upcoming wage increase will result in more job loss holds up no better. We traced it back to an analysis of a different minimum wage bill produced by a group that has historically opposed minimum wage hikes. We rate Righter’s claim False.

No, a Roman statesman did not warn about Trump thousands of years ago
","A Facebook post says a quote from Roman public speaker and statesman Cicero amounts to ""a two thousand Year Old warning about TRUMP."" The quote reads: ""A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. For the traitor appears not a traitor – He speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation – he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city – he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared."" The words, with some slightly different iterations, have been widely attributed to Cicero across the internet for some time, but we could find no evidence that he actually said or wrote it. (Additionally, he died in 43 B.C., a year before the meme claims he said the quote.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We traced the quote down to a 1965 fictional novel by Taylor Caldwell called ""A Pillar of Iron."" On page 661 of the book, it attributes the passage to a speech Cicero made in the Roman Senate in 58 B.C. as ""Recorded by Sallust."" While the novel often includes recorded speeches and letters of Cicero, it is a work of fiction, and the passage could not be located in online archives or compiled works of Cicero’s writings and addresses. Catherine Steel, professor of classics at the University of Glasgow, told PolitiFact she has not come across this quote in any of Cicero’s work. ""I'm not aware that this is translation of any work of Cicero,"" Steel wrote in an email. ""The idea of an internal threat does surface in his speeches against Catiline from 63 B.C., particularly e.g. 2.11, but there aren't any close parallels in terms of language."" Besides the quote appearing in a 1965 fictional novel, no official documentation of Cicero’s extensive writings or speeches includes anything close to the passage. We rate this False.","[('Facebook post, April 29, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2403469522997882&set=a.136928929651964&type=3&theater'), ('Britannica, Marcus Tullius Cicero, Accessed May 2, 2019', 'No link'), ('History Today, Cicero and the Power of Rhetoric, March 3, 2016', 'https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero'), ('A Pillar of Iron, 1965 novel by Taylor Caldwell', 'No link'), ('LibertyFund.org, works and writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero, Accessed May 2, 2019', 'https://www.historytoday.com/archive/cicero-and-power-rhetoric'), ('Cicero: Selected Works, translated by Michael Grant; Accessed May 2, 2019', 'No link'), ('Cicero: Selected Political Speeches, translated by Michael Grant; Accessed May 2, 2019', 'https://www.amazon.com/Pillar-Iron-Taylor-Caldwell/dp/0385053037'), (""Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician by Anthony Everitt May 6, 2003"", 'No link'), ('Email interview, Catherine Steel professor of classics at the University of Glasgow, May 3, 2019', 'https://oll.libertyfund.org/people/marcus-tullius-cicero')]",/factchecks/2019/may/03/facebook-posts/no-roman-statesman-did-not-give-warning-about-trum/

Claims Filipino journalists are trying to oust President Rodrigo Duterte lack evidence
","On April 22, the Manila Times, a newspaper in the Philippines, published a story that claimed there’s a plot to discredit the country’s president, Rodrigo Duterte, and destabilize his government. Several media organizations are identified in the alleged conspiracy, including Rappler, a news website, and VERA Files, a nonprofit fact-checking publication. According to the story in the Times, written by Dante A. Ang, ""there’s an obvious pattern of close coordination among some media organizations for the timely production of anti-Duterte stories."" Rappler and VERA Files, among others, have denied the accusation. We looked into claims they were part of such a conspiracy and found no credible evidence supporting the idea that Filipino journalists are plotting to oust the president. Let’s look at what we know. The Manila Times story If you’re not familiar with the politics of the Philippines, here’s a quick catch up: Rodrigo Duterte was elected president in 2016 after running as a tough, anti-crime candidate. He’s since waged an anti-drug campaign that has led to the deaths of thousands of people there. As local news organizations have covered the killings and drawn international attention to the Southeast Asian country, Duterte has accused journalists of lying, threatened to block the license renewal of the largest broadcast network, ABS-CBN, and said reporters are ""not exempted from assassination."" It is in that context that on April 22 the article accusing journalists of plotting against the president appeared on the Manila Times’ website. The writer, Ang, is the paper’s chairman emeritus. He’s also the special envoy for international public relations in the Philippines, a post he was appointed to by Duterte. ""The playbook is all too familiar,"" Ang writes in the story. ""Utilize the media, plant fake news, distribute them to the friendly media outlets, whet the people’s appetite, arouse anger, manipulate public emotion, touch base with the Leftist organization, enlist the support of the police and the military, then go for the ‘kill.’ That’s how coups are staged."" At the story’s center is a visual matrix that Ang says ""shows what appears to be a coordinated media campaign to discredit the president."" The matrix looks like a flow chart with lines labeled as ""links"" between parties. According to the matrix, a website called Metro Balita (metrobalita.net) is linked to someone called ""Bikoy"" and ""Bikoy"" is linked to Ellen Tordesillas, president of VERA Files. Ang writes that ""black propaganda"" from ""Bikoy"" is funneled to Tordesillas. Tordesillas then ""acts as the nexus and distributor of the materials"" to the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, Rappler and the National Union of People’s Lawyers. They then ""distribute their false narratives to their respective members."" Who is Bikoy? Bikoy is the pseudonym of a man who recently posted videos online that accused members of the Duterte family of benefiting from the illegal drug trade, according to an April 23 story in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the country’s leading newspaper. Bikoy also accused the president’s former special assistant of being involved in illegal drugs. Duterte vowed to retaliate against the people behind the videos, according to the Inquirer, and the country’s justice secretary ordered cybercrime investigators to pursue them. In the matrix in Ang’s story, Bikoy is linked to two parties: Tordesillas and Metro Balita. When we visited metrobalita.net on May 1, we received an error message saying the site’s server IP address couldn’t be found. We checked with Benjamin Decker, who studies the spread of misinformation online, and he said the site was created on March 31. The internet service provider, though, is in the Netherlands, he said. And the domain — metrobalita.net — uses a privacy hosting company to mask its true ownership.   Who are the media organizations, and what do they say?  Rappler, VERA Files and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, the media organizations named in the Manila Times story, have ""condemned the matrix as baseless,"" according to an April 24 Rappler story. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism says it has never received emails from Tordesillas of VERA Files about the Bikoy videos, nor has it posted or distributed stories or commentaries about them. For her part, Tordesillas wrote about the videos on April 5 in an article labeled ""commentary"" on VERA Files’ website. Two videos from Bikoy, who claims to be a former member of a drug syndicate, appeared on YouTube two weeks after Duterte released a list of local officials allegedly involved in drug trafficking, Tordesillas wrote. She described the videos, posted screen grabs of them and shared reactions from members of the Duterte family, but she did not post the videos themselves. Tordesillas says her involvement in the alleged plot is ""downright false."" ""It’s hilarious,"" she wrote on April 24. ""But what I find disturbing is, if this is the kind of intelligence report that the president gets and bases his actions and policies on, the country is in big trouble."" Like PolitiFact, VERA Files and Rappler have partnered with Facebook as third-party fact-checkers to fight disinformation on the social media platform. In 2017, Rappler and VERA Files qualified as signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network’s code of principles. (Disclosure: PolitiFact is operated by Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonprofit journalism training institution. PolitiFact is also a member of the International Fact-Checking Network, which is itself a business unit of Poynter.) The Filipino government protested the news organizations’ partnerships with Facebook. A presidential spokesperson said it was ""unacceptable,"" and described the fact-checkers as ""partisan"" and ""anti-administration."" The Rappler has been critical of the Duterte administration and the president has attacked its reporters before. In March, Maria Ressa, who co-founded the online news organization in 2011, as arrested on charges that she and members of Rappler violated laws concerning foreign ownership of a company. Ressa in late 2018 was one of several journalists from across the globe who were named Time magazine’s ""Person of the Year."" She is also one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in 2019. ""Her arrest is the latest move in a broader crackdown on the news media by Mr. Duterte, who has accused reporters of being ‘spies’ and ‘sons of bitches,’"" the New York Times then reported. Ressa said attacks against her turned aggressive after Rappler published a 2016 expose that outlined how Duterte supporters manipulated Facebook to build support for his leadership, the New York Times said, and Rappler has been the focus of much of Duterte’s campaign against the media. What evidence is there of a plot? The Manila Times and the office of the president did not immediately respond to emails PolitiFact sent seeking evidence that journalists are collaborating to destabilize the government. But the Manila Times’ managing editor, Felipe Salvosa II, objected to publishing Ang’s story and resigned in its wake. Salvosa, who is also a journalism professor at the University of Santo Tomas, was asked to resign after writing on Facebook that a ""diagram is by no means evidence of ‘destabilization’ or an ‘ouster plot,’"" according to a story in the Manila Times. Salvosa told ABS-CBN News, another media outlet in the Philippines, that he was planning to quit: ""I felt it was time to go after the publication of the ‘matrix’ story."" Dante Francis ""Klink"" Ang II, the Manila Times’ president and chief executive officer, said Salvosa behaved unethically, according to a story in the newspaper. He also ""vouched for the veracity of the matrix, saying Duterte’s office itself provided the information to the Manila Times."" ""The Manila Times stands by our ‘matrix’ piece, which is a story in itself,"" the article quotes Ang 2nd as saying. ""As we explained to Mr. Salvosa, our chairman emeritus had a credible source — no less than the office of the president of the Philippines. Mr. Salvosa was also informed that our chairman emeritus did his own background check, using several sources, before submitting his draft for editing. … The oust-plot story was not a PR piece. It was a legitimate news item. Dr. Ang’s appointment as special envoy has no line item or office in the government or remuneration of any kind. He was simply acting on his journalistic instincts having been given an opportunity to write a legitimate story, that was later confirmed by the palace."" In a speech on April 21, before the Manila Times published its story about the plot, Duterte said that he would release intelligent information from a foreign country that showed the extent of corruption in the media, according to the Inquirer. But he said he didn’t know where the information came from. ""It just reached my table,"" the Inquirer quotes Duterte as saying. ""But based on how it was written, I know it’s not from a Filipino. We just revised it and translated it. It wasn’t written in our language."" The story also quotes presidential palace spokesman Salvador Panelo saying that the matrix was based on ""intelligence information gathered by a foreign country"" and that it has been validated. Panelo said he received a copy of the matrix from the Office of the President, according to the Philippine Daily Inquirer on April 22: ""From the president himself. I don’t know how he got one. But it’s coming from the president. I talked to him the other day."" But a May 2 story from ABS-CBN shows the spokesman backtracking, claiming he got the matrix from an unknown source, not Duterte. ""President Duterte didn’t give anything,"" ABS-CBN quotes Panelo as saying. ""Someone sent me a matrix. I told you someone sent me a text."" When we reached out to Gemma Mendoza, who leads Rappler’s fact-checking effort, she pointed us to another story published the same day as the Manila Times’ ouster allegations. According to the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the Armed Forces of the Philippines said they haven’t monitored any specific threat to unseat Duterte. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said there was not enough basis ""for now"" for the country’s justice department to investigate the journalists and lawyers identified in the matrix, Rappler reported. ""We’ll let more facts unfold first,"" the outlet quotes Guevarra as saying. (The justice department did not respond to PolitiFact’s email about the alleged plot.) An April 23 Inquirer story notes that the Philippine National Police has no evidence of a destabilization plot though its chief, Oscar Albayalde, ""said he was not discounting the fact that there was a destabilization plot."" ""I am sure it’s not just Bikoy,"" the Inquirer quotes Albayalde as saying. ""Someone is (planning) this because everything is scripted, and I’m sure that requires a little financial … support."" An attack on free press? The media organizations named in alleged plot believe the accusations are an attack on the free press. ""A free independent and critical press is a hallmark of democracy,"" the Center for Investigative Journalism wrote, concluding its post about the alleged plot. ""A press beholden to the powers-that-be and shirks from its responsibility to fully inform the people on issues of grave public concern mocks its purpose for being."" Ressa, of Rappler, called the alleged plot ""another palace ploy to harass journalists."" On April 29, VERA Files published a story calling for an end to ""intimidation of independent media."" The presidential palace and the Manila Times ""have not come up with anything to back up their false report alleging that journalists, news organizations and a lawyers’ group were involved in an oust-Duterte plot,"" the story says. It goes on: ""The matrix story would have been laughable if it was not deliberately manufactured to muddle the mind of the public with lies and endanger the lives of the persons named in the diagram,"" the piece says. ""That it came from the highest official of the land who took his oath to preserve and defend the constitution and ‘do justices to every man’ is most disturbing and must not be tolerated."" Sheila Coronel, director of the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism at Columbia University and dean of the journalism school, helped found the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism in 1989. Her name appears in the matrix. No one at the center received messages about the Bikoy videos, as the story claims, and only Tordesillas even wrote about them, Coronel told PolitiFact. ""The matrix is part of a series of attacks on independent media,"" Coronel said. Especially insidious, she said, is the Manila Times charge that VERA Files, the center and Rappler ""received largess from various foreign sources."" ""They appear to have received massive foreign funding, which is against our Constitution, and therefore, these media outfits cannot claim objectivity,"" the original Manila Times story says. ""Their critical Duterte stories become suspect."" Coronel pointed to Facebook as an example. As we mentioned, VERA Files and and Rappler, like PolitiFact, have a partnership with Facebook and are paid to fact-check disinformation online. If a media organization receives funding from a foundation from another country, could the Philippine government then say that it’s working on behalf of a foreign government? ""We fear that’s going to be used to eventually clamp down on independent media,"" Coronel said. Imagine, she added, that Donald Trump said U.S. publications can’t receive money from philanthropic organizations — that he would shut down a news organization for taking such funding. Ronald Holmes, president of Pulse Asia Research, an organization in the Philippines that monitors political issues there, said the the Manila Times ouster claims story baselessly target ""independent investigative journalists."" More than a week after the story appeared, no independent organization has verified them. David Timberman, a political analyst with several decades of experience analyzing political and governance issues in South Asia, noted that Duterte and his supporters have been putting ""intense pressure"" on independent media. ""The president frequently cites alleged plots to overthrow him as a way to discredit and attack opposition to him,"" he said. John Gershman, a public service professor at New York University, said there’s no press conspiracy to oust Duterte: ""If, in fact, this matrix is from a foreign intelligence source, ... I would read it as a ham-handed effort by the president to silence his critics via intimidation and set them up for harassment by his allies."" This isn’t the first time the president has produced a ""matrix,"" said Ronald Mendoza, dean of the Ateneo School of Government in the Philippines. In 2016, for example, he implicated officials in a matrix that linked them to the drug trade and later apologized for including them. The government’s claims ""often lack solid evidence and appear to reflect more opinion than fact,"" Mendoza told PolitiFact. ""Many of us now fear this is a tactic to control different groups, and he has not exactly clarified where he gets his ‘intelligence’ from."" Where does that leave us? The Manila Times posted a story that alleges Filipino journalists are part of a plot to oust President Rodrigo Duterte. Yet we found no evidence for the claim other than the word of the president, who has made death threats against some reporters, and his spokesperson. But even that sourcing is weak. Duterte said he didn’t know where the information came from: ""It just reached my table."" More recently, his spokesman contradicted earlier claims that the president provided him with a copy of the matrix and now says an unknown party texted it to him. ""Unsubstantiated allegations of a plot against Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte relayed by the president himself create an immediate danger for critical journalists,"" said Steven Butler, the Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""The Duterte government needs to recognize that critical journalism is a key component of a healthy democracy, not evidence of a subversive plot.""

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum says ""90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted""
","
During an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation on Feb. 19, 2012, Rick Santorum got into a lengthy discussion of prenatal issues with host Bob Schieffer. We’re looking at two claims from that exchange; but here we’re focusing on here is that ""90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted.""
   
Let’s first look at the context of Santorum’s claim.
   
Referring to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio, Schieffer said, ""You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all.""
   
Santorum responded, ""Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted.""
   
First, let’s recap what PolitiFact Florida found when it checked a similar claim in April 2011 that came up during a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives.
   
Republican state Rep. Richard Corcoran said -- and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates publicized it on Twitter -- that ""90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted.""
       
Corcoran cited a New York Times article from 2007 that discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that ""about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion.""
   
The story did not say specifically where the statistic came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion.
       
We searched and found other studies that showed similar percentages.
       
A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. A study in San Francisco published in 2006 found an overall rate of 81 percent.
       
That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here).
       
However, in additional research for this article, we’ve found information that makes the question less cut-and-dried.

In a joint statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups cautioned against generalizing about national patterns from a series of smaller, local studies.
   
""No current, comprehensive estimate of the number of pregnancy terminations following prenatal diagnosis exists,"" the statement said. ""Several studies reporting older data, studies from single centers and studies from other countries have reflected variation in the number of pregnancies terminated. These studies are frequently cited, but given their limitations, are difficult to generalize to the current population of pregnant women in the United States. Undocumented observations from prenatal genetic counselors in the United States suggest that the rate of termination for prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome may vary across the country. New research is called for to comprehensively explore the uptake of prenatal testing and the outcomes of prenatally diagnosed pregnancies in order to more accurately define how women currently incorporate prenatal testing into their lives.""

ACOG suggested we talk to Mark I. Evans, a physician and president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. He emphasized that the percentage can vary significantly based on region and other factors.

""In liberal areas such as New York City, probably 80 to 90 percent of patients with severe abnormalties do choose to terminate when legal to do so,"" Evans said. ""In conservative areas, the proportion of terminations is much lower, perhaps as little as 10 percent"" in some cases.

We also located a paper in the journal Issues in Law & Medicine, titled ""Informed Consent or Institutionalized Eugenics? How the Medical Profession Encourages Abortion of Fetuses with Down Syndrome."" The paper cites the example of a professor and practitioner, Elizabeth Gettig, who found that ""almost 100 percent"" of women with a Down syndrome diagnosis chose to abort when she practiced in North Carolina, but the number dropped to about half when she relocated to Pittsburgh. Gettig offered several reasons for the disparity.

""First, the Pittsburgh region has a higher percentage of Catholics,"" the paper said. ""Second, there are more services than most cities in Pittsburgh to assist children who have disabilities.""
   
Our ruling
   
A number of scientific studies have shown an abortion rate from 80 percent to 90 percent -- close to what Santorum said -- but all have been localized. Since there’s evidence that the decision to abort can vary by region, we think it’s an overstatement for Santorum to say that after prenatal diagnosis, ""90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted."" There are no standardized, national numbers, so his use of the term ""in America"" is problematic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.","[(""\nRick Santorum, interview on CBS News' Face the Nation, Feb. 19, 2012"", 'https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57381060/face-the-nation-transcript-february-19-2012/?pageNum=2&tag=contentMain;contentBody'), ('\nPolitiFact Florida, ""Rep.

"['Pensions', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Chain email']","
Chain email says Gov. Scott Walker supports a move to abolish the state retirement system and reduce pensions
","
Wisconsin public employees, already feeling bruised from past battles, now fear Gov. Scott Walker is planning to strip away their guaranteed pension benefits.

A chain email that has rapidly been making the rounds among Democrats and public employees claims Walker is ""openly"" backing a move to abolish the Wisconsin Retirement System in favor of a system that will cut pensions.

The retirement system has 430,000 members, including retired and active teachers, state and municipal employees. So that’s a lot of potential interest in the topic. We have received a dozen or more requests to check it out.

Here are some of the key points from the chain email, including its tortured syntax:

""Walker is saying that after he wins the recall election, he plans to push thru the legislature a plan to abolish the state retirement system and convert everyone to 401 K which will reduce our pensions by at least a third,"" the email says.

""Tell everybody you know, included those already retired, because if Walker wins we are all in big trouble…. This is not a rumor, he is openly talking about it in Madison, it just isn't being publicized. Remember how nobody thought he would do anything to the union.""

The email is built around its own contradiction: Walker is ""openly talking about it"" yet ""it just isn’t being publicized.""

It’s just one tack taken by those claiming Walker is out to gut the pension system.

More than 32,000 people have signed a Move.On.org-sponsored online petition that opposes an alleged Walker plan to ""radically alter"" the retirement system.

And the state teachers union is organizing a March 1, 2012 meeting on what it what it termed Walker’s plan to ""seriously undermine"" retirement security. ""If you think that you are safe because you are retired, THINK AGAIN,"" says a flier from the Wisconsin Education Association Council.

The concerns did not develop out of thin air.

They date to early 2011, after Walker’s budget repair bill called for a study of the 401(k)-style concept. That study was later approved in the 2011-2012 budget.

The budget calls for a study to be completed by June 30, 2012 of ""establishing a defined contribution plan as an option for participating employees.""

""Defined contribution"" refers to a 401(k)-style concept. (A second study topic is allowing employees to opt out of making contributions).

The study comes after last year’s changes that required most public employees to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward their pension. 
Walker's administration, in response to the growing public profile of the issue, sent a letter to all WRS participants on Feb. 24, 2012 outlining the study's rationale.

How does the pension system work?

The current WRS is a modified version of a ""defined benefit"" system. It offers a guaranteed pension funded mostly from pooled investments in which risk is shared between the employer and the employees. Pension are based mainly on years of service and final salary.

In contrast, under a ""defined contribution"" system, future benefits are not guaranteed at a specific level and workers bear the investment risk in an individual account.

There’s actually precedent for this kind of system in Wisconsin: Before 1966, then-separate funds for teachers and state workers were of the defined-contribution type, according to a history done by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

Experts told the Journal Sentinel  at the time that Walker’s study, along with the governor’s ultimately successful move to eliminate of collective bargaining over pension changes, could herald an eventual conversion to a 401(k)-type plan.

But the chain email makes a different, much bolder claim: That the decision to abolish the system has already been made and, indeed, Walker is ""openly"" backing such a move.

In fact, little has been written or said about even what the study is looking at.

We asked Mike Huebsch, secretary of the state Department of Administration, if the study would look at putting future hires into a 401(k)-style plan, as Michigan did. We also asked about ""hybrid"" systems, which combine the traditional guaranteed pension with a 401(k)- type program, such as in Indiana. And we asked if the study included a purely voluntary option where employees could choose to participate in a 401(k)-type program.

Huebsch said all three approaches would be studied but ""there is no intent at this point of forcing anybody into a system they wouldn’t want to be part of.""

He said he was aware of the outcry in other states when workers were forced into a 401(k)-style plan.

""That’s why we would give them the option,"" Huebsch said.

Walker recently commented on the study in an interview with WISC-TV in Madison, saying that alternatives would be evaluated according to ""a balance of protecting hardworking taxpayers and providing whatever we might provide in a respectful and responsible way.""

Walker also said: ""Despite all the hype and rumors out there, for people in the pension system right now, I can't anticipate anything in the future that wouldn't allow them to continue in that pension system if that's what they prefer to do.""

That contradicts the idea that Walker is openly touting elimination of the system.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie reiterated that Walker would await the study to determine if any changes needed to be made. No specific options are under active consideration, he said.

Wisconsin already has a slight flavor of a defined-contribution plan, in that annual growth in retirees’ basic pension varies with state pension-fund earnings. Still, retirees are guaranteed a pension no lower than the level when they retired, unless they pick a high-risk option.

Huebsch said that far from ""abolishing"" the retirement system, the goal is to determine how the Wisconsin system can remain stable and avoid the massive shortfalls facing other states’ pension funds.

Experts say the Wisconsin pension fund is one of the healthiest in the United States, offers a relatively modest benefit and costs taxpayers less as a share of governmental spending than plans in nearly all other states.

One of the email’s most provocative suggestions is that existing employees -- and even those already retired -- would see major benefit reductions.

But legal experts say retirees almost certainly would be unaffected by any changes under discussion. Courts, they say, have consistently protected benefits already earned by retirees and current workers as a property right -- though governments are increasingly testing that principle.

In contrast, judges have blessed changes that affect new hires who have never been under an existing system.

Huebsch made clear how he viewed Wisconsin law: Changing any benefits already earned would be illegal.

Could the state leave their previously accrued pension benefits in place but change them for future earnings?

Some states, including Rhode Island, have required current employees to participate in ""hybrid"" pension plans that combine elements of both types of plans. Workers are suing over cuts in what they will receive.

Wisconsin state statute 40.19 says ""Rights exercised and benefits accrued to an employee under this chapter for service rendered shall be due as a contractual right and shall not be abrogated by any subsequent legislative act.""

But the statute also speaks of the state’s right to change benefits going forward.

The state Employee Trust Funds department, which administers the pension fund, said in a statement on its website that any changes ""could only apply to the accrual of future benefits."" That leaves open changing benefits going forward for current employees.

Our conclusion

A chain email making the rounds claims Walker is ""openly"" backing a move to abolish the state retirement system.

While a study of the system is under way, the email’s claim jumps the gun and goes way too far. We don’t yet know the study’s conclusions, and Walker’s administration says no decisions have been made on making any changes at all. What’s more, legal experts say in all likelihood any changes would have to be going forward -- and retirees have the most protection.

We rate the email’s claim False.","[('\nChain email, Subject: Walker- Retirement System, January 2012\n\nLegislative Fiscal Bureau, 2011-13 Comparative Budget Summary, language on pension study, Page 263, Section 11, August 2011\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Walker’s budget opens door to defined contribution plan,"" March 6, 2011\n\nDepartment of Employee Trust Funds, ""The WRS Study: What You Need to Know,"" Dec. 9, 2011\n\nStateline.org, ""States test whether public pension benefits can be taken away,"" August 10, 2010\n\nInterview with Robert Klausner, attorney, retirement and benefits systems, Feb. 17, 2012\n\nInterview with Rob Marchant, deputy director, Department of Employee Trust Funds, Feb. 17, 2012\n\nInterview with Art Zimmerman, fiscal analyst, Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Feb. 17, 2012\n\nInterview with Mike Huebsch, secretary of the Department of Administration, Feb. 17, 2012\n\nInterview with Keith Brainard, research director, National Association of State Retirement Administrators\n\nInterview with Shawn Smith, spokeswoman, Department of Employee Trust Funds, Feb. 16, 2012\n\nInterview with Rudy Konrad, deputy city attorney, City of Milwaukee, Feb. 17, 2012\n\nInterview with Cullen Werwie, press secretary to Gov.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims private-sector job growth in 2011 places New Jersey in the top third among the states
","
Pushing his ""New Jersey Comeback"" theme, Gov. Chris Christie returned last week to the subject of private-sector job growth as evidence of the state’s improving economic condition.

With the addition of nearly 40,000 private-sector jobs in 2011, New Jersey saw the best private-sector job growth since 2000 and ranked among the top third of states for such growth last year, according to Christie.

""Since I took office, we as a state have added nearly 60,000 private-sector jobs,"" Christie said during his Feb. 21 speech introducing the fiscal year 2013 budget. ""And 2011 was the best year of job growth since the year 2000 and places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states.""

State officials have made it clear that ""the best year of job growth since the year 2000"" refers to private-sector jobs. In a recent ruling, PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011 was the largest in 11 years.

But we were wondering whether Christie’s right that such growth ""places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states."" The short answer: not exactly.

When you compare states based on the net increase in private-sector jobs last year, Christie’s statement is accurate. But if you compare states according to the percentage increase in jobs, New Jersey isn’t performing as well as the governor makes it sound.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak argued that the net increase in jobs supports the governor’s statement, adding ""you are going out of your way to add something to the mix for the purpose of finding fault with it.""

First, let’s explain New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011.

Between December 2010 and December 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs for a 1.2 percent increase, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The December 2011 figures are preliminary.

In Christie’s fiscal year 2013 budget summary, the governor’s staff reiterates the significance of that private-sector job growth: ""The increase in private jobs was the largest in both absolute and percentage terms since 2000.""

So, the administration cited two measures -- ""absolute and percentage terms"" -- to demonstrate that New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011 was the best since 2000.

In that case, let’s see how those measures determine where New Jersey ranks nationally for private-sector job growth last year.

In terms of net jobs gained, New Jersey’s private-sector job growth stands at 12th place among the 50 states. That backs up Christie’s statement, because he said New Jersey ranks ""in the top third among all of the states.""

But in percentage terms, Christie’s claim is off. Based on the percentage increase in jobs, New Jersey ranks 31.

It’s worth noting that analyzing the net increase in jobs -- the measure that supports Christie’s statement -- typically favors big states. Ranking by percentage changes accounts for states’ different population sizes.

For a different fact-check on New Jersey’s job growth, Edward Montgomery, an economist and dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, had this to say a few weeks ago:

""If the question is which state created the most jobs you would use change in net employment. If the question is in which state is employment growing fastest you would use percentage change. Ranking states by net job creation will almost always favor big states.""

Our ruling

During his budget speech, Christie pointed to New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011, claiming that it ""places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states.""

In 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs for a 1.2 percent increase. In terms of net jobs gained, Christie is right. By that measure, New Jersey ranks in 12th place out of the 50 states.

But the 1.2 percent increase in private-sector jobs does not support the governor’s claim. By that measure, the state ranks 31.

During a Feb. 10 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation, Howell called the GOP majority ""a steamroller"" in passing legislation to ease gun control laws and strengthen voter identification requirements.

""What’s really ironic with what’s happening is it’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is to buy a gun with what they’re doing on gun control issues,"" she said.

Is it really becoming easier to buy a gun than cast a ballot in Virginia?

Howell told us her statement was a ""rhetorical slur."" She cited some of bills that have been approved by the General Assembly this year but did not offer a point-by-point comparison of the requirements to buy a gun or cast a vote.

So we looked at Virginia’s laws overseeing firearm purchases and voting. You have to be at least 18 for either activity. You have to be a state resident to vote in Virginia. But you don’t have to live in Virginia to buy a gun here.

Let’s examine the other requirements.

Identification

To register to vote, you must present a document that shows your name and address. It can be a valid photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document.

To cast a ballot, you must show identification or sign a statement -- subject to felony conviction for false information -- that you are the registered voter you represent yourself to be. This requirement is being altered by the General Assembly this year, a point we’ll address later.

To buy a gun from a licensed dealer in Virginia, you must show primary and secondary forms of identification. The primary document must be a state-issued photo ID. The secondary identification just needs to contain your current address and can be a utility bill, voter registration card, bank check or hunting or fishing license.

But in the case of private guns sales -- if you buy a firearm from an individual who is not a licensed dealer -- the identification requirements go away. 
Application 

To register to vote, you must fill out and submit an application 22 days before a general or primary election. The form can be submitted at variety of locations or by mail.

To buy a gun from a licensed dealer, you have to submit to a computerized background check run by the state police. It’s usually completed in a matter of minutes, but can take as long as four days. The background check does not apply to private gun sales, and such transactions can occur instantly.

Disqualification

You can’t vote if you are a felon and have not had your rights restored, or if you have been judged mentally incapacitated.

Many things could turn up on a background check that would bar someone from buying a gun from a licensed dealer. They include conviction or indictment on felony charges, an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor or felony, outstanding protective or restraining orders, use of illegal drugs, mental incompetency judgement, orders for mental health treatment, dishonorable discharge from military, and conviction on domestic violence charges.

In private sales, it is a felony to knowingly sell a gun to a person who would be disqualified under the instant background check. But there is no onus on a private seller to inquire about a buyer’s background, and no requirement that a purchaser disclose whether he or she is legally qualified to buy a firearm in Virginia.

What could change 
As Howell noted in her interview with Sharpton, the General Assembly has passed several bills this year affecting voting and gun purchases.

The major change in voting concerns what happens if voters don’t have identification when they show up at the polls on Election Day. Instead of signing an affidavit and having their vote counted immediately, anyone who can’t present ID would turn in a provisional ballot. Local electoral boards meet the day after the election to determine which of the votes are valid.

But this provision does not necessarily make voting tougher than buying a gun. You would have no hope of buying a gun from a licensed dealer if you did not present identification. And you still won’t need ID to buy a gun for a private dealer. So the comparison doesn’t change.

Legislators have also repealed a law limiting handgun purchases to one a month. Many exceptions have been put in the law since passed in 1993. But the repeal would not change the requirements for buying a gun in the first place, it will allow you to buy more each time you clear the hurdles.

Our ruling

Howell said it is becoming harder to vote in Virginia than buy a gun..

There are more restrictions on buying a gun from a licensed dealer than voting. The firearm purchase requires more identification. The gun buyer has to go through a background check that the voter does not. And you can be more easily disqualified from buying a gun than you can be from voting.

But there are fewer barriers to buying a gun privately than there are to voting. The private gun sale requires no wait, no identification, and no easily enforceable disqualifications.

Georgia's top court doing more with less, chief justice says
","
Hear ye, hear ye, PolitiFact Georgia readers.

Georgia’s chief justice recently gave state lawmakers some ideas to improve how the justice system works -- and we listened attentively.

They included alternatives to warehousing nonviolent drug offenders in state prison, a recommendation to explore ways to reduce the number of Georgia’s youths committing serious crime and the need for more money to help some areas of the court system as its caseload increases.

Justice Carol Hunstein talked about the caseload problem in her own court, the Georgia Supreme Court.

""Our small staff of 51 is still fewer than we had a decade ago, yet our caseload -- like that of other courts -- has grown,"" Hunstein said in an address to the Georgia Legislature.

PolitiFact Georgia was surprised to hear Hunstein say the court has fewer employees than a decade ago. We wanted to see whether the judge was right.

First, is the Georgia Supreme Court staff smaller than it was a decade ago? Court spokeswoman Jane Hansen said the court had 57 employees in 2002. The staff reductions included some layoffs in the wake of the Great Recession and a couple of employees who retired and have not been replaced. The cuts included reporters of decision, the people who help the court’s seven judges write their opinions, as well as law clerks and an administrative assistant, Hansen said.

For a while recently, the court had no one to answer the telephone and had to rely on unpaid staff to perform that duty, Hansen said.

""Our budget was cut,"" she said. ""We had cuts like other people did in the last few years.""

The current staff consists of the seven justices, two law clerks each for six of the justices (the chief justice has three clerks), an administrative assistant for each justice, eight workers in the clerk’s office, five reporters of decisions, two information technology workers, five central staff employees, the spokeswoman and a fiscal employee.

So is the high court handling more cases?

The Georgia Supreme Court processed 760 cases between Aug. 30, 2010, and Jan. 31, 2011, according to the report it sent PolitiFact Georgia. The court processed 898 cases between Aug. 30, 2011, and Jan. 31, 2012, according to another report the court sent us.

PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed three years of data from the National Center for State Courts concerning the number of cases that came to the Georgia Supreme Court. The Virginia-based National Center for State Courts was founded in 1971 to advocate for state courts.

Here are the annual totals:

In 2007: 1,877 cases.

In 2008: 1,979 cases.

In 2009: 1,979 cases.

In 2002, the Georgia Supreme Court reported a total of 1,872 cases to the NCSC.

The numbers we’ve seen show the Georgia Supreme Court does have fewer employees than it did in 2002. We’ve seen data from the court and the NCSC that show a higher caseload. Our verdict is in. We rate Justice Hunstein’s claim as True.","[('\nState of the Judiciary address, Jan. 25, 2012', 'http://www.gasupreme.us/press_releases/2012_soj.pdf'), ('\nGeorgia Supreme Court statistics', 'No link'), ('\nNational Center for State Courts caseload reports, 2007-2009\n\nTelephone interview with Georgia Supreme Court spokeswoman Jane Hansen, Jan. 30, 2012', 'http://www.gasupreme.us/statistics/')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/27/carol-hunstein/georgias-top-court-doing-more-less-chief-justice-s/
"['Jobs', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Vinehout']","
Dem candidate for Wisconsin governor says 85 percent of newly employed Wisconsin residents got jobs in other states
","
A week after announcing she would run against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in a recall election, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, claimed that most of Wisconsin’s job growth under the Republican governor has occurred in other states.

Huh?

""Did you know that the governors of our surrounding states have done a much better job of creating jobs for Wisconsinites than the governor himself?"" Vinehout told a group of Democrats on Feb. 15, 2012.

""I did a little bit of math and I compared December (2010) to December (2011) -- 21,000 new jobs were created, 18,000 of them were from the governors of other states.""

Hmmm.

That would mean 85 percent of newly employed Wisconsin residents stayed in Wisconsin, but got jobs in other states. 
 
Checking the evidence

We asked Vinehout campaign spokeswoman Jamie Rebman for backup. She provided a January 2012 news release from the state Department of Workforce Development.

Citing two figures in the release, Rebman said that between December 2010 and December 2011, 21,400 more Wisconsin residents were working, but only 3,200 more jobs had been added in the state.

Using simple subtraction, she said, that means some 18,000 newly employed Wisconsinites got their jobs in other states.

But the two figures Rebman cited come from different data sets, making them an apples-to-oranges comparison. What’s more, the news release doesn’t reference out-of-state jobs at all.

We tried to follow up with Rebman, but instead got a call back from Doug Kane, who said he was with Vinehout’s campaign and was calling to answer our questions. He reiterated that he believed Vinehout’s math was accurate. We then asked Kane about his role with the campaign and he said he is a volunteer, but has a Ph.D. in economics, does some consulting -- and is Vinehout’s husband.

Kane is also a former Democratic state representative from Illinois who later did some tax policy consulting for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.

Asking the experts

Kane didn’t offer any additional evidence, so we went to the experts -- the state Department of Workforce Development, which issued the news release Vinehout relies on, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau is the agency that actually produces the employment numbers.

Both agencies confirmed that 21,000 more Wisconsin residents were employed in December 2011 compared with a year earlier, and that Wisconsin saw a  net increase of 3,000 jobs during that time.

But they also said Vinehout’s deduction, that 18,000 of the newly employed Wisconsin residents got jobs out of state, is wrong chiefly because it mixes two numbers that measure different things and are collected differently.

1. The 21,000 more Wisconsin residents employed figure is derived from a wide survey of households that generates the unemployment rate that is frequently reported in the news. The survey covers people in all job categories, including agriculture, the self-employed and people who work more than 15 hours in a week in family-run businesses but don’t get paid.

But the survey does not determine how many of the 21,000 got jobs in Wisconsin or in other states.

2. The 3,000 new jobs in Wisconsin figure is based on a survey of employers in Wisconsin -- and it is narrower, in that it does not include farms, the self-employed or certain family-run businesses.

The survey does not determine how many of the employers’ workers live in Wisconsin or in other states.

In short, the two figures are apples and oranges -- you can’t simply subtract the smaller number from the larger to determine the number of newly employed Wisconsin residents who got jobs out of the state.

""It’s a logical conclusion people make; unfortunately, it’s an erroneous assumption to make,"" said Nelse Grundvig, a Department of Workforce Development official.

Similar miscalculations

When it comes to confusing jobs numbers, we’re in familiar territory.

State Sen. Mark Miller, D-Monona, earned a False when he misused federal figures in a claim about how many jobs have been lost under Walker. And we gave the Republican Party of Wisconsin a False for misusing two sets of numbers to claim that over half of the U.S. job growth in June 2011 came from Wisconsin.

Before we close, do we have any idea how much border hopping goes on each workday?

The Department of Workforce Development says the most recent figures -- reported by the Census Bureau and based on various sets of data -- show that in 2009, 2.53 million people lived and worked in Wisconsin; nearly 132,000 lived in Wisconsin and worked out of state; and more than 70,000 people in other states held jobs in Wisconsin.  

But those numbers are from yet another type of survey and from a different period than the one Vinehout addressed in her comments. She as much as conceded her error by removing from her campaign web site a statement that made the same claim she did to the group of Democrats.

Our rating

Vinehout said she ""did a little bit of math"" with employment figures and found that 21,000 more Wisconsin residents were working at the end of 2011 than were a year earlier, but that 18,000 of the jobs were in other states.

Government experts who compiled the figures said Vinehout is wrong because the numbers she put into her equation aren’t compatible. They said there’s no way to know how many of the 21,000 people got jobs in Wisconsin or in other states.

"['New Jersey', 'Disability', 'Health Care', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims only Texas institutionalizes more developmentally disabled people than New Jersey
","
There’s a fact of life in New Jersey that Gov. Chris Christie considers ""shameful.""

As the governor announced more funding for social services in his budget speech on Feb. 21, he told the Legislature the government needs to change that fact by providing better care to the state’s vulnerable residents.

""New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey. This is a shameful fact. We must change. It’s long overdue,"" he said.

This isn’t the first time Christie made this point.

During an ""Ask the Governor"" segment in January on New Jersey 101.5 FM, Christie said: ""one of the sins in New Jersey is that we have more developmentally disabled folks institutionalized in New Jersey than any state other than Texas. And it's just obscene.""

Christie is on the mark by the number of people with developmental disabilities in large, state-operated institutions. But when measured as a rate of the general population, his comment needs some clarification.

Michael Drewniak, the governor’s spokesman, cited a report from the State of the States in Developmental Disabilities, a project administered by the University of Colorado. The group tracks state-level data on revenue, spending, and programmatic trends for services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Several experts said the group’s report is their primary source for data.

The report includes two measures of institutionalization: raw numbers and rates. The rates are calculated per 100,000 people in the general population.

Experts told us both measures matter. But, they said, comparing rates, rather than raw numbers, accounts for the likelihood that more populous states institutionalize more people.

Drewniak said Christie’s statement was based on the State of the States in Developmental Disabilities report from 2008, but acknowledged more recent figures have become available.

""The 2008 information (and New Jersey’s rank vis-a-vis Texas) has apparently been established in the policy lexicon/discussion here in New Jersey and, thus, has been referred to on several occasions by the Governor, including [on Feb. 21] in the budget speech.  Regardless, the data from 2011, shows NJ is still 49th in the nation,"" Drewniak said in an e-mail.

In the most recent report, New Jersey had 2,703 people living in state-operated institutions of 16 or more people. Only Texas had more people living in such institutions, at 4,899 people.

Sharon Lewis, commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said different groups may define institution in various ways. But state-operated facilities with 16 or more people is one definition.

The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities ranks states and Washington, D.C. by the number of developmentally disabled people in large, state-operated institutions as a rate per 100,000 of the state’s general population. 
By that measure, New Jersey ranks 49th, followed by Arkansas and Mississippi. Texas ranks 43rd.

State advocates for the developmentally disabled said by either measure New Jersey isn’t doing well.

""We are very much behind the rest of the country in getting people out into to the community,"" said Alison  M. Lozano, executive director of the New Jersey Council on Developmental Disabilities. ""I think it’s a poor reflection on how we provide services in this state, unfortunately.""

Our ruling

Christie said: ""New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey.""

Christie is right, according to the population of large, state-operated institutions. Only Texas has more people with developmental disabilities in such institutions than New Jersey.

However, as a rate compared to the general population, the governor is slightly off. Arkansas and Mississippi institutionalize more people with developmental disabilities than New Jersey by that measure. Texas is 43rd.

Still, experts agree that the governor’s point is on target: New Jersey lags the rest of the country in moving people with developmental disabilities out of institutions and into the community.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Religion', 'David Silverman']","
American Atheists President David Silverman says there are twice as many atheists in U.S. as Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists combined
","
David Silverman, president of American Atheists, was interviewed recently by a Washington, D.C., television station about plans for a March 24 Reason Rally on the Washington Mall.

""There are more atheists in the country right now than Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists combined and doubled,"" said Silverman. ""That's a lot of people.""

The statement piqued our interest in light of the rancorous debate over the prayer banner at Cranston High School West.

In January, a federal judge ordered the school to remove the banner, which begins ""our Heavenly Father,"" ruling that it violated Cranston West student Jessica Ahlquist’s constitutional rights and made her feel ""excluded and ostracized"" because she is an atheist. (Ahlquist is scheduled to speak at the Reason Rally.)

At a time when atheists are often reviled -- as witnessed by the crowd reaction in Cranston when some testified on the prayer banner issue -- we wondered whether the percentage of atheists is really as high as Silverman said it is.

To find out, we focused on two major national surveys.

The first was conducted in 2007 by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Among the 35,556 U.S. adults asked to identify their religious affiliation, 1.7 percent characterized themselves as Jews, 0.7 percent were Buddhist, 0.6 percent were Muslim and 0.4 percent were Hindu.

That’s a total of 3.4 percent. If you double that sum, as Silverman proposed in his claim, that's 6.8 percent.

And what percentage of the population identified itself as atheist? Just 1.6 percent.

The second was the American Religious Identification Survey from 2008, conducted by the Program on Public Values at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.

The survey of 54,461 people asked participants to identify their ""religious tradition."" A total of 1.2 percent said Jewish, 0.6 percent said Muslim and 0.9 percent said Eastern Religions, which includes Hindus, Buddhists and others.

Those percentages are rounded off. When you look at the actual numbers and do the math, you get an upper limit of 2.6 percent. Doubling that gives you 5.2 percent.

What percent of respondents in that poll call themselves atheists? Just 0.7 percent.

That's so far off, we're starting to smell a little hellfire and brimstone.

So we called Silverman. He said he's counting as atheists all people who fall into the ""None"" or ""Unaffiliated"" category when asked to state their religious preference.

His rationale: They don't believe in God. They just don't say they're atheists, either because they don't know the word or don't use it.

By his definition, that would be an inclusive group. In the Pew survey, 16.1 percent are listed as unaffiliated. In the American Religious Survey, 15.0 percent are listed as having no religion. ""And that doesn't includes the atheists who call themselves Jews, Christians and Muslims,"" he said. 
Silverman also wants to count agnostics as atheists. (Our American Heritage dictionary defines an agnostic as someone ""who believes there can be no proof of the existence of God but does not deny the possibility that God exists."")

""An agnostic is an atheist,"" Silverman insisted. ""If you don't have a belief in God, you're an atheist. It doesn't matter what you call yourself. It doesn't matter whether they like it or not, they're atheists.""

Similarly, Silverman wants the atheist category to include people who are listed as ""secular unaffiliated"" in the Pew study.

We disagree with Silverman’s reasoning.

The agnostics we know call themselves that because they don't want to be lumped into one group or another when it goes to the question of the existence of God.

And the Pew report defines the ""secular unaffiliated"" as people who say that religion is not important in their lives. That doesn't automatically mean they don't believe in a god, so we don’t think they should be lumped into the atheist category either.

Other questions in the survey, however, complicate matters somewhat.

When the American Religious survey asked people what they thought of the existence of God, 2.3 percent said ""There is no such thing.""

If you agree to add in the 4.3 percent who say, ""There is no way to know,"" the ratio rises to 6.6 percent.

When Pew asked a broader question -- ""Do you believe in God or a universal spirit?"" -- 5 percent said ""No.""  

Barry Kosmin of Trinity College in Connecticut and coauthor of the ARIS said there's an interesting distinction between people who say they are atheists and those who really don't believe in God.

""There's a difference between belonging and belief,"" he said. ""A truck driver may say God doesn't exist, but he's unlikely to give you Greek names like agnostic or atheist. That's why you see different numbers.""

""You're dealing here with a Jell-o. You see everything from 1 percent to 10 percent because a lot of them fall into the 'None' category and terms like secular, atheist, non-religious, areligious are used interchangeably,"" said Kosmin. ""In terms of atheists who have come out, [Silverman] is wrong. In terms of the number of people who have that belief, if you ask them, he's correct.""

Our ruling

Atheist David Silverman claimed that ""There are more atheists in the country right now than Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists combined and doubled.""

He wants to include not only people who define themselves as atheists, but others, such as agnostics, who have serious doubts about the existence of God.

But just as atheists don't want someone else's religious beliefs and practices foisted upon them, we believe that those who doubt the existence of a supreme power shouldn’t be lumped into the ""atheist"" category.

If Silverman had claimed that the number of Americans who don't believe in God is larger than the number of Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists in the U.S., he’d be on more solid ground.

But he didn’t. Instead, he said you could double the number of people in those religions and atheists would still outnumber them. The only way to achieve that number is to include people who may not desire -- or deserve -- to be in that category, so we rate his statement False.

Newt Gingrich says U.S. may have 'three times as much oil' as Saudi Arabia
","In a 30-minute speech that’s running on television as a campaign ad in selected primary states, Newt Gingrich suggests the United States is awash in oil.

""Turns out, we may have more oil in the United States today, given new science and new technology, than we have actually pumped worldwide since 1870,"" Gingrich says. ""We may, in fact, by one estimate, have three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia.""

However, Gingrich does not make the comparison accurately. The 2005 report by the RAND Corp., an independent think tank, is titled, ""Oil Shale Development in the United States Prospects and Policy Issues."" It focuses on oil shale -- sedimentary rocks that release petroleum-like liquids when heated. (Oil shale is different, and more technically difficult to recover, than the ""tight oil"" being aggressively extracted today in North Dakota, which requires modern drilling and recovery techniques but not heating.)

Here’s the comparison from the report that echoes what Gingrich said:

""The United States contains massive amounts of oil held in mineral deposits known as oil shale, located primarily in the states of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. The recoverable energy from these high-grade deposits may be more than 800 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent — more than triple the known oil reserves of Saudi Arabia."" (The RAND report offered a range of 500 billion barrels to 1.1 trillion barrels, of which 800 billion was roughly the midpoint estimate.)

That sounds pretty similar, but we should note a couple of important caveats.

Shale oil isn’t yet ready for the taking

In an earlier PolitiFact item on this subject, we noted a Congressional Research Service report that offered some broad principles for judging how easy or hard it is to extract natural resources.

""It is important to keep in mind that naturally occurring deposits of any material, whether it is fossil fuels, gold, or timber, comprise a broad spectrum of concentration, quality, and accessibility (geologic, technical, and cultural),"" CRS wrote. The report’s authors suggested visualizing this notion as a pyramid -- a small amount of easily recoverable resources at the top, with increasingly large deposits that are more and more difficult to extract toward the base of the pyramid.

Oil shale is somewhere toward the bottom of the pyramid, making it more susceptible to technological and cost concerns.

The RAND report’s lead author, James T. Bartis, told us it's difficult and costly to extract the oil from shale because ""the heating process is expensive, since the temperature needs to be raised to over 650 degrees Fahrenheit, as compared to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit for the Canadian tar sands,"" another non-traditional source that’s been expanding rapidly in recent years. ""At this time, no firm with the technical, management, and financial resources needed to develop this resource has stepped forward and stated that they are prepared to build a commercial production facility, though such firms, and others, are actively engaged in developing the necessary technology.""

The comparison isn’t apples to apples

The U.S. side of the comparison is based on ""potentially recoverable reserves,"" whereas the Saudi side of the comparison is based on ""proven reserves."" Those are two very different measures.

""Proven reserves,"" according to CRS, refers to estimates made with ""reasonable certainty"" to be ""commercially recoverable"" under current economic and governmental conditions. According to data from the Energy Information Adminstration, a federal agency, Saudi Arabia has 13 times the amount of proven reserves as the U.S. does. These numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt, due to imperfect estimation techniques and old or unreliable data. (Countries, for instance, have an incentive to exaggerate their holdings.) Still, at least this comparison is as close as one gets to apples to apples in the petroleum estimation business.

Assuming one uses a consistent methodology, it would also be valid to compare potentially recoverable reserves in both nations, although the numbers available are even more speculative than they are for proven reserves, especially for the Saudi side of the equation. ""I have no basis for estimating Saudi Arabia’s potentially recoverable resource base,"" Bartis said.

The estimate of potentially recoverable resources in the U.S. is also subject to some debate. CRS, for instance, said that ""the uncertainty associated with estimates of those deposits is too great to produce meaningful comparisons. … The final tally would have very little meaning considering the difficulties in estimating those resources."" Also unknown is how much of an environmental cost there would be to extraction, or how much government investment would be necessary if the industry considered it uneconomical on its own terms.

The RAND report explicitly did not factor in economics when making its estimates because shale has never been profitable, which confounds attempts to quantify how much is there. The report assumed that in time, techniques will be developed that would allow 60 percent of the embedded resource to be extracted.

Not considering economic feasibility leads some to question whether the RAND paper’s assumptions are too generous. However, the more important factor as we judge Gingrich’s comparison is that he seemed to compare potentially recoverable reserves to proven reserves -- a comparison that’s apples to oranges.

""I think it would be most accurate to compare all of our probable reserves including our oil shale and heavy oil as compared to Saudi Arabia's proven and probable reserves,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy Forum at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy.

While the RAND report did pair U.S. potentially recoverable reserves with just Saudi proven reserves -- not probable ones -- Bartis said that he and his co-authors did so simply to provide a sense of scale of how big the U.S. shale oil reservoir was -- not to make an actual comparison between how much each country had, as Gingrich did.

Bartis said he made the analogy ""to help our readers grasp the magnitude of the oil shale resources in the U.S. But that doesn’t mean that the U.S. has three times the oil"" of Saudi Arabia.

Our ruling

Gingrich said that the United States ""may, in fact, by one estimate, have three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia."" A paper, published by a respected think tank, does make a similar comparison, but it does not go so far as to suggest that the U.S. may actually have ""three times as much oil as Saudi Arabia."" The paper’s author told PolitiFact that such a leap is invalid since the comparison does not use apples-to-apples statistics.

The U.S. figure is an estimate of what may be theoretically recoverable without looking at economic viability, while the Saudi number is an estimate made with at least some consideration of the economics of recovery.

A majority of Americans are conservative, Marco Rubio says
","
EDITOR'S NOTE: An analysis of this claim by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was published on Feb. 14, 2012. After it appeared, we heard from many readers who argued that our rating of Mostly True was the wrong call. The debate centered on whether to judge Rubio on his literal statement or the underlying point. We try to balance that question in many of our rulings. Upon further discussion, and bolstered by more reporting, we have decided to change this ruling to Half True. (The original item is archived here.)

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had some fun at the expense of liberal opponents at the 2012 Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., by riffing on how he knew the majority of Americans are conservative.

""You know, somebody asked me: ‘How do you know that? How do you know Americans are majority conservative?’ Here’s why: How come liberals never admit that they are liberals? They never admit it. They’ve now come up with a new word called progressive, which I thought was an insurance company, but apparently it’s a label.""

A few minutes later, he noted that Republicans argue over who is most like Ronald Reagan. But, he added, ""the Democrats never fight about who is more like Jimmy Carter.""

Here, we wanted to focus on Rubio’s claim that the majority of Americans are conservatives.

We found three sets of reputable polls that were comprehensive and addressed voter ideology.

Before we get to those polls, we should note two important precautions about considering the data.

First, it matters how questions get asked. In this case, it particularly matters which options a pollster offers for answers to a given question.

Second, political ideology is not the same as party affiliation.These days, people split Republican and Democrat pretty evenly, with the answer ""independent"" garnering significant support. But here, we’re looking at political ideology on a liberal to conservative scale.

The Gallup poll

The Gallup poll has been regularly asking Americans about their political ideology since 1992, and it compiles the results of many polls each year and releases an annual report.

Several pollsters told us they think Gallup is the most reputable on this question because of its unusually large sample size.

For 2011, Gallup found that the largest group of Americans identify as conservative, at 40 percent. Another 35 percent identify as moderate, while 21 percent identify as liberal.

That trend has fluctuated a bit over the years, with moderates sometimes slightly outnumbering liberals. But liberals have consistently numbered much less. (See Gallup’s chart for the clear contrast.)

In Gallup’s poll, the number of conservatives has never crossed the 50 percent threshold. So even though conservative is the No. 1 answer, it commands only a plurality, not a majority.

As we noted above, Gallup found that more Americans than ever identify as political independents, at 40 percent. The Democratic Party, claiming the allegiance of 31 percent of Americans, is second, followed by Republicans, with 27 percent.

When Gallup asked people which party they lean toward, the independents split so that the country is almost evenly divided. For the year of 2011, Gallup reported that 45 percent of Americans identified as Republicans or leaned that way, while 45 percent identified as Democrats or leaned that way.

American National Election Studies data

Every four years coinciding with presidential elections, the American National Election Studies (ANES) project conducts detailed voter surveys. The project is currently a partnership between Stanford University and the University of Michigan.

Since 1972, pollsters have asked voters to place themselves along an ideological continuum. Pollsters offer seven potential political affiliations: extremely liberal; liberal; slightly liberal; moderate or middle of the road; slightly conservative; conservative; or extremely conservative. As an eighth possibility, pollsters asked, ""or haven't you thought much about this?""

In 2008, 32 percent placed themselves on the conservative side; 25 percent said they hadn’t thought much about it; 22 percent chose the liberal side; and 22 percent said they were moderate.

The Battleground Poll

Yet another longstanding poll that asks about political ideology is the POLITICO-George Washington University Battleground Poll. This poll asks voters simply if they are conservative or liberal, without offering the choice of moderate or centrist.

The bipartisan poll is conducted by Republican pollster Ed Goeas of The Tarrance Group and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake of Lake Research Partners. The pollsters have asked about ideology since 1991.

Goeas said the pollsters purposefully don’t offer moderate because it gives people a ""safe haven"" where they don’t have to think about tough political questions.

Lake said they deliberately don’t offer ""moderate"" because it becomes a default answer and is less predictive of voting behavior.

In the most recent poll, conducted in November 2011, 61 percent said they were conservative while 34 percent said liberal.

Another 2 percent volunteered the answer ""moderate,"" while 3 percent said they were unsure or didn’t know.

Pollster Ed Goeas said those results have been fairly consistent since 1991. ""I've never seen ‘conservative’ below 57 percent,"" he said. ""‘Liberal’ has always been in the 33, 34 percent range. ... I don't think I've ever seen it more than 38 percent.""

The number of people who volunteered the answer ""moderate"" has never gone above 10 percent, he said.

Other pollsters weigh in

As we were interviewing pollsters and looking for more polling data, we gathered some interesting insights.

Mark Mellman, a pollster for Democrats, said conservatives never cross the 50-percent threshold when moderate is offered as an option, and moderate always should be offered.

""Questions need to contain the range of relevant alternatives in order to be ‘valid,’"" he said via email.

""The real question is, so what?"" he added. ""Identification with these broad general terms is only loosely correlated with people’s views on any particular substantive issue … Saying more people are conservative than liberal tells us nothing about their views on taxing the wealthy, protecting Medicare, protecting the environment or any other of a host of issues.""

Robert Blendon of Harvard University, who specializes in polling on health care policy; said he prefers the Gallup poll numbers when thinking about political ideology, but added, ""I’ve never seen a poll that doesn’t show more conservatives than liberals,"" he said.

Sometimes, the conservatives and moderates may exchange first and second places, though.

Karlyn Bowman of the conservative American Enterprise Institute distills the results of many polls on similar topics. She said she thought Rubio was on the right track with his comments.  ""Ideologically, we are more conservative than liberal, and that’s consistent across the polls,"" she said.

Our ruling

Rubio said that the majority of Americans are conservative. Two of the three pollls show that while conservatives are a plurality, they are short of a majority. Rubio can't claim majority status because a significant share of the electorate identifies itself as moderate.

In the one poll that gives voters two choices -- liberal or conservative -- conservatives have consistently been the majority.

So by the two polls, he was incorrect. By one, he was correct and we find support for his underlying point that there are more conservatives than liberals. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.","[(""\nSen.

Have only 41% of Oregon adults ever been tested for HIV?
","
The Oregon House recently took up a bill that would change the way in which health care providers get consent to test patients for HIV. Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer, the House’s newest member, was one of the carriers of the legislation. She gave a moving floor speech, invoking the memory of her father who passed away from complications due to AIDS in the 1980s.

""Much has changed in the past 24 years,"" she said. ""Treatment has reduced transmission.""

Indeed, she noted, a study last year found that those who were being treated for HIV were 96 percent less likely to pass the infection on to their partners.

""The problem is that too many people still go undiagnosed,"" Keny-Guyer said. Testing rates remain stagnant. But, she said, these new guidelines could boost the numbers of those getting tested in Oregon.

""Nationally, 21 percent (of those with HIV) are undiagnosed,"" she told colleagues. ""And in Oregon, only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested.""

We thought the second figure was a little surprising, especially given that the Centers for Disease Control recommends routine screening for all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 and annual screening (at least) for ""high risk"" individuals. According to the CDC website, high risk patients include ""injection-drug users and their sex partners, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, and MSM (men who have sex with men) or heterosexual persons who themselves or whose sex partners have had more than one sex partner since their most recent HIV test."" Pregnant women are also encouraged to get screened as part of their routine prenatal tests.

The CDC doesn’t keep track of testing rates, but its website does link to Kaiser State Health Facts, a huge database supported by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

According to that website, the testing figures for Oregon are slightly lower than what Keny-Guyer reported. Less than 37 percent of Oregonians between the ages of 18 and 64 have been tested for HIV. The national average is 40 percent.

If you’re talking in the last year, the figures are even lower -- 18 percent in Oregon, 21.5 percent nationwide.

The numbers were off slightly from what Keny-Guyer reported on the House floor, so we talked to an aide in her office to see if there was another source we weren’t considering. The aide told us that the representative used numbers from the previous year (2009 rather than 2010) and forwarded us the latest statistics -- the ones we’d already found.

We wanted to do our due diligence, so we called up two additional organizations. Michael Kaplan, the executive director of Cascade AIDS project, said Kaiser’s site was the best he could come up with. ""I couldn’t give you a better statistic than they have there,"" he said.

Karynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, told us the same thing. Anything the state had, she said, would be older and less accurate.

With that, we turn to our ruling. While speaking about a bill that seeks to raise the rate of HIV testing in Oregon, Keny-Guyer told colleagues that ""only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested."" The most recent statewide number is actually a bit lower -- 37 percent. But Keny-Guyer used a correct statistic, it was just a year old. We don't consider that significant enough to downgrade our ruling. We rate the statement True.","[('\nRep.

Progress Texas says Texas will have most federal judicial vacancies of all the states this year
","
Texas will be No. 1 this year -- in federal judicial vacancies, an Austin-based group recently warned.

Progress Texas, which describes itself as a ""progressive multi-issue organization,"" said in an online post we spotted Feb. 8, 2012: ""Texas has 5 (federal) judicial vacancies today and two more opening this year – more than any other state in the union.""

The post urged supporters to contact the state’s U.S. senators and urge them to ask Senate leaders to allow confirmation votes by the body on two ""consensus nominees,"" David Campos Guaderrama and Gregg Jeffrey Costa, both nominated by President Barack Obama to fill Texas federal district judgeships.

Is Texas truly poised to lead the nation in federal judicial vacancies?

According to a Feb. 10, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news article mentioning Progress Texas, the group’s cited nominees have the backing of Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, both Republicans. And another 16 Obama judicial nominations await Senate approval, the story says, but floor votes have not been scheduled.

The article quotes Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor, saying the confirmation votes have not been set because Senate Republicans object to Obama’s January 2012 recess appointment of nominees to the National Labor Relations Board and Richard Cordray to head the Consumer National Protection Bureau.

Tobias, who has urged the Senate to act quickly on consensus choices for judgeships, told us in a telephone interview that before Obama’s presidency, the Senate routinely confirmed such nominees in batches. But Republican Senate leaders slowed confirmations of Obama consensus choices to one or two appointees every couple weeks. ""It’s just foot dragging,"" Tobias said.

We came across other takes on the Senate's confirmation pace. 
In a Feb. 14, 2012, statement, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Senate was then running 45 judicial nominees behind the body’s pace for confirming judicial nominees when George W. Bush was president.

To our inquiry, Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told us by email that the Senate confirmed 124 of Obama’s 174 judicial nominees, or 71 percent, in his first three years as president. In the comparable part of Bush’s term, she said, the Senate confirmed 169 of 215 nominees, or 79 percent. For the like period of President Bill Clinton’s tenure, the Senate signed off on 183 of 219 nominees, 84 percent, Levine said.

Levine added that both Obama and Clinton saw two Supreme Court nominees confirmed in the first three years of their presidencies -- a process that has become ""more involved and contentious,"" Levine said, since Democratic filibuster attempts during Bush’s presidency.

We asked Progress Texas to elaborate on Texas’ incipient No. 1 ranking.

Phillip Martin, the group’s research & policy director, said by email the group’s Feb. 8, 2012, press release making the vacancy claim should have said Texas stands to have the most ""emergency"" vacancies of any state. The ""accidental oversight"" on that release, he said, was not repeated in a subsequent release or on other Progress Texas web pages and communications.

Not quite: The Progress Texas web page where we'd spotted the claim -- headlined: ""CALL NOW: Make a Vote Possible"" -- still had the claim posted as of Feb. 20, 2012. After we shared that link with Martin, the language there was amended to refer to emergency vacancies. 
Separately, Levine told us that Obama has not nominated anyone to fill nearly half of the nation's so-called emergency judicial vacancies.

And why are some vacancies labeled emergencies?

We learned that the administrative office of the federal court system designates vacated district judgeships as emergencies if the associated district court has a hefty workload and/or if the vacancy has lasted a while. Each district’s ""weighted caseload"" is devised by statisticians who assign values to different types of cases. A July 1999 footnote posted on the federal courts’ website says the weights account for differences in the time required for judges to resolve various types of civil and criminal actions. ""Rather than counting each case as a single case, weights are applied based on the nature of cases. For example, cases involving a defaulted student loan are counted as 0.031 for each case and patent cases are counted as 1.9 cases. The criminal weights are applied on a per-defendant basis.""  

According to the ""Judicial Emergencies"" web page, a vacant district judgeship is an emergency if that district’s weighted caseload exceeds 600 per judgeship or if the post has been open more than 18 months and the district’s weighted caseload is between 430 to 600 per judgeship. Alternatively, a vacancy is an emergency in a court with more than one authorized judgeship and only one active judge.

Nationally in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, 509 was the average weighted caseload per federal district judgeship, up from 490 in 2010, 480 in 2008 and 472 in 2007.

The federal courts’ website showed that the five emergency Texas vacancies had weighted caseloads ranging from 725 to 806. Those vacancies were created by one judge retiring and four judges shifting to ""senior status,"" a type of semi-retirement where judges usually assume a reduced caseload.

The court system’s web pages confirmed that as of mid-February 2012, Texas had more ""emergency"" federal judicial district court vacancies than any other state. Illinois was next with three emergency vacancies.

Yet New York, which had one emergency vacancy, had the most judicial vacancies overall, eight, according to the court system’s breakdown of current openings. Pennsylvania ranked second, with six, followed by Texas and California, at five each.

The administrative office maintains another web page titled ""Future Judicial Vacancies,"" which showed 18 expected vacancies in 2012 including two in Texas. U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana is shown as retiring as of March 17, 2012, and District Judge Hilda G. Tagle of Brownsville is set to reach senior status at the end of 2012.

According to the information, New York stands to land two more vacancies this year and California is expected to end up with four additional vacancies. So, New York could have 10 vacant federal judgeships by the end of the year, California could have nine and Texas is shaping up to have seven, leaving it third among states with current or expected vacancies.

All these forecasts presume the Senate does not confirm any nominees from those states and that fresh vacancies do not change the states’ vacancy standings.

Our ruling

Progress Texas said Texas would be No. 1 in federal judicial vacancies this year. That’s not correct. Texas is now tied for third and could rank third by the end of the year, behind New York and California.

Still, Texas is and stands to continue to be No. 1 in emergency vacancies. That’s what Progress Texas says it intended to say; unfortunately, it didn’t. We rate the actual claim Mostly False.","[('\nEmails, responses to PolitiFact Texas, Beth Levine, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee press secretary to Sen.

Is Florida the No. 1 state for greyhound racing?
","
The Sunshine State has no shortage of unofficial nicknames.

Is one the Greyhound Racing State?

Animal-rights supporters and some lawmakers suggested as much during the 2012 legislative session. It cropped up in January, when Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, and Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, were garnering support for their proposal to allow dog tracks to stop racing dogs but keep their card rooms and slot machines.

People don’t flock to these tracks for the greyhounds anymore, they said.

""It’s a new Florida, and this is not what we need to be remembered for, as the largest dog-racing state in the country,"" Sachs said. ""We are soon to be No. 3 in the country as the most populous state, and our culture does not look at mandated dog racing anymore.""

It’s unlikely greyhound tracks will be able to go dog-free anytime soon. A broader expansion of casino gambling has been sidelined, and Young and Sach’s bills have been idling in committees.

Still, we wanted to know, does Florida really deserve the rep as the nation’s home for parimutuel dog racing?

We consulted the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, which lobbied in support of letting tracks keep gambling without dog-racing.

The nickname is deserved and then some, they said. No other state comes close.

""It's always been the largest,"" said Ann Church, ASPCA lobbyist.

For decades, greyhound racing was viewed as high-end, glamorous entertainment. It’s been in Florida since 1931.

""It was firmly entrenched,"" Church said. ""It was a destination event, going down to Florida and doing that.""

Racing enthusiasts say it still appeals.

""There's still a demand and love and excitement for the sport out there,"" Gary Guccione, executive director of the National Greyhound Association, told the Tampa Bay Times in 2011. ""I don't know that it's dying. Greyhound racing, in one form or another, has been around for thousands of years."" 
Today, greyhound racing exists in just seven states, including Florida: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Iowa, Texas and West Virginia.

None of those states has more than two active tracks.

But Florida? It’s home to a whopping 13 of the nation’s 22 tracks.

Locations are all over the state. There’s Derby Lane in St. Petersburg, Mardi Gras near Hollywood, the Daytona Beach Kennel Club and Poker Room, and Jefferson County Kennel Club in the rural North Florida town of Monticello.

The ASPCA numbers match up with a Florida Senate committee analysis and information from Grey2K USA, a nonprofit organization that campaigns against greyhound racing.

"['Abortion', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell's support of mandatory ultrasounds before abortions hasn't changed
","
Across the country and around the world, pundits are saying Gov. Bob McDonnell performed a career-defining flip-flop Wednesday by urging fellow Republicans in the General Assembly to ease legislation mandating ultrasounds before an abortion.

The Guardian in London called it a ""U-Turn;"" Al Sharpton on ""PoliticsNation"" called it a ""huge turn-around;"" Slate called it a ""backtrack.""  Politico wrote: ""The conservative blogosphere collectively bemoaned Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s decision to withdraw his support for legislation requiring invasive ultrasounds to be performed before abortions.""

The narrative, in many of the stories, is that McDonnell’s action will harm his chances to become the vice-presidential candidate on the Republican national ticket this year.

So we wheeled out our Flip-O-Meter to see if McDonnell really did change his position in the ultrasound controversy.

On the morning of Jan. 31, during an interview on WTOP radio, McDonnell announced his support of legislation requiring physicians, before an performing an abortion, to conduct an ultrasound and present the image of the fetus to the mother. Here’s an excerpt from his talk with broadcaster Mark Segraves:

Segraves: ""But what do you support – the idea of having a woman have to take a sonogram before getting an abortion? Is that something you would support?""

McDonnell: ""An ultrasound – yes, I actually was the original sponsor of that bill about 10 years ago, to give a woman the right to know all the information before she makes the choice.""

Segraves: ""Well, giving her the right to know and mandating a procedure are two completely different things.""

McDonnell: ""Yeah, but I think it gives full information – an ultrasound is used – it’s modern technology, the costs have been driven down, to be able to have that  information before making, what most people say is a very important, serious, life-changing decision, I think, is appropriate.""

McDonnell didn’t get into the types of ultrasounds or the details of the bill. And the legislation did not specify any type of sonogram that must be performed.

Several hours later, debate on the Senate floor cast the bill in a new light. Several Democrats,  for the first time, argued that the common ""jelly on the belly"" abdominal sonogram -- in which a wand is rubbed over a woman’s stomach -- may not be sensitive enough to render the image of a fetus in the first months of pregnancy.

In such cases, they said, the abortion law would require physicians to conduct invasive transvaginal ultrasounds -- even against a mother’s will -- to get an image.

The first news account disclosing that the bill would require transvaginal ultrasounds ran on Feb. 3. After that, the story went viral. The bill, which critics called ""state-sanctioned rape,"" earned the ridicule from Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live. More than 1,000 people protested at the state Capitol on Feb. 21.

Then, on Feb. 22, McDonnell urged the Republican-controlled General Assembly to amend the bill so that no woman would be required to have a transvaginal ultrasound.  In a written statement, the governor said he had been initially unaware that the legislation would require the invasive procedure.

""I have come to understand that the medical practice and standard of care currently guide physicians to use other procedures to find the gestational age of the child, when abdominal ultrasounds cannot do so,"" McDonnell wrote.

The House amended the bill as the governor requested. The measure is pending in the Senate.

So, is there any evidence McDonnell reversed himself on mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds before an abortion? The answer is no.

The governor, on Jan. 31, endorsed the general concept of mandating ultrasounds before abortions. Hours later, several senate Democrats revealed the legislation would require some use of transvaginal ultrasounds, even against a woman’s will. There is no record that McDonnell ever endorsed or defended mandatory use of the invasive procedure.

Did McDonnell alter his long-held support for requiring women to undergo a non-invasive, external ultrasound before an abortion? The answer, again, is no. He still backs that.

Despite all the uproar, we cannot find any change in McDonnell’s stance. We rate this No Flip.

Rick Santorum says over 40 percent of children are born out of wedlock
","
During the Feb. 22, 2012, presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Rick Santorum offered extended comments on ""the increasing number of children being born out of wedlock in America"" and ""teens who are sexually active.""

Santorum said, ""What we're seeing is a problem in our culture with respect to children being raised by children, children being raised out of wedlock, and the impact on society economically, the impact on society with respect to drug use and all -- a host of other things when children have children. … Two days ago on the front page of the New York Times, they're talking about the same thing. The bottom line is we have a problem in this country, and the family is fracturing.

""Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock. How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically? It's five times the rate of poverty in single-parent households than it is in two-parent homes. … We hear this all the time, cut spending, limit the government, everything will be fine. No, everything's not going to be fine.""

Santorum touched on a lot of issues -- and essentially sidestepped the question from moderator John King, who had reminded him that ""you told an evangelical blog, if elected, you will talk about what, quote, 'no president has talked about before -- the dangers of contraception.' Why?"" 
For this item, we’ll focus on the main statistic he offered -- that ""over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock.""

Simply put, he’s right.

According to 2009 data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 41 percent of all births were to unmarried women. The percentage has risen steadily since at least 1980, the earliest year for which data was provided in the CDC report. In 1980, it stood at 18.4 percent. By 1990, it was 28.0 percent. And by 2000 it was 33.2 percent.

""It has been increasing over the last 50 years,"" said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.

While we’re on this topic, we’ll also look at an issue that Mitt Romney brought up later in the debate -- that ""among certain ethnic groups, the vast majority born out of wedlock."" This data is also included in the CDC report.

In 2009, 17 percent of births to Asian-Pacific Islanders were out of wedlock, with non-Hispanic whites at 29 percent, 53 percent for Hispanics, 65 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans and 73 percent for non-Hispanic blacks. So Romney’s claim would be accurate at least for American Indians and non-Hispanic blacks.

Meanwhile, within age groups, unmarried births accounted for 87 percent of those to teenagers and 62 percent of births to women age 20 to 24. About 20 percent of births to women age 30 and over were to unmarried mothers.

But births to unmarried teens as a percentage of all unmarried births has declined. Unmarried teen births (those to mothers from age 15 to 19) represented 21 percent of all unmarried births, which is far lower than the rate in 1970, which was 49 percent.

Our ruling

Federal data backs up Santorum’s contention that ""over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock."" In fact, the number for 2009, the most recent available, is a record high, based on the data included in the federal report. So we rate the statement True.","[('\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Births: Final Data for 2009,"" Nov. 3, 2011', 'http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_01.pdf'), ('\nChild Trends, ""Childbearing Outside of Marriage: Estimates and Trends in the United States,"" Nov. 2011', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Tom W.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Small Business', 'Bill Pascrell']","
Bill Pascrell claims health care bills forced 62 percent of small businesses to shut down during the past five years
","
If you’re a small business owner, the cost of providing health insurance for your employees may be worse than you thought.

According to U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, medical bills have led about two-thirds of small businesses nationwide to close during the past five years.

Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that startling statistic during a Feb. 1 debate in the House over a bill repealing the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or the CLASS Act. That Act was a provision of the health care reform law enacted in 2010.

The CLASS Act was meant to create a new insurance program for individuals to pay monthly premiums and later receive a cash benefit to support their long-term care needs. But before the program was implemented, federal officials canceled it in October 2011, pointing to legal and financial concerns.

""We have to find a way to make long-term care both accessible and affordable. These problems will not simply disappear. They're not going to go away,"" Pascrell told his colleagues. ""This bill certainly does not fix these problems. The bill does not even provide an alternative. All it does is attack the progress made in the Affordable Care Act.""

Pascrell added, ""Sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills, and you stand there with no alternative whatsoever.""

That bill passed in a 267-159 vote, with Pascrell voting against it.

But PolitiFact New Jersey found it hard to believe that 62 percent of small businesses had closed during the past five years. After reaching out to Pascrell’s spokesman, we found out why: the statement’s not true.

Pascrell spokesman Paul Brubaker told us the congressman meant to say that ""62 percent of personal bankruptcies in 2007 were due to health care costs.""

""He mistakenly said ‘small businesses’ instead of ‘personal bankruptcies’ and ‘past five years’ instead of ‘five years ago,’"" Brubaker added in an email. ""Congressman Pascrell stands by his overall point that personal bankruptcies have been demonstrably connected to health care costs.""

That’s good enough for the Truth-O-Meter. But let’s explain the basis for the statistic that Pascrell was aiming for.

To back up the congressman’s point, Brubaker directed us to a report published in 2009 in The American Journal of Medicine.

Following a national study, researchers estimated in that report that illness or medical bills contributed to 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 -- a significant jump from six years earlier. Many families were under-insured, leaving them responsible for large out-of-pocket costs, while others lost their private health insurance when they became too sick to work, according to the study.

""Since 2001, the proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical problems has increased by 50%,"" according to the report. ""Nearly two thirds of all bankruptcies are now linked to illness."" 
As for small businesses, their numbers have declined in recent years, but that reduction is much less than 62 percent.

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, the number of small employers -- defined as having fewer than 500 employees -- dropped by about 4.2 percent from 6,004,056 in 2006 to 5,749,797 in 2009, which is the latest data available.

We don’t know how much medical bills contributed to that reduction, but health care costs obviously remain a significant concern for small business owners.

Our ruling

In a speech on the House floor, Pascrell claimed that ""sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills.""

But his spokesman told us the congressman made a mistake and cited the wrong statistic. Pascrell meant to say health care costs led to 62 percent of personal bankruptcies five years ago.

We rate the statement False.

Gingrich's gun rack quip about Volt shot full of holes
","Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently went gunnin’ for greenies.

Gingrich’s target is the Chevy Volt, an electric car that also can run on gas. During a recent Republican presidential campaign swing through Georgia, he revved up crowds by calling it the car that rich, liberal environmentalists think you ought to drive.

President Barack Obama would make you ditch your gas guzzler at the side of the road for the Volt, if he had his way, Gingrich warned.

""This is an administration that is deeply opposed to Americans having the right to choose the kind of car or truck they want to drive,"" the former Georgia congressman told a crowd in Cobb County on Saturday. ""And I keep trying to get across to my liberal friends: You cannot put a gun rack in a Volt.""

Slow down there, Mr. Speaker. You can’t put a gun rack in a Volt?

Is Gingrich taking us for a ride?

We realize this is not a pressing policy issue. And Gingrich was obviously trying to inject a little humor in what has been a demolition derby of a campaign.

But PolitiFact Georgia decided it was time for a little detour from our typical GOP primary coverage.

We set the Truth-O-Meter’s sights on Gingrich’s high-voltage claim.

We contacted the Gingrich campaign for a comment, but did not get a reply by the time this article went to press.

The Chevy Volt is a $40,000 electric car. The midsize sedan can travel about 35 miles on battery power alone, but if you need to go a few hundred miles farther, the gas tank kicks in.

To charge the Volt, you hook the battery to an orange cord stored under the trunk carpet. The other end plugs into an electrical outlet.

Chevy designed the Volt with so-called ""early adapters"" and green technology fans in mind, company spokesman Robert Peterson said. Owners tend to have high incomes and are concerned about the environment and U.S. energy dependence.

Chevy manufactures cargo nets, floor mats, a sunshade and an ashtray for the Volt, but nary a gun rack, Peterson said.

""It’s not something we normally consider,"" he said. He lent us a Volt for our fact check.

Car experts weren’t sure a gun rack would fit.

""You certainly CAN put a gun rack in a Volt, if you're talking about a tactical shotgun with a dash-mounted rack, as in a police cruiser,"" said Dan Neil, Pulitzer-winning car columnist and author of the ""Rumble Seat"" column in The Wall Street Journal. ""A window rack, like in pickups? No, that would be difficult.""

Gingrich took his gun rack quip on the road. He repeated it in Tulsa, Okla., on Monday before a crowd of 3,000 at Oral Roberts University.

We heard Gingrich say it again as we sat behind the wheel of a borrowed Chevy Volt, listening to the Sean Hannity radio show. We were hunting for a gun rack, and the Volt did its best to help. It started with the push of a button, and greeted us with a melody that sounded like a harp on Auto-Tune. A screen showed us the location of nearby stores.  

The Volt’s pearly center console glowed under buttons lit up in cobalt blue. We felt as if R2-D2’s younger, sexier brother was our co-pilot.  

Local gun store salesmen told us we could get a truck accessory store to customize a rack. We found a video online that showed a Volt owner rigging one up with plastic piping and plywood.

We don’t think these were what the former House speaker had in mind. PolitiFact Georgia opted to test products we could buy off the shelf. We returned to the newsroom parking lot with three gun racks and a stick as a gun stand-in.

The stick was a precaution. We didn’t want our co-workers to get the wrong idea. It was about 40 inches long, or roughly the length of a shorter shotgun.

The first contraption suspended guns on two racks behind the Volt’s seats. They hooked onto the car’s rear headrests and handily balanced the stick.

It was designed to fit two long guns.

The second used two camouflage neoprene slings to cradle up to two guns behind the car’s front seats. They fit, but not well. The slides of the Volt’s heated seats were in the way. We tied the slings’ bottom attachments to the front seat belt anchors instead.

That’s four long guns.

The third rack was designed to show off guns in the car’s rear window. The kit came with two plastic hooks with long adjustable bases. Each end was shaped like a wedge.

They fit snugly in the space between the upholstery and window, but were about 8 inches too short.

It was nothing that duct tape and PVC pipe couldn’t fix, but no self-respecting Georgian would display his guns that way. We checked online and found window racks that we think would work.

How do we rule?

Gingrich said you can’t put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt. We installed two gun racks that tote four guns combined.

Our own research shows Gingrich’s claim is a lemon. We give him a False.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b893c6f-adb9-4a69-a7f7-3eb4edc24e73","[('Newt Gingrich campaign speech, Cobb County,\xa0 Feb. 18, 2012\n\nYouTube.com, ""Chevrolet Volt Gun Rack Installation,"" Feb. 20, 2012\n\nChevrolet Volt website, accessed Feb. 21, 2012\n\nThe New York Times, The Caucus blog, ""In Georgia, Gingrich Campaigns on Guns and Gas,"" Feb. 18, 2012\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Gingrich hedges on winning Georgia, campaigns with Cain,"" Feb. 18, 2012\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Gingrich hopes Oklahoma can be fertile ground,"" Feb. 21, 2012\n\nG-LOX outdoor products website, vehicle gun racks page, accessed Feb. 21, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, Robert Peterson, spokesman, Chevrolet, Feb. 20, 2012\n\nTelephone interview, \xa0Rob Douthit, blogger, Atlanta Auto Beat, Feb. 21, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Dan Neil, author, ""Rumble Seat"" blog, Feb. 20, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK0ieX9mHr4&feature=youtube_gdata_player')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/24/newt-gingrich/gingrichs-gun-rack-quip-about-volt-shot-full-holes/
