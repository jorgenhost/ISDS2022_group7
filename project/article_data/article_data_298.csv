Donald Trump's first TV ad shows migrants 'at the southern border,' but they're actually in Morocco
","In a new television ad -- his campaign’s first -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shows footage of dozens of people swarming over a border fence. But the footage isn’t as it seems. About halfway through the ad, a narrator says of Trump, ""He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for."" Video footage shows dozens of people streaming across the border, as if they were ants fleeing an anthill.  The clear suggestion is that the footage is of the ""southern border"" between the United States and Mexico. But it’s not -- it’s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco. PolitiFact was able to trace the footage back to the Italian television network RepubblicaTV. On May 3, 2014, the network posted footage of migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. (It can also be seen posted by a YouTube user here.)  The RepubblicaTV video is time-stamped May 1, 2014. According to the description posted by the network (and using Google Translate) the video was released by the Interior Ministry in Madrid, showing an ""onslaught of hundreds of migrants to the wall that separates the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco. About 800 tried to cross the border on May 1st. Those who failed to escape the control of the Civil Guard were hanging on the barriers for six hours before being rejected."" The 2014 RepubblicaTV video resurfaced a year later, in a July 2015 YouTube post titled, ""1,000s of immigrants try to cross the border at once."" It makes no reference to the location. By the time the footage made it into Trump’s ad, both RepubblicaTV’s logo and the 2014 time stamp were no longer visible. Regardless of Trump’s imagery, the Pew Research Center noted last month that ""for the first time since the 1940s, more immigrants from Mexico are leaving the U.S. than coming into the country. The shift is due to several reasons, including slow economic recovery after the Great Recession that may have made the U.S. less attractive, as well as stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, particularly at the border."" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she did not know the source of the video included in the ad and that she doesn't speak for the video production company.  Our ruling Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over ""our southern border."" However, the footage used to support this point actually shows African migrants streaming over a border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla, more than 5,000 miles away. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C335AC0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-first-tv-ad-shows-migrants-southern-/
"['Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Missouri', 'Will  Kraus']","
Numbers don't support Will Kraus' statement on voter fraud
","For nearly a decade, Missouri Republicans have pushed to require a photo I.D. to vote. Those efforts have all fallen short — either in the General Assembly, at the governor’s desk or in the courts. In the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers will try again. Their 2016 plan is a referendum on amending the Missouri Constitution to give the Secretary of State, whose office oversees elections, the power to require that would-be voters present government-issued photo identification. Along with the amendment, lawmakers are pushing a bill that would write photo ID requirements into law. Both measures were pre-filed Dec. 1 by Sen. Will Kraus, R-Lee’s Summit. Kraus has pushed similar measures in past legislative sessions, and next year he will be on the ballot for Secretary of State. He says there are lots of things that already require a photo I.D., like driving a car or opening a bank account, and that voting should be among them. He’s also presented it as a solution to voter fraud. Speaking on the Aug. 30 episode of This Week in Missouri Politics, Kraus said: ""There’s over 16 people in the state of Missouri who have been convicted of some type of voter fraud. That shows people in the state of Missouri are trying to cheat elections."" That combination of specificity and vagueness piqued our interest. Court cases Kraus didn’t give a timeframe for his statement. When reached for comment, his campaign emailed a report from the Heritage Foundation that pointed to 17 convictions since 2005. But none of the cases involved voter impersonation, which is what voter I.D. laws are designed to combat. Instead, all 17 were convicted on false voter registrations. Registering to vote doesn’t require a photo I.D.; it can be done by mail. And Kraus’ proposed amendment only applies to ""a voter seeking to vote in person,"" according to the bill summary. So none of those 17 cases would’ve been averted by his proposals. Moreover, not every person in the Heritage report was convicted of an election offense, per se. For instance, the document highlights the case of Nonaresa Montgomery, who was accused in 2001 of registering fake voters in St. Louis before the mayoral election. Election workers realized that among the names Montgomery submitted was an alderman who had been dead for about a decade, and the fake registrations never made it onto city rolls. Six volunteer activists pleaded guilty to election violations, but Montgomery wasn’t among them. Instead, she was found guilty of perjury for lying to a grand jury about being able to track the registration cards the volunteers had given her. Voter Impersonation The Secretary of State’s office runs an elections integrity unit whose job is to monitor irregularities. Laura Swinford, who was the Secretary of State’s spokeswoman until November, said that unit hasn’t handled any cases of voter impersonation fraud. ""We don’t have reported cases of voter fraud. We just don’t,"" she said in October. ""The reality is there hasn’t been a documented case"" of voter impersonation, said Stephanie Fleming, who replaced Swinford as the Secretary of State’s spokeswoman. Swinford, who now is executive director of Progress Missouri, said the Secretary of State’s office recently encountered fraudulent signatures on petitions, but ""the reason we know that is the system is working."" Counties aren’t required to report cases of election irregularities to the Secretary of State’s office, although they typically do, so it’s difficult to definitively say zero cases of voter impersonation have occurred, she said. But it’s rare enough to conclude voter impersonation isn’t a problem in Missouri, she said. ""I can’t prove there’s no bigfoot. There’s just no bigfoot,"" she said. Our ruling Kraus said Missouri needs a voter I.D. law because there have been more than 16 cases of ""some type of voter fraud"" in Missouri. That number isn’t wrong, but it doesn’t support Kraus’ assertion that photo identification would solve the problem — or that there is a problem of people impersonating voters. Kraus’ statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696AD40>],/factchecks/2016/jan/04/will-kraus/numbers-dont-support-will-kraus-statement-voter-fr/

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick claims states where people carry guns have less crime
","President Barack Obama may be considering executive action on gun sales in his final year in the White House, but Texas’ lieutenant governor says his state shows why the country needs less gun control, not more. Texas became the 45th state to allow concealed-carry permit holders to openly tote their firearms on Jan. 1. Concealed carry has been allowed in the state since the 1990s with basically ""zero problems,"" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less,"" Patrick said Jan. 3. ""There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent. Murders are down. Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing."" Is it true that states with concealed carry have seen a 25 percent decline in crime? The evidence for such a sweeping statement, we found, is lacking. Correlation, not causation Patrick’s statement reminded us of a very similar claim by Florida state Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who said, ""In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower."" Gaetz crunched the numbers himself, comparing the rate of violent crimes (murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the 42 states that allowed open carry in 2012 with the eight states that didn’t. While his math technically checks out, experts told PolitiFact Florida that Gaetz’s statistic is meaningless, as you can’t really draw conclusions about the impact of a single law with data from a single year. But Patrick cited a ""study,"" not Gaetz’s napkin calculations. He did not get back to us by deadline, but he could be referencing one by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, and flubbing some of the details. Lott’s research — which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal but on the Crime Prevention Research Center’s website — looked at the increase in concealed-carry permits but did not discuss open carry, as Patrick mentioned on air. And the 25 percent refers to a decrease in murder rates across the nation as well as a decline in violent crime. According to the study, the number of concealed-handgun permits across the country has increased by 178 percent from 4.6 million to 12.8 million from 2007 to 2015. Meanwhile, national murder rates have fallen from 2007 to 2014 by 25 percent, from 5.6 to 4.2 homicides per 100,000. ""Overall, violent crime also fell by 25 percent over that time period,"" Lott writes, though he doesn’t give the numbers behind this rate in the study. In an interview with PolitiFact, Lott noted that the third edition of his book More Guns, Less Crime, shows that murder rates decreased 1.5 percent every year after concealed-carry legislation was passed, while robberies and rapes declined by 2 percent. Over 10 years, that comes out to about 15 to 20 percent, he said. Experts said that the study notes an ""association"" but doesn’t actually show causation between increased gun ownership and fewer murders or less crime. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, called Patrick’s claim ""ridiculous"" and pointed out another coinciding trend. ""Mass shootings have more than doubled over that time,"" said Webster. ""But I don’t make the claim that more gun carriers have led to more mass shootings."" A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Criminology directly refuted Lott’s findings (and Lott in turn criticized that research). Researchers at Texas A&M University looked at county-level crime data in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas from 1998 to 2010 — the only four states with at least a decade’s worth of data after concealed-carry legislation was passed.   While all the states saw an increase in the amount of concealed-carry permits, the crime trends varied. Rape and burglary decreased across all four states from 1998 to 2010, and murder decreased in Michigan and Texas. However, robbery, aggravated assault and larceny increased in Michigan and Pennsylvania while murder increased in Florida and Pennsylvania.   ""We found no effect of increases in (concealed-carry permits) issued in a county on changes in crime rates,"" Charles Phillips, a public health professor at Texas A&M and lead author of the study, told PolitiFact. An inconclusive theory at best The ""more guns, less crime"" theory largely stems from Lott’s highly influential and equally controversial book of the same name, which analyzed 30 years’ worth of crime data. More than a decade after its first publication, the theory continues to be the subject of heated academic and policy debate as well as numerous fact-checks. Lott contends the ""vast majority"" of research supports his work, but some researchers say he’s been discredited. Major critiques in the Stanford Law Review and by the National Research Council note that the evidence does not show a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates. ""The only real dispute is whether the benefits and the costs of these (right-to-carry) laws are a wash or whether they lead to increases in violent crime,"" said Stanford Law professor John Donohue, a vocal critic of Lott’s work. Donohue’s own influential 2014 working paper shows an increase in violent crime in 22 states. According to Donohue, much of the national decline in crime came from New York, a state that has no right-to-carry law. Webster of Johns Hopkins pointed out that permit holders are low-risk when it comes to involvement in violent crime, so it’s counter-intuitive to suggest that they’re the cause of a decline in murders. That holds true in Patrick’s home state of Texas, where concealed-carry licensees commit very few crimes, said Phillips of Texas A&M, based on his own research. ""But when convicted, they are more likely to be crimes involving violence, guns and death."" Finally, experts have pointed to a lot of theories beyond right-to-carry laws that may account for falling crime rates,including improved police technology, mass incarceration, online financial practices that keeps paper money out of homes, and extended unemployment benefits. So it's not as if the crime is falling because of loose gun restrictions alone. Our ruling Patrick said, ""There's a study showing that where states have open carry or concealed carry, but particularly open carry, the crime is down 25 percent."" It’s possible that Patrick is referencing a disputed study by gun rights advocate John Lott and getting some details wrong. Lott’s study shows a 25 percent decrease in murder and violent crime across the country from 2007 to 2014, as well as a 178 percent rise in the number of concealed-carry permits. Those two trends may be correlated, but experts say there’s no evidence showing causation. Further, gun laws may have little to nothing to do with rates of falling crime. We rate Patrick’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3A2680>],/factchecks/2016/jan/03/dan-patrick/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-claims-states-where-peopl/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul overstates missed votes for Ted Cruz but not Marco Rubio
","While most 2016 candidates have spent the past few weeks campaigning around early primary states, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has had a light schedule NBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Paul why he hasn’t hosted a public event since Dec. 16 in Nevada. Paul said he’s been attending to other responsibilities, such as spending time with his family, performing pro-bono surgeries (he’s an ophthalmologist), and hosting fundraisers — not to mention his job as a senator. Paul went after the voting records of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. ""I mean, I have a job as senator,"" Paul said Jan. 3. ""I'm one of the few of the candidates that actually shows up to vote. Both Cruz and Rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes. But I feel an obligation to the taxpayer that pays my salary."" Critics have attacked Rubio’s Senate voting record throughout the 2016 cycle, so we decided to dig in a little further and see how it compares to the records of Cruz and Paul. We found that Paul far overstated when he said Cruz and Rubio missed ""the vast majority of their votes."" The votes Paul used his busy Senate schedule as an excuse for not hosting many campaign events in the latter half of December, but there wasn’t too much going on at Capitol Hill during this time. The Senate has been in recess since Dec. 18 and won’t be back in session until Jan. 11. Paul didn’t specify a time frame, but his campaign sent over data for his, Cruz’s and Rubio’s Senate careers. We found the same data on the website GovTrack. In the chart below, we’ve counted the career absentee rate for each of the current or former senators running for president. Senator Career absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 13.3 percent (197 out of 1,482) Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 12.4 percent (124 out of 996) Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 4.0 percent (59 out of 1,482) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 3.6 percent (102 out of 2,835) Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) 9.5 percent (249 out of 2,616) Rick Santorum (R-Pa., 1995-2006 ) 1.9 percent (79 out of 4,156)   Concerning their career absentee rates, Rubio has the worst record, missing 13.3 percent of all votes. He’s followed by Cruz at 12.4 percent and Clinton at 9.5 percent. Paul and Sanders have both missed closer to 4 percent. All five are far away from the median career absentee rate for all current senators, 1.7 percent. Santorum comes close with 1.9 percent. However, no candidate has missed a ""vast majority"" of his or her votes. Another way to interpret Paul’s statement is that he is specifically referring to votes cast during the 2016 election cycle or in recent months. Here are the current senators’ records from October through December of last year, as well as for 2015 as a whole. (We chose October through December because GovTrack breaks down its data into three-month periods.) Senator Oct.-Dec 2015 votes missed (out of 67) Oct.-Dec 2015 absentee rate 2015 votes missed (out of 339) 2015 absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 39 58.2 percent 120 35.4 percent Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 20 29.8 percent 80 23.6 percent Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 14 20.9 percent 20 5.9 percent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 19 28.4 percent 28 8.3 percent Between the months of October and December, specifically, Rubio did miss a majority of his votes, skipping 39 out of 67 total votes. Notably, Rubio missed the Dec. 18 final vote on a major spending bill, while Cruz and Paul both voted against it. However, Cruz did not miss a majority of his votes in that time period. Neither Cruz nor Rubio missed a majority in 2015 overall. Paul and Sanders have had a better voting record throughout the 2016 election so far than Cruz and Rubio, but Paul’s statement inflates the gap. Our ruling Paul said ""Rubio and Cruz are missing the vast majority of their votes"" in the Senate. Paul has a point that he has a better Senate voting record than Cruz and Rubio. And over the past three months, Rubio has missed a majority of his votes, skipping out on nearly 60 percent as he campaigns for president. This doesn’t hold for Rubio’s 2015 record or his Senate career. And Cruz has not missed a majority of his votes over any of those time periods. Paul’s criticism goes too far in saying both candidates are ""missing the vast majority of their votes,"" so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097897BC0>],/factchecks/2016/jan/03/rand-paul/rand-paul-overstates-missed-votes-ted-cruz-not-mar/
"['Rhode Island', 'Public Health', '   My City Bikes']","
Advocate links R.I. obesity and bike ownership
","An  organization trying to rally support for cycling sent us a news release highlighting what it said was a ""shocking trend."" The release from My City Bikes, a website and a mobile app that promotes cycling, was headlined:  ""Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent."" So, Rhode Islanders’ are fatter because we own fewer bicycles?  The claim caught our attention and we read on in search of the senders’ sources. The release says the data on declining bicycle ownership came from a recent Johns Hopkins study that analyzed data from 1.25 billion households around the world. And the My City Bikes press release links declining bicycle ownership with rising obesity in Rhode Island. The group even created a graph charting obesity in Rhode Island and the ""global bicycle ownership rate."" The authors aren’t fazed by the fact that they don’t have any Rhode Island-specific data on bike ownership. Their release, which has a Providence dateline, goes on to state: ""While bicycle ownership has been on the decline, locally obesity rates in Rhode Island have more than doubled, from 10.1% in 1990 to 25.7% in 2012."" Yes, obesity here has increased and the My City Bikes obesity data comes from a credible source, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which gets its information from the Rhode Island Department of Health. So, part of My City Bikes statement is correct. But, what use is the ""global"" bike ownership data? Is it relevant? Has My City Bikes even cited it properly? The text of the release says that Johns Hopkins researchers identified a decline in bike ownership — from 60 percent in 1989 to 32 percent in 2012. They suggest that statistic came from the analysis of data from 1.25 billion households ""around the world."" They got that wrong. In fact, the Johns Hopkins researchers saw no significant decline when they analyzed bike ownership in those 1.25 billion households. The decline cited by My City Bikes is for 148 countries and does not include China and India.   In the United States, Olufolajimi Oke, a civil engineer and lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, said there’s been a renaissance of bicycle use in many American cities. ""Ownership globally and ownership in the U.S. are two very different things,"" Oke said. ""And one has to be very careful about assuming any correlation between ownership and other indicators of public health."" And Oke had no data on Rhode Island. We did find an analysis of Census data by the League of American Bicyclists found that the percentage of Rhode Islanders commuting to work via bicycle rose from 0.23 percent in 2005 to 0.50 percent in 2014. Those are very small numbers. There is not much else out there, says Alex Krogh-Grabbe, executive director of the Rhode Island Bicycle Coalition. So, why did My City Bikes in the headline to its press release state:  ""Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent?"" And what’s the benefit of comparing statistics on rising obesity in Rhode Island’s with statistics on bike ownership around the world? Tina Schmidt, one the authors of the news release, told us in an email: ""The answer is relevance."" ""As a local reporter you know first hand that to have a news story published a local angle is a standard prerequisite for a community based media outlet regardless of the story's merit."" Schmidt acknowledged that the ownership decline of 60 percent to 32 percent ignores China and India. But she insisted that My City Bikes’ reference to a global decline was still correct, even though the press release did not point out that the statistic excludes data from two of the world’s most populous countries. And she denied making any cause-and-effect relationship for Rhode Island. Our Ruling But she did. That’s the way the headline is cast. Sadly, obesity is on the rise, but My City Bikes has no data on bike ownership in Rhode Island and yet it names Rhode Island in its headline and datelines its release in Providence.  The claim is bogus.

"['Abortion', 'Congress', 'Texas', 'Cecile Richards']","
Cecile Richards says far more Americans support Planned Parenthood than Congress
","In a Dec. 15, 2015, interview with actress and writer Lena Dunham in Lenny Letter, Dunham’s feminist email newsletter, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards discussed testifying to Congress, running Planned Parenthood in the wake of the shooting in Colorado Springs and her experiences fighting for reproductive rights. Their conversation came as Republicans in Congress continued to seek an end to any federal aid to Planned Parenthood in the same year videos released by an anti-abortion group purported to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the use of fetal tissue in medical research. Federal funding to Planned Parenthood does not go toward abortions and is instead used to fund the organization’s other services, such as sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment, mammograms and contraceptive services. In the interview, Dunham asked Richards about changes in the politics of abortion rights over Richards’ nine years as president of Planned Parenthood. Richards, eldest daughter to Ann Richards, the late former Texas governor, replied by mentioning the partisan realignment of legislatures in 2010, which mostly benefited Republicans, and the Republican Party’s national shift to the right. ""But if you look at the people in this country,"" Richards continued, ""they are supportive of safe and legal abortion. They support Planned Parenthood. I was just looking at the recent numbers. More than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood, and only 11 percent approve of Congress."" Those numbers, Richards said, show that ""just because the politics are going one way, it’s not because that’s where the people are."" Where the people are is a pretty broad assessment. We focused on whether Richards was right about the relative popularity of Planned Parenthood and unpopularity of Congress. Congressional approval Congress hasn’t been widely admired very often. As we noted in a December 2014 story, the Gallup polling organization started inquiring into attitudes toward Congress in 1974. Its results show Congress never proving very popular, except after the 9/11 attacks, when there was a spike to 84 percent of respondents approving of the job Congress was doing. The most recent Gallup poll available at the time of Richards’ interview placed public approval of Congress at 11 percent. (After that, according to Gallup, support edged up to 13 percent.) The poll, conducted from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, 2015, asked respondents, ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?"" A whopping 86 percent disapproved, and 3 percent had no opinion. Eleven percent approval was a low point for Congress in 2015. Twenty percent approved of Congress in February 2015, and 19 percent approved in May 2015. Approval of Congress declined starting in May 2015, reaching 14 percent in August 2015 and 13 percent in October 2015, before hitting 11 percent the next month. A poll released Dec. 3, 1015, by Rasmussen Reports placed public support for Congress even lower: 9 percent of likely voters said Congress was doing a good or excellent job according to Rasmussen’s methodology, which in 2015 often returned lower favorability numbers than Gallup’s polls. Support for Planned Parenthood funding In reviewing the other end of Richards’ claim, we recognized two ways to gauge ""support"" for Planned Parenthood. Polls in 2015 inquired into U.S. attitudes about ending federal aid to the group and about general feelings about the group which, we’ve noted, provides family planning and other women’s health services, including abortions. Planned Parenthood, asked for the factual backup to Richards’ statement, pointed us to several surveys showing support for the group itself and support for its funding as well as opposition to shutting down the government rather than continuing its aid. An Oct. 14, 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin fact-check found True this September 2015 claim by Wisconsin Democrat Gwen Moore: ""60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded."" Three September 2015 surveys--similarly cited by Planned Parenthood when we made our recent inquiry--seemed to back Moore’s claim:  • A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of adults asked: ""Would you favor or oppose totally eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood for family planning and preventative health services?"" Sixty-one percent of respondents opposed eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood. • A USA Today/Suffolk University poll of likely voters asked: ""Do you think all federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be cut off: yes or no?"" Sixty-five percent said no. A similar poll conducted in December 2015 saw that number down slightly at 58 percent. • A Pew Research Center poll tied Planned Parenthood funding to a possible government shutdown in its question but got a similar result: 60 percent of adults said any federal budget agreement to avert a government shutdown would have to maintain funding for Planned Parenthood. Another survey, however, did find support for eliminating Planned Parenthood’s funding. Released Dec. 2, 2015, the poll from the Robert Morris University Polling Institute found that 53.3 percent of respondents supported defunding Planned Parenthood, and 31.5 percent opposed it. The RMU polling institute speculated in its news release that the starkly different response stemmed from the wording used in the polling question. The RMU poll asked respondents: ""Congressional Republicans favor shifting Planned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions. Would you say you support or oppose this plan?"" Other polls generally asked a version of the question, ""Do you think all federal funding to Planned Parenthood should be cut off?"" without mentioning clinics, services, or abortions. The RMU poll stood alone in finding support for defunding Planned Parenthood. Support for Planned Parenthood Survey questions asking directly about support for Planned Parenthood in itself — rather than its government backing — had positive responses, at lower numbers than the 60 percent mark. These polls all asked a version of the simple question, ""Is your opinion of Planned Parenthood favorable or unfavorable?"" An Oct. 6, 2015, poll by Rasmussen Reports, which Planned Parenthood also shared with us, found that 53 percent of likely voters had a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, with a margin of error of 3 percent. A Bloomberg National Poll in November 2015 got 50 percent favorability for the organization, with the same margin of error. A Sept. 28, 2015, poll from Quinnipiac University delivered lower numbers: it found that 44 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, compared with 39 percent unfavorable, with a 2.5 percent margin of error. The lowest favorability ratings came from a September 2015 CBS News/New York Times poll, which found 40 percent in favor and 27 percent not in favor. Thirty-one percent in that poll said they did not know enough to answer the question. 
By email, Planned Parenthood media relations assistant Claire Barnes pointed to an Aug. 5, 2015, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that put Planned Parenthood’s favorability ratings in context. The poll found Planned Parenthood’s 45 percent favorability rating was higher than favorability ratings for the NRA, the Supreme Court, Bernie Sanders, President Barack Obama and several Republican presidential candidates included in the survey. Our ruling Richards said that more than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood, and only 11 percent approve of Congress. Richards had a bead on Congress, which was wallowing in 11-percent approval territory in November 2015. In addition, most polls suggested more than 60 percent of Americans opposed the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood. Still, there’s clarification missing. While more people look favorably on Planned Parenthood than not, polls indicated, that was the opinion of 40 percent to 53 percent of Americans--not more than 60 percent. We rate Richards’ statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Is Guantanamo a 'key component' of terrorist propaganda?
","Supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, including President Barack Obama, often refer to the military prison’s existence as a major recruitment tool for terrorist groups. The theory is that terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) can rally potential followers by highlighting alleged human rights abuses against suspected terrorists held at the prison. But Weekly Standard senior editor Stephen Hayes said this is flat-out wrong. Guantanamo has ""never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda, and yet the president is insisting on moving forward and closing it,"" Hayes said on Fox News Sunday Dec. 27. We decided to get to the bottom of this question. When we reached out to Hayes, he said there’s no question that Guantanamo features in some terrorist propaganda, but he emphasized that it’s not a ""key component.""

Scant mentions Hayes pointed us in the direction of Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert in counterterrorism. ""Guantanamo plays an insignificant role in the jihadis' propaganda"" Joscelyn told PunditFact. ""It is rarely mentioned."" Joscelyn’s conclusion is based on statistical analyses of keywords used in ISIS and al-Qaida propaganda, which he has followed closely for the past decade. Over the years, he has amassed a database of messages, videos, transcripts of audio statements and publications produced in multiple languages, predominantly Arabic. For example, Joscelyn found just four mentions of Guantanamo out of 12 issues — or more than 700 pages in English — of ISIS’ monthly magazine, Dabiq. Not one article included Guantanamo as a main theme. None of the four mentions were in a recruitment context; one was in a footnote. Other topics dominate, such as the fight against the ""Zionist-Crusaders,"" establishing the caliphate, the fate of Palestine, U.S. military airstrikes targeting ISIS, and American occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. Researchers at the Brookings Institution also conducted an analysis of terrorist propaganda earlier in 2015 and published their findings in the respected Lawfare blog. Even though their review only included material that was in English or came with a translation, they came to a similar conclusion as Joscelyn. Overall, the authors found that ISIS has rarely used Guantanamo as a propaganda tool, and al-Qaida uses the prison a lot less frequently than it used to, though the group didn’t use it much to begin with. When groups did mention Guantanamo, it was often listed alongside other controversial facilities, like the now defunct Abu Ghraib prison, and other grievances concerning the United States. ""Guantanamo has never played a big role in any terrorist group’s propaganda compared to the issues that really animate those groups,"" the authors wrote. ""So while it’s easy to find examples of terrorist leaders mentioning and denouncing Guantanamo, these were never the major themes of jihadi propaganda but were, at most, supporting arguments."" One expert told us Hayes’ claim is an overstatement. Max Abrahms, a political science professor at Northeastern University, said Hayes is downplaying Guantanamo’s significance in propaganda. For example, al-Qaida’s Inspire magazine has prominently featured the prison, such as the fall 2010 issue, which included accounts from former detainees. He added that in recent ISIS’ beheading videos shared widely on social media, the terrorists often dress the hostages in orange jumpsuits, which many people assume is a reference to the iconic Guantanamo detainee uniforms. Joscelyn disputed this argument, saying that many prisons use similar jumpsuits and Guantanamo no longer uses those uniforms. Further, these so-called ""Jihadi John"" videos rarely mention Guantanamo. The orange jumpsuit is likely a visual reference to Abu Ghraib, rather than Guantanamo, dating back to the first beheading video by al-Qaida in Iraq, said J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at Brookings. In any case, Guantanamo is not necessarily an effective recruiting tool, Abrahms added. In fact, it might be less valuable in terms of propaganda now than it used to be because Guantanamo was associated with President George W. Bush, while it’s widely known that Obama wants to close the prison. The general topic of Muslim religious and political prisoners is popular among jihadists and can be used in recruitment, said Berger, author of Jihad Joe: Americans Who Go to War in the Name of Islam and ISIS: The State of Terror. Terrorist group members can monitor related social media accounts and websites looking for potential recruits. For example, a former Guantanamo detainee runs one of the most important English-language websites on this topic, the London-based Islamic prisoner advocacy website CAGE, and they cover Guantanamo issues in some detail. ""Guantanamo has not been a massive focus in jihadist propaganda, but it does feature in recruiting,"" Berger said. ""ISIS and al-Qaida recruiters can use it as a wedge issue when approaching someone who is not fully radicalized."" He added, though, that U.S. counterterrorism action, particularly drone strikes, are arguably much more important to recruitment and definitely more important to propaganda than Guantanamo. Our ruling Hayes said, Guantanamo has ""never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda."" Experts told us that Hayes’ point has merit. Analyses of jihadist propaganda materials show that Guantanamo is rarely mentioned, especially compared to other grievances against the United States, like military airstrikes. Al-Qaida uses Guantanamo less frequently now than it used to, though it was never a primary focus of their propaganda. Because he specified that Guantanamo is not a ""key component"" of jihadist propaganda, we rate Hayes’ statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2506C0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/30/stephen-hayes/guantanamo-key-component-terrorist-propaganda/

Facebook post accuses U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho of wanting to strip blacks of voting rights
","A viral image on Facebook falsely accused U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., of saying black Americans should only have three-fifths of a vote. A curious reader pointed us to the image, which reads: ""This guy is Republican Florida Representative Ted Yoho who said this week that African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida."" We looked into it and found that there’s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme’s creator was duped by a satirical website. We learned the image was from a Facebook user in California named Mark Kusler, who based it on a story on Politicalo.com. The website posts some real news, but it also posts satirical stories with exaggerated content. The site includes a ""Show Facts"" button that allow readers to highlight which parts of their stories are true and which are not. But the viral image — which has been shared more than 3,000 times — does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what’s the real story? On May 20, 2014, liberal website RightWingWatch.org ran a story about video footage from a stop at Berean Baptist Church in Ocala during Yoho’s 2012 congressional campaign (not last week, as the image said). During the appearance, Yoho blasted allowing an uninformed electorate into polling places and decried early voting through absentee ballots. He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past. ""I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,"" he said in the video.  He didn’t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn’t deserve to have the same voting power.  Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: ""The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man’s. It’s what God intended."" The YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes. An administrator from Politicalo pointed out to PolitiFact Florida that the quote was not highlighted by the ""Show Facts"" button, meaning it was fabricated by the post’s writer. People For the American Way, the parent of Right Wing Watch, confirmed to us that Yoho didn't say the things Politicalo added. That’s not to say Yoho’s comment about voters historically being property owners didn’t face some backlash. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that Yoho’s assertions ""harken back to another century when Americans were denied their basic rights as citizens"" and ""should be roundly condemned in the strongest possible terms."" Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told MSNBC in an email that ""the congressman was making a reference to how voting was structured when America was in its infancy (from a historical perspective). He does not believe that this is the way it should be now."" Our ruling A viral image said Yoho said ""African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote."" There is no evidence Yoho said anything specifically about black voters in a 2012 campaign appearance in Ocala. The image was taken from a satirical news story on a satire site that twisted Yoho’s words about voting rights to make him appear biased against black voters.  While Yoho has talked about reducing early voting, the post goes too far in using a fake quote to make it appear the congressman wants to strip away African Americans' civil rights.

State correct: traffic deaths are up in 2015
","More than 1,300 people have died on Georgia roads this year, and 25 percent of the deaths are the result of drunken driving. Those claims headline a public service announcement airing statewide on television and radio in this season of merriment and cheer. ""Watch your speed. Put down the phone, and don’t get behind the wheel if you’ve been drinking,"" Gov. Nathan Deal warns listeners. For months, state officials have been alert to an unwelcome change: After falling annually for nine straight years, Georgia’s traffic deaths were up this year. But have more than 1,300 people really died this year on Georgia roads? And have 25 percent — or one out of four of those deaths — been caused by drunken driving, as the public service announcement says? PolitiFact Georgia decided to rev up the Truth-O-Meter. Figures compiled by the state Department of Transportation and released through the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety show traffic deaths in Georgia fell each year from 2005 to 2014, going from 1,729 to 1,170, even as U.S. census estimates show the state added about 1 million residents. Georgia roadway deaths for 2015 hit 1,345 as of Monday of this week. That's up 186, or 16 percent, from 2014, and it’s still a few days until we turn the calendar to 2016. According to state data, the 1,345 included six people killed in car-train collisions, 192 pedestrians, 138 motorcyclists and 21 bicyclists. The largest number of traffic deaths occurred on state and local roads, 675 and 485, respectively. But deaths on interstates — often the most visible because of the gridlock that follows — are up 21 percent, from 153 in 2014 to 185 so far this year. But were 25 percent of this year's fatalities alcohol-related? The answer: That could well be the case, but officials don’t know that with absolute certainty. Harris Blackwood, the director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said his agency has certified data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showing that 297 of Georgia’s 1,179 fatalities two years ago, or 25 percent, involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, the legal limit. Smaller amounts of alcohol — 0.01 percent or higher — were found in 30 percent, or 349, of those fatalities in 2013, Blackwood said. Part of the reason they don’t know for certain about the role of alcohol in 2015 traffic deaths is it can take months to obtain blood test results from the GBI crime lab, he said. ""However, there are indicators, such as open containers, information provided by other passengers, and so on,"" Blackwood said. ""The percentage of alcohol as a factor has been consistent on a percentage basis over a 10-year period, even as fatalities were going down prior to this year,"" he said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website gives an extensive five-year view of fatal crashes in Georgia and the nation — including the role alcohol plays. Between 2010 and 2014, alcohol-impaired driving was a factor in 24 percent to 25 percent of all fatal accidents each year. The one exception was 2011, when the percentage dropped to 22 percent. Nationally, 30 percent to 31 percent of all fatalities in those same five years involved alcohol-impaired drivers (those with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or above), according to the NHTSA data. Blackwood said the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety also did a preliminary analysis early this year and found no evidence that ""the alcohol percentage is going down"" from prior years. In the first nine months of 2015, there were 483 instances where an officer requested an alcohol test or a driver refused an alcohol test, he said. (We should note that some law enforcement agencies consider it standard protocol to request a blood alcohol test in fatal traffic accidents.) Our ruling A public service announcement says more than 1,300 people will die on Georgia roads before the end of the year. By Monday of this week, the number was 1,345, according to a tally kept by the Georgia Department of Transportation and released by the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. The PSA also makes the claim that one in four of those people died in alcohol-impaired fatalities. The truth is that state officials don’t know for certain what’s happened in these traffic deaths. It takes time to investigate. They’re basing the claim on a trend they’ve seen and one that doesn’t seem to be changing in Georgia or the nation. That’s probably context the reader deserves to know. We rate the statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E22040>],/factchecks/2015/dec/30/state-public-service-announcement/state-correct-traffic-deaths-are-2015/

Terrorist watch list no obstacle to buying guns, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy says
","U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy joined other Democrats in demanding the House take up a bill that would keep people on the FBI’s watch list from buying guns, saying far too many people on the list have been allowed to get firearms. Murphy tweeted a graphic on Dec. 8, 2015, claiming that ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" His tweet came after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns. In an unusual procedural move, Murphy and other Democrats signed a petition to bring the bill to the House floor, but it currently doesn’t have the required 218 signatures for further action. The Senate earlier in December struck down a similar bill. We were curious if Murphy -- who is also running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016 -- was right to say that 91 percent of suspected terrorists looking to buy guns were able to get one. Our research showed that is accurate by the best available estimates, but there are some caveats about the watch list we should keep in mind. Watching the watch list The FBI maintains what is informally known as the terrorist watch list through its Terrorist Screening Center, which maintains a consolidated file of ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" As you can imagine, some critics are uneasy about the government maintaining any sort of list designating people potential enemies of the state, but it’s generally considered a valuable tool for national security. The Democrats’ bill allows for cross-referencing the list while conducting a background check for a firearm purchase. The actual size of the list and who is on it is not public information, but we have estimates: In 2011, an FBI fact sheet said there were 420,000 people on the list. Current estimates have put the list at around 700,000. Since the database pulls information from U.S. and global agencies, only a relative handful — about 8,400 in 2011 and likely around 10,000 now — are American citizens or legal residents. Murphy’s stat comes from a March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which examined how many people applying for gun purchases were run through the FBI’s instant background checks and also were on the watch list. Between February 2004 (when the FBI started keeping tabs on people on the list trying to buy guns) and December 2014, there were 2,233 people on the list who applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed, including three applications to buy explosives. That’s a bit more than 91 percent. Experts have told PolitiFact that the GAO report is plausible, and not really that remarkable, considering how many gun purchases Americans have made in the past decade. But there are things to keep in mind. The data show how many weapons applications there were, not how many individuals, so one person could have potentially made several purchases. The report also didn’t show transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted, so the number actually could be higher. There also have been some issues with the terror watchlist database in the past. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were ""associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations"" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which has previously led to people with the same name as a person on the watch list being stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Murphy said, ""91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."" His figure comes from a GAO report that showed a bit more than 91 percent of gun store weapons applications by people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list were approved. There are some caveats to the watch list, including past issues with who is included and why. The report also didn’t distinguish how many individuals are making these applications, or how many people on the watch list potentially buy firearms at gun shows. But experts have told us the report is both plausible and not altogether unsurprising, given how many guns Americans purchase. We rate Murphy’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C250CC0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/29/patrick-murphy/terrorist-watch-list-no-obstacle-buying-guns-rep-m/

Cruz falsely claims U.S. law requires double fencing on border
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says President Barack Obama’s border policies aren’t just bad, they’re illegal. ""Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing,"" Cruz, a presidential candidate, said during a recent radio interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" broadcast in Portsmouth. ""The Obama administration refuses to do that. They’ve built only 36 miles."" We wondered if the law requires that the U.S.-Mexico border have a 700-mile span of ""double-layered fencing"" in which two barriers are set up, one in front of the other. Rick Tyler, a Cruz campaign spokesman, backed the senator’s statement by pointing us to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which required that at least two layers of reinforced fencing be installed along five sections of the U.S.-Mexico border. Those sections totaled about 850 miles, although the fenced area would be somewhat less, because other means could be used to secure the border in areas with steep terrain. In areas of steep terrain, ""other means"" could be used to secure the border, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report. The bottom line is, the law mandated a double-layered fence along a stretch of at least 700 miles, covering more than one-third of the roughly 1,900 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. But the law was amended in 2008 and loosened the fence requirements that Cruz continues to describe. The current law, contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, still mandates the construction of a fence covering ""not less than 700 miles"" of the border. But - key to this fact check - it erased the requirement that the fence be double-layered. Instead, the law mandates that ""reinforced fencing"" be erected. That generally means a barrier that’s more durable and sturdy than a typical fence, but the law doesn’t specify the barrier’s height or that it be constructed from wire mesh or another material, according to the  Congressional Research Service report. The new law ""now mandates only a single layer of reinforced fencing (while not precluding additional layers from being deployed, if deemed appropriate),"" the report says. So what has been built? The Department of Homeland Security says it has fencing on 650 miles, according to the research service. About 350 miles of that fencing is designed only to deter pedestrian crossings and contains only one barrier layer. Another 300 miles is covered by a ""vehicle fence"" - barriers designed to stop cars and trucks from crossing the border but not people traveling by foot. Only 36 miles are covered by double-layered fencing, according to Homeland Security tallies. ""DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) believe they have all the fencing that they need and that any additional fencing would not contribute to border security,"" Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an interview. Others disagree, saying the barrier is not enough. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which urges tighter immigration policies, noted the vehicle fencing provides no deterrent for people on foot. ""Your grandma could hop them,"" Krikorian told us in an email. Our ruling Cruz says, ""Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing."" He complains that Obama is ignoring the mandate. Such a law was passed in 2006 but no longer is on the books. It was amended in 2008, before Obama took office, and the double-layered fencing requirement was removed. About 650 miles of fencing now stands, of which 36 miles is double-layered. Cruz’s statement is long past its expiration date. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C8040>],/factchecks/2015/dec/29/ted-cruz/cruz-falsely-claims-us-law-requires-double-fencing/

Cruz says 40 percent of illegal immigrants have overstayed visas
","Although building a wall on the Mexican border gets most of the headlines, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says other steps also must be taken to keep illegal immigrants from settling in the United States. ""Forty percent of illegal immigration doesn’t come across the border; it’s people coming legally on visas and overstaying their visas,"" the presidential candidate said during a recent interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" broadcast from Portsmouth. Cruz pledged to develop a program to record and store biometric information on visas to help track the entry and departure of visitors to the United States. Biometrics refer to characteristics such as fingerprints, eye recognition and DNA. We decided to examine Cruz’s statement that 40 percent of illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas - a claim often cited by Republicans. Two of Cruz’s rivals for the GOP nomination, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also have mentioned the statistic this year. When we asked Cruz’s campaign for the source of the statistic, a spokesman referred us to PolitiFact Texas’ 2013 fact-check of a similar statement made by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas. Carter’s statement was based on a 2006 report by the Pew Research Center that estimated ""nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" While the source data gave an estimate that ranged from 33 percent to 50 percent, the report went middle-of-the-road and called it 45 percent. Pew relied on a 1997 study by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS report concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on overstayed visas since that aging study. Subsequent estimates have been based on taking that core 1996 data and adapting it to current trends. In 2003, the INS reprocessed the data and estimated that 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in the nation in 2000 had overstayed their visas. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, gave estimates on visa overstays ranging from 27 percent  to 57 percent. The GAO cautioned that its methodology in reaching the figures was ""complex, indirect and marked by weaknesses."" Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 report, is among those who have published updated estimates based on the old data. Warren, now a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, theorized in a 2014 study that because it has gotten harder in recent years to enter the U.S. through its southern borders, the percentage of illegal immigrants overstaying their visas has increased and in 2012 may have been 58 percent. But because there’s no new hard data, no one knows for sure. ""They’re all ballpark estimates,"" said Marc Rosenblum, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Our ruling Cruz said that 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are ""people coming legally on visas and overstaying their visas."" This widely cited statistic is based is an estimate based on research going back to the 1990s. The federal government hasn’t provided updated statistics on overstayed visas, and subsequent research has focused on adapting the old data to new trends. Estimates in those reports have ranged from 27 percent to 58 percent of illegal immigrants overstaying their visas. So Cruz is using what research shows to be an acceptable middle figure. But he would be more accurate to refer to the 40 percent figure as an estimate rather than a fact.

Scott Walker says he put more funds into mental health than any Wisconsin governor in 25 years
","On Dec. 3, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker was asked by a Wisconsin reporter for his reaction to the gunslaying of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. the previous day. That was before authorities had determined that the husband-and-wife shooters had discussed jihad and martyrdom. Walker responded by talking about mental illness. ""We don’t know enough about this instance. But for others like that, what we’ve found is one of the common denominators in many of these cases are people who’ve slipped through the cracks when it comes to chronic mental illness,"" the governor said. ""That’s why I’m proud that here in Wisconsin, we’ve put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years."" Two longtime mental health advocates told us that Walker’s funding boost was exceptional. ""We were hard pressed to think of anything quite as significant,"" said Shel Gross, senior policy associate at Mental Health America of Wisconsin. So let’s see whether Walker put into the state budget more money for mental health than any governor in the last quarter-century. Walker’s evidence Walker announced in February 2013, in the wake of mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and at a Sikh temple and a spa in suburban Milwaukee, that he would raise spending on mental health services by $29 million in his 2013-’15 state budget. The six initiatives included $12.6 million to open two units at the Mendota Mental Health Institute, a state-run psychiatric hospital in Madison for patients who have been committed, and $10.2 million for expanding community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness. When Walker made his formal budget presentation later that month, he said only half of all Wisconsin adults with ""serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication"" -- a claim we rated Mostly True. We noted that the Wisconsin chapter of National Alliance on Mental Illness had praised the spending boost, but criticized Walker for rejecting a proposal under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, saying his decision ""reflects a shallow understanding"" of ""crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents."" Mental health benefits in private-sector insurance plans are generally less comprehensive than those provided by Medicaid. But that is separate from the amount of state funds Walker put into the state budget. To back the governor’s claim, a spokeswoman provided us a February 2013 email from Walker’s Department of Administration that said there had not been a mental health funding boost in ""general purpose revenue"" since the creation of what was known as the ""community aids"" program in the mid-1970s. Walker’s office also had his Department of Health Services provide us more detail in restating that his investment was the largest since the ‘70s. Separately, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau confirmed to us that the $29  million increase in state funding budgeted for mental health services in the 2013-15 state budget was the largest increase in at least 25 years, and that no other increases during that time were nearly as much. A final note: Charlie Morgan, a program supervisor for the fiscal bureau, told us that the total amount the state budgets for mental health services ""is not easily answered."" That’s because funding for those services is provided through many programs, including: inpatient services provided by the state's mental health hospitals, community-based mental health services that are budgeted as distinct programs; and funding the state provides to counties, including for programs that provide mental health as well as substance abuse services. But it’s clear the additional $29 million added by Walker is the largest such increase in at least 25 years, he said.   Our rating Walker said: ""Here in Wisconsin, we've put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years."" It’s worth noting that Walker refused a federal expansion of Medicaid that would have provided more mental health services to Wisconsinites. But on putting state money into the state budget for mental health, he is correct.

How many abortions are performed in Texas each year?
","Texas lawmakers are considering a proposal that would prohibit city and county governments from doing business with Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, eight years after passing legislation prohibiting the state from doing the same. During debate on the proposal in the Senate, Democratic lawmakers proposed amendments that would exempt spending on non-abortion related health care like sexually transmitted diseases or health crises like a Zika outbreak. Sen. Donna Campbell, the bill’s author, urged her colleagues to reject the changes and said no taxpayer dollars should go to an entity that performs abortions. ""When we’re talking about health, there’s nothing healthy about abortion,"" said Campbell, a Republican from New Braunfels. ""For an industry that in Texas alone aborts almost 60,000 innocent babies a year, when we’re trying to put things in perspective and you’re talking about healthier practices, having more opportunities for people with STDs, STIs — where is the outcry for the crisis of the almost 60,000 for abortion?"" We were curious about Campbell’s abortion statistics. The number of abortions performed annually in Texas has been declining, as the state has tightened restrictions on the procedure. What do the latest numbers tell us? Campbell’s estimate is close Alice Claiborne, Campbell’s spokeswoman, said this number came from reports published by the state’s Health and Human Services Commission about abortion providers in Texas. These reports are compiled using data reported to the state from abortion facilities, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and doctor’s offices. In 2016, there were 54,507 abortions performed in Texas, including 1,026 for patients from out of state, according to the most recent state figures. At least 200 of those procedures occurred in hospitals or doctor’s offices that would be exempt from Campbell’s legislation. Her bill applies to all abortion clinics and any ambulatory surgical centers or doctor’s offices that perform more than 50 abortion procedures in a given year. There are 26 facilities in Texas, including clinics and surgical centers, that perform abortions, according to a list curated by NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and Lilith Fund, which helps low-income patients pay for abortions. Texas law prohibits abortions past 20 weeks post-fertilization (with some exceptions) and requires any abortions performed more than 16 weeks post-fertilization to happen in a hospital or at an ambulatory surgical center, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. Campbell’s bill would end an Austin contract with Planned Parenthood in which the organization rents a city-owned building for a health center for $1 a year. State data shows decline in abortions The number of abortions performed in Texas has declined dramatically since 2001, the year with the earliest data published by the Health and Human Services Commission. The number fluctuated between 77,000 and 75,000 between 2001 and 2005, before rising as high as 82,000 in 2006. Since 2008, the number of abortions performed in the state has declined almost every year. Nationally, the number of abortions performed annually tends to surge after key court rulings that strike down abortion restrictions and then start decreasing, according to an earlier PolitiFact Texas report on the number of procedures. Texas lawmakers frequently pass legislation aimed at restricting access to abortion. In 2013, lawmakers passed a law to require all abortion facilities to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers and for physicians performing abortions there to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. Key provisions of the law were ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016, but not before nearly two dozen abortion clinics had shut down, leaving just 18 open, according to research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at UT. By 2019, the number of facilities offering abortions had grown again to 26. To Campbell’s larger point about whether abortion correlates with health care, studies published by Texas Policy Evaluation Project showed that clinic closures affect the number of procedures performed but also limit access to general gynecological and reproductive care, said Kari White, an investigator at the policy group. ""Our work has shown that these various measures have had adverse effects on women’s health,"" White said, noting that closures mean ""women haven’t been able to get the reproductive care they need."" Our rating Campbell said the abortion industry performs 60,000 procedures annually in Texas. In 2016, there were more than 54,000 abortions performed in Texas. Not all of those procedures were performed by providers who would fall under Campbell’s proposal. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Has income stalled for the bottom 90% since the 1970s, as Pete Buttigieg said?
","During an interview on Vox.com co-founder Ezra Klein’s podcast, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg highlighted growing inequality in the United States. In response to a question from Klein about the the conservative era ushered in by President Ronald Reagan, Buttigieg said the governmental approach at the time ""had a lot to do with the removal of regulation, the weakening of labor standards, and slashing taxes at every level, based on this presumption that this would grow the economy. And on one level it did. The top-line growth numbers were pretty great. On the other hand, if my numbers are right, since 1973, the income of the bottom 90 percent, so pretty much all of us, didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit."" Is he right that for most people, income levels -- adjusted for inflation, which economists consider a necessity for such comparisons -- haven’t increased since 1973? The data shows that income levels have actually risen beyond inflation during that period, but the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent hews pretty closely to what Buttigieg said. (Buttigieg’s campaign did not respond to inquiries.) Neither we nor economists we consulted with could find an exact data set that fit Buttigieg’s wording, but we found one that was close. It was calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and covered 1979 to 2015, most of the period in question. The figures CBO used are adjusted for inflation and federal taxes, but not for for state and local taxes. They show income growth for people in four different economic ranges: the lowest 20 percent of the income distribution, the middle 60 percent, the 81st percentile to the 99th percentile, and the top 1 percent. These don’t mirror Buttigieg’s precise parameters, but economists told us they are useful for showing whether he’s broadly right or not. Here’s a chart summarizing what Buttigieg found: The top 1 percent, in red, have the most unique and most impressive growth. The other income groups are tightly clustered together. But look closely at the slope of the line: It heads upward. The rise is nowhere near as fast as it was for the top 1 percent, but it did increase after being adjusted for inflation. This undercuts Buttigieg’s assertion that for most people, income ""didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit,"" since the 1970s. And Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that the subsequent data since 2015 would likely show additional increases, since incomes across all the income distribution have improved since 2015. (He also said that adding in data for 1973 through 1978 would be unlikely to make a difference.) Buttigieg’s statement ""is very unlikely to be true,"" Burtless said. That said, other data supports Buttigieg’s claim more closely. Let’s look at wages, which are what you earn from your job; it does not include other types of income, including interest and payments from programs like Social Security or food stamps. The following chart, drawn from data collected by the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute, shows inflation-adjusted data for wages going back to 1973. We’ve broken down the wage levels by 10 percent increments -- the lowest 10 percent, the next 10 percent, and so on. The chart shows clear wage stagnation for the bottom 60 percent of the income scale. The rate did go up for the 70 and 80 percent levels, which means that Buttigieg’s 90 percent figure would be a bit exaggerated. (It’s also worth noting that wage data excludes income from Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, and refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit, so it’s an incomplete picture of household income.) And what if you look at the percentage of total income taken by each group, rather than just ""the income""? This is a meaningful way of looking at the trend because, if income is generally rising, it’s possible for people to see an increase in income even as their percentage of the pie stays the same or goes down. This metric closely follows the pattern Buttigieg cited. The World Inequality Database builds off the work of economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who have specialized in income inequality. Their approach does not receive universal approval -- they use pre-tax income and include realized capital gains, which likely magnify the income for the wealthiest -- but economists say their approach is not unreasonable. Here’s a chart showing the share of income taken by four different parts of the income distribution: This shows that both the bottom 50 percent and the next 40 percent -- essentially the 90 percent that Buttigieg cited -- have taken declining shares of the nation’s income since 1973. By contrast, both the top 10 percent and the top 1 percent have seen their shares grow. The parallels between Buttigieg’s statement and the World Inequality Database figures are strong, said Brendan Duke, a tax policy analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Many analysts would argue that the CBO data are a more complete concept of ‘income’ as frequently defined in economics, but one could also argue that the Saez-Piketty data more closely approximate how most Americans think of income,"" Duke said. ""If you asked most Americans what their income is, they probably wouldn’t count the premiums their employer pays toward their health insurance or the value of Medicare services they receive, something the CBO data do include."" Buttigieg said, ""Since 1973, the income of the bottom 90 percent, so pretty much all of us, didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit."" Actually, income for every group, as calculated by the CBO, has increased beyond the rate of inflation since the 1970s. However, another measurement --  the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent -- has indeed declined since 1973.

Fact-checking Julian Castro on Bush's 2005 immigration policy
","Julián Castro, seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, is proposing sharp changes to immigration laws in a stark contrast with President Donald Trump’s policies. Castro used to be mayor of San Antonio, Texas, and he served as Housing and Urban Development secretary in the last few years of the Obama administration. In an online post, he recounted his family’s migrant background, criticized Trump’s ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy, and advocated for a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally. Castro emphasized what he said is a little-known but significant policy, Section 1325, ""central to today’s inhumane and flawed immigration system."" The law dates back to the 1920s and got a new push during George W. Bush’s presidency, he said. ""These laws got a new life in 2005, when the Bush administration decided to charge those that crossed the border with criminal violations, rather than civil ones,"" Castro wrote in a Medium post published April 1. Did Castro accurately characterize the Bush administration’s practice? We found that some immigrants were prosecuted for improper entry even before 2005. But in 2005 the Bush administration did launch a program to prosecute most immigrants before deporting them. Castro’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. 8 U.S. Code Section 1325 lays out legal consequences for immigrants who enter or attempt to enter the United States at a time or place not designated by immigration authorities; who elude examination or inspection by immigration officers; and who enter or attempt to enter under false pretenses.  For the first commission of any of those offenses, a person can be fined or imprisoned for a maximum of six months, or both. Subsequent offenses can lead to a fine or imprisonment for a maximum of two years, or both. The law has been around for decades. Operation Streamline is what Castro had in mind when he referenced 2005 policy changes by the Bush administration, his campaign said. The program allowed Border Patrol agents to refer for prosecution all individuals apprehended at the border, making exceptions for parents traveling with minors, juveniles and select others. It started in response to increased illegal entries of people from countries other than Mexico. Before 2004, Border Patrol referred a limited number of immigrants to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, said a 2015 report from the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Homeland Security. Historically, the government generally returned most Mexican nationals to Mexico through a voluntary return process, and administratively detained and processed immigrants for deportation through the civil immigration system, the report said. Prosecutions under Section 1325 have ebbed and flowed over different administrations; not all have enforced it the same way, said Brian Owsley, assistant law professor at the University of North Texas at Dallas, College of Law and former U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of Texas. One of the reasons why Section 1325 was used before and after 2005 was to get people in the federal criminal system— if someone came in improperly a second time they could then be charged for illegal re-entry (a felony), Owsley said. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations all prosecuted immigrants under Section 1325. The Trump administration does, too. Trump’s ""zero tolerance"" prosecution policy is said to have been modeled after Operation Streamline. However, Trump’s policy is different from policies of other administrations in that it led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. After public outcry over the separations, Trump signed an executive order to keep families together, ""where appropriate and consistent with law,"" and based on available resources. The order did not end the prosecution policy. Immigration experts emphasized that immigration is typically a civil matter— for instance, entering with a legitimate basis for seeking asylum is not a criminal act, and those cases are reviewed by immigration courts within the Justice Department. Yet Bush wasn’t the first one or the only one to prosecute immigrants for illegal entry into the United States. Castro said that the Bush administration in 2005 ""decided to charge those that crossed the border with criminal violations, rather than civil ones."" Immigrants who cross the border illegally were prosecuted for immigration offenses even before 2005. But the Bush administration introduced Operation Streamline in late 2005 to prosecute most immigrants who crossed the border illegally.

Meadows wrongly claims Obama removed census citizenship question in 2010
","The fate of the Trump administration’s census citizenship question rests in the hands of the Supreme Court, but debate over the issue has been swirling in Congress. During Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ March 14 testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, said asking about citizenship is nothing out of the ordinary. ""The previous administration under President Barack Obama really was the first time that we didn’t ask a citizenship-type question,"" Meadows said in a question to Ross. ""For the first time in a century, a citizenship question was not included in 2010."" Meadows, who represents North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District, which includes the state’s westernmost counties, made the same claim at an earlier point in the testimony, saying citizenship questions were a staple of censuses ""prior to 2010, when President Obama decided not to include a citizenship question on the census."" But Meadows’ statements muddle the facts because the citizenship question did not disappear entirely during the Obama years. Here’s what Meadows got wrong. The answer is complicated. The census has been administered every decade since 1790 to get a national population count used for determining the distribution of seats in Congress. The 1790 census asked for the name of the head of the family and the number of people in each household, including slaves. According to a history published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2009, a question asking about citizenship status first showed up in 1820 and 1830. It was then asked of males ages 21 and older in 1870, and has appeared as a general question every decade since 1890, with the exception of 1960, when it was removed for unexplained reasons. What’s unique about the Trump administration’s proposal is that the question would be asked of all U.S. households. The last time the Census Bureau came close to asking every household about citizenship status was in 1950. That year, census workers knocked on doors to fill out the census by interviewing the residents of American households. They jotted down where each person was born and, in a follow-up question for those born outside the U.S., asked, ""If foreign born — is he naturalized?"" But because citizenship was the subject of a follow-up question, not every U.S. household was asked about it, said D. Sunshine Hillygus, professor of political science at Duke University and a former member of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee. ""Census workers asked about citizenship as a follow-up question only to those households who reported someone was born outside the United States,"" she said. A decade later, the 1960 census asked about place of birth but not about citizenship. Then, beginning in 1970, the Census Bureau started distributing two different questionnaires: a short form sent to most households and a long form sent to about 1 in 6 households. Only the long form asked about citizenship. In 2000, for example, respondents who got the long-form questionnaire were asked, ""Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?"" But those who received the short form were only asked for the basics, such as name, date of birth, sex, and race. The 2010 census ditched the long form, using only a 10-question short-form questionnaire that did not ask about citizenship. That’s because the Census Bureau had also started collecting demographic and socioeconomic information through the American Community Survey, or ACS, which is sent every year to approximately 3.5 million households and does inquire about citizenship status. Meadows’ spokesman Ben Williamson said the congressman ""was talking about the first time the decennial census was without a citizenship question on either the long form or short form.""  But Meadows’ claim that 2010 was ""the first time that we didn’t ask a citizenship-type question"" gets the history wrong, since the Census Bureau asked about citizenship that year via the ACS, which effectively replaced the long form and was sent to a sample of households. ""The Census Bureau has long measured citizenship within the U.S. population (including in the Obama administration), but not as part of the decennial census of all U.S. households,"" Hillygus wrote in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. ""So, the proposed citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census is a new addition to the census of all American households."" ""We already have access to quality data on our citizens and non-citizens alike through the ACS,"" added Terry Ao Minnis, director of census and voting programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a legal and civil rights group. ""In 2010, a citizenship question was asked on the ACS."" It has been asked every year since. Meadows said, ""The previous administration under President Barack Obama really was the first time that we didn’t ask a citizenship-type question … for the first time in a century, a citizenship question was not included in 2010.""  That’s factually inaccurate. A citizenship question has not been asked of all U.S. households since 1950, when it was a follow-up for foreign-born respondents. In 2010, the Census Bureau sent a citizenship question to approximately 3.5 million households through the ACS. We rate this statement False.

Did states with charter schools cluster below West Virginia in ACT scores?
","West Virginia state Sen. Mike Romano, a Democrat, recently took a swipe at charter schools. A Feb. 2 tweet by the West Virginia Senate Democrats quoted Romano criticizing a low ranking for the state in a report published by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group. Romano sought to turn the tables by offering a more favorable ranking for West Virginia -- the state’s test scores for the ACT, a major college entrance exam -- and by taking a shot at charter schools, which West Virginia doesn’t allow. ""We hear we are ranked 47th. I could never figure out where that came from, but I finally did, it was ALEC. I have put on your desk the rankings of ACT test scores, WV is 30th. Which states are listed in the bottom? 15 states with charter schools. #wvpol #SB451"" Sen Mike Romano: We hear we are ranked 47th. I could never figure out where that came from, but I finally did, it was ALEC. I have put on your desk the rankings of ACT test scores, WV is 30th. Which states are listed in the bottom? 15 states with charter schools.#wvpol #SB451 We found the ALEC report stating that West Virginia is ranked 47th in the nation. The group calculated that rating based on state academic standards, charter schools, homeschool regulation burden, private school choice, teacher quality, and digital learning. That’s a different measurement than ACT scores. So is Romano correct that West Virginia ranks 30th in ACT scores nationally, and that every state lower on the rankings has charter schools? We took a closer look. (Romano’s office did not respond to inquiries.) We looked at a report summarizing the 2018 average ACT scores by state, and West Virginia did indeed rank 30th. We found 18 states that ranked below West Virginia: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wyoming. (Two states had equal composite scores to West Virginia -- North Dakota and Ohio -- but we’ll set those states aside for this analysis.) How many of these states have a law allowing charter schools? Based on data from a report by the National Center for Education Statistics, most of these states allow charter schools. Specifically, of the 18 states that ranked below West Virginia, all but Kentucky, Montana and Nebraska allow charter schools. Case closed? Not so fast. The reality is that by now, most states allow charter schools -- 43 states, to be exact. So the list of states ranking above West Virginia is also chock-full of charter school states. In fact, every single state ranking above West Virginia except for North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont allows charter schools. So there’s not really a pattern by which charter school states are clustering below West Virginia. Rather, charter school states are clustering both above and below West Virginia in the ACT rankings And there’s another problem. The ACT summary warns that it’s important to choose states carefully when making comparisons. The summary recommends only comparing states that have similar rates of taking the ACT. Why? The smaller the percentage of statewide graduates tested, the more likely it is that stronger, college-bound students will take the test, thereby producing higher scores. For West Virginia, that means the state can only be meaningfully compared to a small subset of states, rendering suspect the 50-state comparison Romano used. Specifically, about one-third of states tested 100 percent of graduates; another eight states had testing frequency between 53 percent and 77 percent; and the remainder of states tested between 7 percent and 43 percent of their graduates. In West Virginia, 65 percent of West Virginia graduates took the ACT, putting the state in that middle category of eight comparable states. And among those eight states, West Virginia finished in the middle of the pack, behind Iowa, Georgia, Kansas, and South Dakota and ahead of Arizona, Florida, and New Mexico. Three of the states ahead of West Virginia have charter schools, while all three below West Virginia have charter schools. Once again, there’s no clear pattern. Romano said that in the state rankings for ACT test scores, West Virginia ""is 30th. Which states are listed in the bottom? 15 states with charter schools."" West Virginia did rank 30th in 2018 for ACT scores, but that’s where Romano’s accuracy ends. There are lots of charter-school states that rank below West Virginia -- but also lots of charter-school states that rank above West Virginia, simply because most states now allow charter schools.

State Rep. Riemer on the money with tax credit claim
","According to state Rep. Daniel Riemer (D-Milwaukee), a tax credit issued to manufacturer and agriculture producers is making the rich richer. ""About 80 percent of that tax credit goes to claimants who are making a million dollars or more,"" Riemer said on a recent WISN-TV UpFront program. The Manufacturing and Agriculture Credit, which was passed by Republicans in 2011 and went into full effect in 2016, is an economic incentive given to business owners in those industries. It is aimed at encouraging them to maximize production efforts in the state, instead of elsewhere. In his budget, new Gov. Tony Evers -- a Democrat -- has proposed scaling back the tax credit to help pay for a middle-class tax cut instead. Is Riemer right that millionaires are the ones who are benefiting the most from the manufacturer and agriculture credit? We decided to do some deeper digging. The back-up When asked for backup, Riemer said the statement was based on information the Legislative Fiscal Bureau sent Feb. 5, 2019 to state Rep. Gordon Hintz (D-Oshkosh). The memo was an updated version of one sent Oct. 25, 2018. The bureau, which is a nonpartisan operation and considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters, provided an estimate for the 2019 tax year of how the credit would be distributed. According to the memo, those with incomes starting at $1 million -- and all the way up to more than $30 million -- would get 79.65 percent of the total credit distributed. ""In brief, I stand by my claim,"" Riemer said via email. ""I believe it is true."" Why are high income earners getting the credits? Andrew Reschovsky, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on tax policy and public finance, told us the tax credits are aimed to create a financial incentive for production and job growth in the state. ""The purpose of this was to reduce taxes on manufacturers particularly in a way of encouraging economic growth and employment,"" Reschovsky said. Therefore, most of the credit is going to go to job creators, not job holders. ""In some cases, if you were a private owner of a business, manufacturing business, you would take your net income as personal income,"" Reschovsky said. ""The way any credit works is you figure out what your tax liabilities are. What this manufacturing and agricultural credit did was reduce not absolutely to zero, but very close -- the taxes paid by manufacturing firms and agriculture in the state of Wisconsin."" Companies remain eligible for the tax credit regardless of whether new jobs are created. What’s the impact on job growth been through these tax incentives? If business owners and industry leaders are receiving tax breaks as a means of boosting growth, what’s the picture in those sectors of the workforce? According to the state Department of Workforce Development, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Wisconsin was second nationally and first in the Midwest for adding manufacturing jobs between 2017 to 2018. The state added 15,100 jobs in that sector. Shortly after the increase was implemented, though, the increase in manufacturing jobs wasn’t much. Manufacturing jobs increased only from 455,576 in 2013 to 468,600 jobs in 2015, or a 2.7 percent increase, the Capital Times reported in a May 16, 2016 article. Meanwhile, the agricultural industry continues to struggle, particularly with dairy farms as milk prices continue to fall and more farms close down. Wisconsin lost 638 dairy farms in 2018, an average of nearly two a day. ""Most economists would argue reducing state income tax is a very ineffective way of generating increases in employment,"" Reschovsky said. ""Wisconsin has been robust (in job growth) but I think it’s even slower than the national average."" Our rating Riemer said about 80 percent of the Manufacturing and Agriculture Credit goes to claimants making over $1 million or more a year.

Despite what Donald Trump keeps saying, his father was born in New York, not Germany
","In 1885, Friedrich Trump — the father of the late Fred Trump and the grandfather of President Donald Trump — immigrated from Germany to New York. Then 16, Friedrich left before he could legally have been conscripted into the German military service, according to journalist Gwenda Blair, author of The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President. Some years later, Friedrich and his homesick wife, Elizabeth, tried to return to Germany, but their stay was short and they were eventually deported back to the United States. Not only had Friedrich, now too old to be drafted, not done his military service, but he had become a U.S. citizen, Blair explained to PolitiFact. Why the history lesson? Well, on April 2, 2019, (which happens to be International Fact-Checking Day), in making remarks to reporters about Germany, referred to his father, Fred, and said: ""My father is German, right? Was German, and born in a very wonderful place in Germany."" A flurry of news reports quickly declared that the president had uttered a falsehood about his father’s birthplace  — again. The stories pointed out that, as has been reported many times, Fred Trump was born in New York. Just as his New York Times obituary says he was. (Interestingly, as the New York Times obit notes, Fred Trump at one stage of his life took to telling people he was of Swedish origin. Blair told us that was likely due to his business dealings with many Jewish people in New York and to anti-German sentiment in the United States during and after World War II.) As for the president’s claim about his father, when PolitiFact inquired to the White House, a spokesman did not respond. Blair, speaking to PolitiFact from New York’s Central Park, said there’s no doubt that Elizabeth Trump was pregnant with Fred while she and Friedrich were still in Germany. But there is also no question, Blair attested, that the couple had returned to New York by the time Fred was born. ""As we know, that does not make him born in Germany,"" Blair said. ""Conceived in Germany? OK. But, born in Germany, no."" Newsweek and The Independent reported that Trump has made the erroneous claim about his father at least four times since taking office. Each time, according to Newsweek, he has been either criticizing Germany's contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union's trade relationship with the U.S. Donald Trump said his father was born in Germany  — even though, as has been reported many times -- Fred Trump was born in New York.

Why do farmers get so few of our food dollars? Us.
","Democrat Elizabeth Warren released a policy aimed directly at farmers in the key caucus state of Iowa. Under the headline ""Leveling the Playing Field for America’s Family Farmers,"" Warren detailed how she would curtail the economic heft of mega-agricultural companies. She said family farms are caught in a ""squeeze"" that she linked to consolidation in the industry. ""Mergers mean that farmers have fewer and fewer choices for buying and selling, while vertical integration has meant that big agribusinesses face less competition throughout the chain and thus capture more and more of the profits,"" Warren wrote March 27. ""The result is that farmers are getting a record-low amount of every dollar Americans spend on food, food prices aren’t going down, and agribusiness CEOs and other corporate executives are raking it in."" The numbers clearly show the declining share of dollars going to farmers. What’s less certain is what large agricultural corporations have to do with that. And before going deeper, it’s important to note that a smaller share of the food dollar doesn’t translate into tougher times for farmers. Even as it has gone down, there have been times when farmers made more money because sales rose. When Americans buy a box of cereal, a head of broccoli or a meal at a restaurant, some portion of each dollar goes to different players in the supply chain. The U.S. Agriculture Department has detailed statistics back to 1993. From that starting point, the trend is unmistakable — farms have been getting less and less. In 1993, the farm share was 17.5 cents on the dollar. In 2017, it fell to 14.6 cents. Those are current dollars. Corrected for inflation, the numbers are a little different — 16.1 cents and 12.2 cents — but the trend is the same. Either way, the farm share has never been lower. USDA economists drill down to see the fraction of each food dollar that goes to each industry that helps put food on the table, whether that table is at home or in a restaurant. The list ranges from agribusiness (the firms that sell seeds and other materials to farmers), to food processors, to packaging, to energy and more. By and large, each sector held a fairly stable share until 2010. That year, the share going to food service — any eating or drinking establishment — took off. Restaurants, fast-food chains, college food services, and their ilk gained an additional 7.5 cents in six years. That rise came at the expense of other players, but none more than farmers. Farms lost 2.8 cents on the dollar, more than any other sector. The second biggest losers were food processing and grocery stores. Agribusiness, part of the focus of Warren’s comment, lost less than half a cent. When Americans buy apples at a farm stand, the share staying with the farm is large (it's not 100 percent because the farm has expenses). But buy a slice of apple pie at a restaurant and that money gets split among every company and person along the way, from the trucking firm that shipped the apples, to the server who brings the pie to the table, and everyone in between. More and more, Americans are eating food outside the home, and that has fundamentally altered how much of the food dollar goes to farmers. Out of a dollar spent for food at a grocery store, the share has gone up and down but basically is unchanged from 1993. It’s now about 23.4 cents. For food eaten away from home, the amount going to farmers has always been much lower, and it has shrunk since 1993. It’s now 4.4 cents, about half what it was 25 years earlier. USDA economists spotted the trend a while back. ""Increasing expenditures on food services are behind much of the reduction in the farm share,"" they wrote in 2011. Other players found ways to cushion themselves from this shift. ""Processors are processing the food sold for away-from-home consumption,"" said John Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri. ""Food-service wholesalers are selling and delivering to restaurants and institutions, and virtually all of the major supermarkets now have food courts or even restaurants in their stores."" On top of that, even for food bought at the grocery store, American habits put the squeeze on farmers. Each added step in the supply chain means a smaller percentage for the farmer — think here of any ready-made food. ""Consumers do like convenience,"" said William Knudson, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University. ""People want to buy bread, or a frozen pizza. They don’t want to buy flour."" Warren tied the falling share for farmers to fewer and larger companies controlling key inputs and more steps in the supply chain. For some products, there’s evidence of that. The Obama administration changed the rules for poultry growers, who face a processing sector dominated by four companies. (The Trump administration later put those rules on hold.) A 2012 USDA study said the conditions were right for agribusiness to throw its weight around. But in practice, the case is harder to make. ""Concentration matters in general, but the precise effects on prices vary widely and depend on a host of other factors,"" USDA economist James MacDonald wrote in a 2017 article. Warren cited a press release from the National Farmers Union, which in turn cited the work of Mary Hendrickson, a University of Missouri sociologist who studies farm economics. Hendrickson said the jury is still out on the impact of agribusiness consolidation. ""There’s a lot of argument about that,"" Hendrickson said. ""It’s not resolved."" MacDonald told us that in the long-run, rising productivity, not agribusiness consolidation, has pushed the farm share down. ""Over time, a greater share of the total costs of producing food fall on processing and retailing,"" he said. While Warren doesn’t come right out and say it, her implication is that a shrinking share of the food dollar is bad news for farmers. It’s not that simple. When demand has stayed strong, farm incomes have risen, even as the share of the food dollar has dropped. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan arm of Congress, wrote that falling farm-share numbers ""should not be misconstrued to suggest that marketing costs are too high or that farmers’ well-being has declined. These statistics do not address either of those issues."" Gary Brester, agricultural economist emeritus at Montana State University, looked at meat producers between 1945 and 2006. The farm share fell from 74 percent to 33 percent. During the entire time, ""real per-farm net income has trended upward,"" Brester wrote in 2009. ""This concept is perhaps the most frequently quoted, but misused, number published by the USDA,"" Brester said in his article. Farm incomes have fallen in recent years, but that stems more from low prices due to a number of factors, not due to a falling share of the food dollar. Hendrickson said what the measure actually reflects isn't so much farm profits as the length of the supply chain. ""More people have come between the farmer and the eater, each trying to get their share,"" she said. And the longer the supply chain, Hendrickson said, the less market power farmers have. Warren said that mergers and integration in agribusiness ""squeeze"" family farms and ""the result is that farmers are getting a record-low amount of every dollar Americans spend on food."" Government data definitely show that farmers are getting a record-low share of the food dollar. In some cases, consolidation of agribusinesses has contributed to that, but the broader connection is unproven. The strongest driver is Americans’ increasing appetite for food at restaurants and prepared foods at grocery stores. When preparation costs more, the percentage going to farmers declines. But a declining share of the food dollar going to farms does not mean farmers are worse off. Elements of this claim have a measure of truth, but it leaves much out. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF4500>],/factchecks/2019/apr/04/elizabeth-warren/why-do-farmers-get-so-little-our-food-dollars-us/

No, Joe Biden wasn’t photographed kissing a woman behind Lindsey Graham
","In late March, a former Nevada legislator accused former vice president Joe Biden of kissing and touching her. The allegation fueled old claims that Biden, a likely presidential candidate, behaves inappropriately with women. It also inspired some new, supposed photo evidence of such behavior. In one picture, posted on Facebook on March 31, Biden appears to be kissing a woman a few feet behind U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham. But the image is doctored, and the post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original image is a still of a video by Daily Caller columnist Benny Johnson. Johnson recorded Graham walking away from a woman protesting Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, according to Johnson’s Oct. 5 story. Biden is not in the picture. In the doctored photo, the woman has her mouth open like she is screaming or gasping in surprise. But watching the recording, it’s clear she’s yelling at Graham. ""We are voting you out of office,"" she says as Graham adjusts his tie and smiles for the camera. A screenshot of that moment has become a meme (examples here and here). But commenters on the Facebook post seem to believe the doctored photo with Biden is authentic. ""What a creep,"" one woman wrote. ""Does he have to be pawing women all the time? Where is his wife?""

Have West Virginia test scores tended to drop after 4th grade?
","The president of the West Virginia state Senate, Mitch Carmichael, recently said that students in the state consistently rank well below students elsewhere when comparing test scores. Carmichael made the comments in an interview with Hoppy Kercheval of WV MetroNews Talkline on Feb. 14, 2019. He was discussing the then-current Senate Bill 451 and what the bill could offer both teachers and students. At one point he called improving the state’s education system a moral imperative. In West Virginia, he said, ""our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they’re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation—which is not good, but it’s not horrible. By the time they’re in the 8th grade, they’re 46th or 47th, and then upon 11th grade testing they’re near last."" .@SenCarmichaelWV joins @HoppyKercheval to explain his thoughts on the @wvhouse’s version of the omnibus education bill. WATCH: https://t.co/wkudfIAoe1 pic.twitter.com/90qJg2JDZY Is that correct? We took a closer look. (We reached out to Carmichael, but he did not respond.) We turned to the Nation’s Report Card, an archive of National Assessment of Educational Progress test scores. NAEP was first administered in 1969 and is the largest continuing, nationally representative assessment of student achievement in such subjects as math, reading, science, and writing The Nation’s Report Card allows users to compare specific states to the nation as a whole in a variety of subjects. This is the main interactive page for West Virginia’s state comparisons. The Nation’s Report Card looks at math and reading scores and organizes states into three categories: ""higher"" than the target state, ""not significantly different"" than the target state, and ""lower"" than the target state. Here’s a chart showing West Virginia’s ranking for fourth graders. The figure shown is the number of states ranked ""higher"" than West Virginia in the year noted. By this data, Carmichael is generally in the right ballpark, though scores in recent years have had a wider range than he suggested -- from 30 to 41, rather than 37 or 38. Here’s the chart for eighth graders: For eighth grade, the rankings aren’t quite as low as Carmichael had indicated, but he does have the general trend line correct: In most cases, West Virginia’s ranking dropped in math and reading between fourth and eighth grade. What about testing near the end of high school? The data that’s available makes it difficult to say. There are only two years for which data is available at all -- and for those years, not every state took part. So while it looks like West Virginia improved dramatically by the end of high school, there were actually so few states participating that each of these rankings represents a last-place slot for that year. Superficially, this supports Carmichael’s assertion -- that by the end of high school West Virginia students are ""near last."" But since about two-thirds of the states didn’t participate, we really don’t know for sure how well or poorly West Virginia ranked among all 50 states. Carmichael said that in West Virginia, ""our students enter in at fourth grade the first time they’re tested, 37th or 38th in the nation—which is not good, but it’s not horrible. By the time they’re in the 8th grade, they’re 46th or 47th, and then upon 11th grade testing they’re near last."" Judging by the past six years of NAEP rankings, Carmichael’s specific figures are slightly off for fourth and eighth grades, but the trend he points out -- a decline for West Virginia between fourth and eighth grades -- is accurate and consistent. As for the end of high school, however, while West Virginia does drop to last among participating states, that finding is undercut by the reality that most states did not take part in the testing. That makes it difficult to know how well West Virginia fared nationally.

Has West Virginia's foster care caseload jumped by two-thirds in recent years?
","West Virginia is reeling from the opioid epidemic, including a significant impact on children whose parents have become addicted. During recent testimony before the state Senate, Jeremiah Samples, the deputy secretary of the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, sought to explain exactly how big that impact has been. In a Feb. 28 video clip of his testimony aired on West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Samples said, ""We have had an increase of 67 percent (in) the number of number of children taken into state custody since 2014."" By custody, he was referring to children in the foster care system. That’s a large increase. Is it correct? We took a closer look. When we reached Samples’ office, they offered one qualification -- they said that he had misspoken when he said the first year of the comparison was 2014. He should have said 2013 instead, the office said. So what is the rise since 2013? A spokeswoman for his department, Jessica Holstein, pointed us to data collected by the federal Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System. She provided data from 2013 to 2018 showing that the number of children in foster care on Sept. 30 of each year had risen from 4,309 to 7,210. That’s a 67 percent increase. We tried to verify those figures against the original federal database but only found data published through 2017. Holstein said the 2018 data came from state figures that have been submitted to the federal government but which has not yet been published. The percentage increase for the nation as a whole was 11 percent between 2013 and 2017, so West Virginia’s increase was substantially larger than the United States as a whole. The only caveat we’ll note is that the one-day snapshot of children in the foster care system is not the only relevant statistic that’s collected. The number of children entering the foster care system rose between 2013 and 2016 by 42 percent, a somewhat smaller increase than the one-day snapshot showed. But the number of children waiting for adoption rose by an even larger amount than the one-day snapshot -- 76 percent. Both of these figures were significantly higher than the increase nationally over the same period -- a 6 percent increase in children entering the foster care system, and a 19 percent increase in children waiting for adoption. Samples said, ""We have had an increase of 67 percent (in) the number of children taken into state custody since 2014."" Samples’ office acknowledged that he had misspoken on the year; he should have said 2013. Using that year along with the data officially submitted by the state, he’s correct about the 67 percent increase. This rise, and the rise in other related data on the state’s foster care system, far outstrips the increase seen nationally.

Donald Trump falsely tweets that Puerto Rico got $91 billion in hurricane aid
","After Democrats and Republicans in the Senate failed to reach an agreement on disaster aid for Puerto Rico, President Donald Trump falsely tweeted about the amount of hurricane aid already distributed. ""Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA....,"" Trump tweeted April 2. Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA.... Then he praised his own leadership: ""....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!""  ....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation! We found that Trump is wrong about the dollar amount the territory has received and wrong when he said it was a record. His comments about hurricane aid follow other misleading statements he made related to the 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico. Trump mischaracterized the death toll saying the estimate was ""done by Democrats,"" and he exaggerated the poor condition of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid before the hurricanes. The future of aid to Puerto Rico is up in the air after the Senate failed to move forward on legislation. Both parties have pointed fingers at each other for not reaching an agreement after months of proposals. While proposals from both parties have included $600 million for food assistance for Puerto Rico, Democrats want millions more for other needs in Puerto Rico including for the electrical grid, FEMA reimbursement and water projects. The federal government’s recovery website shows shows $40.7 billion has been allocated (Congress appropriated the spending) through December 2018. Of that, $19.4 billion has been obligated (the government has promised to spend the money) and of that $11.2 billion has been spent. The money comes from various agencies and funds including FEMA, U.S. Housing and Urban Development, the Community Development Fund and the Disaster Relief Fund.   A senior administration official told PolitiFact that Trump arrived at the $91 billion figure by combining the roughly $41 billion already allocated with additional estimated future FEMA costs of $50 billion. (The Washington Post’s Fact Checker wrote that the $50 billion was a high end estimate of what would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988.) That means the $50 billion is speculative, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""It may be spent, it may not, and some of it will be far into the future,"" he said. How far into the future? A look at Katrina spending shows it can last for more than a decade after a storm. There is still Disaster Relief Fund money being paid out related to Katrina (and Rita and Wilma, also 2005 storms), to the tune of nearly $200 million this year, Ellis said. Sorting out exactly how much the federal government has spent after disasters is tricky. Some hurricanes hit more than one state, and some states receive money for multiple disasters. Comparing how much various jurisdictions have gotten for different disasters is not an apples-to-apples comparison because some disasters create more damage. Comparisons to disaster aid in Puerto Rico versus other storms also omits inflation and that it is more expensive to get disaster supplies to Puerto Rico ,which is located approximately 1,000 nautical miles from the U.S. mainland. ""Obviously Puerto Rico is not in the continental U.S. so all supplies have to be sent by ship or plane, which increases costs,"" Ellis said. ""You can truck supplies into Louisiana and Texas and Florida. Inflation is a factor -- $1 billion in 2005 is worth more than  $1 billion in 2017."" Federal officials did not respond to our questions asking how Trump concluded that the $91 billion figure was more than any other disaster. But federal reports show that the government has already spent more on Hurricane Katrina -- and that’s without factoring in inflation. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that ""Congress provided roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina."" In his attack on Puerto Rico disaster spending, Trump said that we ""cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!"" The federal government pays for disasters in various states and the territory of Puerto Rico, which is a part of the United States. (This is despite the comments by White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on MSNBC who referred to Puerto Rico as ""that country."" He called it a slip of the tongue.) Trump tweeted ""Puerto Rico got $91 Billion for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before."" Trump arrived at that figure by combining the $41 billion already allocated with additional estimated future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster of $50 billion. But that future payment is speculative, and it will be years before we know how much of it is realized. Even if the $91 billion is the ultimate cost down the road, the federal government already has estimated it spent $120 billion on Hurricane Katrina.

Fact-checking Donald Trump’s take on wind energy
","One of President Donald Trump’s new favorite political targets is Democrats’ Green New Deal, a sweeping approach to combating climate change. That plan embraces a greater reliance on renewable energy sources — like solar and wind — over a decade. Trump has trained his fire on wind power in particular during several recent speeches, claiming that consumers face major blackouts from nothing more than a simple shift in weather. And Trump’s disdain for wind energy, as the Washington Post notes, has even deeper roots. ""When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric,"" Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference March 2. ""Let's hurry up. ‘Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling.’ "" Trump continued hammering wind energy later that month at a rally in Michigan, saying that if Hillary Clinton had won the election the United States would not be a global leader in energy production. ""You would be doing wind, windmills,"" Trump said March 28. ""And if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night."" The president’s riffs on wind energy grossly oversimplify things — perhaps for comedic effect. But the latest White House budget proposal would slash funding for renewable energy programs across the country. So we thought his comments were worth checking. Ensuring uninterrupted electricity when using renewable energy is a legitimate concern. Wind energy — and solar, for that matter — are considered ""intermittent energy sources,"" because of their dependence on weather conditions. But the issue is a manageable one under the current system, experts said. First off, the notion that a person gets electricity from only one wind farm is wrong. That’s because American energy consumers in virtually all cases get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. ""No home connected to the continental U.S. grid is primarily reliant on the wind the occupant feels in their backyard,"" said Daniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute. For example, in the western United States, Schwartz said, power generation and consumption is transmitted across roughly a dozen states and Canadian provinces. ""On a still day in Seattle, the wind is blowing in Montana, or California, or elsewhere,"" he said. Michael Gillenwater, executive director of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, responded to Trump’s claim this way: ""Just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down."" Experts noted that utilities typically use a mix of sources to generate energy, including some, like natural gas, that aren’t susceptible to running out if the winds are low or if clouds block the sun. The current energy system has successfully integrated renewables. As of 2018, renewable sources made up around 17 percent of total U.S. energy. Among renewables, hydropower provided the most, at 7 percent, with wind energy a close second. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, accounted for nearly two-thirds of American power.  Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration​ But what would happen to grid stability if the United States increased its reliance on sources like wind and solar? That analysis hinges on several unknown variables, including how much would come from intermittent sources, whether nonrenewables would continue to serve as backups, and the pace of green technology development.   In his CPAC speech, Trump’s criticism of wind energy grew out of his broader disapproval of the Green New Deal. It’s in that context that Trump has a point, said Benjamin Zycher, a resident scholar at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute who has written a forthcoming book critiquing the Green New Deal. ""If you define the wind power as envisioned by Trump as part of a ‘100% renewable system’ or something approaching it — as defined, say, in the Green New Deal — then Trump is correct,"" he said. Zycher said a 100 percent renewable system would face a series of practical challenges. Batteries cannot currently provide sufficient backup generation, he argued, so the only practical alternative to maintain grid stability would be from a non-renewable source, which would mean maintaining elements of the current system. There’s some debate about whether the Green New Deal is truly pushing for a ""100% renewable system,"" or some lower threshold. The legislative language does not spell out what energy sources would comprise a new grid. In fact, its elasticity on this point appears to be something of a selling point. As Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey, D.-Mass, said, ""The resolution is silent on any individual technology. We are open to whatever works."" Rather, the proposal calls for ""100% of power demand through clean, renewable, and zero-emissions energy sources."" To some, the plan could encompasses more than just renewables, to include nuclear power, or even fossil fuels with carbon capture. Schwartz, of the Clean Energy Institute, said the challenges of wind power are widely recognized in engineering circles. But he was bullish on the future of green technology. ""My reaction is optimistic,"" he said. ""I see engineering challenges, not insurmountable barriers created by the laws of nature."" Already, some utilities use some of the surplus electricity they generate to pump water uphill, where it can be released downhill to generate electricity as needed. Going forward, researchers are working on additional methods, such as next-generation batteries, to store energy so it can be kept in reserve for slack periods for wind or solar generation. Gillenwater agreed there’s a lively debate about the feasibility of building a 100 percent renewable system, and pointed us to this article from Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ magazine. But he noted that ""getting to about 80 percent is generally seen as not a problem technically or economically."" Gideon Weissman, a policy analyst with Frontier Group, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has done substantial research on what a greener grid might look like. He added that other research suggests that a renewable grid ""has the potential to be more reliable and resilient than our current electric grid, since it would be less vulnerable to central disruptions."" Trump said, ""When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric."" In virtually all cases, American energy consumers get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. Practically speaking, just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down. Right now, renewables account for around 17 percent of total U.S. power. Experts say there are some legitimate practical and technological challenges associated with moving to a grid that relies much more heavily on renewable energy than our current system. But engineers are aware of the issues and many believe they are not insurmountable. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

Holy Guacamole: Would America really ‘run out of avocados’ if Trump closes the border?
","Late-night comedians and news headlines whipped up worries all week: Avocados could disappear ""in three weeks"" if President Trump shuts down the border. ""Holy lack-a-guacamole. No avocados! What are we supposed to put on our toast now, jelly?"" Stephen Colbert quipped on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" Yahoo! News captured the concern with this headline: ""The U.S. Would Run Out Of Avocados In Three Weeks If The Mexico Border Were To Actually Close"" Many other outlets and blogs reported the same alert, all citing President Trump’s threat to shut the border. We wanted to know: Had these warnings served up the truth? Couldn’t growers in California, a leading avocado producer, step in and replace the high-demand fruits in the case of a shut down? We don’t typically examine predictions. But given Trump’s repeated threats to close the border and America’s avocado obsession, we decided the time was ripe for a fact check. Avocados for sale at a Sacramento farmer's market / Capital Public Radio file photo Where did this claim start?  The fears over an avocado vanishing started with a Reuters news article on April 1. And, no, it wasn’t an April Fool’s joke. ""Americans would run out of avocados in three weeks if imports from Mexico were stopped, said Steve Barnard, president and chief executive of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world,"" the article stated. ""You couldn’t pick a worse time of year because Mexico supplies virtually 100 percent of the avocados in the U.S. right now. California is just starting and they have a very small crop, but they’re not relevant right now and won’t be for another month or so,"" Barnard told Reuters. We asked Mission Produce for more information but did not hear back. ‘Vastly fewer avocados' Dan Sumner, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis, said the prediction about an avocado shortage is generally correct, given the nation’s reliance on Mexico, though it needs some context. ""Avocado demand has expanded so rapidly that we now import about 80 percent of the avocados we use in the United States,"" Sumner said. ""California produces almost all the rest, about 20 percent. And almost all the imports come from Mexico. A little bit from Chile and a few other places."" Sumner said the claim assumes that Americans would continue to consume avocados at the same rapid pace we do now, even after a shut down. Price spikes, however, would cause demand to wither and some expensive avocados might be leftover, and stores might try to ration avocados, he added. ""Exactly what the retail strategy would be in this case, I’m not sure. But we would have vastly fewer avocados,"" Sumner said. Just how fast avocados would disappear, if at all, would depend on whether the Trump administration enacts a full or partial border closure. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC he’s looking for ways to keep some commerce flowing. ""We are looking at different options, particularly if you can keep those freight lanes, the truck lanes, open,"" he said this week.   Grower’s perspective Ben Holtz owns Rocky H Ranch, a 70-acre family-run avocado farm in northern San Diego County. He agreed avocados would run out within weeks. ""Mexico is the big player today. California is not. You shut down the border and California can’t produce to meet the demand,"" Holtz said. ""There will be people without their guacamole."" While Mexico’s avocado harvest is year-round, California’s is limited to April through July. Growers in the state have picked only about 3 percent of what’s expected to be a much smaller crop of about 175 million pounds this year, Holtz said. A heat wave last summer reduced the crop size. California’s avocado harvest has averaged approximately 300 million pounds in recent years, according to data from the California Avocado Commission. By contrast, the U.S. has imported more than 1.5 billion pounds of avocados from Mexico annually. Representatives from the commission did not respond to requests for this article. Altogether, the U.S. received 43 percent of its fruit and vegetable imports from Mexico in 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Also affecting this year’s avocado supply, a California avocado company in March recalled shipments to six states last month after fears the fruit might be contaminated with a bacterium that can cause health risks. Until the early 2000s, California was the nation’s leading supplier of avocados, Holtz said. Mexico gradually overtook the state and now dominates sales in the U.S. ""It’s a very big possibility,"" Holtz said of avocado shortages. ""Three weeks would dry up the Mexican inventory. California alone consumes more avocados than are grown in our state. Cold storage supply chain is basically three weeks or less of inventory. Most of the time it’s seven days."" A spokeswoman for the California Restaurant Association said ""we haven’t heard concerns from restaurants, it doesn’t mean they aren’t worried."" A national grocers association said it will ""continue to closely monitor any developments"" at the border, but did not have information about the potential impact on avocados. Our rating  News outlets and blogs reported that the United States would ""run out of avocados in three weeks"" if President Trump shuts down the border. America imports about 80 percent of its avocados, and most come from Mexico. California’s avocados, and those from Chile and other countries, account for the rest. Experts agreed the Mexican inventory would run out within weeks.

No, hackers aren’t posting ‘sexual videos and pictures’ on your wall that you can’t see
","It is wise to stay vigilant on the internet, but when people share vague, unsourced warnings about a social media scam, the threats they reference typically aren’t credible. One message making the rounds on Facebook warns users that ""hackers"" are somehow gaining access to accounts to post ""sexual videos and pictures"" on people’s walls that they cannot see – but their friends can. Here is the warning, in full: ""URGENT WARNING TO ALL FACEBOOK USERS! FRIENDS BE CAREFUL! THIS IS SERIOUS! Hackers are posting sexual videos and pictures on your walls! You don’t see them, but your friends do, then it seems as if you posted it. If you see any such garbage posted under my name, please let me know because I DID NOT POST IT! Share this to protect yourself and your friends."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The alert is too vague to be a credible security warning and doesn’t detail how these hackers are getting into accounts, nor does it give any solution besides telling users to let someone know if they see this activity on others’ Facebook walls, which provides no permanent fix. Clifford Neuman, cybersecurity expert and director of University of Southern California’s Center for Computer Systems Security, told PolitiFact he has not seen credible evidence of the warning, either. He does say it isn’t completely impossible, though. ""If social media platforms give one that ability to post javascript enabled code (or any other scripting language) to a wall, it is potentially possible for someone to post something on your wall in a way that could keep you from seeing it,"" Neuman wrote in an email. While malware has been spread in the past using similar techniques, he has not seen evidence that this is happening right now. Other fact-checking sites have also looked into the veracity of these types of warnings, some as far back as 2011, when a similar hacker ""threat"" was being warned against in chain emails. If hackers do gain access to accounts, security organizations and technology websites say it is often because the user inadvertently allowed it to happen. This can come about by mistakenly downloading untrustworthy internet applications that allow spam or scam messages to be posted as comments or on walls and may grant unauthorized access to personal information. It can also happen from opening messages and links from shady senders or providing personal information in phishing schemes. Some steps to take to avoid this include beefing up your passwords and changing them often, disconnecting suspicious-looking apps and strengthening security settings, such as two-factor authentications and checking your login location logs (you can do this on Facebook by visiting your settings and then clicking on Security and Login). Neuman advised similar online safety steps. Strong passwords and scrutinizing your online associates are paramount to remaining secure. ""Use a strong password on your social media account, and a password that is different from the password used on any other sites on the internet,"" Neuman said, ""and be careful of who one accepts as friends on these platforms. Many users will boast about having thousands of friends because it makes them feel important, but when asked how many of their ‘friends’ they actually know, they are at a loss to answer."" Warnings circulating on Facebook claims hackers are posting ""sexual videos and pictures"" on users walls without them being able to see it. There is no credible evidence that this threat is real, and the warnings remain vague and unsourced. Reposting such warnings will not keep anyone safe online, and cybersecurity experts say people should instead strengthen their account security and avoid installing third-party applications. This claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C187840>],/factchecks/2019/apr/03/facebook-posts/no-hackers-arent-posting-sexual-videos-pictures/

Overdoses, suicide driving drop in U.S. life expectancy, presidential candidate Andrew Yang says
","Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is getting attention for what he says would be his first priority in the White House — implementing ""universal basic income."" Every U.S. citizen over 18 years old would get $1,000 per month under the proposal from the 44-year-old New York Democrat, an entrepreneur and former tech executive who is making his first run for public office. Universal basic income is needed, Yang said on The Hill’s ""Rising"" TV show, because ""we’re going through the greatest economic and technological transformation in our nation’s history."" He also made a claim about life expectancy that he has used repeatedly: ""The indicators already show that we’re falling apart. America’s life expectancy has declined for the last three years in a row, the first time in a hundred years, because of surges in suicides and drug overdoses."" Yang’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back up his statement. But the campaign has previously cited a Politico news article on reports released in November 2018 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those reports were on life expectancy as of 2017. We’ll take Yang’s statement in three parts: 1. Yang was a bit off in saying life expectancy has declined for three straight years, in that there was no change from 2015 to 2016, according to CDC figures that were revised slightly after their initial release: 2014: 78.9 years 2015: 78.7 years 2016: 78.7 years 2017: 78.6 years 2. That was the first time such a three-year stretch had occurred since the flu pandemic a century ago, the CDC said. So, he’s right about it being ""100 years"" since something similar happened. 3. A CDC report cited three causes of death that have contributed to the decline in life expectancy: drug overdoses and suicides, as Yang said, but also chronic liver disease. (The CDC said chronic liver disease may be caused by both biological and behavioral factors, including hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection and excessive alcohol consumption.) According to the CDC, in 2017 there were a record number of fatal drug overdoses (70,237) and a continued growth in suicides (47,173), with the rate of suicides growing by one-third since 1999. So, overdoses and suicides were major causes of the decline in life expectancy. Shannon Monnat, a sociology professor and co-director of the Policy, Place, and Population Health Lab at Syracuse University, went so far as to say the recent decline ""is due almost entirely"" to increases in overdoses and suicides. She told us: ""Although the declines are small, they are unprecedented, and they are signals that there is a serious well-being crisis in the U.S."" University of Maryland professor Andrew Fenelon, a sociologist and demographer whose research specialties include health disparities and population health, told us that Yang goes too far in citing only overdoses and suicides as the reasons for the decline. ""Identifying a ‘cause’ of a very small decline in life expectancy is hard, because many causes of death for which there were increases in mortality could, in essence, be said to be the reason for the decline,"" Fenelon said. Still, it’s clear, as news media reports on the CDC figures reflected at the time, that overdoses and suicides were major drivers of the decline. As for the significance of the decline, Fenelon agreed with Monnat, calling the three-year decline ""extraordinary."" ""We are simply not used to seeing, on a national scale, declines in life expectancy, especially not ones lasting more than one year. It is a major crisis,"" he said. ""And not only are we failing to improve life expectancy in an absolute sense, as we have done for the past hundred years, but we're also falling farther behind the rest of the high-income world."" Yang stated: ""America’s life expectancy has declined for the last three years in a row, the first time in a hundred years, because of surges in suicides and drug overdoses."" Yang’s claim is based on the most recent figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the three years since 2014 for which data are available, life expectancy dropped in 2015, stayed the same in 2016 and dropped in 2017. That pattern has not been seen in 100 years. The CDC says suicides and drug overdoses, which showed major growth, as two of the three main factors in the decline. We rate Yang’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DFB180>],/factchecks/2019/apr/03/andrew-yang/overdoses-suicide-driving-drop-us-life-expectancy-/

No, JFK didn’t say he would expose a slavery plot
","And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what PolitiFact can do for your country. That’s not a John F. Kennedy quote (though it’s close to something the former president said during his inaugural address), and neither is this one that was posted on Facebook on March 30. ""There’s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child,"" reads the text of a photo of what looks like a flyer pasted to a phone pole. ""Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot."" The quote is attributed to President Kennedy, whose photo is featured. It says Kennedy uttered these words seven days before his assassination. Kennedy was shot to death on Nov. 22, 1963. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We couldn’t find the quote included in a list of quotations by the president on the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum website. But the library is often asked about the statement, said archivist Stacey Chandler. ""When there is a credit or citation line, it typically suggests this was part of a speech at Columbia University in late November 1963,"" she said. Sometimes the quote is attributed to Kennedy on Nov. 15, 1963, she said. Other times, it’s Nov. 12, 1963. But researchers have never found evidence that Kennedy spoke at Columbia on either of those dates, or any time in 1963, according to Chandler. The library also has records related to speeches he delivered as president and he gave two on the 15th, seven days before his assassination, but those don’t appear in either, Chandler said. You can read transcripts of the speeches he gave in New York City that day here—at the  AFL-CIO convention—and here, at the National Convention of the Catholic Youth Organization. His schedule from Nov. 15 doesn’t include a visit to Columbia nor any other speeches or events. Chandler said the library has a few ways of searching presidential statements, including keyword searches of archival holdings, historical newspaper coverage and speech databases such as the Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""We’ve never found a match for this statement through any of these resources, and we haven’t been able to confirm it via secondary sources, either,"" Chandler said. Marc J. Selverstone, chair of the Presidential Recordings Program at the University of Virginia, told us that the Facebook post has no validity. ""Never seen it in any reputable source,"" he said. We couldn’t find it in one either. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48F880>],/factchecks/2019/apr/03/viral-image/no-jfk-didnt-say-he-would-expose-slavery-plot/
