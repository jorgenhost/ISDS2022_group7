"['National', 'Obama Birth Certificate', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump said Obama's grandmother caught on tape saying she witnessed his birth in Kenya
","It's early, but Donald Trump is emerging as a significant player in the Republican race for president. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that among people planning to vote in the Republican primary, Trump placed second, tied with Mike Huckabee and behind Mitt Romney. On MSNBC's Morning Joe on April 7, 2011, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell warned, however, that Trump's economic commentary is being ""trivialized"" by his association with the so-called birthers, people who doubt that President Barack Obama is a natural-born citizen of the United States, and is therefore ineligible to serve as president, because he has not provided a copy of his original birth certificate.

""Get off the birther stuff,"" Rendell said.

Trump, who is considering a run for president, said in a telephone interview on the program that he would not back off the issue, and that over the last few weeks he has only become more skeptical that Obama was born in the U.S. (His campaign released a Certification of Live Birth, which Hawaii officials say is an official birth certificate and sufficient to prove he was born in Honolulu. Trump and others have said that is not sufficient and that they still have doubts. We've gone over this ground repeatedly at PolitiFact.)

Trump also defended his position, saying, ""His grandmother in Kenya said, 'Oh no, he was born in Kenya and I was there and I witnessed the birth.' Now, she's on tape and I think that tape's going to be produced fairly soon ...The grandmother in Kenya is on record saying he was born in Kenya.""

Trump made an identical claim in a Today Show interview the same morning: ""His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, okay?""

This is actually an old claim that has been bouncing around the Internet for years. But keeping up with the latest birther claims is often like playing Whac-A-Mole, and we never got around to this one. So here we go.

The claim is based on an Oct. 16, 2008, telephone call between Bishop Ron McRae of the Anabaptist Churches of North America and Sarah Obama of Kenya, Barack Obama's elderly step-grandmother. The interview is complicated by the addition of at least one translator, because Sarah Obama, then 86, spoke Swahili.

The edited portion that often makes the rounds on the Internet includes this part of the interview:

McRae: ""Could I ask her about his actual birthplace? I would like to see his birthplace when I come to visit Kenya in December. Was she present when he was born in Kenya?""
 
""She says yes she was. She was present when Obama was born,"" said the translator.

Smoking gun? Only if you stop the tape there and don't listen to the rest of the interview.

McRae immediately followed up by saying, ""Okay, when I come in December, I would like to go by the place, the hospital where he was born. Could you tell me where he was born? Was he born in Mombasa?""

The translator can be heard translating, and then, he said, ""No. Obama was not born in Mombasa. He was born in America.""

Said McRae: ""Whereabouts was he born? I thought he was born in Kenya.""

The response came back, ""He was born in America, not in Mombasa.""

""Do you know where he was born?"" McRae continued. ""I thought he was born in Kenya. I was gonna go by and see where he was born.""

""Hawaii. She says he was born in Hawaii,"" the translator said. ""In the state of Hawaii, where his father, his father was also learning there. The state of Hawaii.""

""I thought she said she was present,"" McRae said. ""Was she able to see him being born in Hawaii?''

""No, no,"" the translator said. ""...She was not ... she was here in Kenya. Obama was born in America ... Because the grandmother was back in Kenya and Obama was born in America, where he is from, where his father was learning, learning in America, the United States.""

Listen to the full conversation yourself. The parts in question begin about the 4:20 mark.

McRae -- who we should emphasize was not the translator -- has kept the theory alive. In a Dec. 5, 2008 article, Salon ran an affidavit from McRae in which he maintains Sarah Obama confirmed she witnessed Obama's birth in Kenya:

""Though some few younger relatives, including Mr. Ogombe (one of the translators), have obviously been versed to counter such facts with the common purported information from the American news media that Obama was born in Hawaii, Ms. Sarah Hussein Obama was very adamant that her grandson, Senator Barack Hussein Obama, was born in Kenya, and that she was present and witnessed his birth in Kenya, not the United States. When Mr. Ogombe attempted to counter Sarah Obama's clear responses to the question, verifying the birth of Senator Obama in Kenya, I asked Mr. Ogombe, how she could be present at Barack Obama's birth if the Senator was born in Hawaii, but Ogombe would not answer the question, instead he repeatedly tried to insert that, ""No, No, No. He was born in the United States!""

That's not what we heard on the tape. What we heard was a very rough translation in which an elderly woman agreed to the leading question that Obama was born in Kenya and that she was present. But it was immediately and clearly corrected -- repeatedly. When we contacted Trump’s organization, Michael Cohen, his political aide, referred us to Jerome R. Corsi, author of The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, which makes a case against Obama, calling him a political extremist who associates with radicals and has disturbing connections to Islam. (PolitiFact found the book was riddled with errors).  In a brief telephone interview with PolitiFact, Corsi said he has spoken to Trump and that the statement about Obama's grandmother was, in fact, based on her taped conversation with McRae. Corsi pointed us toward an article he wrote for the conservative WorldNetDaily, in which he says that he spoke to two unnamed Kenyans familiar with Sarah Obama's dialect, and that they claimed she was clear in saying that she witnessed Obama's birth in Kenya. Futhermore, Corsi said they told him it appeared her later efforts to recant appeared to be heavily coached by those around her. Corsi has a book questioning Obama's birthplace coming out next month. We note that in a Chicago Tribune story in March 2007, national correspondent Tim Jones wrote that in an interview with Sarah Obama, she said she received the news of Obama's birth via a letter to her in Kenya and that she was ""was so happy to have a grandchild in the U.S.""

Trump is serving up re-heated leftovers that have long ago been debunked. Anyone who listens to the tape of the phone conversation with Sarah Obama can hear how tightly you need to edit this interview to present it as evidence of a presidential cover-up. We rule Trump's claim that Obama's grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya False. Addendum: While researching this story, we sent an e-mail seeking comment from Bishop Ron McRae, who conducted the trans-Atlantic interview with Sarah Obama. We received this letter from McRae after our story published.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/96d0c18c-2c04-40d8-83c6-54cfbbfbc004",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC8A40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-president-obamas-grandmother-cau/

John Boehner says interim spending bill would cut $12 billion
","
With the possibility of a government shutdown looming, Republicans have been saying their temporary spending bill will cut $12 billion.

The statement was made by several key GOP members, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Here's what he said in a statement touting the bill, which would extend government funding by another week while also providing funds to the Pentagon for the remainder of the year.

""As I’ve said throughout this process, since the spending binge in Washington is hurting job creation in this country, we’re going to fight for the largest cuts possible – real cuts, not more smoke and mirrors,"" Boehner said in the April 5, 2011, statement. ""We’ve made clear that Democrats’ $33 billion proposal is not enough, and much of it is based on gimmicks. To make a positive impact on our economy, the cuts need to be significant, and they need to be real. Failing to make real cuts will send a signal to job creators that Washington is still not serious about getting government spending under control.  ...

""We’re not going to allow the Senate and White House to force us to choose between two options that are bad for America, whether it’s a bad deal that fails to make real spending cuts, or accepting a government shutdown due to Senate inaction. We’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year. We may pass this to keep the government running if Democrats don’t listen to the American people and get serious about cutting spending.""

At issue is this line: ""We’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week.""

Indeed, while the bill does include $12 billion in cuts, it also includes $7.6 billion in additional spending for the Defense Department -- a 1.5 percent increase over last year’s level. (This news release from the House Appropriations Committee breaks down the numbers in the bill.)

So the net amount of cuts is $4.4 billion -- roughly one-third of the $12 billion figure Boehner cited in his statement.

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, considers the emphasis on the $12 billion figure misleading.

""Saying the continuing resolution cuts $12 billion while ignoring the $7.6 billion in defense adds is like saying you met your weight loss goals if you don’t count your backside,"" Ellis quipped in an e-mail.

We asked Boehner’s office for the speaker’s perspective, but we did not hear back.

We find that Boehner, who decried budget ""gimmicks"" in his statement, is conveniently leaving out the spending increase and painting a misleading picture of the bill.

Boehner’s statement -- ""we’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year"" -- is carefully worded. The bill does include $12 billion in cuts to discretionary spending, and it does fund the Defense Department, as he indicated.

But we also think Boehner’s artful wording suggests a much larger cut than the bill actually delivers when the additional defense spending is included. Using the net figure for spending reductions would have been a more accurate description. On balance, we rate Boehner’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966FB340>],/factchecks/2011/apr/07/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-interim-spending-bill-would-cut-/

Tim Kaine says Virginia named best managed state, best for business while he was governor
","
Democrat Timothy M. Kaine launched his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign on April 5 by touting his record as Virginia’s governor.  

Kaine said Virginia was named the ""best-managed state, best state for business and best state in which to raise a child"" during his term from 2006 to 2010. (Virginia law bars governors from serving consecutive terms).  

We wondered if Kaine had his facts right.

We turned to Governing magazine. Since 1999, it has been publishing a report by the non-partisan Pew Center on the States that grades each state on the strength of its management.

Under Kaine in 2008, Virginia was one of three states to earn an ""A-"" grade, topping the rankings alongside Utah and Washington.

The Pew report does not assign one-to-50 rankings to the states, meaning Utah and Washington can also claim to be ""best managed.""

Virginia’s reputation for well-managed government hardly begins with Kaine, however. Each of the four governors who preceded Kaine also claim credit for having run the best-managed state. That includes Republican George Allen, who is also running for Senate in 2012.

The state earned the best grades in Governing  in 2005 when Democrat Mark Warner was governor and in 1999 under Republican Jim Gilmore.

Financial World magazine researched and published similar ratings -- independent of Pew -- in the 1990s.  Virginia received the top management grade in 1995 and 1996 under Allen, and in 1992 and 1993 under the governorship of Democrat Doug Wilder.

The Pew report looks at a state’s performance and resources in four major categories: money, infrastructure, people and information. The diverse topics means a state’s record is dependant on many people, including elected officials and state employees. The state’s 2008 mark under Kaine was unchanged from the ""A-"" grade received in 2005 under Warner.

Virginia’s ranking as the top state for doing business comes from Forbes, the financial magazine. The state took first place each year from 2006 to 2009. In 2009 the publication said Virginia earned the top spot thanks to a highly-trained workforce, a favorable regulatory environment and high quality of life.

As governor, Kaine had only indirect control over most of these factors. Although he certainly had a say in tax rates and regulations, he had little sway over how many Virginians earned college degrees during his term and many quality-of-life issues.

But the facts match Kaine’s claim about the state being rated best for business during his tenure.  

Last year the state surrendered the top spot to Utah and placed second in the Forbes survey. Despite the drop, the magazine still had high praise for Virginia’s business climate. Utah had narrowly trailed Virginia in 2009.

The claim about Virginia being the best state to raise a child comes from a 2007 report by Education Weekand the Pew Center on the States. The survey examined education test scores, high school graduation rates, family income and even the education level of Virginia parents. Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Maryland rounded out the top five.

Like the other categories, Kaine can’t claim credit for all of these successes. He certainly didn’t play a role in how many Virginians went to college during the years or decades before he became governor.

Let’s review our findings.

Virginia has long-earned top marks for state management, finishing at or near the top of virtually every survey in that category for 20 years. Kaine built upon a strong legacy of management established by his predecessors from both parties. He deserves credit, however, for keeping the state near the top. He was handed a Cadillac and drove it well.

We rate his statements True.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA1380>],/factchecks/2011/apr/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginia-named-best-managed-state-b/

State Rep. Armond Budish says one-quarter of African Americans don't have photo ID
","
It’s normal for House Democrats and Republicans to have sharp divides, but last month’s heated debate over a controversial voter ID law added a new ingredient to the partisan stew: race.

Democrats, including several black members of the caucus, in no uncertain terms, accused Republicans of targeting minority populations with the proposal to require all Ohioans to show government-issued ID at polling locations. Democrats saw the move in racial terms because of what they said was clear evidence black voters are more likely not to have photo IDs than white voters.

Rep. Armond Budish, the House Democratic leader, implored House Speaker William G. Batchelder to not move the legislation forward. In a March 22 letter to the speaker, Budish said groups such as senior citizens, college students, poor citizens and black residents would suffer because they are more likely to not have a photo ID.

""Across the United States, 25 percent of voting age African Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require,"" Budish wrote.

Surely there are African-Americans in the United States who don’t have photo ID (as do a portion of every racial group), but could a full quarter of 41 million black Americans be without IDs? Politifact Ohio decided to take a look.

The legislation would require voters to show one of four forms of ID when voting in person — an Ohio driver license, state ID, military ID or passport. House Republicans added a provision that would allow an expired driver license be used - a measure aimed at helping seniors comply with the ID law.

The claim about 25 percent of African Americans became the underpinning for the racially-charged accusations lobbed at Ohio Republicans. Rep. Tracy Maxwell Heard, a Columbus Democrat who is black, repeated it at a news conference March 23.

Later that same day, the House passed the bill along party lines. It’s now pending in the Ohio Senate.

We asked Budish where Democrats got the 25 percent figure they were using  to make the case that the Ohio law would impact blacks disproportionately. He cited a report from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.

The report, ""Citizens Without Proof,"" is based on a telephone survey conducted by Opinion Research Corp., an independent polling firm. It surveyed 987 randomly selected voting-age Americans over four days in November 2006.

Those surveyed were asked, ""Do they have a current, unexpired government issued ID with their picture on it?"" Among the African Americans, 25 percent have no current government-issued photo ID, according to the survey. For white adults, the rate was 8 percent. The margin of error, the Brennan Center states, for that particular statistic is plus or minus 8 percent—meaning the actual statistic is probably between 17 and 33 percent.

It was clear that one five-year-old national survey had found a quarter of African Americans without proper ID, but were there other studies of this issue?

Some sleuthing in the political science academic journals turned up a 2007 study done in Georgia — one of only two states in the country with an ID requirement similar to the one proposed in Ohio — that found a much lower portion of African-Americans without photo ID.

This study found that only 6.8 percent of blacks did not have a proper government-issued photo ID. However, that same study found that 3.7 percent of white adults in Georgia did not a photo ID — a finding that tended to support the outrage from Ohio Democrats that the proposed law would disproportionately targeting black adults.

A study from Wisconsin found much higher percentage of black adults without state ID. Statewide, 80 percent of men and 81 percent of women had a valid drivers license, the study found. But only 45 percent of black males and 51 percent of black females had a driver’s license or other form of state ID

PolitiFact Ohio checked with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles for information on how many black Ohioans have driver’s license or state IDs, but the bureau does not track individuals by race.

So add it up and what do we have?

A national study did find 25 percent of African Americans don’t have the kind of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, that the Ohio proposal would require. But the study has a sizable margin of error -- 8 percent -- and that it was done in 2006. It may be the most current research available, but Budish’s statement was made in the present tense about data that is five years old.

Budish was using the national statistic to argue that the new law would disproportionately impact potential black voters in Ohio. Yet there has been no study of this issue in Ohio so there are no specific figures for the state population. ID rates in other states where studies were done differed greatly.

So while Budish’s statement is accurate, it leaves out those important details needed to understand it in full context. On the Truth-O-Meter that rates as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A55F80>],/factchecks/2011/apr/07/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-one-quarter-african-a/

Debbie Stabenow says government shutdown “could disrupt"" veterans' benefits
","
With a possible government shutdown looming, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., is backing legislation that would make sure the paychecks for members of Congress stop along with everything else. Although similar measures have been proposed, so far congressional paychecks are still intact.

We addressed this proposal more generally in a separate item. But for this item, we were more interested in checking one of the arguments Stabenow made as she argued for the bill’s passage.

""Lawmakers need to be held accountable and should feel the impact of a government shutdown just like many other Americans will,"" Stabenow said in a March 1, 2011, news release. ""A shutdown could disrupt Social Security checks, veterans' benefits, hold up exports and cost private sector jobs and will stop paychecks for hundreds of thousands of people. It's only fair that members of Congress' paychecks be stopped too.""

You can read our analysis of whether a shutdown would endanger Social Security checks in our rating of a statement by President Barack Obama here. In this item, we’ll look what could happen to veterans’ benefits.

First, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
   
The Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."" This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.""

The biggest risk for veterans benefit checks comes from the fact that employees of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs are paid through appropriated funds. So a shutdown could prevent those employees -- just like employees of the Social Security Administration -- from going to work.

How many VA employees would be considered ""essential"" -- and thus would stay on the job during a shutdown -- and how many would not remains to be seen. Many VA employees are doctors and nurses at VA hospitals and are unlikely to be furloughed. This situation for benefits employees is not yet clear.

As a practical matter, the department has a bit of a cushion. Veterans’ benefit checks go out at the beginning of every month, so if a shutdown starts April 8 -- as would happen if lawmakers cannot agree on a deal -- there wouldn’t be widespread problems for existing beneficiaries for a few weeks. However, if a new month dawned with the government still on hiatus, a new round of checks could indeed be delayed, depending on which employees are deemed ""essential.""

""If it goes beyond the first of the next month, you may see disruptions there,"" said David Autry, a spokesman for Disabled American Veterans. Checks for veterans from the Defense Department would be subject to the same types of uncertainties as those sent by the VA.

In the meantime, two other benefits-related activities could be curtailed by a shutdown, depending on staff availability. Answers to routine inquiries from veterans could be slowed or stopped entirely. And there might be no employees to handle new claims for benefits.

During the last government shutdown in 1995, ""more than 400,000 veterans saw their disability benefits and pension claims delayed,"" Senate Veterans Affairs Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., said, according to the Army Times. ""Money that they were counting on didn’t come to them. Payment of GI Bill education checks were delayed for hundreds of thousands of our veterans. Telephone calls from our veterans to veterans’ benefits offices went unanswered. Mail from veterans to our VA offices wasn’t opened. It wasn’t answered.""

So where does this leave us? By saying that a government shutdown ""could disrupt ... veterans' benefits,"" Stabenow phrased her statement cautiously, and, for the most part, accurately. A shutdown is not destined to disrupt checks to veterans, but it could -- either for new claims, or, if the shutdown drags on long enough, for existing beneficiaries.

Stabenow could have added that a shorter shutdown in line with the duration of those in 1995, or a generous allocation of ""essential"" employees, could minimize or even eliminate the impact on veterans checks this year. But we think that’s a minor omission, given how carefully she couched her statement. On balance, we rate her comment True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C99C40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/06/debbie-stabenow/debbie-stabenow-says-government-shutdown-could-dis/

Nancy Pelosi says GOP bill would deprive 6 million seniors of meals
","
CORRECTION: In the initial version of the story, we speculated that the number of people who could be deprived of meals due to the proposed cuts could range from 2 million to 4 million. However, an alert reader pointed out that we neglected to factor in the obvious reality that people eat every day, so the number of people affected would be much smaller. We have revised this item to reflect that. However, this error doesn’t affect our ruling of Half True, since we still believe that Pelosi’s estimate of 6 million meals was calculated reasonably, and that her error came from misspeaking as she described the statistic at the public event.

On April 4, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made an appearance with a group called the Hunger Fast Coalition in which she took aim at her Republican rivals’ budget priorities.
   
""In one of the bills before us, 6 million seniors are deprived of meals – homebound seniors are deprived of meals,"" Pelosi said. ""People ask us to find our common ground, the middle ground. Is middle ground 3 million seniors not receiving meals? I don’t think so. We’ve got to take this conversation from a debate about numbers and dollar figures and finding middle ground there, to the higher ground of national values. I don’t think the American people want any one of those 6 million people to lose their meals.""
   
The comment attracted a fair amount of attention in the blogosphere, so we thought it was worth a check. We’ll focus on whether 6 million seniors would in fact be denied meals if Republican budget plans are enacted.
   
When we contacted Pelosi’s office, they walked us through their calculations. But first, they acknowledged an error in Pelosi’s remark: She should have said ""6 million meals for seniors,"" not meals for ""6 million seniors."" So right from the beginning, we’ll have to downgrade her original comment’s accuracy.
   
Setting that aside, how good is the rest of Pelosi’s math?
   
First, Pelosi’s office elaborated that the Republican bill she was referring to was H.R. 1, a fiscal year 2011 spending bill that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. The bill specifies that aging services programs within the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration on Aging will get about $1.4 million. That’s roughly 5 percent below the funding for those programs during fiscal year 2010.
   
This 5 percent cut is relevant to Pelosi’s comment because it refers to the budget category that includes federal nutrition programs for seniors. According to HHS, these programs are designed to ""reduce hunger and food insecurity; promote socialization of older individuals; and promote the health and well-being of older individuals and delay adverse health conditions through access to nutrition and other disease prevention and health promotion services.""
   
Generally speaking, this funding goes either toward ""Home-Delivered Nutrition Services,"" which helps deliver meals to homebound seniors, and ""Congregate Nutrition Services,"" which provides meals at senior centers and other centralized locations.
   
In fiscal year 2010, total funding for these nutrition programs was just under $819.5 million. Cutting 5 percent from this amount would mean a reduction of nearly $41 million. Pelosi’s office said when they made the calculations, they actually used a more conservative estimate -- a 3.6 percent reduction -- so by their math, the cut would actually be $30 million.
   
And how deep is the impact of either a 3.6 percent cut or a 5 percent cut? We found data for fiscal year 2009 showing that the program funded roughly 149.2 million home-delivered meals and 92.5 million centralized meals. Together, that adds up to about 242 million meals. A 5 percent cut from that amount would be 12.1 million meals. A 3.6 percent cut would affect 8.7 million meals.
   
But once again, Pelosi’s calculations were conservative. Her office used 193 million meals as its baseline, rather than 242 million. Using this smaller starting point, a 5 percent cut would mean a reduction of 9.7 million meals, while a 3.6 percent cut would mean a reduction of 6.9 million meals.
   
The 6.9 million figure, her office said, is the source of the statistic Pelosi cited in her appearance with the Hunger Fast Coalition.
   
As far as we can tell, Pelosi’s math seems sound -- at every turn, she erred on the cautious side, up to and including the final step, in which she rounded 6.9 million down to 6 million, rather than up to 7 million, which would have been entirely justified. So 6 million meals is a conservative estimate; the true number could well be higher, and her methodology provides her with a large cushion for error.
   
In other words, Pelosi’s problem wasn’t her math; it was how she reported her math at the event. So ultimately, Pelosi is wrong, but we think she deserves credit for taking a cautious approach in cobbling together her numbers. On balance, we rate he claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2F5140>],/factchecks/2011/apr/06/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-gop-bill-would-deprive-six-milli/

Steve Moore says ratio of people working in government, manufacturing is “an almost exact reversal"" of pattern in 1960
","
In an April 1, 2011, op-ed column, Steve Moore -- the senior economics writer for the Wall Street Journal editorial page and a longtime conservative activist -- wrote a column titled, ""We've Become a Nation of Takers, Not Makers."" In it, he bemoaned divergent trendlines for government employment, which he described as increasing, and manufacturing, which he described as decreasing.

""If you want to understand better why so many states — from New York to Wisconsin to California — are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, consider this depressing statistic: Today in America there are nearly twice as many people working for the government (22.5 million) than in all of manufacturing (11.5 million). This is an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960, when there were 15 million workers in manufacturing and 8.7 million collecting a paycheck from the government. … We have moved decisively from a nation of makers to a nation of takers.""

Several readers asked us to take a look at Moore’s column. We’ll focus on his contention that the ratio of people working for the government and working in manufacturing today is ""an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960.""

We turned to the historical employment data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found:

Total government employment, January 1960: 8,307,000
Total government employment, March 2011: 22,166,000

Total manufacturing employment, January 1960: 15,687,000
Total manufacturing employment, March 2011: 11,667,000

To us, all of these numbers appear quite close to what Moore wrote. So he’s right on the numbers. But is he correct that today’s numbers show ""an almost exact reversal of the situation in 1960""?

That’s less clear.

We found a somewhat different story if you swap out Moore’s raw employment numbers and instead use the numbers for each of the sector’s share of total U.S. employment. Doing it this way takes into account the increasing size of the American work force over more than 50 years -- it grew from 54.2 million workers in 1960 to 130.7 million workers in 2011. Here are the percentages:

Total government share of U.S. employment, January 1960: 15 percent
Total government share of U.S. employment, March 2011: 17 percent

Total manufacturing share of U.S. employment, January 1960: 29 percent
Total manufacturing share of U.S. employment, March 2011: 9 percent

What this shows is that government’s proportion of the work force has increased -- but by a relatively modest rate. Meanwhile, manufacturing -- for countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology -- has fallen off a cliff during the past 50 years.

To us, the comparison of jobs in government and manufacturing looks less like ""an almost exact reversal,"" as Moore puts it, than two largely unrelated changes.

We’ll add a final point of context. Several other employment sectors grew at faster rates over the 50-year period than government did. The leisure and hospitality sector, for instance, grew from 6.3 percent of the workforce in 1960 to 10 percent in 2011, and professional business services roughly doubled, from 6.8 percent in 1960 to 13.1 percent in 2011. So, other types of private-sector employment -- jobs that don’t ""make"" anything -- took up some of the slack from manufacturing’s decline.

So where does this leave us? Moore’s raw employment numbers for manufacturing and government are accurate, but adding context about the size of the labor force as a whole weakens the notion that the trendlines are an ""exact reversal.""

Congress can't agree on cutting its own pay in the event of a government shutdown
","We’ve found something Republicans and Democrats say they agree on: If Congress shuts down, members of Congress should not be paid during the closure. Current law says they get their paychecks, shut down or no.

Yet when someone actually proposes changing the law, things start to get a little, well, weird.

We figured it was time for a fact-check when Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., accused House Republicans of voting down language she had proposed to stop the congressional paychecks. Instead, she said, the Republicans adopted a bill containing a provision designed to ensure that it would die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

""Attaching their pay measure to a bill that has no prayer of ever becoming law shows House Republicans are not serious about ‘no budget, no pay,’"" Boxer said Friday. ""This is nothing more than an April Fools’ Day gimmick.""

Back in February, Boxer announced she was introducing legislation to stop members of Congress from being paid during a shutdown.

""Failing to keep the government open because of politics, or because there’s no will to compromise, is a failure of government,"" Boxer said. ""If the government is forced to shutdown, members of Congress and the president should be treated like all other federal employees: We should not be paid. And to take it one step further, we should not be paid retroactively once the government re-opens.""

It’s strange but true: Members of Congress get paid during a shutdown, even though most other federal employees do not. Also exempt from a pay freeze are the president, presidential appointees, certain legislative branch employees and employees either doing emergency work or ensuring an orderly shutdown, according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report noted that in the past federal employees were paid retroactively once shutdowns ended.

Boxer’s bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 1.

Now let’s look and see what’s happened over in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

The House voted on Friday, April 1, 2011, to stop pay for members of Congress as part of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. But the act also contained a provision that the Democrats in the Senate were sure to reject.

The act says that if the Senate doesn’t approve a budget, then the provisions of the House budget bill already rejected by the Senate ""are hereby enacted into law."" The original Republican budget proposal had been rejected by the Senate on a 44-56 vote back on March 9.

So House Republicans are asking the Senate to approve a bill that says if the Senate didn’t approve another bill, the House version of the budget becomes law. That would appear to violate the U.S. Constitution, which says both chambers must approve laws which then must be signed by the president.

We’ve never heard of anything like this before, and we were frankly perplexed by the idea. We asked majority leader Eric Cantor’s office for a comment on this, but we didn’t hear back.

So we turned to longtime government watcher Norm Ornstein of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

""First of all, it is farcical,"" Ornstein said. ""Of course, no bill can be ‘deemed’ into law without passage by both houses in identical form and the signature of the president (or a veto overridden by two-thirds of both houses). … I have never seen anything like this, for good reason.""

""This is all about one thing and one thing only: trying to shift blame if there is a shutdown,"" he added.

Getting back to Boxer’s statement, she said the House had a chance to vote on a more straightforward ""no budget, no pay"" bill, without the references to one-chamber approval of the House budget bill.

There was a motion to substitute the text of Boxer’s bill and remove references to H.R. 1, the house budget bill. But the motion, proposed by Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minn., failed on a largely party line vote, with Republicans voting no and Democrats voting yes.

Finally, there’s one more issue at work here, and it’s a significant one: It might be unconstitutional for Congress to cut its own pay or that of the president.

Article II, Section 1 says the president’s compensation ""shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected."" The 27th amendment, meanwhile, says, ""No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.""

So the whole argument over ""no budget, no pay"" may be moot anyway.

So to sum up: The House passed a bill to stop pay for members during a shutdown. But the measure clearly had a poison pill provision on a different topic -- the budget itself, which is the cause of the impasse in the first place. The House did have a chance to vote on something similar to Boxer’s bill, but it turned it down on a near party-line vote. So Boxer is correct on that point. There’s still a question whether her bill is would pass constitutional muster. We won’t find out, though, because the two chambers seem unlikely to agree on legislation. Given that impasse, we rate Boxer’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E04C0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/06/barbara-boxer/congress-cant-agree-cutting-its-own-pay-event-gove/

RNC Chair Reince Priebus says U.S. has lost 26 million jobs under Barack Obama
","
During an interview on NBC’s Today show on April 5, 2011, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy.

Asked by host Meredith Vieira whether the recent run of job growth and falling unemployment numbers ""throw a real monkey wrench"" into his party’s argument, Priebus said, ""No, not at all. Under this president, he’s promised millions and millions of jobs. We’ve lost 26 million jobs, Meredith, since he’s been president. He promised under an $850 billion stimulus program that we’d be on a path to recovery. We’ll none of that has come true. … I think that pointing out a snail’s pace in the job (growth) numbers is not going to be enough to undo 26 million jobs that are lost, Meredith.""

We wondered: Has the number of jobs really declined by 26 million since Obama has been president?

The answer: Not by any standard method of calculating job losses.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers. We found that in January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, 133,563,000 Americans were employed. Today, that number is 130,738,000. That’s a significant decline -- but of 2.8 million jobs, a number roughly a tenth of what Priebus cited.

We then looked at the difference between the highest level of employment during the recent recession and the lowest level. From its peak in December 2007 to its bottom in February 2010, a total of 8.7 million jobs were lost. That’s still only about one-third of the number Priebus gave -- and that period was split roughly evenly between the presidencies of George W. Bush and Obama.

We arrived at these figures, as economists do, by comparing job gains with job losses to determine a net total. It’s theoretically possible that 26 million jobs were lost during the Obama presidency and that 23.2 million jobs were created, leaving a net of 2.8 million jobs lost. But even if that were the case, economists across the political spectrum say it would be highly misleading of Priebus to focus on the job losses without citing the offsetting job gains.

It would not be ""kosher to count only one-half of the jobs equation,"" said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said it would be ""absurd"" to cite the gross job numbers instead of the net numbers.

Just for a sense of scale, if it were a net number, losing 26 million jobs, as Priebus indicated, would mean losing about 20 percent of the nation’s jobs -- something on the scale of the Great Depression.

We e-mailed the Republican National Committee’s press office for an explanation, but they did not reply by the time we posted this story.

Perhaps Priebus simply misspoke, or perhaps he misplaced a decimal point and ended up wrong by a factor of 10. Whatever the reason, the 26 million figure he cited on the Today show was ridiculously wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C99340>],/factchecks/2011/apr/06/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-us-has-lost-26-milli/
"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson says federal health care law for the first time in U.S. history penalizes a personal inaction
","
Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently revisited a favored theme -- predicting harmful consequences if ""government-led"" health care takes full effect under the bill Democrats pushed through in 2010.

In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the junior senator from Wisconsin added a new twist, saying the law would make history by requiring individuals to purchase an insurance plan:

""For the first time in U.S. history, a personal inaction (not purchasing something, in this case, a health- insurance plan) will be deemed unlawful,"" Johnson’s piece said. ""The person not committing this act (or is it committing an inaction?) will be subject to a fine. Or is it now, as the government contends, a tax? I'm confused.""

That’s a pretty sweeping claim.

After all, all of U.S. history goes back 235 years. And its seems like there are other penalties for not doing something, such as buying auto insurance.

We asked Johnson communications director Mary Vought for support for the senator’s claim.

She acknowledged there are other examples but said ""we’re not aware of any other requirement as broad as this. The 2010 health care law requires every American to purchase health insurance as a condition of being alive and a human being.""

Johnson is referring to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- which the GOP derisively labels ObamaCare. It does call for monetary penalties against taxpayers who fail to get health coverage. The tax penalties would be collected by the IRS.

That mandate is being challenged in court as unconstitutional and likely headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.

But that is far from the only example where there is a penalty for not doing something.

We mentioned auto insurance, a requirement in most states. There is the requirement that males register for Selective Service at age 18. At various levels of government, there are requirements to pay taxes, clear snow from your sidewalk, install a smoke detector and show up for jury duty, to name a few.

All carry penalties for inaction.

A spirited debate has taken place over how they compare to the health care mandate.

Anup Malani, a University of Chicago law professor, and Henry Aaron, a health care expert at Brookings Institution, listed several instances where legal mandates penalize inaction. They contrasted them with the health care purchase mandate this way: 
Critics contend the health care mandate would lead to unlimited government power under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

""Can the government compel you to buy broccoli or buy membership in a health club?"" asked Roger Pilon, director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Constitutional Studies. ""The other side can’t come up with any credible argument as to why the government couldn’t do this once you’ve opened the door.""

Two state attorneys general, Richard Cordray and Tom Miller, took the opposing view at Politico.com.

""We live under mandates every day. Without them, society as we know it would disintegrate... ""We can -- and do -- argue about what shape these laws should take, without claiming that our leaders are constitutionally barred from dealing with our most pressing problems.""

Let’s take a closer look at Johnson’s statement.

If Johnson had limited his statement to federal penalties under the Commerce Clause for not purchasing a product, that would likely be unprecedented.

Pilon and Malani agreed that there is no precedent for the feds using the Commerce Clause to compel an individual to buy a product from a private vendor, under penalty of law.

Although it’s dated, a 1994 Congressional Budget Office paper on an earlier proposal to mandate purchase of insurance concluded that  ""the government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States.""

But that’s not what Johnson wrote -- and his office did not seek to limit the meaning. His statement was much broader, making the comparison to a whole range of duties under local, state and federal law and the constitution.

Vought, Johnson’s spokeswoman, said the health mandate trumps all other existing mandates because it is universal.

Vought wrote: ""Some Americans are not required to file a tax return, because they fall below a minimum income threshold. Millions of Americans are not required to purchase auto insurance, or wear a seat belt, because they do not own a car.""

But the health care mandate itself has exemptions, so it will not be as broad in practice as Johnson maintains.

Taxpayers who can’t afford it, can’t get health coverage or object on religious grounds can be held harmless from penalties even if they lack ""minimum essential"" coverage, according to a Congressional Research Service summary.

Let’s wrap up.

Johnson, in a bold and broad claim, says the health care mandate is unprecedented in imposing penalties for failure to get insured. But experts agree there is already a long list of ""personal inactions"" penalized by the government, such as failure to buy auto insurance or attend jury duty. And Johnson’s contention that the health mandate is broader than all the other mandates -- even if true -- doesn’t negate that fact.

This merits a False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977A4E80>],/factchecks/2011/apr/06/ron-johnson/us-sen-ron-johnson-says-federal-health-care-law-fi/

State Rep. Mike Villarreal says craft beer is the only segment of the beer market that's growing
","
Plugging legislation that would allow restaurants that brew their own beer to sell their bottled suds to a beer distributor, state Rep. Mike Villarreal suggested craft brewers are ""the future"" of the beer industry.

""The only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment,"" the San Antonio Democrat said during a March 22 press conference about House Bill 660, which was left pending in a House committee.

Responding to our query, Peter Clark, Villarreal’s legislative director, passed on a March 21 press release from the Colorado-based Brewers Association, a trade association representing craft brewers. The association defines a craft brewer as small (produces less than 6 million barrels a year), independent (less than 25 percent is owned by an alcoholic beverage industry member who isn’t a craft brewer) and traditional (at least 50 percent of its total production volume is malt beer or beer that enhances the flavor with grains such as barley or wheat).

According to the release, small and independent craft brewers saw production increase 11 percent and retail sales increase 12 percent in 2010. But total U.S. beer sales were down 2.2 percent in 2009 and 1 percent in 2010. Total beer volume dropped from 205.7 million barrels in 2009 to 203.6 million in 2010, the release says.

The National Beer Wholesalers Association, which represents 3,300 licensed independent U.S.  beer distributors issued a press release the following day applauding craft brewers’ ""continued growth.""

Harry Schuhmacher, editor of Beer Business Daily, a trade publication focused on the commercial beer industry, told us that Villarreal’s claim is ""definitely true."" He likewise cited the Brewers Association, which he said tracks craft beer volumes, and the Washington-based Beer Institute, a lobbying group that tracks the entire industry.

The Beer Institute pointed us to statistics showing that total estimated domestic beer production decreased 1.6 percent from 2009-10.

Craft beer ""has really taken on a life of its own in the last four or five years,"" Schuhmacher said. ""And the beer industry itself has always grown"" until 2008, when the recession hit, he said. ""Ironically, craft beer, which is the highest-priced segment in the beer industry, continued to grow and indeed accelerate.""

Texas has followed the nationwide trends tracked by the Brewers Association and the Beer Institute, said Rick Donley, president of the Texas Beer Alliance, which supports Villarreal’s bill. ""The only thing that has a real growth to it right now is the craft beer segment,"" he said.

The Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas, which opposes the legislation, didn’t respond to our query.

The sales trend in microbrews hasn’t been lost on the big brewers. On March 28, Anheuser-Busch announced plans to buy Chicago craft beermaker Goose Island. ""Sales of these more expensive and more sophisticated craft beers are a tiny drop in the bucket compared to mass market beer sales, but they’re growing faster than mainstream beers,"" according to a National Public radio story about the deal.

Last September, CNBC reported that publicly-traded craft beer companies had seen ""explosive growth"" in the U.S. while overall beer sales were down. And an August MarketWatch report said: ""While beer consumption in recent quarters has remained mostly anemic for the major commercial beer brewers... sales for premium or so-called craft beers have continued at a steady pace.""

We rate Villarreal’s statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809712D5C0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/06/mike-villarreal/state-rep-mike-villarreal-says-craft-beer-only-seg/

Tufts Health Plan CEO says judges have split 3-2 on constitutionality of new health law
","
While Republicans have been trying to repeal last year's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Congress, critics have challenged the new health care law in court, mostly asserting that the provision that requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty is unconstitutional. According to The Heritage Foundation, 27 states have sued or are planning to sue to block the law.

On the WPRI interview program Newsmakers, aired April 3 and taped April 1, James Roosevelt Jr., chief executive officer of Tufts Health Plan, who is helping Rhode Island prepare for implementation of the law, was asked whether the effort should be delayed until the law's constitutionality has been resolved.

""Two courts have found it's unconstitutional to have the individual mandate, the one that makes people take personal responsibility to have insurance. Three courts have found that it is constitutional,"" said Roosevelt. ""It will also go through three different courts of appeal. So the Supreme Court will get it with different points of view. I think that preparing for the bill is really important.""

We were curious whether Roosevelt's scorecard was correct, especially in light of assertions of some critics that the law is unconstitutional based on a ruling in Florida.

PolitiFact National last looked at the issue on Feb. 6 after President Obama, in an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, was asked about the Florida decision. Obama said 12 judges had rejected ""the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional.""

PolitiFact ruled that Mr. Obama's statement was False.

Although a dozen court cases had been dismissed for procedural reasons, two federal judges -- both appointed by Democrats -- had ruled that the individual mandate was legal and two others -- both appointed by Republicans -- had ruled that the mandate was unconstitutional.

When a check of the White House's health care blog turned up no reference to a fifth case, Roosevelt's office called our attention to Margaret Peggy Lee Mead et al. versus Eric H. Holder Jr. et al, which was decided in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Feb. 22.

The five plaintiffs argued that the requirement to buy insurance required them to purchase something they would never use. Three had also objected to the mandate on religious grounds, saying that God would provide for them. Two objected because the health plan would not cover their holistic treatments.

Judge Gladys Kessler, a Clinton appointee, upheld the law after ruling that Congress has clear authority under the federal Commerce Clause to regulate insurance markets. In her ruling, she declared that most of the millions of Americans without health insurance ""consume medical services they cannot pay for,"" and ""those who choose not to purchase health insurance will ultimately get a 'free ride' on the backs of those Americans who have made responsible choices to provide for the illness we all must face at some point in our lives.""

The new law, she said, was a constitutionally acceptable way to stabilize the price of health insurance.

Kessler, in granting the government's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, rejected the religious arguments, saying the purchase requirement would be an insignificant affront to their religious beliefs.

So the score is three rulings upholding the law, two finding it unconstitutional. For now.

"['Elections', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine said he would not run for Senate
","
The worst-kept secret in Virginia is now official: Democrat Timothy M. Kaine is running for the U.S. Senate.

Kaine, a former governor and currently the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, made the announcement in an April 5 Twitter message. He’ll be seeking the seat next year held by Democrat Jim Webb, who is not running for re-election.

Webb announced his retirement on Feb. 9, confirming months of speculation that he would not run for a second term. The senator had shown little interest in raising money or assembling a campaign staff.

Three weeks before Webb said he was leaving, MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell put the big question before Kaine during an interview.

""And if Jim Webb does not run, would you consider that Senate race?"" she asked.

""No, I’ve got a job I really like right now, tough though it may be,"" Kaine said, referring to his DNC chairmanship. ""And I’m doing what the president wants me to do. And so, no, my full expectation is that I’m going to be supporting a great Virginia Democrat, and I believe that Virginia Democrat will be Jim Webb for the Senate seat.""

In late January, Kaine also told reporter Jim Nolan of the Richmond Times-Dispatch that another run for public office was unlikely -- at least until his 15-year-old daughter, now in high school, had finished up with college.

""I could wake up after Annella's out of college and say I want to do it, but I know myself pretty well,"" Kaine said. ""You get spoiled being an executive — being a legislator is not the best way for me to serve others right now, and I find it hard for me to contemplate a future where I say that is the best way for me to serve.""

No doubt, Kaine’s been under pressure to run since the moment Webb announced he would not.  Rank-and-file Democrats chanted ""Run, Tim, Run,"" at the state party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner on Feb. 14. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and state party Chairman Brian Moran said they wanted Kaine to join the race.

Perhaps the greatest pressure came Feb. 16, when President Barack Obama told a Richmond television reporter that he had been in touch with Kaine by phone and was eager to know what the former governor planned to do.

""I think he would be a great senator from Virginia if he chose to do that,"" Obama told NBC 12’s Ryan Nobles.

Before Webb’s retirement, Kaine said he was doing what the president wanted in serving as Obama’s hand-picked DNC chairman. But with the stakes for the Virginia senate seat growing, the president seems to have changed his mind about where he wants Kaine.

Former Gov. and U.S. Sen. George Allen is seeking the Republican nomination for the senate. Allen barely lost the seat to Webb in 2006. Also running in the GOP primary are Tea Party activist Jamie Radtke and David McCormick, a Virginia Beach lawyer.

Kaine appeared with Obama at a March 29 fundraiser in New York. The president said his ally would make an excellent legislator. Obama urged major donors to support Kaine if he joins the race.

While Kaine certainly said he would not run for the Senate, he also expressed a desire to do ""what the president wants me to do."" Once Webb said he would not seek reelection, Obama began encouraging Kaine to run.  

So we rate Kaine’s candidacy a Half Flip. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F3AA80>],/factchecks/2011/apr/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-said-he-would-not-run-senate/

Are Illinois property taxes really the highest in the country? Different sources say different things Illinois’ property tax rankings vary depending upon where you look. The Tax Foundation, an independent, nonpartisan think tank, ranked Illinois third in the nation in property tax burden. Popular personal finance sites like WalletHub placed Illinois property taxes as second highest in the nation, with New Jersey claiming the top spot. In fact, we could only find one source that ranked Illinois first in property tax burden. CoreLogic, a California-based corporation that provides various private and public clients with analytics on a variety of property and finance questions, ranked Illinois as the state with the highest property taxes. Looking at these three sources, Illinois was ranked first, second and third across the nation in property tax burden (with rates of 2.67 percent, 2.3 percent, and 1.98 percent, respectively). No doubt, Illinois property taxes are high. But we were curious where the differences in rates were coming from, and whether or not one was more accurate than the rest. So we reached out to CoreLogic, WalletHub and the Tax Foundation to ask about their methodologies. Let’s start with CoreLogic To calculate their property tax rates, CoreLogic responded that they first collected the annual tax amount for every property in the state. The market value of each property was information already contained in their databases. To calculate the tax rate, it was then just a matter of dividing the annual property tax by the fair market value of every property, To arrive at a state-level property tax rate, CoreLogic used the median tax rate, or the middle value in the range of rates they had collected. Wallethub used a slightly different approach WalletHub used 2015 data from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate their property tax rates.

Dividing the two, Wallethub arrived at its figures for each state’s property tax rate. The Tax Foundation also used Census data However, whereas WalletHub used the median home value and tax rate, the Tax Foundation used the average property tax rate. That explains one reason why Illinois property tax rates may be different. Although the median, or middle value, is often close to the average value, the two numbers are not necessarily the same. This could easily result in differences large enough to shift a few states in national rankings. Another reason for differences may be the the source of the initial data.

New York Times tweet fumbles comparisons of New England Patriots' visits to White House
","The New York Times faced criticism after implying in a tweet that far fewer members of the New England Patriots football team attended a White House visit with President Donald Trump than just two years ago with President Barack Obama. The newspaper’s sports account sent out a tweet that linked to a story about how fewer Patriots players were at the 2017 ceremony than in prior years. The tweet included the following images, and was sent out at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on April 19, 2017: Patriots' turnout for President Obama in 2015 vs. Patriots' turnout for President Trump today: https://t.co/OxMEOqZonI pic.twitter.com/pLmJWhOw1j The top image is the team’s trip to the White House on April 23, 2015, to celebrate the Patriots’ victory in Super Bowl XLIX. The bottom image is their April 19 visit for their come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI. The post was retweeted almost 49,000 times. The photos appear to show that a mere fraction of the team showed up to visit Trump, compared to the sprawling entourage that visited Obama. The comparison recalled the January 2017 dispute over images showing smaller crowds for Trump’s inauguration than for Obama’s 2009 swearing-in. But while several players were absent from the 2017 visit, it’s difficult to fairly compare the two photographs. The 2015 photo showed the team and its administrative staff, while the 2017 photo did not. The Patriots pointed this out at 8:45 p.m. the same day, noting that more than 40 staff members were seated instead of lining the staircases, forcing the New York Times to backpeddle a bit. These photos lack context. Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs. In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn. https://t.co/iIYtV0hR6Y Why no photo with the entire staff this year? ""That’s just what the White House chose to do,"" team spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Globe. The Patriots provided the Globe with a photo the team had tweeted of the ceremony’s rehearsal that did include more than 100 players and staffers. Thanks @realDonaldTrump & @WhiteHouse for the gracious hospitality today honoring the Super Bowl Champion New England #Patriots! pic.twitter.com/7AU8XsA5Xk Another tweet from the team included images that the Patriots said were a fair comparison by showing only the players and not the full staff. That example included a photo of the team visiting President George W. Bush on May 10, 2004. The New York Times updated its tweet by noting that the Patriots said 34 players visited in 2017 and 50 attended in 2015, but the total number of team and staff was ""roughly the same."" The newspaper’s story noted that several key Patriots players like LeGarrette Blount, Chris Long, Alan Branch, Dont’a Hightower, Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty had stayed away specifically because they did not support Trump. Patriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have described themselves as Trump’s friends. So has quarterback Tom Brady, who had announced in a statement before the gathering that he would be absent because of ""personal family matters."" Brady also skipped the 2015 ceremony. NESN Patriots reporter Doug Kyed tweeted out a list of players who did not attend the ceremony before the New York Times story published. We attempted to contact both the New York Times and the Patriots via phone and email, but neither responded with any comment beyond prior public statements. Another element to the attendance appears to be that, well, it’s just not all that special for a team that’s won five Super Bowls since 2002 to visit the White House. The New York Times story provided figures from James, who said 45 players went to the White House in 2002, when Bush was president, closer to 2015’s 50 players. But in 2004 and 2005, the players numbered closer to this week’s 34 player attendees. (WBZ-TV sports anchor Dan Roche tweeted 36 players went in 2004, and just 27 in 2005.) New York Times sports editor Jason Stallman took responsibility for the deflating juxtaposition in an emailed statement to the Washington Post: ""Bad tweet by me. Terrible tweet. I wish I could say it’s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I’m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. ""Once we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it."" Even so, Trump took to his Twitter account the next morning to accuse the Times of lying: Failing @nytimes, which has been calling me wrong for two years, just got caught in a big lie concerning New England Patriots visit to W.H. The White House had no further comment when we contacted a spokesman. Our ruling The New York Times’ comparison made it appear the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team’s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015. While many Patriots players did skip the April 19 ceremony, some to avoid Trump, the use of the images together made a false equivalency. The 2015 photo shows not just players, but also Patriots staff members, while the 2017 photo does not. The New York Times updated their tweet and story, and the sports editor has apologized. While fewer players showed up at this year’s White House ceremony, it wasn’t drastically different than similar situations in prior years. If we’re talking just players, the team has said 34 players visited in 2017, compared to 50 in 2015. This claim rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D8C4C0>],/factchecks/2017/apr/20/new-york-times/new-york-times-tweet-fumbles-comparisons-patriots-/

While mentioning Keystone XL, Donald Trump errs in saying pipelines must use only American steel
","Visiting the Badger State for the first time as president, Donald Trump made a claim about steel and the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that is similar to one his staff has already had to correct. While in Kenosha on April 18, 2017 to give a speech touting his ""Buy American"" agenda, Trump said in an interview with WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee: I support the concept of everything from the U.S. You know, I don't know if you saw, but I approved a pipeline, right, called the Keystone pipeline, and other pipelines. And I want them to use American steel, American product. I want it manufactured here. And I made those changes just before we signed it. I said, Where's the steel coming from? So, all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel, which is really a big factor. So, while mentioning the Keystone, which still needs approvals before it can be built, Trump is claiming ""all pipelines that are coming into"" the United States have to be made with American steel. The Keystone XL  Proposed by energy giant TransCanada, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Western Canada to Nebraska. Then it would connect with an existing pipeline system to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where the oil would be turned into petroleum products such as gasoline. The refineries export about two-thirds of their products; the rest is sold in the United States. The project had been in limbo for more than seven years when the company’s application to build the pipeline was rejected in November 2015 by President Barack Obama. He said the pipeline wouldn't serve U.S. national interests and would undercut America's global leadership on climate change. In contrast, Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build the Keystone and get ""a piece of the profits"" -- a pledge that’s been rated In the Works on PolitiFact’s Trump-O-Meter. An important step was taken in March 2017 when, at Trump’s urging, the State Department issued a presidential permit for the Keystone. The permit is necessary for the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. But before the pipeline can be built, it must win approval from the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners. The steel connection, meanwhile, relates to a memorandum regarding construction of American pipelines that Trump signed in January 2017. Keystone and steel The memorandum calls for U.S oil pipelines to use American steel in their construction -- but it is not an order carrying strict requirements. The memo directs the secretary of commerce to ""develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States,"" use materials and equipment produced in the United States, ""to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law."" Five weeks after Trump signed the memorandum, the White House stated explicitly that it does not apply to the Keystone XL. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that because the Keystone is not a ""new"" project, it is not bound by the memo. ""But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that (memorandum),"" she said. (The White House didn't provide us any information to back up Trump's claim.) While carrying the weight of the president’s signature, the memorandum has the force of law only over the executive branch of the federal government. (And for that matter, it is arguably a lesser form of presidential action than an executive order.) Moreover, as Reuters has reported, the memorandum contains ""legal language about ordering things to the maximum extent permitted by law, which is designed to preserve lots of wiggle-room""; and the attempt to mandate the use of American steel ""would almost certainly violate 70 years of settled international trade law."" Chris Weld, a Washington trade lawyer whose firm represents American steel companies, told the Washington Post that the memorandum is not a mandate, but rather  ""a message to U.S. pipeline operators to consider steps to purchase U.S.-produced iron and steel."" Meanwhile, the Keystone, while not yet under construction, is nevertheless well under way. TransCanada has said it already has purchase agreements for the 660,000 tons of steel it will use for the Keystone XL. Half is to come from the Arkansas plant of an India-based steelmaker, 10 percent from a plant in India and the rest imported from Canada and Italy. Trump, meanwhile, reportedly will sign an executive order directing the Commerce Department to investigate whether steel imports into the United States should be blocked on national security grounds. Our rating While mentioning the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, Trump said: ""All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel."" The White House made it clear weeks earlier that a memorandum signed by Trump related to the use of American steel does not apply to the Keystone -- only to new pipeline projects. And though the memorandum could put pressure on pipeline companies to use American steel, it does not contain any requirements that only American steel be used.

Even in a state Trump won, NC lawmaker says, most people still want him to release his taxes
","President Donald Trump has continued to break with decades of precedent in refusing to release his tax returns. Trump has said voters don’t care about his taxes – which PolitiFact ruled False, based on public polling both before and after the election that found most people do think he should release them. But have even voters in states that Trump won been clamoring to see his tax returns? One North Carolina lawmaker said they have. And he proposed that if Trump runs for re-election in 2020, he’ll have to release his taxes to get on the ballot in this crucial swing state. Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Democrat from Raleigh, introduced a bill with that requirement. In case its target was unclear, he called it the ""Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act,"" or the T.R.U.M.P. Act. ""I filed the T.R.U.M.P. Act because I believe every presidential candidate, including Donald Trump, should disclose their tax returns,"" Chaudhuri told The News & Observer. ""I did so for three reasons. First, every major party presidential candidate for the last 40 years has made his or her tax returns public. Second, such disclosures allow the public to know whether these candidates have conflicts of interest. For example, does Donald Trump have business dealings with Russia? Finally, this bill has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties, including Republican Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina."" We won’t check Chaudhuri’s claim about every major modern presidential candidate releasing tax returns, since the work has been done for us. Our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin previously ruled that same claim, as made by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, as Mostly True. But we were intrigued by Chaudhuri’s final claim, that ""this bill has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties."" Political polarization Chaudhuri’s sentence was phrased somewhat vaguely. It appears he’s talking about ""a majority of North Carolinians and (some) members of both parties."" Yet it’s also possible to read it as saying most members of both parties. But that’s unlikely, since if he had meant that he wouldn’t have needed the first part of the sentence, and in the end we interpreted it as some members of both political parties. In Congress, some barely even cuts it. Rep. Walter Jones was one of only two Republicans not to vote the party line last month, when Congress voted down an attempt by Democrats to pass a national bill similar to what Chaudhuri is proposing for North Carolina. But partisan polarization in Congress often doesn’t accurately reflect their constituents. So we’re more interested in what Chaudhuri had to say about public opinion statewide, since he’s promoting a state-level bill. His T.R.U.M.P. Act is likely a long shot, just like that doomed national bill, since Republicans also control the N.C. General Assembly. Some politicians and legal experts have also questioned whether such a bill – which has also been introduced in at least 24 other states – would even be constitutional. Nevertheless, it would be intriguing if Chaudhuri is right about widespread support behind this idea. So we began researching opinion polls to find out. A majority for or against? We discovered only one polling firm has asked voters in North Carolina this issue. But its research backs up Chaudhuri’s claim. Most North Carolinians do want Trump to release his taxes and would support a law that require all presidential hopefuls to do so, according to Public Policy Polling, a liberal-leaning firm based in Raleigh that has polled the topic multiple times. Its polling results mirror national polls (which recently have found between 53 percent and 74 percent want Trump to release his taxes). So it doesn’t appear to be an outlier. But since it’s the only firm polling on this topic in North Carolina specifically, we take its findings with a grain of salt. PPP polled North Carolinians in August 2016 and January 2017 on whether Trump should release his taxes. The August poll found 58 percent said yes; the January poll found 60 percent said yes. That backs up Chaudhuri’s claim about ""a majority of North Carolinians."" And the poll’s crosstabs back up his point about some support from both sides politically. In August PPP found 76 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of unaffiliated/other voters wanted Trump to release his taxes. There was no majority view among Republicans, of whom 37 percent said Trump said should release his taxes, 49 percent said he shouldn’t and 14 percent were undecided. That poll surveyed 830 likely voters, with a margin of error of 3.4 percent. The overall January numbers were similar – a total of 60 percent support – although increasingly polarized. Support among Democrats and unaffiliated voters rose by several points, while Republican opposition rose by several points. That poll surveyed 954 registered voters, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent PPP’s January poll also found 54 percent of North Carolinians would favor ""a law requiring that a candidate for President release 5 years of tax returns in order to appear on the ballot,"" which is precisely the type of law Chaudhuri proposed several months later. PPP found most Democrats and independents would support the bill, while there was no majority view among Republicans. The poll reported 31 percent of Republicans would support such a bill, 49 percent would oppose it, and 20 percent were undecided. Our ruling Sen. Jay Chaudhuri proposed a bill that would require future presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to get onto North Carolina’s ballot. The bill was clearly aimed at Republican President Donald Trump, but Chaudhuri said it ""has a lot of support – by a majority of North Carolinians and members of both parties."" According to one polling firm, Chaudhuri is correct that most North Carolinians want to see Trump’s tax returns, and that the majority also would support a law requiring all presidential candidates to release their taxes. He’s also correct that both issues have bipartisan support, including most Democrats and independents, and about a third of Republicans. However, only one pollster has explored this question at the state level. That’s an important piece of information that Chaudhuri doesn’t mention, so we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C240B80>],/factchecks/2017/apr/19/jay-chaudhuri/even-state-trump-won-nc-lawmaker-says-most-people-/

Maxine Waters wrong to say she has 'not called for' Trump's impeachment
","More than perhaps any member of Congress, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has discussed the possibility of impeaching President Donald Trump. So it was a bit of a surprise to hear her say she has ""not called for impeachment"" of Trump during a recent interview on MSNBC. Here’s the backstory. On the morning of April 18, 2017, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., tweeted, ""The President is a liar, his actions are contemptible, & I'm going to fight everyday until he's impeached."" The President is a liar, his actions are contemptible, & I'm going to fight everyday until he's impeached. Later that day, when Waters sat for an interview with MSNBC’s Craig Melvin, the anchor read her tweet on air and asked her about it. Here’s a portion of their exchange: Melvin: ""You just started that by saying the question becomes, should we wait to call for impeachment until we have the answers to have that question..."" Waters: ""Well, I have not..."" Melvin: ""-- or some of the questions."" Waters: ""-- I have not called for impeachment."" Melvin: ""You said, ‘I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.’ That's what you tweeted."" Waters: ""Yes, but here's what I've said. Here's what I've said. I've said that we need the information. We need to connect the dots. We need the facts in order to do the impeachment. And I'm going to work every day to try and help get those facts and to reveal them to the republic, to our public until, of course, impeachment is taking place."" A reader asked us to look into Waters’ statement that ""I have not called for impeachment."" We found that’s not accurate. During the interview on MSNBC, Waters seemed to draw a distinction between calling for impeachment and calling for investigations into matters that could lead to impeachment. And she has taken a more procedural approach at times, saying, for instance, during an April 2 CNN interview that ""we want to know about the hacking … and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know, because I know, if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable. A lot of people don’t want to talk about that, but I do."" (Waters’ office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) However, even if you grant that this distinction by Waters is valid, ample evidence exists showing Waters actually calling for impeachment. For instance, on Feb. 3, Waters gave an interview on the streaming video channel Cheddar in which she said her ""greatest desire is to lead (Trump) right into impeachment.""  Then, just three days before her appearance on MSNBC, Waters spoke at a rally on the Capitol grounds to demand that Trump release his tax filings. ""I don’t respect this president,"" she told the crowd. ""I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people. … I will fight every day until he is impeached."" She then proceeded to start the crowd on a chant of ""Impeach 45,"" referring to Trump, the 45th president. The crowd responded to her invitation, and Waters led them by chanting ""Impeach 45"" three times. She then closed her speech saying, ""Go ahead: Impeach 45"" before exiting the stage. You can see Waters and the crowd chanting in this video. Waters didn’t seem to be hiding the fact that she had chanted ""Impeach 45."" The same day she appeared on MSNBC, Waters retweeted a CNN video clip of her speaking and leading the chants.  Our ruling Waters said on MSNBC that ""I have not called for impeachment."" She has at times called for investigations that could lead to Trump’s impeachment, rather than calling for impeachment directly. But on at least two occasions -- the Cheddar interview and the tax rally -- she did call for Trump’s impeachment directly, in one case literally cheerleading for impeaching Trump at a rally at the U.S. Capitol.

Trump: China taking unprecedented steps to help with North Korea's nukes
","North Korea’s nuclear weapons program might be a looming security threat for the United States and its allies, but it has also provided a point of common interest for America and China. In an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump praised China for working to help with the North Korea problem and he specifically noted that China has begun to reject coal shipments from North Korea, denying it a key source of revenue. ""Nobody has ever seen it like that,"" Trump said April 17. ""Nobody has ever seen such a positive response on our behalf from China."" There’s a lot to unpack in that statement, not the least of which is whether China is acting on America’s behalf or its own, or both. The fact is, China has taken many steps over the decades to manage North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Some long-time observers think its latest stance represents a new high; others are less convinced. China and North Korea The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, described China as ""North Korea’s closest ally, largest provider of food, fuel, and industrial machinery, and arguably the country most able to wield influence in Pyongyang."" China buys over 80 percent of North Korea’s exports. At the same time, North Korea has been a thorn in China’s side for quite a while. A 2007 report from the Council on Foreign Relations said that ""Chinese leaders are acutely concerned about a crumbling North Korea that precipitates massive instability in northeastern China."" Reflecting a common view, Cheng Li, director of the China Center at the Brookings Institution, a Washington academic organization, told us, that above all, China wants stability. ""It’s in China’s interest to have a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,"" Li said. A bellicose North Korea might invite a U.S. attack, which would create refugee flows and crisis, or lead South Korea or Japan to reconsider their nuclear options. None of that would help China. China’s growing role China has been involved with North Korea talks since the mid 1990s, when bilateral negotiations between the United States and North Korea  produced a pause in the country’s march toward building nuclear warheads. China took a more direct role in 2003. That year, North Korea withdrew from the Nonproliferation Treaty, restarted a previously frozen 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and during talks brokered by China, told the lead American diplomat that it now had nuclear weapons. ""China wanted to play a role,"" Li said. ""It wanted to cooperate with the United States. First, it organized the three-party negotiations (China, North Korea and the United States), which then became the six-party negotiations (with Russia, South Korea and Japan). It hosted the six-party talks and had harsh words for North Korea’s leaders."" In 2005, those talks produced an agreement that might have led to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. That agreement broke down four years later, but Frank Jannuzi, who spent 15 years as Senate Foreign Relations Committee policy director for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, credits China with pushing to keep diplomacy moving forward. ""The United States had long been reluctant to engage in face-to-face official talks with North Korea, without the political cover of a multilateral venue,"" Jannuzi said. ""The Chinese wanted these talks too, but in making them happen, they were doing us a big favor."" China gradually ramps up the pressure Through its seat on the U.N. Security Council, China has approved five resolutions against North Korea. The first was in 2006, followed by another in 2009, two in 2013, and the most recent in 2016. Economic sanctions have increased through the later resolutions, although Jannuzi said China would only go so far on that front. ""The sanctions would never be effective,"" he said. ""Because the sanctions will always stop short of crippling North Korea’s economy, which China would not want."" Jannuzi cautioned against reading too much into China’s latest rejection of North Korean coal. The March 2016 resolution imposed a quota on how much coal China could import. ""The trade data suggest that North Korea reached the quota by about the end of February,"" Jannuzi said. ""The coal China turned back went beyond the quota. So it’s good that China stuck with the sanctions, but they supported that when they voted for the resolution."" The Brookings Institution’s Li said China is going beyond what it’s done before. He pointed to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit with Trump, and the rhetoric in Chinese media ""China’s propaganda machine changed dramatically,"" Li said. ""A few months ago, you began to see more criticism of North Korea’s missile program. Unofficially, commentators have talked about regime change. Previously, you couldn’t write about that."" Januzzi said if China is being more vocal and showing its displeasure with North Korea, that’s in line with the past. ""It represents a new high point in terms of their overall frustration level with North Korea but they have been ratcheting it up for 15 years,"" he said. Some analysts, such as Mohan Malik, professor of Asian security at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, see little to cheer in China’s recent moves. ""No doubt, China is tightening the noose around Kim Jong-un’s neck, but it is nowhere near choking him,"" Malik said. ""China’s trade with North Korea is significantly up from last year. And more importantly, the transfer of dual-use components from Chinese companies for use in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs continues unabated."" Our ruling Trump said with North Korea, no one has ever seen such a such a positive response from China on America’s behalf. In the eyes of the experts we reached, China is doing more. Some were more enthusiastic than others. The record shows that China has gradually moved in this direction over the years. Refusing coal shipments is in line with U.N. economic sanctions that China voted for last year. China has largely maintained its trade ties with North Korea and so far, its actions have been more rhetorical than substantive. It is difficult to quantify a ""positive response."" Whether the latest moves represent a sea shift that ""no one has ever seen,"" or the logical conclusion of a longer pattern, probably lies in the eye of the beholder. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968E39C0>],/factchecks/2017/apr/19/donald-trump/trump-china-taking-unprecedented-steps-help-north-/

In manufacturing-heavy Wisconsin, Donald Trump links China to 70,000 lost U.S. factories
","On his first visit to Wisconsin since taking office, President Donald Trump came to Kenosha, a city once synonymous with manufacturing, to sign an executive order as part of his ""Buy American, Hire American"" agenda. It’s aimed at boosting jobs in the United States. Speaking April 18, 2017 at Snap-on Inc., a tool manufacturer, Trump made a claim about China. He implied it had a hand in the loss of American jobs, saying: For too long, we’ve watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands. We’ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization. And you’ve seen that, you’ve heard about it -- 70,000. The World Trade Organization -- another one of our disasters. Congress cleared the path for China’s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, which deals with the rules of trade between nations and works for open trade. The entry spurred investment in China and produced a lot more movement of goods -- leading to broad agreement that the change cost America millions of jobs. But how many factories? And were there other factors? Previous claim Trump’s claim is nearly the same one he made a month earlier at a rally in Kentucky, when he said: ""Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories."" PolitiFact National’s rating was Mostly True. Here’s what our colleagues found: The latest-available U.S. Census counts, for 2014, show the number of American factory establishments has dropped to below 300,000. The decrease since China joined the World Trade Organization was nearly 61,000, according to one Census tally, and more than 73,000 according to another. Some of that decline is due to China’s becoming a bigger player in the world economy by joining the WTO, as our colleagues reported: Around the same time China joined the WTO, the United States gave China permanent normal trade relations status. Both of these actions removed significant barriers to trade and investment with China, basically putting them on an even playing field with the United States’ other trading partners. In the 16 years since, United States imports from China have quadrupled, in large part because production is so cheap there, making U.S.-based manufacturers less competitive. We found three significant economic studies from the past few years that all conclude increased free trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing and jobs. At the same time, experts said the loss of factories was also brought on by other factors, including U.S. trade deficits with other parts of Asia and Europe; a slow recovery after the Great Recession; and increased manufacturing productivity in the United States. The Trump-O-Meter, which tracks Trump’s campaign promises, shows Trump has pledged to reverse China’s entry into the WTO. For its part, China maintains that its entry has led to global economic growth. Our rating Trump said: ""We’ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization.""

The latest U.S. Census figures, for 2014, produced two counts: 73,000, which supports Trump’s claim, and 61,000. And at least some of the losses can be attributed to increased trade with China. We rate the statement Mostly True. More Trump As he prepared to visit Wisconsin, Trump’s record on the Truth-O-Meter -- on statements fact checked since he’s been president -- shows roughly two-thirds of his statements have been rated near the bottom of the meter.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BEABC0>],/factchecks/2017/apr/19/donald-trump/manufacturing-heavy-wisconsin-donald-trump-links-c/

Fake story wrong about Malia Obama being expelled from Harvard for marijuana use
","A story that appeared on scads of blogs claiming former President Barack Obama’s eldest daughter Malia was kicked out of Harvard University is fake news. ""Breaking: Malia Obama expelled from Harvard,"" read the headline on an April 10, 2017, post on TheNewYorkEvening.com, a known fake news website. The same post appears almost word for word on plenty of other websites, too. Facebook users flagged the story as possibly being bogus, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds. The post said Harvard chancellor Malcolm Little said Malia, 18, ""was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends."" The school’s strict drug policy meant she was out, the article read, and the Obama family was considering filing a discrimination suit. Again, this story is fake, because there haven’t been any reports that Malia Obama was kicked out. But the post does acknowledge something that would make expulsion difficult — she isn’t going to school there yet. The White House announced in 2016 after she was accepted that Malia Obama would take a gap year before enrolling in the fall of 2017. What has she been up to since then? Things a teen with a year off would do, probably, like hang out with boys in Manhattan. As for the post’s other details, Harvard does prohibit drugs and alcohol on campus, where current students would face penalties (expelling the former first daughter seems unlikely in any event). Harvard doesn’t have a chancellor, it has a president, and her name is Drew Gilpin Faust. More importantly, the post originally appeared April 9 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that ""all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" Point being, Malia wasn’t caught smoking weed in a Boston hotel, and didn’t get booted from a school she isn’t even attending yet. Don’t expect to see her having to settle for Brown anytime soon.

Does the University of South Florida invest in BP, big tobacco, weapons and prisons?
","University of South Florida students, faculty and alumni are revamping their efforts to have more say in how the university invests its money. A new video called ""#HeyJudy"" from the USF Divest coalition urges USF administrators to stop investing in a number of industries that they don’t support, such as private prison operators, tobacco companies, oil companies and weapons manufacturers. A cool-talking student narrator (he’s ""kind of a big deal"") lays out the problem and calls on USF President Judy Genshaft to implement an ethical review process giving students and faculty some influence over where the money goes. The video laces comments from a the narrator with asides from people who control the industry being called out. ""Here at the University of South Florida we invest in oil companies,"" the narrator says. ""Like BP, even though we screwed up your coastline,"" says a man dressed like an oil executive. ""Ooo."" ""Tobacco companies,"" the narrator says, adding to the list. ""USF hypocritically proudly tobacco free, yet, the school shares in tobacco’s plentiful profits,"" says a man with a cigar in tow. ""That is hypocritical,"" the narrator responds. ""We also invest in weapons manufacturers."" ""Anyone need a hellfire missile? 50 percent off,"" exclaims a man with a missile on his shoulder. ""No thank you,"" says the narrator. ""And private prisons."" ""Has anyone seen any black people?"" asks a man in a suit. ""We need to make our quota."" Divestment has been suggested many times at USF since 2013, either through student elections, student petitions or Student Government, often led by the student organization, Students for Justice in Palestine. With the video buzzing on campus we wanted to check out if USF invests its money in oil companies, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons. What’s going on with USF’s investments? When we reached out to USF Divest about this claim, they said their evidence stems from a 2013 document detailing how the USF Foundation invests its share of USF’s endowment money. USF’s investments are managed by several entities. The university’s total endowment of more than $400 million is managed by the USF Foundation.  The USF Foundation is run by an elected board who raises, manages and invests money from private donors to support the university’s activities. The board’s Investment Committee oversees the university’s $400 million total endowment. The foundation is classified under Florida laws as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, meaning some relevant records are shielded from disclosure. This makes it hard to pinpoint the exact companies the foundation invests its money. Here’s what we know. The committee that oversees the university’s endowment does not select individual stocks or companies for the endowment to invest in; rather, it hires investment managers who decide what funds to invest. Adam Freeman, the communications director for USF, said the video asserts that the USF Foundation made a decision to invest in certain companies, which is not the case. ""The university does not invest in individual companies,"" he said. ""A diversified portfolio has exposure to a wide array of asset classes with investments that will span most, if not all, major industries. The investment practices followed by the foundation are common within colleges and universities as well as other institutional investors."" Steven Perfect, a finance professor at Florida State University, said investors have no control over the contents of individual funds, but said they can always choose to move to other mutual funds that more closely track their preferences. A strict enforcement of the video’s divestiture goals would be a bit of a challenge, but is certainly possible at some cost, Perfect said. There are certain investment plans that offer investors carbon-free portfolios, for instance.  USF Divest said there are hundreds of campaigns going on nationwide and there are many examples of successful divestment efforts. For example, Columbia University divested from private prisons in 2014 by selling its stock in G4S, the world's largest private security firm, as well its shares in the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA).  What about those specific industries? The foundation’s status under Florida laws and its wide-ranging investment techniques make it hard to pinpoint specific companies and industries where money is being invested. The most recent document about the foundation’s investment decisions is from 2013. Back in 2013, Ken Souza, the investment director of the USF Foundation, provided a list of investment managers that decide what mutual funds to invest in. Once they had the list of mutual funds, the group was able to look up the specific companies using the Securities Exchange Commission Edgar website. To look up a mutual fund on SEC Edgar, you need the name of the mutual fund or the Stock Ticker associated with the mutual fund. (A Stock Ticker is the five-letter identification to look up the mutual fund.) This is what the group received:  With the stock tickers, they were able to look at what companies those mutual funds invested in, which included British Petroleum (an oil company), Altria (a tobacco company better known by Philip Morris) and CoreCivic (a company that owns and manages private prisons and detention centers), to name a few. We were able to confirm these companies on the SEC Edgar website. We noticed that portfolio holdings were even more diverse than what USF Divest highlighted. For instance, Wilmington Funds (WMRIX) invests in stock in multiple industries including automobiles, airlines, textiles, technology and energy. USF Divest said it requested more up-to-date information from the foundation but never got it. We asked the university and the foundation, too. Freeman said that the foundation does not have a publicly available document that would provide that level of detail like the 2013 document. (And he did not offer one up.) Besides the foundation’s audited financial statements, the most updated investment information that is publicly available is in the foundation’s Investment Prospectus — a two-page overview about the endowment’s investment strategy. As detailed in the Investment Prospectus, the endowment is invested with managers who specialize in specific asset classes. (An asset class is a group of securities that have similar characteristics and behaviors and is subject to the same laws and regulations.) Perfect said the Foundation’s asset allocation plan suggests it’s investments are diversified, but said he can’t be certain without seeing what’s inside each asset class. Our ruling USF Divest said the university invests in oil companies like BP, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons. Based on a 2013 list of mutual funds that the foundation invested in, the claim holds water. The caveats are that the mutual fund managers directed where the money should be invested, not the foundation directly, and this investment is common and covers most industries represented on the stock market. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFCB4BC0>],/factchecks/2017/apr/19/usf-divest/fact-check-how-does-university-south-florida-inves/

Which is deadlier: prescription painkillers, heroin or cocaine?
","The explosion of deaths from heroin and other opioid drugs promises to be an issue in the 2018 elections, in Wisconsin and across the nation. As Wisconsin’s top cop, Attorney General Brad Schimel has promised aggressive efforts to continue to push back against the tide. In a March 12, 2017, interview on WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Schimel, who is seeking re-election, said the overdose spike ""did get ahead of us."" His explanation: prescription painkiller abuse has soared, leading in turn to greater use of heroin from Mexico, Central America and South America. Another factor: the rise of fentanyl, an often illegally produced and sold painkiller of super high potency. ""In America,"" Schimel added, ""more people die from the painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined."" Is he right? Digging into the numbers To back Schimel’s claim, his office provided a 2011 news release from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that quoted 2008 figures on prescription painkiller use, abuse and related deaths. ""Overdoses involving prescription painkillers are at epidemic levels and now kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined,"" the release quoted CDC Director Thomas Frieden as saying. On the surface, it’s compelling -- if very dated -- evidence for Schimel’s claim. But a deeper dive, and a look at more recent trends, tells a somewhat different story. In 2008, heroin deaths were just starting to take off, and illegally made and distributed knockoffs of prescription fentanyl were not yet a huge story. At that time, the number of deaths involving prescription painkillers greatly exceeded those involving heroin and cocaine. But when Schimel spoke, much more recent figures were available. In 2015, the CDC estimated that heroin and cocaine deaths were more than double the 2008 total, largely due to spiking heroin use. By contrast, prescription opioid-involved deaths had risen but not as fast. Let’s do the 2015 math on Schimel’s equation: there were 12,998 heroin-related deaths and 6,784 deaths involving cocaine, per the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Total: 19,782. Meanwhile, a spokesman at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics offered this total for prescription painkiller deaths: 17,536. So by the agency’s own math, based on its widely publicized number, Schimel’s claim doesn’t hold up. But -- stay with us -- that doesn’t leave the attorney general without a leg to stand on. Other creditable health-care organizations and federal agencies say there were 22,598 deaths involving one or more prescription opioid painkillers -- a figure that would make Schimel’s claim accurate. And those organizations are citing numbers published by the CDC. How can that be? Changing definitions The confusion is over an adjustment the CDC made regarding fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that is sold both as a prescription medicine and as an illegally produced street drug used to intensify the high of other drugs such as heroin. In 2016, the CDC decided to narrow what it considers ""prescription"" opioids because law enforcement reports suggested many of the deaths involving fentanyl were from the non-prescription street version of the drug. So the agency removed some or all synthetic opioids from the ""prescription"" death tally, saying it’s a better way to portray what’s really happening. It’s not a perfect fix -- it excludes deaths associated with prescription fentanyl, for example. That brings the number down from 22,598 to 17,536 or even lower -- and is the difference between Schimel’s claim being on or off target. Clearly the CDC prefers the lower number and emphasizes it in its public presentation, but the higher figure, or both, are cited by others. The rating Schimel said that in America, ""more people die from"" prescription narcotic painkillers ""than from heroin and cocaine combined."" His claim would go unchallenged if this were 2008, the year upon which his claim is based. But changing drug trends and a 2016 alteration in how federal officials tally deaths creates problems for his math. Still, there’s a case to be made for his number based on a long-used but recently de-emphasized way of calculating deaths from prescription drugs. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973C5F00>],/factchecks/2017/apr/19/brad-schimel/which-deadlier-prescription-painkillers-heroin-or-/

How much do Donald Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago cost?
","In his first 13 weeks as president, Donald Trump spent more than half of his weekends away from the White House. Trump’s frequent visits to his Palm Beach, Fla., club inspired a liberal political nonprofit to create a website with a catchy URL: IsTrumpAtMarALago.org. The website, built by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, allows users to compare the steep cost of Trump’s trips to the cost of providing various public services, like school lunches. The fine print appears, at first blush, to back up the eye-popping amount. ""A trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, according to a Government Accountability Office report,"" the website says. We’ve seen similar estimates of Trump’s travel costs pop up on various news and media sites. Nearly every one can be traced back to a single GAO report from October 2016. The GAO is an independent, reputable federal agency that researches how the government spends money. But this report doesn’t exactly back up what the critics are saying, even if it’s the best available estimate of a presidential trip to Palm Beach. The report did not estimate the specific costs of Trump’s weekend escapes to the so-called Southern White House, though a reader would get that impression. Instead, the report, titled ""Presidential Travel: Estimated Costs for a Specific Presidential Trip to Illinois and Florida,"" found that a four-day trip President Barack Obama took to Chicago and Palm Beach in February 2013 cost approximately $3.6 million. It’s not fair to assume that those costs are typical for presidential travel, the author of the report told us. Nor should we assume that Obama’s 2013 trip and Trump’s 2017 trips have similar price tags, even though both presidents went to Palm Beach. ""We wouldn’t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama’s trip to any other trip,"" said Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO. Here’s why. When the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives. This is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama’s 2013 trip. But these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it’s hard to nail down the average cost. For example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas. Or, if the president’s event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter. Other details can, on a smaller scale, affect the cost to taxpayers from trip to trip, such as the number of staff traveling with the president or the number of venues that need a security sweep. Or if the trip is for a non-official political event or vacation, the president and others traveling with him reimburse the government for some of the costs. This is not all to say that Trump’s traveling isn’t expensive or unusual. And as of week 13, Trump has spent 25 days away from the White House at another private residence, while past presidents spent far less at the same point in their term. Obama spent four days away; George W. Bush, 14 days; and Bill Clinton, zero days, according to the New York Times. And beyond Trump himself, the government is spending at least hundreds of thousands of dollars protecting Trump’s family, including first lady Melania Trump who’s currently living in New York City with their son Barron, and sons Donald and Eric as they travel around the world on business. But it’s wrong to assume that the Mar-a-Lago trips cost the same as a specific trip Obama took to two cities over four days in 2013, based on this one GAO report. Corey Ciorciari, policy and research director at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, acknowledged this but said he’s still comfortable with $3.6 million as a reasonable, if not conservative, estimate for the cost of one of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips. He said some of the Mar-a-Lago trips could cost even more than $3.6 million because they involved foreign leaders, like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while the 2013 Obama trip did not. Unfortunately, this GAO report is the only recent official report on presidential travel costs. The next-best thing we came across was a GAO report from 1999 about trips President Bill Clinton took to Africa, Chile and China. Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations, estimated that the Obama administration spent more than $96 million over his eight years on presidential travel, based on records they obtained from the military and Secret Service. The group’s director, Tom Fitton, has said they’re also examining how much Trump’s travel is costing taxpayers. The GAO recently accepted a request from Democratic lawmakers to examine the costs of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago trips. Lepore said the investigation will likely get under way in a couple weeks, but he didn’t have a time frame for when it would be complete. Our ruling The Center for American Progress Action Fund said, ""A trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, according to a Government Accountability Office report."" No doubt, a presidential trip out of Washington is expensive. It's reasonable to assume that Trump's multiple weekends at Mar-a-Lago cost taxpayers millions. But the GAO report in question, one of very few available estimates of the cost of presidential travel, did not say exactly that a trip to Mar-a-Lago cost $3.6 million. The report covered a specific trip Obama took in 2013 covering two cities including Palm Beach.   To say each Trump Mar-a-Lago visit costs the same as the Obama trip is imprecise. There are too many unknown variables to say for sure.

Trump falsely claims Obama policies to blame for growth of MS-13 gang in the U.S.
","President Donald Trump blamed former President Barack Obama on Twitter for the formation of one of the most notorious gangs. ""The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!"" Trump tweeted April 18. The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast! Trump’s tweet came days after four young men were found brutally murdered in Central Islip in Long Island. The Suffolk County police commissioner said he suspects the MS-13 involvement. But the president’s post about the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang, is misleading. The gang was established in Los Angeles and spread across the country decades before Obama took office. Trump’s administration has conducted target operations to arrest criminals, but data is not yet available on how many MS-13 gang members have been arrested or removed. Ioan Grillo, author of the 2016 book Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields, and the New Politics of Latin America, disputed Trump’s conclusion. ""I have seen no evidence that the Obama administration can can be blamed in any way for the existence or activities of the gang in the U.S.,"" Grillo told PolitiFact. We asked a Trump spokesman for more information but did not hear back by deadline. MS-13 history and growth predates Obama policy Violent gangs, including MS-13, were forming in U.S. cities long before Obama’s presidency. MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. (The name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word ""mara"" which is a term for gang, ""salva"" for El Salvador and ""trucha,"" which is slang for clever.) It later spread to other parts of the United States and in Central American nations. By the end of the 1990s, the United States government recognized that MS-13 posed a significant criminal threat. Amid an immigration crackdown toward the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the government launched an effort to deport foreign-born residents convicted of crimes, including gang members.   In the mid 2000s, U.S. agencies including the FBI and ICE launched initiatives to combat the growth of gangs. There were several news reports about MS-13’s proliferation in the United States during the 2000s, with interest growing after a 2006 National Geographic documentary on the ""World’s Most Dangerous Gang."" The documentary showed that by the end of the 1990s, the gang had groups in almost every state. Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed MS-13 on the same day as Trump’s tweet, blaming ""an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement"" for MS-13 recruitment. Multiple experts said there is no evidence that Obama policies caused the growth of Latino gangs in the United States. ""The big surge was during Bush-Cheney when the drivers of illegal migration in Central America grew, when various crackdowns on crime-filled prisons to bursting point, and when funding for rehabilitation programs declined,"" said Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. Armstrong formerly worked as a national intelligence officer for Latin America, chief of staff of the CIA’s crime and narcotics center, and was a career CIA officer. The growth of MS-13 in the United States is related to draconian domestic policies in the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) that have pushed many gang members out of Central America, said Florida International University professor Jose Miguel Cruz. Héctor Silva Ávalos, a research fellow at American University, said that there has been a new peak in gang activities on the East Coast since 2014 -- especially in Long Island and Montgomery County, Md. ""But this has to do with gang dynamics that have been brewing back in Central America since the Mauricio Funes administration in El Salvador (2009-14) brokered a truce with both MS-13 and Barrio 18,"" he said. ""It is not related to U.S. internal policy."" Elana Zilberg, a University of California San Diego communications professor, said Obama specifically targeted ""criminal"" aliens (including MS-13 members) in his aggressive deportation program. ""However, Trump’s tweet might be a blunt allusion to Obama’s position on unaccompanied minors from Central America,"" she said. ""That, however, was a policy inherited from the Bush administration."" The number of Central American children coming alone began to increase in fiscal year 2012 and rose significantly in 2014. The Obama administration in 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address the issues driving their migration. The Central American Minors program allowed certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm could be admitted under parole. The program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply. No data on MS-13 removals under Trump Trump lauded his administration’s enforcement efforts in a Fox News interview that aired shortly after his tweet. ""We’ve gotten tremendous criminals out of this country,"" Trump said on Fox & Friends. ""I'm talking about illegal immigrants that were here that caused tremendous crime that have murdered people, raped people, horrible things have happened. They are getting the hell out, or they are going to prison."" Trump claimed nothing had been done to remove criminals until he came along. (Here is an overview of some targeted enforcement operations during the Obama administration that led to the arrests of criminals and gang members.) ""It is a serious problem and we never did anything about it, and now we're doing something about it,"" Trump said. But ICE data available so far do not prove that Trump is removing MS-13 members ""fast"" as he tweeted. In February, the Trump administration said it had conducted targeted operations resulting in the arrest of more than 680 people, including gang members. At least one of them was a self-admitted MS-13 gang member from El Salvador. A unit within ICE tracks MS-13 arrests, but monthly data on gang and MS-13 arrests during Trump’s time in office is not available. From fiscal years 2005 through 2016, immigration officials made 7,051 MS-13 arrests, ICE said. ICE removal data shows how many individuals were suspected or confirmed gang members. But it does not say to which gang they were affiliated. In fiscal year 2016, ICE removed 240,255 individuals and 2,057 were suspected or confirmed gang members, the agency reported. During the full two months that Trump has been in office (February and March), a total of 36,467 individuals have been removed, according to an ICE official. ICE said it did not have information on how many of them were gang members. An executive order signed by Trump expanded removal priorities to include immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of crimes as well as those who have been charged with a criminal offense but not yet convicted. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!"" MS-13 gangs in the United States were established decades before Obama took office and had been spreading across the U.S. long before his tenure. Experts told us there is no evidence Obama policies spurred their growth. Finally, Obama prioritized the deportation of criminal immigrants. Immigration officials told us data on how many MS-13 gang members have been arrested and removed under Trump’s administration is not available.

Bernie Sanders wrong that voter turnout hit 20-year low in 2016
","Was voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election at a decades-long low? Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran in the Democratic primaries before losing the nomination to Hillary Clinton, said so during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union on April 16, 2017. In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Sanders said, ""You know, tomorrow afternoon, Tom Perez, who is the chair of the Democratic Party, and I will be taking a nine-state tour all across this country to do what I think is absolutely necessary. And that is to help revitalize American democracy. So many of our people are giving up on the political process. It is very frightening. In the last presidential election, when Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years. And in the previous two years before that, in the midterm election, we had the lowest voter turnout in 70 years."" He’s right about the midterm election of 2014, but he’s far off regarding turnout for the 2016 presidential election. We turned to a widely trusted source for voter turnout statistics -- the United States Elections Project -- run by political scientist Michael McDonald of the University of Florida. There are different ways to measure voter turnout, but McDonald tends to favor the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot for the highest office contested that year. In presidential election years, that would mean the president. McDonald has compiled data on voter turnout going back to the 1700s. Here’s the rundown: According to this chart, voter turnout percentages have settled into a range between the low 50s and the low 60s since the early decades of the 20th century -- well below what it was during most of the 1800s, but above what it was in the country’s first few decades of existence. But on Sanders’ specific point, the final turnout figure for 2016 -- 59.3 percent -- amounted to a middling result for the past 20-year period, which is the time frame he used. It was lower than the 2004 and 2008 turnout figures, but it exceeded the turnout rate for 1996, 2000, and 2012. Looking back even further, the 2016 turnout rate is actually even more impressive. You’d have to go back to 1968 to find a year other than 2004 and 2008 in which voter turnout was higher than it was in 2016. And 1968 was the last election before a constitutional amendment took effect guaranteeing that all 18-year-olds could vote. So, starting in 1972, millions of teenagers were added to the denominator in the voter turnout calculation, a change that tended to depress the percentage somewhat in the elections that followed. Using the turnout among the voting-eligible population tends to be a more useful measurement than the percentage of the voting-age population that cast a ballot, because the latter statistic counts ineligible voters in the denominator, including noncitizens and felons whose voting rights have not been restored. Because noncitizens and felons don’t have a choice about whether to vote or not, turnout statistics that include them aren’t as enlightening as those about just the voters who have a choice about whether to vote. Still, even if you use voting-age population instead of voting-eligible population, Sanders isn’t correct. In 2016, the turnout rate using that measurement was 54.7 percent. While that trailed the rates for 2004 and 2008, it exceeded the rates for 2000 and 2012. Our friends at FactCheck.org noted that Sanders may have been thinking about preliminary -- but inaccurate -- news reports shortly after the election that indicated that voter turnout in 2016 would hit a two-decade low. The counting of late-arriving ballots, such as those from the growing number of states that rely heavily on mailed-in ballots, rendered such assertions moot. Sanders’ office did not respond to an inquiry. For the record, Sanders' statistic for the 2014 midterm elections was accurate. Turnout among eligible voters was about 36 percent in 2014 -- the lowest since the 33.9 percent in 1942, when the nation was fighting World War II. Here is McDonald’s full data set for midterm elections. Our ruling Sanders said that ""when Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years."" That’s not correct. In 2016, turnout was lower than it was for two of the elections in that span (2004 and 2008) but it was higher than it was for three others (1996, 2000 and 2012).

After four attempts, the attendant reportedly grabbed the child from its mother’s arms and slapped him in the face. The crew member had to be restrained and the plane made an emergency landing in Missouri.

The story ignited a firestorm of backlash on social media and beyond. Since March, the airline has had a run of events that have cast it in a bad light. There was a furor over two teens denied a flight because they were wearing leggings. After the Dao incident, a scorpion stung a passenger on a flight from Houston to Calgary, Canada. Most recently, a couple from Salt Lake City alleged they were kicked off a plane for no justifiable reason on their way to a Costa Rican wedding and honeymoon.

Did Snapchat's CEO say India was too poor for his app?
","Snapchat pictures might come and go in seconds, but the furor in India over reported comments by Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel is hanging on much longer. On April 15, News18, a CNN affiliate tweeted, ""Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has said the app is for rich people, don't want to expand in poor countries like India and Spain."" .@Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has said the app is for rich people, don't want to expand in poor countries like India and Spain pic.twitter.com/5Uf8ViOGoz Outraged Indians launched a campaign to undercut the social media photo and video sharing application. Gaurav Pradhan, who has over 80,000 followers, retweeted an image that urged Indians to uninstall the application and give it a one-star rating on Google’s Play Store. Pradhan’s wrote, ""If Indians, across world and in India have any ""Self Respect"" left. Uninstall @Snapchat now and give a KICK 2 this arrogant Headless Chicken."" If Indians, across world and in India have any ""Self Respect"" leftuninstall @Snapchat now and give a KICK 2 this arrogant Headless Chicken pic.twitter.com/pI5lolApVE Snapchat is in damage control mode. In a statement, Snapchat denied that Spiegel said the offending words. ""This is ridiculous,"" the company said, according to reports. ""Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It’s available worldwide to download for free."" We decided to see whether it’s accurate to assert categorically that Spiegel said India was too poor for Snapchat. In this case, certainty is elusive, because it comes down to one person's word against Snapchat's. Magazine article triggers firestorm On April 11, Variety published a story about a former Snapchat manager’s lawsuit against the company. The headline alone highlights the key caveat: ""Snapchat CEO Said ‘This App Is Only for Rich People,’ Ex-Employee Alleges."" A Jan. 4, 2017, filing had this account of an exchange between former manager Anthony Pompliano and Spiegel (pages 19 and 20 in the file). ""The data showed that Snapchat’s international user metrics were very low, even in countries with high social media engagement, such as Spain and India. When Mr. Pompliano attempted to explain that he could implement strategies to achieve significant growth for Snapchat in these major markets, Mr. Spiegel abruptly cut in and said, ‘This app is only for rich people. I don’t want to expand into poor countries like India or Spain.’"" This conversation allegedly happened on Sept. 11, 2015, a year and a half before the filing. So far, that is the sum total of the evidence that Spiegel disparaged Spain and India. Two other people were in the room, but Spiegel’s alleged response was tangential to the meat of the lawsuit and there is no further testimony on this point. (We have not seen reports about a backlash in Spain.) We have one man’s word that Spiegel said this, and that man is suing Snapchat. The larger Indian news organizations noted the uncertainty behind the allegation. Our ruling A viral post in India asserted that Snapchat CEO Spiegel said his company’s application was for rich people and not poor places such as India. The article that fueled this meme stated at the top that Spiegel allegedly said these words, not that he definitely had. The lawsuit behind the article provides no evidence beyond saying that a former employee said the exchange took place. If there was a conversation, it happened a year and half ago, which raises questions of how accurately the exact words can be relied on. We might learn more, but until then, we rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F42440>],/factchecks/2017/apr/17/viral-image/did-snapchats-ceo-say-india-was-too-poor-his-app/

Florida lawmaker says 'African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row'
","The decision by Orlando-area prosecutor Aramis D. Ayala to no longer seek the death penalty in murder cases has injected a racial discussion about death row into the Florida legislative session. Ayala, a Democrat elected as state attorney in 2016, announced her decision while handling the case of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend and an Orlando police officer. Scott removed Ayala from the Loyd case as well as 21 additional first-degree murder cases and reassigned them to Brad King, a Republican state attorney. Sen. Randolph Bracy, an Orange County Democrat and chairman of the Florida Senate Criminal Justice Committee, defended Ayala’s right to make that call and criticized Gov. Rick Scott’s reaction in an op-ed in the New York Times. ""As a black man, I see the death penalty as a powerful symbol of injustice in which race often determines who lives and who dies, especially in Florida,"" Bracy wrote. ""The state has the second-largest number of death row inmates in the country, after California, and African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row."" Related: Did the U.S. Supreme Court ban all state laws that make executions mandatory for murderers? We decided to look at the statistics and see if they back up Bracy’s statement. Florida’s death row statistics Sheer numbers don’t say very much about racial discrepancies of death row inmates. (There are more white inmates than black inmates among the 371 members of Florida’s death row.) Bracy’s point about overrepresentation compares African-American inmates on death row compared to African-Americans’ share of the general population. African-Americans in Florida comprise about 17 percent of the population, according to the 2015 census. But they make up about 39 percent of the death row population. Based on the data, African-Americans make up twice as large of a share of death row inmates as a share of the state population. Other ways to crunch it There is a lot of research that shows racial disparities in sentencing for death penalty cases, in Florida and around the country. The leader of a pro-death penalty group quibbled with Bracy’s point, saying it disregards the race of people who commit homicides. Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, said more African-Americans are convicted of homicide. ""There are far fewer women than men on Florida's death row; this does not indicate a bias against men, it indicates a disproportionate percent of men who commit capital murder compared to women,"" he said. The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that nationally between 1980-2008, 52.5 percent of homicide convicts were African-American while 45.3 percent were white. In 2015, 36.7 percent of homicide convicts were African-American while 30.2 percent were white. ""The difference between the makeup of death row and the makeup of the general population is attributable to the difference in offending rates, not bias in the system,"" said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. Evidence for racial disparities Studies show sentencing in death penalty cases often depends more heavily on the race of the victim than the killer. No white person has ever been executed for killing a black person, said Michael Radelet, a University of Colorado professor who has studied death penalty sentencing in Florida. In a 1991 study, Radelet (then at the University of Florida) found the odds of a death sentence for those who kill white people are about 3.4 times higher than for those who kill African-Americans in Florida. ""All the research in Florida has found that the race of the victim is a more powerful predictor of death sentencing than the race of the defendant...,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""It is true that every homicide cases is different, but even after looking at roughly similar cases (multiple murders, murders that have accompanying felony circumstances, etc.) we find the patterns of bias."" Brandon L. Garrett, a University of Virginia School of Law, reached a similar conclusion in his research at the national level. Garrett analyzed data on all death sentencing by county from 1990 to 2016, seeking to answer the question of why a few counties, but not the bulk, still impose death sentences. He found that death sentences are strongly associated with urban, populous counties as well as counties that have large black populations. Garrett also found that counties with more white victims of homicide have more death sentencing. Frank Baumgartner, a University of North Carolina political science professor, described a similar pattern in a 2016 Albany Law Review article after he examined national data on race and homicide between 1976 through 2014. In Florida, Baumgartner found ""tremendous disparities"" depending upon the race and gender of the victim. He found that 72 percent of all executions in Florida were for crimes involving white victims despite the fact that 56 percent of all homicide victims are white. He argues that bias can enter the system at many points -- starting with a prosecutor’s decision about how to charge the crime and ultimately decisions by juries. It isn’t just a Florida problem. One of the key pieces of analysis cited in this area is by University of Iowa law professor David Baldus, who examined a sampling of death penalty cases in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1993. He found average death sentencing rates were 38 percent higher for black defendants than for other defendants. Baldus, who died in 2011, played a role in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1987 McCleskey vs. Kemp decision, in which the court determined Baldus’ research showing statistical evidence of racial discrimination in Georgia death penalty cases did not make the death penalty unconstitutional. In a report for the American Bar Association, Baldus found that race-of-defendant disparities existed in several other states, too, including California, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Our ruling Bracy said, ""African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row."" African-Americans are overrepresented in terms of their population; black inmates make up twice as large of a share of death row inmates than their share of the state population. The ""why"" isn’t as easy to answer. National data show that more blacks than whites are convicted of homicides. However, research repeatedly shows that the victim’s race affects a defendant’s sentence: no white person has been executed for killing a black person in Florida.
