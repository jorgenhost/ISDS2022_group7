John Kerry rebuts Trump, says NATO spending was up, not down
","Former Secretary of State John Kerry took exception to President Donald Trump’s criticism of the NATO allies at the recent meeting in Brussels. Trump came into the meeting saying the European members needed to spend more. At a news conference after the meeting, Trump said their defense spending had been falling. ""It was going down, the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially, and now it's going up very substantially,"" Trump said. Kerry said the trend was just the opposite. ""President (Barack) Obama raised the issue in a constructive and collegial way that succeeded in securing a pledge from NATO members to increase their defense spending,"" Kerry said in a statement July 11. That meeting took place in 2014 in Wales. At the end, NATO members said they would spend more on defense and ""aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade."" ""Each year, (NATO) nations have been increasing their contributions,"" Kerry said. The European nations had reasons beyond Obama to up their defense game. Open fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists had Europe on high alert. Whatever motivated the Europeans, the numbers say Kerry is right, at least for the time frame he mentioned. Since 2014, the European members collectively increased defense spending by 8 percent, or $20 billion in real terms. (Canada’s spending also rose by $7 billion.) This chart draws from official NATO statistics, with all amounts in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. Now, it is true that before 2014, Europe had been spending less, but that isn’t what Trump said. Trump said spending was going down when it was rising. In relative terms, the European share of all NATO member defense spending has been rising since before 2014. In 2012, its share stood at 27 percent. That fraction increased every year, reaching 30 percent in 2017. Defense analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation see the data the same way. Luke Coffey and Daniel Kochis said while non-U.S. spending needs to go higher (as did Kerry), they also said it has been headed in the right direction. ""In 2017, NATO members (not including the U.S.) collectively increased spending by 4.8 percent, or $23 billion, since 2015,"" Coffey and Kochis wrote June 26. NATO broke from its usual practice and issued a projection of 2018 defense spending at the end of the recent gathering. That report shows Europe’s collective spending rising by about $35 billion in current dollars, while U.S. spending would go up by about $20 billion. Kerry said that NATO members have been increasing their contributions. Total defense spending by the European members rose 8 percent or $20 billion dollars from 2014 to 2017.

Kendall Scudder says Bob Hall hasn't passed a bill into law
","A North Texas Democrat nominated for the Texas Senate told a Dallas crowd that the incumbent, Bob Hall of Edgewood, has an empty legislative record. Kendall Scudder of Sulphur Springs said at a July 2, 2018, event noted by the Dallas Morning News:  ""None of you should be surprised to find out that Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill before. And we're going to keep it that way."" Hall, a businessman who joined the Senate’s ruling Republicans in 2015, told the newspaper: ""I'm not one to try to get my name in lights when it comes to passing bills. I see myself as part of a team."" Still, has Hall not advanced any of his own measures into law? Records show a Hall proposal advancing into law Before reaching Scudder, we gauged Hall’s record by searching the Texas Legislature Online website maintained by the Texas Legislative Council. Our searches for proposals authored by Hall that Gov. Greg Abbott signed or let into law showed one such accomplishment. In the 2017 regular session, the Hall-authored Senate Bill 102, clarifying position titles in the Texas National Guard, made it through the Senate and House and was signed into law on June 1, 2017. Hall said in a June 2017 statement of intent filed with the proposal that lawmakers previously created new general officer positions within the Texas National Guard but the federal government didn’t recognize or fund the position titles. ""This bill would clarify these new general officer titles and duties to allow for proper recognition and funding,"" Hall said. Hall otherwise authored 52 proposals in 2015 and 69 more in 2017, records indicate. Put another way, about 1 percent of his authored legislation made it into law. Yet that rate doesn't capture Hall's full legislative record. In the regular sessions and a summer 2017 special session, records show, Hall co-sponsored measures offered by others--some of which passed into law. In 2015, Hall was a co-sponsor of seven House bills that passed into law and in 2017, Hall co-sponsored three House measures in the regular session that made it into law and three House proposals that passed into law after action in the special session. Scudder, responding by email, told us his point in Dallas was that Hall hasn’t been effective. ""I was specifically referring to Sen. Hall's inability to pass legislation benefiting his district as a primary author (in short stump speeches, it can be difficult to specifically outline the intricacies of legislative processes),"" Scudder wrote. Our ruling Scudder said Hall has never passed a bill. Hall's had scant success ushering his own measures into law. Still, he authored a 2017 proposal clarifying Texas National Guard titles that passed into law. He's separately cosponsored other proposals now in statute. We rate this claim False.

Donald Trump misleads on US defense spending, NATO budget
","Since his earliest days in office, President Donald Trump has made no bones about his feelings on how much the United States spends on NATO, often scolding allies for not carrying their weight. This week he was in Brussels for a summit with those very nations he’s unhappy with. One talking point came up again and again. As he left the White House for Europe, Trump tweeted that the United States is paying for 90 percent of NATO with other member countries falling far behind. In a short speech before he boarded his plane, he repeated his frustration but dialed back the size of the U.S. share, saying ""we spend at least 70 percent for NATO."" And in a July 12, 2018, press conference before he left Brussels, Trump decided to use both numbers to describe a lopsided U.S. contribution: ""I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important, probably the greatest ever done. But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate. That's not fair to the United States."" Regardless of the figure used, it is not accurate to say that the United States is paying for either 70 or 90 percent of NATO’s military defense. We first consulted NATO’s latest budget report for 2017. (A report with projected 2018 defense spending was released after Trump’s initial comment, but this doesn’t change the facts surrounding the claim.) The 2017 numbers show defense spending data of all member countries from 2010 to 2016 and 2017 estimates. By NATO’s count, total defense spending of all NATO members stood at about $957 billion in 2017. The United States’ share was about $686 billion. Do the math, and the percentage of U.S. spending is about 72 percent. (We don’t know the source for the  90 percent number.) Here are the top four spending countries on NATO’s list: Country  Spending in billions (2017) Percent of total defense spending by NATO members United States $686 71.7% United Kingdom $55 5.8% France $46 4.8% Germany $45 4.8%   But what do these numbers mean? The spending doesn’t represent money spent on behalf of NATO, nor for NATO. They’re the total defense budgets of NATO members. For 2017, the defense spending of all NATO members totaled about $957 billion.   The United States spent $686 billion on all of its defense spending across the globe for that year. Gordon Adams, professor emeritus at American University’s School of International Service, said the president’s wording is ""bizarre"" given that the burden for defense is quite different for the United States and European nations. ""U.S. defense missions are global, not just European,"" he said, ""while the allies spend solely for European defense."" American defense spending supports aircraft carriers in the Pacific, as well as troops in Europe. On top of that, Adams said that U.S. equipment and personnel in Europe, such as an F-35 stealth fighter, can be deployed for missions in the Middle East. There is no clear way to tease out the fraction of American defense spending that primarily guards Europe. NATO does have things it calls its own. There is a civilian staff and headquarters, and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, command headquarters and a program to beef up military capabilities in certain countries above and beyond what they would need for their own defense. Each of the 29 members contribute to those costs through an agreed cost-sharing formula based on the country’s gross domestic product. As the member with the largest GDP, the U.S. contributed 22 percent of NATO’s common funding. Not far behind is Germany with about 15 percent, then France and the United Kingdom with about 10 percent. With common costs of about $2.5 billion in 2017, the U.S. share of about $550 million doesn’t change the picture, since Europe’s share was a much larger $1.8 billion. That gap only weakens Trump’s argument. Trump said ""the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of (NATO)."" It is not accurate to say the United States pays for the majority of NATO's costs. The United States pays for 22 percent of NATO's common fund. Beyond that relatively small amount, the cost of NATO is undefined. The organization does total the defense budgets of its members, and based on that, U.S. defense spending equals about 70 percent. But the United States spends as much as it does because it is a global military power, which by and large, the European members are not. It is an apples and oranges comparison. Trump pushed a flawed comparison even further by saying the U.S. paid for as much as 90 percent of NATO. That goes beyond the exaggeration of this statistic that we've seen before. Trump’s statement contains just an element of truth, ignoring critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC876540>],/factchecks/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/

No, Broward Sheriff Scott Israel was not fired by Gov. Rick Scott
","A false story on Facebook says Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired in a cover-up stemming from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. ""Broward County Sheriff fired for lying about Parkland,"" said the July 3 headline on Your News Wire, a frequent purveyor of fake news. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. While the headline and the first paragraph says that Israel has been fired, the story was lifted from another website that said Israel will be fired. Big League Politics, a website with a conservative bent, wrote on July 3 that Israel was set to be removed the following week for unspecified ""criminal issues"" following an investigation by Gov. Rick Scott. It cited information from an anonymous source at the sheriff’s office. The story was written by Laura Loomer, a conservative activist we have written about before. We emailed Loomer and did not get a reply. We also did not get a reply from Your News Wire. Israel’s personal attorney Stuart Kaplan said on the WFTL-850 morning show disputed Loomer’s report. We didn’t get a response from Israel’s media relations staff at the sheriff’s office. The idea that Scott was going to suspend Israel has not been reported by other credible news outlets. We asked Scott’s office if he plans to suspend Israel, and a spokeswoman said that he will review the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation once it is complete. Scott ordered that investigation into the law enforcement response in February following the Valentine’s Day shooting. Israel has faced scrutiny for his office’s response to the shooting, including the fact that the school resource officer, Scot Peterson, took position outside of the school rather than go in and engage the shooter. The department is months away from finalizing its investigation and then will submit it to the Broward state attorney for review, an FDLE spokeswoman said. The governor has the power to suspend public officials for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony. Scott has largely suspended public officials who have been accused of crimes. If Scott removes Israel, a Democrat, he could appoint a replacement in the Democratic-majority county.

Blog twists Pope Francis's message on migrants, national security
","Did Pope Francis say that the rights of Muslim migrants are more important than any country’s safety concerns about them? That’s what a largely plagiarized story on the website opreminfo.com claimed. But what he said was more nuanced. Facebook flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So we decided to investigate. It turns out that a large part of the article is copied, word-for-word, from a 2017 Reuters article titled, ""Pope says migrants’ rights should override national security concerns."" The only differences between the two are that the opreminfo.com article omits the final two paragraphs of the Reuters story, and it also has a different headline singling out Muslim migrants.    Reuters is a reputable source, and a 2017 Guardian article corroborates much of their story. But this recently posted article has a few problems. First, there's an issue of timing. The story begins with the statement, ""Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants."" The Reuters article began with those same words, but it was published in August 2017, and was referring to a message the pope put out that same month, ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees. In it, the pope reiterates an earlier address and says, ""Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate."" He then goes on to describe the task of ""welcoming"" as follows: ""Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation … The principle of the centrality of the human person, firmly stated by my beloved predecessor, Benedict XVI, obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security … The situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees requires that they be guaranteed personal safety and access to basic services. For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization."" The opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope ""urged political leaders on Monday,"" even though the pope’s remarks were published nearly a year ago.   Secondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to ""Muslim migrants."" Rather, it mentions that the pope called for ""broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally."" We didn’t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope’s message.  An article on Facebook claimed, ""Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country."" The pope discussed ensuring all migrants' ""personal safety over national security."" But this article cherry-picked a subgroup of migrants to make it seem like he was only talking about Muslims.   In addition, the text of the article is copied from a 2017 Reuters article, even though it is framed as though the speech happened recently. For a partially accurate claim that takes things out of context, we rate this headline Half True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC73E100>],/factchecks/2018/jul/12/blog-posting/blog-post-twists-popes-words-about-migrants-and-na/

Do European allies pay U.S. $2.5 billion yearly to keep troops there?
","President Donald Trump criticized fellow NATO members during a summit on July 11, saying they had spent too little on defense and in support of the alliance. But NATO backers lined up to push back against Trump’s criticisms. The United States maintains approximately 35,000 military personnel in Germany, 12,000 in Italy, 8,000 in the United Kingdom, plus smaller numbers in other European countries. The combined personnel levels in Europe fell after the end of the Cold War, but growing tensions with Russia in recent years have led to some refortification. Despite this, Trump has expressed skepticism about the scale of the U.S. troop presence in Europe, leading the Pentagon to study possible options for relocating or reducing the U.S. footprint on the continent, the Washington Post has reported. One commentator who appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe was Nicholas Burns, a Harvard University professor who served for almost three decades as a foreign-service officer, including a stint as undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2005 to 2008. Burns said Trump was ""misrepresenting the facts"" about NATO and spending by U.S. allies. The United States’ European allies, Burns said, ""pay us $2.5 billion a year to keep our forces there. It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe.""   When we looked into Burns’ statistic, we found it was more complicated than it would seem. Burns told PolitiFact that he had obtained the figure from National Security Action, a newly created advocacy group founded predominantly by Democratic foreign policy specialists. The group tweeted an infographic that offered that number. A spokesman for the group, Ned Price, told PolitiFact that the number came from a New York Times article that said, ""Allies cover 34 percent of the United States’ basing costs, worth $2.5 billion annually."" This echoed a number we had found in the most comprehensive recent analysis of this topic -- a study the RAND Corp. released in 2013. The study found that the NATO allies’ combined support for U.S. military activities on their soil was more than $2.48 billion in 2002 dollars, or essentially $2.5 billion. The data is 16 years old and was initially calculated as part of a series of reports that the Pentagon published, but stopped producing in 2004. Garret Martin, a lecturer in the School of International Service at American University, said that ""it is unlikely that the figure (from 2002) still applies to 2018. U.S. troop levels in Europe in 2002 were closer to 100,000, as opposed to 65,000 today."" The $2.5 billion figure ""is the best we can say today,"" said Patrick Mills, a RAND senior operations researcher who helped produce the report. ""Publicly available burden-sharing data for NATO allies was very difficult to come by in the writing of that 2013 report, and it still is."" The number also requires additional context. FIrst, 97 percent of the $2.5 billion in NATO support came from what are called indirect costs -- things like rent and foregone taxes and customs duties. Such streams of support are important in evening out the books, but they are not reimbursements for outlays that the United States has made. Rather, they enable the United States to sidestep things they would have otherwise had to pay for, and they are harder to characterize numerically. ""Indirect contributions are less precise than hard dollars,"" Martin said. And second, NATO member support covers only about one-third of the U.S. military costs. The U.S. still pays two-thirds of the burden. Indeed, in 2002, NATO’s rate of support was lower than that of other nations that host U.S. troops. According to the RAND report, NATO’s 34 percent share was well below the share picked up by Japan (75 percent), Kuwait (58 percent), Qatar (61 percent), and Saudi Arabia (65 percent), and was modestly below the level in South Korea (40 percent). Price, of National Security Action, said the cautionary factors we offered were reasonable. ""There will always be caveats when it comes to these sorts of issues."" he said. That said, he added, ""there’s nothing to suggest the burden-sharing balance has changed."" Experts said this assertion is plausible but hard to either prove or disprove. On the one hand, the RAND report concluded that overseas bases cost more than domestic bases do, partly because costs of living for military personnel are higher in other countries. However, moving to all-domestic bases isn’t a guaranteed cost-saver, because there would be additional costs to travel to the battlefield if troops are stationed further away. Whether a move back home would save or cost money could also depend on how many existing facilities in the United States can be repurposed rather than built from scratch. Harder to put a price tag on -- but vitally important -- are strategic issues surrounding a move. ""If you think forces overseas have deterrent value, bringing the forces home could make wars more frequent,"" Mills said. The many possible parameters for making the comparison Burns suggested further complicate the matter, said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""Is it just the Army, or is it the Air Force and Navy too?"" Janda said. ""Would we lose refueling and basing rights? Would that force us to pay for those services options in other countries? The ‘what ifs’ in all of this are insane."" Burns said European allies ""pay us $2.5 billion a year to keep our forces there. It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe."" The $2.5 billion figure is the most recent estimate -- but the data is 16 years old. It mostly encompasses hard-to-calculate ""indirect costs,"" and it only covers about one-third of U.S. military expenditures in Europe. Meanwhile, experts said it’s conceivable that it would be more expensive to close up shop in Europe and bring troops back to the United States, but there are many variables surrounding that decision and it’s difficult to factor in the intangible strategic losses from giving up a European footprint. Ultimately, Burns’ assumption is speculative.

Old Obama video misrepresents his views on Christianity
","Throughout Barack Obama’s presidency, critics questioned his Christian beliefs. The suspicion among some conservative Facebook groups has continued a year and a half after his exit from the White House. One group, called Yes I’m Right, shared a link to an article titled ""Shocking Video Emerges of Obama Mocking God and the Bible."" Hundreds of users reacted and shared the link, which led to a Conservative Post write-up and video. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked at the video. It has been around since 2006 and is clipped from a larger 40-minute speech about separating religious beliefs from policymaking. The Conservative Post article is just a few sentences long, accusing Obama of an ""open universalist attitude toward faith"" and say that his faith is ""100% phony."" According to his biographies, Obama became a practicing Christian in early adulthood when he began working with religious community groups in Chicago. According to reports during his time in office, he prayed daily and would regularly consult with pastors for spiritual guidance. In the attached 3-and-a-half minute video, Obama does not denigrate Christianity. He is shown arguing for political compromise across religions. ""We are no longer a Christian nation, or at least not just,"" he says, ""We are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, and a Buddhist nation, and a Hindu nation, and a nation of non-believers."" Because of this, Obama argues, making political policy based solely on religious beliefs is unsustainable. He gives the example of a Christian who objects to abortion on religious grounds: Though they may feel strongly that is wrong because of their religion, he says, they cannot use the Bible as their evidence. Obama also notes that, if the government was led by religion, many books of the Bible would not be applicable for making policy. As the audience laughs, he says that Leviticus, which condones slavery but forbids shellfish, or Deuteronomy, which allows for the stoning of wayward children, would not be suitable for modern laws. This might be interpreted as disrespect or mocking by some viewers. However, the video is cut from a much larger speech: Obama’s keynote at the ""Building a Covenant for a New America"" conference in 2006. The conference was sponsored by Sojourners, a progressive Christian magazine. In Obama’s 40-minute address, he urges Democrats to embrace religion, rather than shy away from it or decry it. Even if religious arguments are not sufficient for making policy, the moral lessons that religions teach can be essential for guiding decisions and reaching out to others. So when viewed as a whole, the point of the speech is not to mock Christianity. Here’s where things get interesting: the video wasn’t edited together by conservative groups seeking to discredit Obama’s religious views. It was edited and posted originally by an online spiritual group in favor of Obama. Founded in the mid 1990s, Yoism is an ""open-source religion"" in which participants can continually propose new tenets and beliefs. The group votes on the proposals, and then adds them to the Book of Yo. Though the book has not been updated since 2004, it appears the website remained active and politically vocal throughout the Obama presidency, frequently defending his policies. The Yoism site attached the video underneath a Doonesbury cartoon about Christmas decorations and short article praising Obama for his commitment to the separation of church and state. Using the same video that was shared by Conservative Post, the Yoans applauded Obama’s Christian values. Obama gave a speech in 2006 that encouraged Christians to take a compromising approach to their religious values when creating policy. He spoke extensively about his own experience as a Christian and encouraged the crowd of Democrats to use their religion to guide them on moral issues. He does emphasize the extremity of many of the Bible stories, perhaps in a way that some Christians would feel is disrespectful. However, the few snippets of Obama’s longer speech do not accurately reflect his views on Christianity overall, and it is an overstatement to say that he is mocking God. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8EA200>],/factchecks/2018/jul/12/blog-posting/old-obama-video-misrepresents-his-views-christiani/

Gubernatorial candidate Paul Soglin's claim on how often guns are used for self defense
","The most recent mass shooting, which killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in Annapolis, Md., reignited the gun control debate. The tragedy brought to mind a claim made earlier this year by Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. During a March 23, 2018, news conference, Soglin claimed: ""The latest statistics demonstrated that if there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."" In light of recent events, we decided to examine Soglin’s claim. Guns and the risk of suicide, assault When asked to backup the claim, Soglin pointed to a January 2016 article in The Trace, a nonprofit news organization focused on gun issues, titled ""A gun as a defense against terrorists? The stats say it’s more likely to harm your family."" The article cites a statistic we came across frequently during our research -- household gun ownership triples the risk of suicide and doubles the risk of homicide. In addition, the article highlighted a study that found access to firearms increases the likelihood of assaults against family members and others to whom people are close, such as girlfriends or boyfriends, escalating to homicide. That 1992 study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found death was 12 times more likely if such assaults involved a firearm than if the assault did not involve a firearm. However, neither the study nor the article states that guns are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than they are for self defense. So, where did the number come from? Well, if Soglin added all of the numbers — three times the risk for suicide, two times the risk for homicide and 12 times more likely for a family and intimate assault to escalate to homicide — he would have gotten 17. But the numbers cannot be added together -- family and intimate assaults that escalate to homicide are already accounted for under homicides as whole. In addition, none of these numbers compare the use of a gun for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide, which was the focus of Soglin’s claim. The studies compare the risk of gun ownership to non ownership. Are there other studies that are on point? According to a 2014 analysis in the Annals of Medicine that examined 16 published studies, people in the United States with access to a firearm are three times more likely to die by suicide than those who do not have access, and are two times more likely to die by homicide. This study made no mention of family or intimate assaults, and did not make comparisons with self defense. We could not find any recent studies comparing how often guns are used for suicide and assault vs. how often they are used for self defense, but there is a 20-year-old study that comes close to corroborating Soglin’s claim. That 1998 study by A.L. Kellermann with the Emory University Center for Injury Control said for every time a gun is used in the home for self-defense or legally justifiable shootings, it is used four times in an unintentional shooting, seven times in a criminal assault or homicide and 11 times in an attempted or completed suicide. The study found a gun is 18 times more likely to be used in an attempted or completed suicide, homicide or assault than it is for self-defense. But some of these homicides may involve strangers and, therefore, it would not be entirely accurate to say this study supports Soglin’s claim about the danger to known victims. What’s more, gun laws, ownership and crime rates have changed since this study was completed, so its findings may be out of date. Finally, Soglin’s larger point about guns being used infrequently for self defense is generally accurate. A study done using federal crime and victimization statistics by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based organization dedicated to stopping gun deaths and injuries, found that between 2007 and 2011, there were 29.6 million victims of an attempted or completed violent crime. Of those victims, 235,700 used a firearm as a form of self defense. That means about 0.8 percent of attempted or completed violent crimes involved a victim using a firearm as a form of self-defense. Our rating Soglin claimed ""If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."" Soglin is on point in stating a gun is much more likely to be used for a suicide, assault or homicide than used in self-defense, but is on less solid ground when it comes to stating exactly how many times more likely.

Trump falsely claims NATO countries owe United States money for defense spending
","During a bilateral breakfast with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump blasted the alliance’s other members over lagging contributions to NATO’s joint defense spending. ""Many countries are not paying what they should,"" Trump said. ""And, frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they’re delinquent, as far as I’m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them.""  .@POTUS: ""Many countries are not paying what they should and frankly many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money."" pic.twitter.com/ahsFiwEX8r This was not the first time Trump has demanded that NATO countries contribute more to the military alliance, and we have fact-checked similar statements before. But the sweeping nature of this claim inspired us to take another look at one of the president’s oft-repeated complaints. As it turns out, Trump’s statement shows a misunderstanding of the way NATO spending works. Other member countries do not owe the United States or NATO any money. Formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO was established in 1949 for the purpose of providing collective security against Soviet aggression and expansion. Ten European nations signed on to the original agreement along with the United States and Canada. In signing the treaty, the original members agreed that ""an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all"" to which each member would respond by taking ""such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."" NATO has swelled to 29 member countries with the stated purpose ""to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means."" As of 2014, NATO’s collective agreement instructed member countries to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. According to NATO’s most recent report detailing members’ defense expenditures, only five countries currently satisfy that threshold: the United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Latvia. But other countries still have several years to reach the target commitment, and for those experiencing significant economic growth, increases in defense spending may take some time to reflect change to the share of GDP.   Daniel Benjamin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor at Dartmouth College with an expertise in foreign policy and security, noted that ""the trend lines are going in the right direction"" for many countries that are underspending at the moment. The White House did not respond to a request to clarify this point. Several experts explained that the president was likely referring, albeit incorrectly, to the commitment to devote 2 percent of GDP to defense spending. ""It most certainly is not true, as the president has suggested repeatedly, that other NATO countries owe us money,"" said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. ""The 2 percent figure refers to what each country spends on its defense, as a share of that country’s GDP. It does not imply owing the U.S. anything."" NATO countries do not pay money to a broad NATO defense budget. NATO defense spending is ""not money that is going to be put in some kitty at NATO,"" Benjamin said. In reality, each country determines its own level of military spending, said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council for Global Affairs and the former U.S. ambassador to NATO under former President Barack Obama. ""No one owes us any money,"" Daalder said. ""Nor is the U.S. spending more because allies are spending less ... our defense spending is a national decision and is determined by our national security and defense needs."" ""Countries falling short means not that they owe anyone money, but that countries have weaker militaries than we would like,"" added Stephen Saideman, a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs. ""NATO is not a country club."" Preble also noted that a more specific remark might have been slightly more accurate. ""If Donald Trump was claiming that the United States needed to spend more on the Pentagon because we have obligations under NATO to come to others’ defense, and those obligations are more onerous and thus costly because others are not spending enough on their defense, that would be more accurate,"" Preble said. ""But he’s not saying that."" The United States does pay for approximately 22 percent of a small, commonly-funded budget that concerns civilian and some military expenses, Daalder noted. That budget, which is less than $5 billion, is funded by all NATO members based on a cost-sharing formula that considers gross national income and other factors. But Daalder said ""no one is in arrears or delinquent on any payments"" for that budget, either. Trump said that ""many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back."" NATO members agreed to contribute at least 2 percent of their country’s GDP toward defense by 2024, but that defense spending does not take the form of payments to the United States or the alliance as a whole. We rate this statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC761D40>],/factchecks/2018/jul/11/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-nato-countries-owe-united-sta/

Was Bernie Sanders fine with Russian annexation of Crimea? No
","Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea is poised to resurface as President Donald Trump prepares for his first summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Virtually the entire global community, including President Barack Obama’s administration, refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. But given Trump’s friendliness to Putin, some foreign policy specialists are wondering whether the president might soon change the U.S. position on the annexation of territory that belonged to Ukraine. During the July 8 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka, the senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, equated the Russia-friendly comments of Trump with the stance of the 2016 Democratic presidential runner-up, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""The Crimea thing highlights something much more important, which is this awful meeting of sort of the Bernie bros and the Trump people on this question of eating away at other country's sovereignty,"" Pletka said. ""You know, ‘Oh no, that's fine, what do we care? Crimea, they've got a lot of Russians anyway.’ Bernie Sanders took that position, President Trump takes that position. I don't understand why it is that the center-right and the center-left are not more forceful on this issue."" There’s a problem with this assertion: Sanders has consistently opposed the Russian annexation of Crimea. Here are some of his comments (with bold emphasis by us): • On March 17, 2014, Sanders wrote in an official statement, ""The entire world has got to stand up to Putin. We've got to deal with sanctions."" • On Feb. 4, 2016, during an MSNBC Democratic primary debate, Sanders said, ""I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine."" (Sanders did go on to say that he ranked the ""isolated"" nation of North Korea as the most serious national security threat to the United States, above Russia, without minimizing Russia’s threats.) • Feb. 11, 2016, during a PBS Democratic primary debate, Sanders said, ""Right now, we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO — correctly, I believe — are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression."" When we contacted Sanders’ office, they said the senator stands by the positions in these quotes. The closest potential evidence suggesting that Sanders was copacetic with the annexation of Crimea was his vote against legislation that would tighten sanctions on Russia. The bill, called the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, passed with only three nay votes in the House and two in the Senate, including Sanders, before it was signed by Trump in August 2017. However, Sanders made clear that his objection to the bill had to do with its policies toward Iran, not the sanctions on Russia. In June 15, 2017, statement, Sanders said, ""I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill. It is unacceptable for Russia to interfere in our elections here in the United States, or anywhere around the world. There must be consequences for such actions."" However, Sanders continued that on Iran, ""these new sanctions could endanger the very important nuclear agreement that was signed between the United States, its partners and Iran in 2015."" (Trump subsequently dropped United States support for the Iran nuclear agreement.) Russia specialists we contacted agreed that Sanders has been consistent in opposing the annexation of Crimea. ""I don’t think there is evidence that Sanders or his supporters were ever in support of Russian annexation of Crimea,"" said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. ""Both center-left and center-right supported sanctions and punishment of Russia over Crimea annexation."" Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, agreed. ""The Sanders campaign considered the annexation of Crimea illegal and illegitimate,"" said Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. ""He did have a more calibrated position that sought to balance, on the one hand, deterrence and pressure with, on the other hand, avoiding unnecessary escalation. But it was never that he said, ‘That’s fine. What do we care?’"" Pletka told PunditFact that she may have conflated some past research she had done on the issue, inaccurately attributing the views of some left-wing Democrats to Sanders, who did not share them. Pletka said Sanders was indifferent to Russia's annexation of Crimea because he felt ""they have a lot of Russians anyway."" We found no evidence to support that assertion. To the contrary, we found that Sanders has consistently criticized the annexation since it occurred and supported measures to punish Russia.

"['Health Care', 'Supreme Court', 'PunditFact', 'Andrew Napolitano']","
Fox News pundit says Brett Kavanaugh is pro-Obamacare. Is he?
","The nomination of U.S. District Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court has set off a scramble to define where he stands on key issues. Fox News legal pundit Judge Andrew Napolitano gave his take the morning after President Donald Trump announced his pick. ""He’s pro-life,"" Napolitano said on Fox News’ Fox and Friends on July 10. ""He’s pro-gun. He’s pro-police, which rankles civil libertarians. He’s also pro-Obamacare."" Napolitano’s last point sounded like a break from the other conservative credentials: Does Kavanaugh really support the health care law that Trump and Republicans have vowed to repeal? Napolitano told us that Kavanaugh revealed his position in a 2011 case that challenged a key piece of the Affordable Care Act: the individual mandate and the penalty that came with it. But conservatives split on the implications of Kavanaugh’s opinion in that case, and the legal scholars we reached said they don’t discern overall leanings one way or the other. In the case of Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a group of taxpayers argued that the health care law’s requirement to buy health insurance went beyond the legitimate power of Congress. ""In a 2011 published opinion on the Affordable Care Act, Judge Kavanaugh declined a reasonable opportunity to invalidate it and voted to dismiss the challenge,"" Napolitano told PolitiFact. Two out of the three appellate judges rejected the challenge outright, saying that the mandate was allowed under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. In his dissent, Kavanaugh shot down the challenge but pointedly avoided ruling on the plaintiffs’ big issue. ""I do not take a position here on whether the statute as currently written is justifiable under the Taxing Clause or the Commerce Clause,"" he wrote. Instead, he rejected the claim based on tax law. He said the suit itself was flawed because an 1867 law — the Anti-Injunction Act — blocks courts from ruling on tax laws before they take effect. It was 2011, and the mandate didn’t come into force until 2014, so ""a suit challenging the individual mandate cannot be entertained until 2015."" Bottom line: He said the circuit court should issue no ruling at all. Kavanaugh spent many pages explaining why the mandate and the penalty to back it up amounted to a tax and therefore fell under the 1867 law. But the real grist for conservative concern came near the end of his long dissent. Since the mandate was a tax, he wrote, ""the only potential Taxing Clause shortcoming in the current individual mandate provision appears to be relatively slight."" Kavanaugh said ""a minor tweak would establish the law’s constitutionality,"" and offered three legislative fixes. For conservatives like Christopher Jacobs, a former analyst at the Heritage Foundation, this was too much. ""Conservatives might argue amongst themselves about which is worse,"" Jacobs wrote in The Federalist on July 2. ""An unelected judge opining on how a mandate to purchase a product could meet constitutional muster, or that same unelected judge giving Congress instructions on how to ensure it will."" Kavanaugh’s thinking mattered, because when the issue went to the U.S. Supreme Court, the majority led by Chief Justice John Roberts said that, indeed, the mandate was a tax (although the legal reasons differed from Kavanaugh’s). That 2011 opinion is a legal Rorschach test for conservatives. Also writing in The Federalist, former Kavanaugh clerk Justin Walker said that Kavanaugh’s dissent showed ""that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under the Taxing Clause."" If nothing else, Kavanaugh’s opinion is subject to interpretation. Several health care law professors  told us they can’t see any particular leaning on Obamacare, based on that 2011 case or a second one that came in 2015. The more recent case challenged the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that it was a revenue bill that should have started in the House of Representatives, but hadn’t. Kavanaugh found that in fact, ""The Affordable Care Act originated in the House and thereby complied with the Origination Clause."" Based just on the Kavanaugh’s words, Indiana University law professor David Gamage finds no particular attitude toward the law as a whole. ""His decisions involved narrow, technical issues and didn’t involve any assessment of the larger framework of the Affordable Care Act,"" Gamage said. ""It is misleading and inaccurate to describe Kavanaugh as pro-Obamacare."" Kavanaugh’s reasoning on the origins of the original health care bill was by the book, ""with no additional teeth being added,"" said James Blumstein, a Vanderbilt University law professor. In the 2011 case, Blumstein said Kavanaugh showed ""a traditional norm of judicial restraint."" Mark Hall at Wake Forest University echoed that point. He sees Kavanaugh’s opinions as focused on legal fundamentals. ""In both cases, he took pains to write a separate opinion stating alternative grounds for rejecting the challenge,"" Hall said. ""To that extent, he appears to me to be more concerned about precision of legal analysis than reaching a particular outcome."" Allison Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania told us ""both of these opinions were procedural and offer no insight into how Kavanaugh would have come down substantively on the Affordable Care Act."" Napolitano said that Kavanaugh is pro-Obamacare. Kavanaugh wrote opinions in two cases involving the legality of the Affordable Care Act. In both, he rejected the claims from opponents of the law based on narrow, more technical grounds. Some but not all conservatives see an openness to Obamacare in those writings. Legal scholars said they saw no preference either way in Kavanaugh’s opinions. In one case, he pointedly said that he wasn’t making a sweeping finding. Rather, he argued that under an old law, the court should wait before weighing in. There is room for people to interpret the meaning of Kavanaugh’s opinions, but on the surface, his words say little about his overall position on Obamacare. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCBEF40>],/factchecks/2018/jul/11/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-court-pick-kavanaugh-pro-obamacare-he/

Is Trump's Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh to the right of Scalia on assault weapons? No
","Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee’s position on the Second Amendment. ""Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical,"" Murphy tweeted July 9. ""He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia."" Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical. He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia. We wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would tote his rifle on the New York City subway. After reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment. Assault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot. One of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is D.C. vs. Heller. Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller’s favor. The majority decision was written by Scalia. Scalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment ""is not unlimited,"" and upholds ""laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."" The question of assault weapons never came up. Instead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district’s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit favored the district two to one, but Kavanaugh dissented. ""There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses."" When the question of whether assault weapons bans are unconstitutional was raised of the Supreme Court, Scalia was unable to answer because the court rejected the case. The case in question was Friedman vs. Highland Park, a challenge to a Chicago suburb’s ordinance banning semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. However, Justice Clarence Thomas voiced a similar opinion to Kavanaugh’s in the rejection, which Scalia joined. Scalia and Thomas wrote that in accepting the ban, the court was not complying with the precedent set by Heller. ""The city’s ban is thus highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes,"" Thomas wrote. ""Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semi-automatic rifles. The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons."" ""In the Highland Park case, we should say Kavanaugh was on the same page as Scalia,"" said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Murphy’s office pointed out that Scalia’s opinion explicitly allowed for regulations, which some lower courts found included assault weapons bans. But the rulings are not unanimous. ""You have more courts upholding the bans than finding them unconstitutional, but there’s definitely a split of opinion on this,"" said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the Independence Institute. Murphy said that on assault weapons, Kavanaugh’s position is ""way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia."" Kavanaugh stated that assault weapons bans were unconstitutional in the circuit court case Heller vs. District of Columbia. Scalia’s opinion on the Supreme Court allowed for some regulations in District of Columbia vs. Heller, which some courts have interpreted to rule in favor of assault weapons bans. But the decision was not about assault weapons. We found at least one instance where Scalia signed off on saying an assault weapons ban would be unconstitutional. So Kavanaugh’s position and Scalia’s are substantially similar. Leaving room for legal interpretation, we rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE1E180>],/factchecks/2018/jul/11/chris-murphy/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-gun-control-second/

Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Flynn says Foxconn won't face wetlands oversight. Is he correct?
","The $10 billion Foxconn project recently broke ground with much fanfare in Mount Pleasant, Wis. The project, which Republican Gov. Scott Walker helped woo to Wisconsin with the help of a state and local incentive package of about $4 billion, has been a political lightning rod. Supporters have hailed the prospect of 13,000 new jobs and the related economic impact on the state. Opponents have assailed the state’s tax incentive package, arguing the money could be better spent on road improvements, education and health care. They have also criticized the company’s need to divert millions of gallons of water a day from Lake Michigan. Some of the most prominent objections have focused on the potential environmental impact of the project, including potential air pollution and wetlands loss.   Matt Flynn, one of several Democratic candidates vying to take on Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018,  general election, voiced his concerns in a June 13, 2018 news release: ""As I have said before, Foxconn is welcome to build its factory in Wisconsin and create jobs here, but not under the terms of Scott Walker's costly, corrupt, and unconstitutional deal. As governor, I will not allow Foxconn to take our tax dollars or circumvent the laws everyone else has to follow."" He added this claim, which is one we want to check: ""Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws."" The evidence When asked to provide support for the wetlands statement, Flynn campaign manager Bryan Kennedy pointed PolitiFact to a Jan. 3, 2018, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, which begins this way: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it has no jurisdiction over wetlands that will be filled as part of Foxconn Technology Group’s plans for a massive electronics plant in rural Racine County. The Corps’ decision could help hasten construction by removing a potential roadblock for construction of the $10 billion plant, which would have allowed for the public to offer comments on the permit and potentially push for changes in how the site is developed to avoid wetlands. Wisconsin lawmakers changed state law in September to accommodate the company by giving up state authority over wetlands on the Foxconn property. The Corps, however, still had the power to weigh in on the project. The legislation also exempted Foxconn from some environmental requirements, allowing the company to fill in wetlands that are regulated by the state and change the course of streams. So, the paragraphs from the article are mostly -- but not entirely -- on target with Flynn’s claim. However, further down, the article notes: ""While the state would allow Foxconn to fill wetlands, that loss would require that new wetlands be created. Under existing law, for every 1 acre lost, a developer must create 1.2 acres elsewhere. The Foxconn legislation requires greater mitigation — 2 acres for every 1 acre lost."" So, there are other environmental regulations at play. State Department of Natural Resources In short, there are some things the state has given up. But that does not mean there is no oversight on wetlands, as Flynn claims. The company has to replace the wetlands -- and do so at a higher ratio than other companies that are allowed to fill in wetlands. This is all covered in a $2 million ""in lieu"" fee that is part of the agreement. Foxconn paid the amount into the Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust, according to an April 25, 2018, state Department of Natural Resources letter. The in-lieu fee program, according to the DNR, involves the restoration, establishment, enhancement and/or preservation of aquatic resources through funds paid to a government or non-profit natural resources management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements of permits. In a separate reference to its oversight, the state DNR Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust document stated the agency will oversee third-party construction of wetlands as paid for by Foxconn’s fee. DNR communications director Jim Dick said in an email that a total of 16.64 wetland acres under state jurisdiction were delineated in the area of Phase 1 of the Foxconn project. Thus, the $2 million would be used to create at least 33.28 acres of new wetlands. The expectation, he said, is that the new wetland areas will be created in the same watersheds affected by the loss of existing wetlands. The DNR website states ""Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands."" Officials from Foxconn and Walker’s office both cited the same 2:1 ratio and $2 million payment by the company. Our rating In a news release, Flynn said ""Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws."" The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that ""it has no jurisdiction,"" but the state Department of Natural Resources says ""Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands."" Indeed, Foxconn is required to mitigate wetlands at a higher ratio than other companies in the state. The bottomline: While some environmental oversight was removed, Flynn’s claim went beyond that to say there would be no oversight related to wetlands. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB391C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/11/matt-flynn/wisconsin-gubernatorial-candidate-flynn-says-foxco/

Charles Schumer says Dow Jones lost 2,000 points after last debt ceiling fight
","If the nation hits the debt ceiling later this month without it being raised by Congress, economists predict a wide spread of economic harm: higher interest rates, lower economic growth and plunging consumer confidence in the United States and overseas. One particularly high-profile sign of economic distress would be a plummeting Dow Jones Industrial Average. During an appearance on ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., cited that scenario as one of the reasons why Congress should take action soon. Stephanopoulos asked Schumer whether both sides were ""posturing"" and ""playing with fire"" on the debt ceiling, which is the legal limit to how much debt the government can shoulder. Schumer said, ""You don't negotiate over something like the debt ceiling because --"" at which point Stephanopoulos interjected, ""Other presidents have done it."" Schumer responded, ""No. The one time that it was really done in this kind of way, (when it wasn’t just) a deadline and you had to decide (on) abortion or something else, was in 2011. We went right up to the deadline. The stock market lost 2,000 points, $18 billion was lost by the American people."" We wondered whether Schumer was right about the stock market losing 2,000 points. So we looked at historical data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most popular measure of the stock market. On July 21, 2011, the Dow reached 12,724 -- its high point in the months immediately preceding the debt ceiling fight. For the next 10 days, Congress squabbled over raising the debt ceiling. Then, between July 31 and Aug. 2, the White House and congressional leaders reached and implemented a deal that became known as the Budget Control Act of 2011. By Aug. 2, when the crisis was effectively over, the Dow stood at 11,866, a drop of 858 points. That’s less than the 2,000 points Schumer cited. However, the Dow continued to tumble for another two months, due in large part to repercussions of the debt ceiling debate, particularly the downgrading of the United States’ credit rating by Standard & Poors on Aug. 5. By Oct. 3, the Dow had bottomed out at 10,655 -- a decline of 2,069 points from its pre-debt ceiling peak, and its lowest level in about a year. So if you include the aftershocks of the debt ceiling fight, Schumer is correct that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. (You can see the decline as a line chart here.) That said, it’s also worth noting that the recovery was almost as quick as the decline. It took only until Jan. 25, 2012 -- about three and a half months after the low point -- for all of the pre-debt ceiling losses to be recouped. By Jan. 25, the Dow hit 12,758. And as Schumer was speaking on This Week, the most recent Dow close was 15,072 -- an 18 percent increase over the pre-debt ceiling high, which had been about two years and three months earlier. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, said the Dow’s subsequent recovery is irrelevant. ""Of course (the Dow) came back, but that is of little comfort to anyone who was at or nearing retirement during those several months,"" he said. ""With 10,000 baby boomers retiring a day, that drop is incredibly important, and not to be trivialized. .... And this is all from a default that didn’t happen."" Still, we think it’s important to note that the 2,000 points the Dow lost didn’t stay off for years, or even permanently, as some viewers might assume. Our rating Schumer said that because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, ""the stock market lost 2,000 points."" If you count the aftermath of the deal that avoided a debt ceiling breach, which included a historic downgrade of the United States’ creditworthiness rating, then Schumer is right that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. Still, Schumer makes it sound as if the drop happened right away. Actually, it dropped at the time of fight and continued to drop for another two months after the United States' credit rating was downgraded. We rate Schumer’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA983FC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/08/charles-schumer/charles-schumer-says-dow-jones-lost-2000-points-af/

John Morgan says 'nobody's addicted' to marijuana
 ","High-profile Orlando attorney John Morgan is leading an effort in Florida to legalize medical marijuana, arguing that the drug is safer and cheaper than other painkillers. As a recent guest on Bay News 9’s Political Connections, Morgan also discussed whether marijuana is addictive. ""Nobody's addicted to it,"" Morgan claimed. We decided to fact-check Morgan’s claim based on input from readers. But we didn’t have to dig too far. Morgan told us he was wrong. ""It was a huge mistake,"" said Morgan. ""I’m sorry and embarrassed I messed up."" Morgan said he was ""flat out wrong"" about marijuana not being addictive and meant to focus on the use of the drug compared to more potent painkillers. ""Some levels of addiction kill you -- marijuana may make you slow, but it will never kill you,"" said Morgan, a personal injury attorney who is leading the group People United for Medical Marijuana. The group has launched a petition drive to add an amendment to the state’s Constitution to legalize medical marijuana in 2014. Even though Morgan said he made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources. Aaron Norton, a psychotherapist who specializes in addictive disorders, said that ""cannabis dependence is a diagnosable disorder.""  ""Not everyone who uses it becomes addicted,"" said Norton, but some are more vulnerable, including people with mental disorders, adolescents and young adults. ""In the course of my career, I have probably treated hundreds of patients who are cannabis-dependent, and many of them also met the two diagnostic criteria associated with physiological dependence -- tolerance and withdrawal,"" Norton said.    Marijuana abuse is recognized as cannabis-use disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual’s list of symptoms include craving; taking larger doses over a longer period of time than intended; recurrent use that results in failure to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home; and tolerance (needing more to get the desired high). It’s also described as an addictive substance by the government-funded National Institute on Drug Abuse, which writes: ""Estimates from research suggest that about 9 percent of users become addicted to marijuana; this number increases among those who start young (to about 17 percent, or 1 in 6) and among daily users (to 25-50 percent)."" Psychiatrist Dr. Darren Rothschild, an addiction medicine specialist, says he’s worked with patients who have developed a serious dependence on marijuana and ""the impact is substantial."" ""In order to feel normal, they have to have the drug,"" Rothschild said. ""Not everyone who smokes becomes addicted, but it’s erroneous to say it doesn’t happen."" Rothschild said people who smoke marijuana daily over a long period of time are the ones most susceptible to dependence on marijuana versus intermittent smokers who may occasionally smoke pot at a party. ""I’d say none of those people are addicted."" Dr. Samir Sabbag, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment and Research, said ""long-term use of marijuana is indeed addictive,"" though he noted people can be addicted to a variety of things, including the caffeine in chocolate and coffee.  Even groups that support relaxing marijuana laws, such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), concede that Morgan was incorrect to say that marijuana is not potentially addictive. ""Can people have an abusive relationship with marijuana? Absolutely,"" said NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre. But St. Pierre says marijuana is ""not addictive in any way shape or form the same way that alcohol, nicotine and other legal and illegal drugs, even caffeine, can cause serious withdrawal."" Our ruling Orlando attorney John Morgan said that ""nobody’s addicted to"" marijuana. Morgan quickly admitted that he was wrong, and experts agreed.

Cruz claim about more Americans giving up job searches month after month not supported, though labor force participation on downslide
","Saying the new health care law is undermining the economy, Ted Cruz declared that ever-more Americans are giving up on looking for work. The junior U.S. senator from Texas, who hammered the 2010 law in a Senate floor speech that ran from mid-afternoon Sept. 24, 2013 to noon the next day, made this claim after suggesting Washington is broken because lawmakers don’t heed constituents. Americans are not calling for ""more pork,"" Cruz said. ""The calls are from people who are saying: ‘Listen, jobs and the economy is my No. 1 priority.’...  When you have one job, it lets you begin to climb the economic ladder to a better job and a better job and a better job. That is the American spirit. Yet we have tens of millions of people in this country out of work. Every month, we get the reports from the (U.S.) Bureau of Labor Statistics that say even more people have given up looking for work."" Americans giving up on job searches factor significantly into monthly jobless rates. That’s because the government does not count individuals who did not look for work in the latest four weeks as being ""in the workforce."" Cruz continued: ""The odd way our unemployment statistics work, that makes the number the newspapers report go down. Because when a few hundred thousand people say: ‘All right, I give up, it is so hopeless, I will never find a job,’ that, curiously, results in the unemployment number going down because the number that gets reported in the papers is a measure of a percentage of how many of the people looking for work are unable to find it."" Americans giving up? Cruz did not specify the ""reports"" referenced in his speech, but economists told us individuals who have given up looking for work are what the government calls ""discouraged workers,"" meaning persons ""not in the labor force who want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months (or since the end of their last job if they held one within the past 12 months) but who are not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify."" Such workers are a subset of workers classified as ""marginally attached"" to the workforce, meaning individuals who want a job, have searched for work during the prior 12 months and were available to take a job during the referenced week but had not looked for work in the past four weeks. By email, Bureau of Labor Statistics economists guided us to its estimates of the number of discouraged workers, which has gone up and down month to month. According to a searchable bureau database, the number of ""discouraged workers"" averaged a decade-high of nearly 1.2 million in 2010, surely because of the recession. But the monthly average of discouraged workers decreased to 989,000 in 2011, the bureau says, and dropped again, to 909,000, in 2012. In the most recent 12 months before Cruz’s speech, from September 2012 through August 2013, the number of discouraged workers increased six times and decreased six times, according to the agency’s figures. Most recently, the bureau estimated 866,000 discouraged workers in August 2013, which was down from 988,000 and slightly over 1 million workers in the immediately preceding months. For a tighter comparison, we calculated the monthly average of discouraged workers through the first eight months of 2012 at 906,000, which was greater than the comparable 2013 eight-month average of 874,000. By email, bureau economist Steve Haugen agreed that the agency’s quantifications of ""discouraged workers"" are often cited to tally people who have given up looking for work. Labor force participation on slide Alternatively, Haugen wrote, one could look at changes in the nation’s labor-force participation rate, meaning the proportion of the civilian adult population either working or actively looking for work. That fell sharply during the recession, Haugen said, and ""has continued to decline"" even as the economy recovers. ""The latest monthly figures suggest that the participation rate has continued to drift down over the past year,"" Haugen wrote. Haugen added that while government survey results ""generally don’t enable us to precisely answer the question as to whether all of the decline in participation can be ascribed to persons who have abandoned their job search,"" related research suggests ""that weak labor market conditions have played a role, as have longer-term demographic factors, such as retiring baby boomers."" He pointed out a July 2013 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston stating that participation in the nation’s labor force has largely been on the downslide since around 2000 and was projected to drop by another 2.2 percentage points between 2010 and 2020. In contrast, the paper says, if participation had held at the level of December 2007, then 6.2 million additional people would have been in the force in the first quarter of 2013. However, the paper does not say that the shrinking workforce is due only to the recession and slow recovery. Rather, it says, a ""significant portion"" of the decline is attributable to demographic changes. The bank analysis footnotes a BLS article published in January 2012 stating that through 2020, various factors will decrease the labor force participation rate. ""The baby-boom generation’s exit from the prime-age workforce and entry into the older age groups will lower the overall labor force participation rate significantly,"" the article says, knocking down annual growth in the labor force to 0.7 percent. To be sure, most economists express worry about the decline in labor-force participation -- precisely, the share of Americans 16 or older who are working or who are actively looking for a job. The percentage for August 2013 was the lowest it had been since August 1978. If fewer people are working, that’s a potential drag on economic growth. Still, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently noted in connection with another fact check that labor-force participation changes have greatly been affected by large numbers of baby boomers retiring because they no longer want to work. And determining how much of the decline in labor-force participation has been due to the poor economy, as opposed to broader demographic trends, is tricky. PolitiFact noted news reports about the latest BLS employment report indicating that between July 2013 and August 2013, the economy created a net 169,000 additional jobs, while the size of the civilian labor force dropped by 312,000. (The civilian labor force refers to working-age people who are either employed or were unemployed but looking for work.) That supported House Speaker John Boehner’s comment that more Americans are leaving the workforce than finding jobs. However, the cited figures mixed numbers from different surveys not really producing apples-to-apples comparisons. Also, using the full labor force to gauge how many people are ""leaving the workforce"" isn’t perfect. Americans are aging; the leading edge of the baby boomers is turning 67. This means that every month, large numbers of Americans are retiring. Also, the labor-force rolls in Americans as young as age 16, and many Americans between that age and their early 20s aren’t part of the labor market because they are going to school. How much do these factors skew the numbers? It’s hard to say for sure, but in August 2013, just under 7 percent of the Americans categorized as ""not in the labor force"" were also categorized as ""want a job now."" The bulk of the remaining 93 percent were likely school- and retirement-age Americans. So, many non-workers aren’t people actively engaged in the job market. PolitiFact reached a better estimate by focusing on those who wanted a job in August 2013 in contrast to those said as much in August 2012. Upshot: The number of people not in the labor force but who wanted a job fell by 740,000 over that year-long period, while the number of people employed over the same period rose by more than 2.2 million--both favorable economic signals. A Texas take For our part, we turned to Texas A&M University research economist Luis Bernardo Torres who said by telephone that by the discouraged-workers’ metric, Cruz’s statement does not hold up.  Separately, he agreed by email, a ""drop in the labor force participation rate does not mean necessarily that less people are looking for work because some (have) retired, married, gone back to school, etc."" Our ruling Cruz told senators: ""Every month, we get the reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say even more people have given up looking for work."" Per the 12 latest months of data available before Cruz spoke, the number of Americans considered by the bureau to be ""discouraged workers"" fluctuates month to month, sometimes going up and sometimes going down. Separately, a years-long decline in the nation’s labor-force participation rate has significantly been affected by baby-boomer retirements, which by and large are not driven by the economy’s health. We rate this claim, which has a thread of truth but ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression, as Mostly False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Tweets and bloggers say Obama used government shutdown to close Amber Alert system
","The government shutdown has cranked up the volume on the blame game of who is causing the most misery for whom. The latest move comes from the right, where accusations began to fly that President Barack Obama was willing to put missing children’s lives at risk to score political points. From what we found, the claim started in the Twitterverse with tweets late on Friday night, Oct. 4, 2013. ""Did u see how the amber alert system was shut down & they even produced a screen to declare it!?"" said one. Amber Alert is the system that draws the public into the hunt for an abducted child. The Right Scoop carried the message to a wider audience. At around 5 p.m. Sunday, it posted that the U.S. Justice Department Web page for the Amber Alert program was down. ""I’m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn’t – at least not while he’s trying to ‘win’ the government shutdown,"" the blog post said. The Drudge Report put that item on its homepage with the headline, ""Amber Alert website shut down, Michelle’s ‘Let’s Move’ stays up."" By the next morning, the Washington Examiner’s Mark Tapscott had an article titled, ""Obama shutters Amber Alerts as government shutdown enters second week."" ""Somebody, somewhere in the Obama White House or the Obama Justice Department decided to shut down the Amber Alerts, despite the system's long and stellar record of helping locate missing children,"" Tapscott wrote. Two congressmen, Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn, and Steve Stockman, R-Texas, added their own tweets into the mix, echoing the theme that Obama was playing politics with kids. By mid-morning Monday, the government Web page was back up, but chastising tweets continued. We decided to check out exactly what had been shut down, and by whom. Federal action If you went to the federal Amber Alert Web page on Sunday, you would have found this message ""Due to the lapse in Federal funding, this Office of Justice Program website is unavailable."" That is what triggered the blog postings, tweets and articles. A Justice Department spokesperson explained to the Huffington Post, ""All the sites that had to go offline were put behind a firewall so that they couldn't be hacked while the IT people were on furlough."" The spokesman said a furloughed worker was brought back Monday to put the site back online. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave the reason for that move at his press briefing later that day. ""To eliminate any confusion among the public about the status of the program. A furloughed Justice Department employee was called in to work in order to restore the informational site,"" Carney said. ""But again, it’s informational. The system itself was never interrupted."" We contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit that assists local and state authorities in this work. According to their data, over this weekend, at the same time the tweets and blog posts were building, the Amber Alert was activated twice: in Texas on Oct. 4 and in Florida on Oct. 5. At the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, spokesperson Gretl Plessinger said the news stories about the federal website had prompted some people to call out of concern. Plessinger reassured the public that Florida's program ""is operating as it always has."" We also got in touch with Gene Thaxton of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, who coordinates the Amber Alert system for that state. Thaxton was emphatic that the program never closed. ""Oklahoma has its own Amber Alert program, and it is not affected by the government shutdown,"" he said. ""The federal Web page is informational. It doesn’t affect the operations of the program."" To be clear, the Amber Alert system is not run by Washington. States set up their own programs and use guidelines and standards that are shared nationwide. The program is a network of these state-run operations. At the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, spokesman Bob Hoever told us that the federal Web page plays no role in actually finding children. Hoever said local or state law enforcement officials trigger an Amber Alert when authorities have details like the name of the child, a photo of the child, the kind of car involved, a plate number, or a photo of the suspect. ""Those are the things that have led to a rescue in the past,"" he said. State authorities then notify the media and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The center spreads the word through the Web and over cell phones, sending automatic text messages to everyone with a smart phone in the area where officials think the child might be. ""We had a case in Minnesota where a teenager read the text on her phone, and there across the street was the car,"" Hoever said. ""She told her dad, and he called the police, and they rescued the child."" Hoever said as far as he knows, from the initial investigation to the public reports of a possible sighting, the federal website has never been involved. ""If people knew how this worked, we wouldn’t be dealing with this confusion,"" he said. Our ruling People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida. The one sliver of truth that triggered this claim is that a federal webpage promoting the program was closed, but that did not affect the program itself. It is a mistake to confuse that web page with the Amber Alert system. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC043680>],/factchecks/2013/oct/07/tweets/tweets-and-bloggers-say-obama-used-shutdown-close-/

Did Obama shut down the ocean as part of the shutdown?
","As we were drowning in claims about the federal government shutdown, this one popped up on our shores Monday morning: Obama has closed down the ocean as part of the shutdown. This brought to mind an image of federal agents tossing frolicking children out of the sea and soldiers marching on the beaches, barricading the bikini-clad set from taking a dip. We found numerous ocean shutdown claims on Twitter: ""Obama shuts down Atlantic ocean! Who knew the fed’s owned the ocean?"" and ""Obama and Dems can’t even close borders but are trying to close the ocean!"" and ""if Obama can shut down the ocean why didn’t he shut down the hurricanes and floods?"" We fished out this one to fact-check: ""It is official. Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!"" We dove in to search for answers. Has Obama shut down the ocean as part of the federal government shutdown? The key to the answer was close to home for PolitiFact Florida: the Florida Keys. The Florida Bay  Many of the ocean shutdown tweets linked to an Oct. 5 article on the conservative website Breitbart, which included this headline: ""Feds try to close the ocean because of shutdown."" It featured a photo of President Barack Obama swimming through ocean waves. The article explained that the closure related to the Florida Bay and linked to a Miami Herald article. The Herald pulled information from the Florida Keys Keynoter, which stated that boat charter guides received a message from the National Park Service banning them from taking customers to fish in Florida Bay, which is within the boundaries of the Everglades National Park. More than 1,100 square miles of prime fishing, between the southern tip of the mainland and the Keys, would be off limits until further notice, according to Dan Kimball, superintendent of Everglades and Dry Tortugas national parks. We tracked down the message that commercial use permit holders for Everglades National park received: ""Effective at 6 p.m. on Oct. 1, 2013, both Everglades and Dry Tortugas National Parks will be closed. While our law enforcement rangers will remain on duty, all other administrative activities and visitor services will be discontinued until the shutdown has been lifted. If you have a trip planned for Oct. 1, you must conclude your business within the park by 6 p.m. After today, you may not offer any services within the park's boundaries until further notice. We regret the burden that this will place on your livelihood. We will notify you when the park is reopened."" Kimball confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that the Florida Bay, which encompasses about a half-million acres, is closed due to the shutdown. However, there are exceptions, including transit through the park. ""You can’t anchor, you can’t fish,"" Kimball said. ""It has to be for transportation purposes."" Also, the feds will allow access in emergencies, such as seeking shelter from a storm, and they granted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission access to monitor algae blooms. ""Just like the Grand Canyon is closed during shutdown -- it's federal property -- so is the Florida Bay under the Everglades National Park,"" said Jennifer George-Nichol, who works for U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, who represents the Keys. The national park closure does not mean that the entire ocean -- whether in the Keys, the rest of Florida or elsewhere -- is shut down. There are still spots in the Keys where tourists can go fishing or jump in for a swim. For example, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which offers glass bottom boat rides and snorkel excursions, isn’t limited by the federal shutdown. ""At this time, nothing in the state park is affected,"" said Nathan Frier, assistant manager for Coral Reef Park Company, a concessionaire inside the park. ""We do have a lot of calls to see if we are open or not."" At Barefoot Billy’s in Key West, boat trips to the Dry Tortugas are canceled but other ocean activities including parasailing, boating and jet skiing remain open. ""We have numerous local and state parks and beaches, none of which are impacted,"" said Lisa Tennyson, director of legislative affairs for Monroe County. Enforcing the shutdown in Florida Bay We wondered how seriously the shutdown in Florida Bay will be enforced. Breitbart speculated that the government ""will probably use more personnel and spend more resources to attempt to close the ocean, than it would in its normal course of business."" The National Parks Service contingency plan states activities at parks and facilities will be suspended ""except for those that are essential to respond to emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property."" The majority of employees at Biscayne National Park and Everglades National Park and Dry Tortugas have been furloughed. Rangers have been notifying people that the park is closed and asked them to leave and generally have had good compliance, Kimball said. When we interviewed Kimball mid-afternoon Oct. 7, no one had been issued a written warning or violation. Our ruling Claims about the federal government shutdown include this one circulating on Twitter: ""Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!"" The tweet linked to an article in Breitbart that explains that the shutdown means that the Dry Tortugas and the Florida Bay are closed as a result of the shutdown. That means that 1,100 square miles of prime fishing is off limits -- a blow to fishing charter companies and others that benefit from that access. Biscayne National Park is also off limits. But it’s an exaggeration to state that Obama has tried to shut down the entire ocean -- or even to suggest that he has shuttered the Atlantic Ocean or all of the waters in the Keys. Tourists and locals can continue to fish, swim and play in the ocean, even in the Keys. We throw a big ol’ bucket of ocean water from the Keys on this claim and rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9B92440>],/factchecks/2013/oct/07/tweets/did-obama-shut-down-ocean-part-shutdown/

Mario Diaz-Balart says Congress is paid during shutdown due to Constitution
","You know those members of Congress who are responsible for the federal government shutdown? While staffers have been furloughed, their bosses continue to collect their paychecks. During an Oct. 2 interview on CNN, Wolf Blitzer asked U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, ""Will you accept your paycheck as 800,000 other federal workers are being denied theirs?"" Diaz-Balart replied that he hopes staffers get repaid when the shutdown is over. As for his own paycheck, Diaz-Balart didn’t say he would or wouldn’t accept his paycheck. Instead, he said this: ""There is a bit of a constitutional issue by the way, as you know, when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of Congress."" A few days later, Diaz-Balart voted to give back pay to furloughed federal workers. The measure passed unanimously in the House, 407 to 0. Still, we were intrigued by his comments that pay for legislators raises constitutional issues. What does the Constitution tell us about congressional paychecks amid a shutdown? What the Constitution says About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed during the shutdown that started Oct. 1. During past shutdowns, furloughed workers received back pay once the shutdown was over. Other workers have been deemed essential (or in government-speak ""excepted"") and must work for now while getting paid when the shutdown ends. Finally, President Barack Obama signed a law to allow active military and the civilians and contractors who support them to get paid during the shutdown. But the rules that apply to federal workers don’t apply to members of Congress. Most members earn $174,000 a year, with leadership getting a little more. ""Due to their constitutional responsibilities and a permanent appropriation for congressional pay, members of Congress are not subject to furlough,"" states a September report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution authorizes pay for members of Congress. ""The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States,"" it states. Most of the experts we interviewed and news articles we read agreed that according to the Constitution, Congress continues to get paid, even during a shutdown. The purpose of the language about congressional pay ""was to resolve the once-hot dispute over whether the elected representatives to the new federal government would be paid by the states or out of the federal treasury,"" said Ilya Shapiro, Senior Fellow in Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute. ""So yes, Congress can’t reduce/eliminate its own pay during a shutdown. I guess that makes congressmen and senators the primo ‘essential’ federal workers."" But we’ll offer one counterargument by University of Miami constitutional law professor Stephen Schnably. If people are saying the Constitution ""is a barrier to their pay being withheld during the shutdown, I’d have to say the text doesn’t necessarily support that. It doesn’t say, ‘regardless of any appropriation requirement.’ "" However, ""what really counts in this area is Congress’s practice over the years,"" Schnably said. ""Mostly these provisions have been left to Congress to interpret."" Right now, Congress is scheduled to be paid. ""Constitutionally, we have to disperse their pay, but we are honoring member requests to hold on to their pay until after the shutdown,"" said Dan Weiser, communications director for the House’s Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. At least 125 members have said that they will refuse their paycheck or donate it, according to the Washington Post, though some observers say that’s just a publicity stunt. And it might be a moot point because members get paid at the end of the month and it’s possible the shutdown will be over before then. (Diaz-Balart’s chief of staff declined to discuss with PolitiFact if Diaz-Balart wants to forgo his pay but when questioned about it on CNN he said that lawmakers need to avoid ""gimmicks."") One final wrinkle about their paychecks: Congress can’t change its own pay until after an election happens. The 27th Amendment, adopted in 1992, states, ""No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened."" That amendment means Congress can’t vote to stop it's pay right now, said Kermit Roosevelt, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school. However, Congress could pass a law for future shutdowns, saying they won’t be paid, he said. Past efforts to do that have failed, though. In January, U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Bob Casey, D-Pa., introduced a bill that would would prevent Congress and the president from being paid during a shutdown or default. The Senate passed such a bill in 2011, but the House didn’t act. Similar efforts this fall leading up to the shutdown also failed. Our ruling When asked about whether he would forgo his own paycheck during the shutdown, Diaz-Balart said, ""There is a bit of a constitutional issue ... when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of Congress."" He is correct: Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution authorizes pay for members of Congress ""ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States."" Members can ask the House to withhold their pay, but that’s just a temporary symbolic move -- particularly since they aren’t scheduled to get a paycheck until the end of the month.

John Boehner says U.S. will have record revenues this year
","As the nation moved closer to breaching the debt ceiling, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that the country has enough money, it just needs to stop spending. On the Oct. 6, 2013, edition of This Week, Stephanopoulos asked Boehner about his stance on passing a ""clean"" debt limit bill -- that is, a bill that lifts the amount of debt the nation can take on without adding any additional provisions. ""So under no circumstances will you pass a clean debt limit?"" Stephanopoulos asked Boehner. Boehner responded, ""We're not going down that path. ... George, we've spent more than what we've brought in for 55 of the last 60 years. This year, the federal government will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country, and yet we're still going to have a nearly $700 billion budget deficit."" Boehner’s a little off when he said that there have been deficits for 55 out of the past 60 years; it’s actually been 51 years out of 60. But in this item, we wanted to look at his claim that the government ""will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country."" The most recent estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects in excess of $3 trillion in revenues for fiscal year 2014. That would be the highest amount of federal revenue in the nation’s history when measured by raw dollars. However, that’s not the only way to measure federal revenues -- or even the best. That’s because using raw dollars doesn’t take into account either inflation or the growing economy and population. It’s natural that today’s economy -- which is larger than ever, and with dollars worth less than they once were -- would produce the largest amount of revenue in raw dollars. An alternative way of measuring the scale of federal revenues is to measure it as a percentage of gross domestic product. And using this yardstick gives a much different impression. For fiscal 2013, the just-completed fiscal year, the Office of Management and Budget predicted that federal revenues would account for 16.7 percent of GDP. That’s the highest it’s been since 2008, the year the Great Recession hit -- but by historical standards, it’s low. Going back to 1952, revenues as a percentage of GDP were higher than today’s level during 55 of 63 years, or 87 percent of the time. Only in eight years was it lower than today’s 16.7 percent. It reached a high of 20.6 percent of GDP in 2000. When we contacted Boehner’s office, spokesman Brendan Buck said that what Boehner said ""is accurate. If you want to write about revenue as a percentage of GDP, that’s a column – not a fact check."" However, experts say the difference between the two measurements isn’t trivial. Boehner’s argument was that even with historically unprecedented revenues, the United States still can’t balance its books. He has a point that the nation does face long-term budget concerns, but framing the question the way he did ignores that current revenues aren’t all that massive by historical standards. ""If revenues had been even at historically average levels -- whether due to a stronger economy or a different tax structure -- the deficit might be significantly lower,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling Boehner said that this year, the federal government ""will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country."" That’s true for raw dollars, but raw dollars aren’t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, because inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever. A more reliable method -- revenue as a percentage of GDP -- actually shows that revenues today are historically low compared to most of the past six decades.

Wendy Davis filibustered abortion restrictions, June 25-26, 2013, but to earlier debate over the same measure, Senate Bill 5, in the first summer special session called by Gov. Rick Perry. Under Democratic fire, the proposal perished in that session, but it passed into law in a second session called by Perry. Not all versions of the claim about Dewhurst’s whereabouts have been so clear. On a website launched Aug. 16, 2013, by Sen. Dan Patrick, like Staples a Republican challenging Dewhurst for the lieutenant governorship, comic cat videos illustrate ""the night that will live in Texas political infamy"" -- Davis’ filibuster -- with captions claiming Dewhurst ""was out having a glass of wine with a political consultant friend"" on ""the night of the important pro-life bill debate."" Another Republican challenger, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, alluded to failed leadership and ""vanities like expensive steak dinners with overpriced consultants,"" according to a July 12, 2013, news blog entry by the Dallas Morning News. Staples raised the issue again at a Sept. 16, 2013, debate, according to a Houston Chronicle news story posted that day, which quoted him as saying, ""You don't go out to eat and drink with lobbyists when there are issues on the floor of the Senate that you are supposed to be dealing with."" It’s not uncommon for legislators to step out and grab dinner when work runs late, nor for the lieutenant governor to hand off the duty of presiding over the proceedings to a senator. So, what exactly happened? As the Senate debated amendments late on June 18, 2013, before voting to send the abortion proposal to the House, Dewhurst chaired most of the evening session and also watched over the final vote. In between, he stepped out for a time -- newspapers reported that tweets placed him at a steakhouse eight blocks from the Capitol -- and he confirmed to reporters when he returned that he’d been at Austin Land and Cattle. ""No steak,"" though, he said, and did not answer a question about whether he’d had any wine. Reporters and lege-watchers registered surprise that Dewhurst would depart during debate on an issue he had urged Perry to add to the agenda. Staples campaign spokesman Kent Sholars emailed us the Morning News blog post and a June 24, 2013, San Antonio Express News/Houston Chronicle news story. We looked at those and other news accounts, tweets, Senate journals (which document floor proceedings) and video of the relevant debate. We asked Dewhurst’s campaign staff for comment, but did not hear back. What we did find confirmed Staples’ statement except for the claim that Dewhurst had ""drinks""; reports were mixed on that score. Sholars noted that the Morning News blog post said Dewhurst had decided ""to slip out for a glass of wine."" The blog entry didn’t cite a source for that statement. One of the reports said that at the restaurant, Dewhurst met up with political consultant Rob Johnson. We tried to contact Johnson but did not hear back. He was Dewhurst’s chief of staff from 2006 to mid-2009, when he became manager of Perry’s re-election campaign, then managed presidential campaigns for Newt Gingrich and Perry before starting a political action committee to boost Dewhurst’s U.S. Senate bid in 2012. The Morning News also reported, ""Dewhurst didn’t eat. As his spokesman Travis Considine noted two days later, he presided over most of the debate and was confident colleagues could soldier on during his brief absence."" Senate journals for June 18, 2013, show Dewhurst had earlier presided over the floor proceedings from 12:20 p.m. to 1:39 p.m., then gaveled the Senate back in at 5:39 p.m. to take up the abortion-restriction measure. Dewhurst called for a break at 8:54 p.m., according to the journal, and Sen. Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, took over the duties of presiding from Dewhurst as debate resumed at 9:15 p.m. The Senate adjourned at 10:15 p.m. and was called to order again by Dewhurst at 11:09 p.m. After voting to approve the measure, the Senate called it a night at 11:45 p.m. Among tweets collected in a Statesman politics blog post June 19, 2013, Associated Press Capitol reporter Jim Vertuno wrote, ""Since everyone (is) wondering, Dewhurst is back in the chamber. He was here for 3 hours of debate, let Eltife chair most amendments."" Also during the debate, Express-News reporter Peggy Fikac tweeted, ""Re Land & Cattle, @DavidHDewhurst confirms he was there to say hi to a consultant but ‘no steak.’ "" 
 Our ruling Staples said, ""The current incumbent lieutenant governor went out for drinks during the legislative session when that bill was originally on the Senate floor."" Dewhurst has said that he stepped out to a restaurant during part of a lengthy Senate debate on abortion legislation June 18. But Staples did not prove he had drinks, and we found no such confirmation either. Given that going ""out for drinks"" has connotations that just aren't supported by the available evidence, we rate Staples’ statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

"['Guns', 'Virginia', 'Ken Cuccinelli']","
Cuccinelli says Virginia is No. 1 in stopping the mentally ill from buying guns
","GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says the state has made strides in keeping guns away from the mentally ill since the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. ""What we’ve done in Virginia is we have become the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases,"" Cuccinelli said during a Sept. 25 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe. We wondered if Virginia really is No. 1. To support his statement, Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix pointed to a chart in the Seattle Times that ranked states on that measure.The chart was based on figures compiled by Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- a gun control group started by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those figures show Virginia had submitted 2,254 mental health records to the national background check system for every 100,000 residents in the state. That was the highest ratio among all states in late 2011. The gun control group said in a November 2011 version of its Fatal Gaps report that Virginia had been sharing records with the national background check database for a decade, but the volume of records shared increased after the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy. In that case, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two handguns he used to kill 32 people despite going through federal and state background checks at licensed gun dealers, according to a 2009 panel report on the shooting to then Gov. Tim Kaine. Cho had been deemed a danger to himself by a Virginia court, and that normally would have made him ineligible to buy the weapons. But his information was not shared with the federal National Instant Background Check System, the panel said, because of ambiguities in Virginia’s guns laws. The Virginia Tech shootings sparked a nationwide examination of the national background check system. Congress passed a 2008 law providing incentives for states to submit mental health records to the national background check system, but they are under no requirement comply. Virginia also passed legislation expanding the mental health records that have to be sent to the federal and state background check databases. Mayors Against Illegal Guns notes on its interactive chart that in the wake of the massacre, Virginia became the national leader in submitting mental health records to the national background check system. It remained at the top of the group’s list until October 2012, Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. Since, then, however, Pennsylvania has vaulted from the bottom of the pack to the top. That month, according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Pennsylvania State Police resolved lengthy legal and technical problems and transmitted 643,167 mental health records to the NICS. The submission means that Pennsylvania has submitted about 5,003 mental health records to the national background check system per 100,000 residents. Virginia was a distant No. 2 in the latest report by the mayors’ group, which counts all submissions through Oct. 31, 2012. Virginia had sent 180,338 mental health records to NICS. That breaks down to about 2,220 records per 100,000 residents. Rounding out the Top 5 were Delaware, California and Washington. The Bottom 5, in descending order, were Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The gun control group plans to issue an updated report in the coming weeks. Our ruling  Cuccinelli said Virginia is ""the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases."" His claim is based on outdated numbers.   Virginia used to be No.1, but was surpassed by Pennsylvania last year. Now, we’re a distant No. 2. That’s still impressive. So Cuccinelli’s statement is largely accurate but needs the clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD82500>],/factchecks/2013/oct/07/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-virginia-no-1-stopping-mentally-il/

Obamacare to stop domestic violence as pre-existing condition, Gwen Moore says
","On Sept. 29, 2013, two days before a political showdown over Obamacare led to a government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore defended the health care law. On MSNBC’s ""Disrupt with Karen Finney"" show, the Milwaukee Democrat described how bad women have had it -- and how things will improve with the Affordable Care Act. She stated: ""If you’re a victim of domestic violence, even that’s seen as a pre-existing condition. Women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender rating. All of that is over."" So, we need to determine whether being a domestic violence victim is regarded as a pre-existing health condition; and whether women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of ""gender rating."" We also need to see how the health care law handles domestic violence and gender rating. Pre-existing conditions In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama made a statement similar to the first part of Moore’s claim. She said it was legal in some states to regard domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and use it as a basis for denying health insurance coverage. PolitiFact National rated Obama’s statement True because at the time, eight states permitted treating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, according to the National Women’s Law Center. The law center told us that its most recent check, in 2010, showed the District of Columbia as well as six states -- Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming -- had no law prohibiting the insurers from designating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. However, there were restrictions in some of those states. (The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, also referred us to the law center on this question.) In rating Michelle Obama’s statement, our colleagues pointed out that just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Indeed, an insurer might deny a woman coverage based on an injury or condition without it being disclosed that the injury or condition was a result of domestic violence. There was evidence in the 1990s that using domestic violence to deny coverage was widespread, but the law center told us it is not aware of any data on how many insurance companies actually use domestic violence now as a pre-existing condition. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act will prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems, such as high blood pressure, depression or diabetes, as well as ""conditions arising out of domestic violence."" So, while there isn’t evidence that health insurers commonly use domestic violence as a pre-existing condition to deny coverage, it is ""seen"" as such in that it is legal in a handful of states for health insurers to do so. Moore is also correct that practice is being outlawed under Obamacare. ""Gender rating"" The second part of Moore’s claim is that women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of ""gender rating."" There’s no dispute that health insurers use gender as one factor in setting rates; others include age, family size, geographic region and health status. But Moore’s broad claim that women pay 50 percent higher rates isn’t so clear. Moore cited a March 2012 report, again from the National Women’s Law Center. The center said it used the eHealthInsurance website to calculate premiums in the individual market -- in other words, premiums for women who purchase health insurance themselves, rather than getting it through their employer or spouse. The individual market is a key target of the Affordable Care Act. The center said premiums were at least 50 percent higher for women than for men in a number of instances, including health plans for 25-year-olds in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming; and for 40-year-olds in Alabama, Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. Although federal anti-discrimination protections enacted prior to the Affordable Care Act generally prohibit employers from charging female employees higher premiums than male employees, businesses with predominantly female workforces are routinely charged more for group coverage, according to the law center. The reform law prohibits gender rating, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. So, there is evidence that some women buying health insurance in the individual market, a key target of Obamacare, are charged 50 percent more than men for the same coverage. Such gender rating is made illegal under the health reform law. Our rating Moore said domestic violence ""is seen as a pre-existing"" health condition and ""women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings,"" but under Obamacare, ""all of that is over."" The thrust of what Moore said is partially accurate, in that there is some evidence to back the pre-existing condition and 50 percent parts of her claim. She’s correct that the Affordable Care Act eliminates the treatment of domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and eliminates gender rating. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Moore a Half True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
R.I. Gov. Lincoln Chafee says governors in 46 states have line-item veto authority
","In a Sept. 22 interview on WPRI-Channel 12’s  ""Newsmakers,"" the subject of the Rhode Island State Constitution and the relative powers of the governor and General Assembly came up. Governor Lincoln Chafee said on the show that ""nothing could be more important"" than to assign more power to the governor, who, in Rhode Island, is institutionally weak relative to the Assembly. ""Line-item veto is a perfect example. Everything goes in the budget the last minute. If the governor vetoes the whole budget, it’s going to be overridden in a millisecond,"" he said. ""But if you can line-item veto, like 46 other states have, then that becomes a public discussion about that narrow issue"" and the governor might be able to prevail. Is Chafee correct that a large majority -- 46 of 50 states -- give their governors the line-item veto? We thought we’d test his knowledge of the states. First, let’s define the term ""line-item veto."" It allows a chief executive to prevent from becoming law a particular provision of a bill approved by a legislature, including a budget bill, while allowing the rest of the bill to take effect. In Rhode Island, it takes a three-fifths majority vote of both branches of the General Assembly to override a governor’s veto. The three-fifths requirement, rather than the simple majority necessary to pass a bill initially, is a higher threshold that gives a governor an improved chance to win in a disagreement. In order for the governor to gain the line-item veto, a Constitutional Convention would have to be called, the convention delegates would have to propose that change to voters, and they would have to approve the change. A convention typically is convened by a vote of the electorate every 10 years. Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis has said that he intends to put a convention call on the general election ballot in 2014. So, back to our test of Chafee’s claim that 46 states have a line-item veto. We went to ""The Book of the States,"" 2013 edition, published by the Council of State Governments. It lists 44 states in which the governor has a line-item veto for all bills or at least for bills appropriating money. Besides Rhode Island, the only states lacking it are Nevada, Indiana, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Vermont. The ""Book of the States"" information is based on state-by-state surveys completed in December 2012. So we contacted the National Council of State Legislatures and the National Governors Association to make sure nothing has changed since. It hasn’t, they say. Our ruling Governor Lincoln Chafee said governors in 46 states have line-item veto power. But a definitive and up-to-date source, The Book of the States, says 44 have it. He is very close. The judges rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC04380>],/factchecks/2013/oct/06/lincoln-chafee/ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-governors-46-states-hav/

A closer look at a Facebook post on a man's struggle with the Obamacare marketplace
","Shortly after the the Obamacare insurance marketplace launched on Oct. 1, users of social media experienced a burst of complaints on Twitter and Facebook, ranging from technical glitches to substantive concerns. But for our readers, one post stood out. Many readers sent us a Facebook post that went viral and has since been circulated by chain-email. It was originally posted on the Facebook page of Healthcare.gov, the federal government’s portal to the new insurance marketplace created under President Barack Obama’s health care law. The marketplace is designed to offer one-stop shopping for health insurance plans for Americans whose employers do not offer coverage. The Facebook post claims to be from a man named Will Sheehan. (We couldn’t confirm his identity.)  The post says that he tried to sign up for Obamacare and then decided to not go along with it; he then said he received an email detailing fines he would face.   Here’s the full text of the post: ""I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 ‘Silver Plan’ and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I ‘opt-out’ and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the ‘REPERCUSSIONS PORTION’ for ‘non-payment’ of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with ‘Non-Payment’ and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy ‘Automatically withdraw’ your ‘penalties’ weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is ‘Free’ or even ‘Affordable’."" We will check a number of the post’s claims below. • ""There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I ‘opt-out’ and chose to continue along with no insurance."" According to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the marketplace, this is not how the system works: ""There's no way for people to complete the online application and then affirmatively ‘opt out’ at the end. They would simply close the website or not enroll in a plan."" • ""I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me"" about the fines I would face. This is wrong on several levels. First, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Second, any fines would be calculated as part of the user’s overall income tax form 1040 -- they wouldn’t be sent as a bill. And third, any taxes would be owed by April 15, 2015 -- a year and a half from now. Someone being assessed a tax penalty by the Internal Revenue Service in early October doesn’t even make any sense, since the applicant has many weeks to find another insurance plan and avoid a penalty. • ""My fine would be $4,037."" This number is way out of line. Under the law, the penalty fee in 2014 is 1 percent of your yearly income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. The fee increases every year. In 2016 it is 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher. If we are to take this Facebook user’s claims at face value -- that his ""income base was 45K-55K annually""-- and if he has no dependents, he would not have to pay any more than $550, by 2015. To pay a penalty of $4,037 in 2014, you would need to be making making more than $403,700 a year. • ""Your drivers license will be suspended until paid."" CMS told PolitiFact that nobody’s driver's license will be suspended as a noncompliance penalty under the Affordable Care Act. Nothing in the law mentions that as a penalty, and driver’s licenses are administered by state governments. • ""If you go 24 consecutive months with ‘Non-Payment’ and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home."" A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the law specifically bars the IRS from using their normal means of collecting unpaid taxes, including the use of liens and levy.   According to the law, the government ""shall not (i) file notice of lien with respect to any property of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section, or (ii) levy on any such property with respect to such failure.’’ Instead, the only thing the IRS can do to collect fines is to subtract it from any tax refund you qualify for. If you aren’t due a refund, all the IRS can do is send you a letter. Another section of the health care law protects citizens from any other form of punishment.  ""In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty (…) such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty,"" it says. • ""You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy ‘Automatically withdraw’ your ‘penalties’ weekly, bi-weekly or monthly!"" Don’t take online banking advice from a Facebook post. The Treasury Department warns citizens not to hand out bank information online. Our ruling The Facebook post tells the story of a man who says he opted out of Obamacare soon after the marketplace was launched on Oct. 1, 2013, and was informed that he owed a fine of more than $4,000. The post includes many elements that make no sense or are flat-out wrong -- and can be easily debunked by reading the law or reliable summaries of it. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC76440>],/factchecks/2013/oct/04/facebook-posts/closer-look-facebook-post-mans-struggle-obamacare-/
"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Anita Perry']","
Six countries allow abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and many countries permit them under certain circumstances
","Anita Perry said she supported new abortion restrictions advanced by the Republican-majority Legislature and signed into law this summer by her husband, Gov. Rick Perry. ""And I believe there are only four countries in the world that allow abortions after 20 weeks,"" Anita Perry said, adding that Texas belonged in the same category prior to the changes in law. Her four-count, part of a Sept. 28, 2013, public interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, aligned with a similar claim made in August 2013 by former Republican U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina of California, who said in defense of the change in Texas law: ""There are only four countries in the world that have -- that legalize abortion after five months -- China, North Korea, Canada and the U.S."" Setting five months as equal to 20 weeks, after which the changed Texas law restricts abortions, PolitiFact rated Fiorina’s claim as Half True after identifying wrinkles including a couple of additional countries allowing abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. What the laws say U.S. requirements for legally obtaining an abortion vary by state, but the national standard was handed down from the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Lawmakers and physicians refer to the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus as ""viability."" The decision sets the standard that women can choose to have an abortion until the point of viability. In citing the leading obstetrics publication as a guide, the ruling suggests viability starts at 24 weeks into the gestation period, which starts on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period. So women in the United States can get an abortion for any reason, not necessarily medical, until at least 24 weeks of gestation. This is known as elective abortion. After 24 weeks, or whenever the resident’s state prohibits elective abortion, the woman can get a therapeutic abortion under a few exceptions: life in danger, physical health or mental health. China, North Korea and Canada do not have federally enforced limits on elective abortion. Gestation period restrictions in Canada, unlike the other two nations, are regulated at the local level, Johanna Fine, a Center for Reproductive Rights spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. Provinces can range from 10 to 20 weeks for the maximum gestation period. So this gets us to the mentioned four nations. However, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which published a 2013 chart that several reproductive rights experts referred PolitiFact to, Singapore and the Netherlands also fit the criteria. Both nations allow unrestricted abortion through Week 24 of gestation, after which therapeutic abortion is possible. Anita Perry’s statement, like the claim by Fiorina, also leaves off an important qualifier. She did not mention that dozens of countries permit abortions after 20 weeks for different reasons. Common exceptions to the gestational period requirement mean women may be able to get therapeutic abortions based on physical health, mental health or socioeconomic status. Just 29 countries (meaning independent states and semi-autonomous regions whose populations exceed 1 million) outlaw abortion entirely, with no exceptions to save the woman’s life. Thirty-seven other countries that routinely outlaw abortion, including Paraguay, Afghanistan and Uganda, make clear exceptions to save mothers. Another 59 will do so in general to preserve pregnant women’s physical health on a broader scale, with Israel, New Zealand and others also accepting mental health reasons as valid exceptions. India and Japan belong to a group of 13 countries that grant even wider exceptions that include access to the procedure for socioeconomic reasons based on factors like age of the woman or very low income. The remaining 61 countries legalize elective abortions with varying gestational period requirements, with the United States, Canada, North Korea, China, Singapore and the Netherlands being the six countries with the widest acceptable time periods. ""It’s not so much whether abortion is legal; it’s under what circumstances it's legal,"" Mindy Roseman, the Human Rights Program academic director at Harvard Law School, told PolitiFact. ""Even where abortion is highly restricted, it’s legal for the health of the woman."" By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens said the initial PolitiFact article on Fiorina’s claim ""pretty much covers"" the Anita Perry claim. Our ruling Perry said only four countries allow legal abortions past 20 weeks into the gestational period. The United States, Canada, North Korea and China fit that measure, but Singapore and the Netherlands do as well. Also, far more countries permit abortions in certain circumstances in which the pregnancy would damage the woman’s well-being, be it physical, mental or economic.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul says '85 percent of government's running right now'
","When someone says the government is ""shut down,"" it sounds like most services have ground to a halt, except for activities to protect life and property. But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggests that dire image is exaggerated. During an interview on CNN on Oct. 2, 2013, Paul told anchor Erin Burnett that ""85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down."" Is he right? We took a closer look and found that there are different ways to measure government. Government spending is one way, but the picture changes when you look at the federal workforce. First, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that’s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly. However, other types of federal spending are unaffected by the shutdown because they aren’t subject to annual appropriations. An important one is known as mandatory spending -- money paid out to anyone who meets a fixed definition, such as someone who qualifies for Social Security or Medicare. Much of President Barack Obama’s health care law is also unaffected by the shutdown since it is not dependent on regular appropriations, Also, interest payments on the debt are not affected by a shutdown. So if you’re trying to determine how much spending is ""on"" during a shutdown and how much is ""off,"" you have to compare the amounts that fit into these various categories. According to the fiscal year 2014 figures from the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- the federal budget includes $2.2 trillion for mandatory spending, plus $237 billion in interest payments. These two categories add up to $2.4 trillion, out of a total budget of $3.6 trillion -- or about 68 percent. The percentage grows closer to Paul’s estimate of 85 percent once you add in spending on military personnel. Such spending would ordinarily be subject to cutbacks, but it was exempted by enactment of the Pay Our Military Act, which Congress passed and the president signed shortly before the shutdown began. Paul’s office, citing Senate Budget Committee calculations, said the Pay Our Military Act frees up $225 billion in payments to be paid. That brings the percentage up to 74 percent. And the percentage rises further once you count the costs of federal activities that are continuing during the shutdown because they safeguard the public’s safety and property. The problem is that it’s hard to nail down exactly how much money is being spent on such activities, since we’re so early in the shutdown and because many of the decisions have been made on the fly. In order to reach Paul’s 85 percent threshold, the government would need to be spending $404 billion from its ""discretionary"" (or appropriated) budget beyond military personnel. That means the government would be spending 43 percent of the remaining discretionary spending on activities that continue through the shutdown. Experts we spoke to said that percentage is plausible. Even if you cut that $404 billion figure in half, Paul would still be pretty close -- the figure would be 79 percent rather than 85 percent. We’ll only know the final number for certain after the shutdown is over. Still, spending isn’t the only way to look at this issue. For instance, if you look at the number of federal employees furloughed, the percentage left unscathed by the shutdown is likely much lower than the 85 percent figure Paul cited for spending. Estimates published in the New York Times suggest that at least six agencies were expecting to keep 20 percent or less of their workforce laboring through the shutdown, with another three expecting to continue employing between 21 percent and 50 percent. Using spending as the unit of measurement biases the perception of how far-reaching the shutdown is, because so much of the budget is spent on things like Social Security and Medicare -- programs that are dollar-heavy but personnel-light, said John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, an advocacy group for government service. ""Government spending does not equal government,"" said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""So while it hard to come up with an accurate figure as to how much government is still being done, the spending burn rate is not the best way."" Our ruling Paul said that ""85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down."" Government shutdowns by nature are somewhat haphazard, so it’s hard at this point to calculate these numbers with any precision. However, due to the big role of entitlement spending in the federal budget, Paul is likely in the ballpark when he measures ""government"" by the yardstick of spending. However, measuring government in other ways, such as the percentage of federal employees being furloughed in major departments, would make the impact appear bigger. And when he said that ""85 percent of government"" is operating right now, that’s more of a stretch. Paul’s comment is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB961A40>],/factchecks/2013/oct/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-only-15-percent-federal-spending-be/

Moran says Obamacare has ""reined in"" the growth in health care costs
","U.S. Rep. Jim Moran says Obamacare is stunting the growth in health care costs. ""Rising health care costs have handicapped consumers and choked family budgets,"" Moran, D-8th, said in a Sept. 12 statement. ""Thankfully, that growth has been reined in through the Affordable Care Act."" We asked for proof and Moran’s office pointed to a 2012 report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It said total U.S. health care spending in 2011 was $2.7 trillion. That was a 3.9 percent increase over 2010. The study said the growth rate was low by historical standards, as were the 2009 and 2010 growth rates of 3.8 and 3.9 percent respectively. The Kaiser Family Foundation wrote in April that health care spending is growing at the slowest rate since the government began keeping official tallies in 1960. Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, so the low growth rates somewhat match up with the creation of the law. But they also coincide with the nation’s slow recovery from the Great Recession, and many economists see this as the real reason for slowed growth in health care spending. The 2012 CMS report cited by Moran’s office doesn’t credit Obamacare for the slowed spending. It said the lagging growth rate ""largely reflects the lingering effects of the recent recession and modest recovery."" CMS said the downturn led to lower health spending as employers cut costs and the number of people with private insurance dropped. In a companion piece in Health Affairs, a policy journal, CMS officials said Obamacare had ""no discernible impact"" on overall health care spending in 2011. Shortly after Moran made his statement, CMS released its 2013 report on health care expenditures. It’s charts showed that, with or without Obamacare, costs would have increased by an average of about 3.9 percent a year in 2010 and 2011 -- the latest years for which conclusive research is available. Moran’s office also pointed to a pair of May reports by two separate teams of Harvard University researchers that examined the reasons beyond the economy to explain the slow cost growth in recent years. One paper said that various factors -- such as insurers shifting costs of benefits to people in employer-sponsored insurance -- drove the slowdown. The second paper found the recession accounted for only 37 percent of the slowdown while another 55 percent is ""unexplained."" David Cutler, a co-author of the second report who advised Obama’s 2008 campaign, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National that Obamacare is ""one likely explanation"" for the slowing cost growth. The Kaiser Family Foundation, in its April report, said the lackluster economy accounted for 77 percent reason the increase in health care spending has slowed. It attributed the other 23 percent to structural changes within the health care system, such as rising levels of patient cost sharing that discourage use of services. A co-author of the report, Larry Levitt, told ABC News he thinks Obamacare ""is responsible, indirectly, for a good bit of what the economy doesn’t explain."" But, Levitt added, ""the precise impacts can’t be proven."" Drew Altman, the CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, also said in an op-ed in Politico that the specter of reforms from the law means ""it is entirely likely that Obamacare has played and will continue to play a role in the slowdown in health-care cost growth and accelerating market change."" A May 2013 report from the Urban Institute, notes the slowdown in health care spending began in 2002, pre-dating the recession and Obamacare. The cause, the Institute said, could be related to a long-time slide in real incomes. Alwyn Cassil, a spokesman for the Center for Studying Health System Change, said Moran’s statement is ""overly simplistic"" and an ""overly optimistic"" view of Obamacare’s impact. Many of the law’s provisions haven’t even gone into effect yet, she said. In 2014, CMS is projecting health care costs will rise by 6.1 percent. The agency said the increased rate will be driven in part by expanded health insurance coverage under Obamacare. About 11 million people are estimated to gain insurance next year as the mandates on Medicaid expansions kick in and people start buying plans on state-based health exchanges. Over time, about 30 million uninsured people are expected to get coverage. The law requires efficiencies in the delivery of health care that supporters of Obamacare say will stunt the long-term growth in costs. But as we’ve noted before, it’s an open question whether those measures will be sustainable. Our ruling Moran said health care costs have been ""reined in through the Affordable Care Act."" Other Democrats have made similar statements. The rate of cost growth began to slow in 2009 -- the year before Obamacare was passed, when the nation was in recession. Many analysts say the slow economic recovery is the major reason health care spending have been rising at historically low rates. Research by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that Obamacare has played ""no discernable role"" in the slowed growth rate. That doesn’t mean Obamacare has played no role. Some analysts, including the CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, believe Obamacare has helped slow costs, but say they can’t quantify its impact. All told, Moran’s statement is highly exaggerated and we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA98700>],/factchecks/2013/oct/04/jim-moran/moran-says-obamacare-has-reined-growth-health-care/

Obama says Medicare Part D was less popular than Obamacare when it first passed
","In the midst of a government shutdown stemming from Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act, we’ve heard many times that the controversial law has a consistently low approval rating. President Barack Obama’s response to that criticism is that his signature health care law isn’t the only one that had a rocky start in the polls. He says Medicare Part D, the subsidized prescription drug program for seniors, faced the same struggle at first. ""At the time that (Medicare Part D) was passed (it) was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls,"" he told NPR in an interview that aired Oct. 1, 2013. We decided to check into the poll results. The prescription drug benefit was signed into law by President George W. Bush in December 2003 as part of the Medicare Modernization Act. The program passed by a close margin after Republican leadership whipped votes for several hours. February 2004 poll results from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which experts told us did the most thorough work on the issue, show that 25 percent of adults favored Part D, while 38 percent had an unfavorable view. The rest were either neutral or didn’t know. Those numbers didn’t change much until November 2006, after the enrollment period had been open nearly a year, said Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University. By contrast, in September 2013 the Affordable Care Act registered a 39 percent favorable rating and a 43 percent unfavorable rating, according to Kaiser. That hasn’t changed all that much since the law was drafted in 2009. So if Obama was measuring how many people liked Medicare Part D (25 percent) compared with the health care law (39 percent), he’s right that Obamacare is more popular. But the health care law also has higher unfavorable ratings. Polling shows that 43 percent have an unfavorable view of Obamacare, while fewer, 38 percent, had an unfavorable view of Medicare Part D. We’ll note that those who didn’t want to express an opinion about Medicare Part D was much higher than the health care law, at 37 percent versus 17 percent. Both polls have a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Factoring these in leaves unfavorability ratings a wash, while Obamacare still sees a significantly higher favorability rating. As for the point Obama intended to make by noting the statistics, that Medicare Part D became more popular as people became familiar with it, we found that also holds water. Today, 9 out of every 10 seniors are satisfied with Medicare Part D, though we should note that’s according to the Healthcare Leadership Council, which is made up of health care executives. ""When you think of the popularity of Part D today, it’s easy to forget how divided people were,"" Hoadley said. ""People felt like they didn’t have enough information to understand the program."" Of course, it’s too soon to say if Obamacare will have the same long-term success in the public eye. Robert Blendon, a Harvard University health policy professor, said that poll results could start to shift as early as May, after enough people have had personal experiences with the law. ""It’s going to be a consumer issue rather than a policy issue,"" Blendon said. Obamacare’s popularity will also be affected in the next few years by the rhetoric of elections in 2014 and 2016, Hoadley said. So while people could look back years from now and not remember the act being a sharply divided policy issue, that shift won’t likely happen overnight. Now, the comparison Obama sets up isn’t the most straightforward, Blendon said. The prescription drug program for seniors is just one part of Medicare, which began in 1965. For students of politics, comparing Medicare itself with Obamacare would be more apples-to-apples. The former was favored by a majority of Americans at the time it was passed. Our ruling To illustrate that the Affordable Care Act can overcome its low popularity ratings, Obama claimed that Medicare Part D was even less popular when it first passed. Polling data shows that a lower percentage of people favored Part D in 2004 than favor Obamacare in 2013. However, depending on the margin of error, a slightly higher percentage of people may view the president’s reform unfavorably compared with Part D.

Newt Gingrich says shutdowns are 'normal' process, with 12 under Tip O’Neill and two under Gingrich
","Newt Gingrich knows a thing or two about government shutdowns. When he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1995 and 1996, the Georgia Republican was involved in two of them. In fact, they were the most recent examples of a federal government-wide closure before the one we’re experiencing right now. On a recent edition of CNN’s Crossfire, where Gingrich is now one of the hosts, he drew on this experience to put the current shutdown into historical context. ""Tonight there is an amazing amount of hysteria and vitriol over what is a normal part of the constitutional process,"" Gingrich said during the Sept. 30, 2013, edition of the show. ""The government shut down 12 times under Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill. It was only shut down twice while I was speaker."" The U.S. government was shut down 12 times when O’Neill was speaker and Ronald Reagan was president? We didn’t remember that. On the other hand, we did remember shutdowns under Gingrich, and we wouldn’t classify them as a ""normal part of the constitutional process."" We decided to investigate. The numbers What causes a shutdown is fairly simple: It happens when appropriations bills expire, and Congress and the president can’t agree on new ones. Shutdowns have a constitutional basis, from Article I, Section 9, which says, ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."" This has been reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law that has been revised periodically over the years. The act provides exceptions only for ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property."" We found a list of recent shutdowns, from 1976 to right before the current shutdown, in a report from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. Gingrich was right on the numbers: O’Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat, served as speaker from January 1977 to January 1987. Twelve of the 17 shutdowns happened during his speakership. Two others came during Gingrich’s tenure. (One each occurred under Speakers Carl Albert, Jim Wright and Tom Foley.) Still, we found a lot of context that was at odds with Gingrich’s implication that all of those shutdowns were similar, or that they were a ""normal"" part of governance. A fair comparison? Gingrich equated the shutdowns under O’Neill with those during his own tenure. But we found the nature of shutdowns and the reasons they happened have changed significantly since the 1980s. Here’s why: • Five of the 12 cases under O’Neill didn’t result in genuine shutdowns. Five of the shutdowns that happened under O’Neill happened before 1980, when new legal opinions changed how shutdowns happened. Prior to 1980, many federal agencies continued to operate during funding gaps, assuming that money would be restored soon and that Congress didn’t intend for them to close down. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued two opinions that required agency heads to suspend operations until funding began to flow again. The only activities that could go forward, Civiletti wrote, were those where there is a connection ""between the function to be performed and the safety of human life or the protection of property,"" or where otherwise ""authorized by law."" So right off the bat, it’s not really accurate to equate the first five episodes under O’Neill to either of the Gingrich-era shutdowns, or, for that matter, to the current one. The first five shutdowns under O’Neill were hardly apocalyptic events in which hundreds of thousands of federal workers were forced to stay home. By contrast, in the second and longer of the shutdowns under Gingrich, roughly 280,000 executive branch employees were furloughed, government contractors were laid off and government services were delayed, CRS noted. • The remaining seven shutdowns under O'Neill were much shorter than either of those under Gingrich. Of the seven O’Neill-era shutdowns after the Civiletti memos, the longest lasted three days, and the total duration for all of them was 13 days. That’s half the cumulative length of the two Gingrich shutdowns, which lasted 26 days. In addition, three of those happened primarily on weekends, further minimizing their impact. A one-day shutdown in October 1982, the Washington Post recently noted, stemmed from a particularly innocuous reason: Congress delayed a session because President Reagan had invited lawmakers to a White House barbecue, and Democrats were holding a $1,000-a-plate fundraising dinner. The funding question was resolved the next day. • The seven later shutdowns during the O’Neill era involved a lot of horse-trading on fairly mundane issues, not stark, ideological warfare. The Gingrich-era shutdown was led by small-government Republicans who wanted to aggressively cut back the scope of government. The current one was sparked by the imminent implementation of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. By contrast, the seven later shutdowns under O’Neill seemed to be dominated by more run-of-the-mill budgetary horse-trading. The sticking points in these shutdowns included a grab bag of comparatively parochial issues -- raises for senior civil servants; adjustments in aid to Israel, Egypt, Syria and El Salvador; a ban on oil and gas leasing in federal animal refuges; water-development projects; civil-rights standards for universities; the percentage of U.S.-made goods and labor required in offshore oil rigs; and the sale of the freight railroad Conrail. What the experts say Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, said Gingrich has a point. ""It's not the duration that matters so much as the disruption, inconvenience and appearance of dysfunction from closing government doors and shooing federal workers away from their jobs,"" said Wolfensberger, a congressional scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Bipartisan Policy Center. Other experts we checked with found fault with Gingrich’s comparison, however. While his numbers were correct, the differences in the reach of the shutdowns and their duration make it ""an apples and oranges comparison,"" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed that Gingrich’s ""facts are correct, but his implication is not."" Several of our experts also cast doubt on whether any of the shutdowns were a normal part of the constitutional process. Meyers said that ""the normal situation throughout our history has been for agencies to be funded through appropriations bills, not closed because the lack of such bills. It is hard to imagine how the preamble's charge to ‘promote the general welfare’ is met by this shutdown; it was not met by the Gingrich-era shutdowns."" Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed. ""What we have had is 17-year hiatus from the breakdown of the constitutional process and shutdowns,"" he said. Now, he said, the breakdown is back. Our rating Gingrich said shutdowns are ""a normal part of the constitutional process,"" with 12 shutdowns under Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill and two during his own speakership. He's right on the number, but the shutdowns under O'Neill were quite different in nature than either of the ones under Gingrich, or the current one. It’s also dubious to suggest that shutdowns are part of the normal constitutional process. Just because they have been relatively common doesn’t mean they are the way the founders intended government to operate. We rate Gingrich’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b23fd78-e6c8-47ed-a6b3-1ac9bdf33e60",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDF0440>],/factchecks/2013/oct/04/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-late-speaker-tip-oneill-served-/
