No, you are not better off wearing gloves in public
","Face masks have become a go-to accessory in America’s grocery stores and remaining public areas, with some prominent retailers even requiring them for entry. But many shoppers have taken it on themselves to go a step further — donning gloves as well. This pseudo-surgical garb may feel safer, but is it? One business that doesn’t think so posted a sign outside banning gloves, and a picture posted May 5, 2020, that went viral on Facebook. Here’s what it said in part: ""If you are wearing the same set of gloves all over town you are only spreading germs everywhere you go. Every door you touch, the cart, the supplies, your phone, your car door, your face, money and change. … DON’T WEAR THE SAME GLOVES EVERYWHERE!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It seemed a good time to settle this question. Does wearing gloves really hurt more than it helps? Most likely, yes. Here’s what the experts have to say. The glove guidance for the general public is simple from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Don’t. ""CDC doesn’t recommend the general public use gloves. Gloves can be a source of contamination, even for the wearer, if not properly removed,"" spokeswoman Kate Grusich said in an email. ""COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets that can land on surfaces. If the wearer touches a variety of surfaces during the day while wearing the same pair of gloves, contamination can definitely be transmitted from one surface to another."" The CDC’s online guide for glove use recommends wearing them when cleaning or caring for someone who is sick. It expressly notes gloves are a bad choice for running errands. ""The best way to protect yourself from germs when running errands and after going out is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol,"" the website says. But we don’t even have to take the CDC’s word for it. Infectious disease experts across the country agree gloves are a bad idea for general use. People may assume gloves are a solution on their own without recognizing that in the medical field they’re only part of the process. Gloves are disposed of as soon as the medical personnel leave a contaminated area, and hands are washed before and after removing. ""We’re seeing a lot of people out in public wearing gloves, which isn’t wrong so to say,"" said Dr. Patricia Dandache, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic said this in a online post by the organization. ""But unfortunately, most people aren’t wearing or disposing of their gloves correctly, which defeats the whole purpose."" And removing gloves is a tricky process. The CDC gives detailed guidance on it because even health care professionals struggle to do it in a way that avoids contamination. A 2019 study in the American Journal of Infection Control found 37% of health care workers using their normal glove removal technique contaminated themselves in the process. Even if gloves were removed correctly, they’re problematic because people often wear them to multiple places. ""With or without gloves, if you touch one thing then touch something else, you’re potentially transmitting it (the virus) from one place to another,"" Dr. David Cutler, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., told Healthline. And the gloves aren’t providing any additional protection from COVID-19, said Mary Beth Graham, medical director of infection prevention and control at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee. ""For things like influenza, COVID, etc., these are things where hand hygiene is sufficient,"" she said. ""The virus isn’t going to go in through the pores of your skin on your hand. It’s going to get into you if you’re touching commonly touched surfaces and then going in to touch your nose, your mouth, your eyes … before you do hand hygiene (washing)."" All of which brings us to perhaps the largest danger of glove-wearing — the false sense of security.  ""Wearing gloves may make someone feel safe, but it will also make people very lax in regards to recognizing that the key part of even wearing gloves is hand hygiene,"" Graham said. ""Gloves are nothing without hand hygiene."" A viral Facebook post warned against wearing gloves in public because keeping the same set on means ""you are only spreading germs everywhere you go."" Infectious disease experts around the country agree gloves largely do more harm than good. They don’t really protect the wearer since the coronavirus doesn’t seep in through the skin. And they don’t limit the disease spread since they are often worn too long or removed incorrectly. And perhaps most notably, wearing gloves can stop users from washing hands as often, which is the step that actually kills the coronavirus.

Riggs needed more digging on the Missouri counties with COVID-19 cases
","While Missouri’s stay-at-home order has expired, cases have been closely monitored to see whether the state is flattening the curve. Some cities, like Columbia and St. Louis, have extended their stay-at-home regulations. In a reflection of how the state has been responding to the pandemic, state House Rep. Louis Riggs, R-Hannibal, said on April 21: ""Thankfully, we have seen success to date, as nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases."" Riggs’ estimate was more than a little off. Data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on that day show 20 counties without any positive cases, or 18% of 114 counties. The state passed the halfway mark three weeks earlier, on March 30.  Riggs admitted that his error resulted from a quick glance over the department’s map showing the breakdown of cases by county. If a county has between one and six cases it has a light tan color, easy to confuse with the white color of the counties without any cases.  Riggs said what he should have said was, ""nearly 20% with zero cases and half with less than 10,"" which would be accurate.   As of May 11, 15 counties have not reported any cases of COVID-19.  Riggs said on April 21, ""nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases."" Half would be a sharp rounding up from 18%.  Because Riggs’ estimate included counties that did not fall into the correct category we rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2020/may/13/louis-riggs/riggs-needed-more-digging-missouri-counties-covid-/

No, that’s not a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
","From Maryland to California, governors dealing with the COVID-19 crisis have faced challenges to the legality of their stay-at-home orders, some of which are showing up in court. A Facebook post claims that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, these orders are already deemed unconstitutional and that many governors must forfeit their authority because they have infringed on the rights of U.S. citizens. The post includes a picture with this text: ""This should settle the matter. This was the ruling of The United States Supreme Court shortly after the ‘civil war’ in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866) which yet stands to this day: ‘Neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution in case of emergency …’ … therefore, ANYONE who declares the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed rights (to freely travel, peacefully assemble, earn a living, freely worship, etc.) and or attempts to enforce such suspension within 50 independent, sovereign, continental United States of America is making war against our constitution(s) and, therefore, we the people. They violate their constitutional oath and, thus, immediately forfeit their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity and that means ANYONE; even the governor and President."" The cited case, Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866), was about disputed judicial authority during the Civil War. In 1864, Lambdin P. Milligan was arrested and tried by a military tribunal in his home state of Indiana and sentenced to death by hanging. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the military courts established by the president during wartime had no judicial power in secure areas with established civil courts, and Milligan was released.  The case citation and time frame in the post are legitimate. But the quote about government authority does not come from this case.  That quote, or a close match, comes from a case argued in the Illinois Supreme Court in 1935. In People ex rel. Lyle vs. City of Chicago, the justices of Chicago’s municipal court filed a complaint against the City Council over unpaid salaries amid the Depression. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in their favor and ordered the city to pay them the partial salaries that had been withheld. In his opinion, the Illinois chief justice said that ""neither the legislature nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the constitution even in case of a great emergency."" He was referring to the Illinois Constitution and the Municipal Court of Chicago’s founding laws.  The second part of this claim that says orders ""can be disregarded with impunity"" doesn’t come from either of these cases and wasn’t found in any court cases or acts.  We also found ample evidence that states do have the authority to issue stay-at-home orders. According to the American Bar Association, the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment and past U.S. Supreme Court decisions dictate that ""state governments have the primary authority to control the spread of dangerous diseases within their jurisdictions.""  That doesn’t mean that there haven’t been cases brought against governors and local governments in California, Illinois, Texas, and Pennsylvania that are attempting to prove stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. There have been mixed results from local courts, which all base their decisions on state laws and constitutions.  Right now, the Supreme Court refuses to take a side. On May 8, the high court declined to review a case from a group of Pennsylvania businesses’ that wanted to block Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order. In the past, the Supreme Court has supported state’s rights to deal with public health emergencies. The best example of the Supreme Court supporting a state’s power to impose mandatory restrictions during a pandemic is Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905).  The case was brought against the Cambridge board of health and its response to a surge in smallpox cases in the city. The city’s board of health issued an order that all adults had to be vaccinated against the disease, or they would face a $5 fine (about $100 today). Henning Jacobson refused to be vaccinated, after having bad reactions to earlier vaccines. When the state of Massachusetts fined him, he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  The court ruled in the state’s favor, stating that they had full power to restrict the freedoms of any citizen if it ""is necessarily subject for the common good"" and that they had ""distinctly recognized the authority of a State to enact quarantine laws and ‘health laws of every description.’"" Our ruling A Facebook post claims that under an 1866 Supreme Court ruling, stay-at-home orders are illegal and can be disregarded with impunity. The claim cites an actual Supreme Court case, but it quotes a judicial opinion from an unrelated state case in Illinois dealing with judges’ salaries.

COVID-19 vs. HPV vaccine: COVID is more deadly
","Iowa state Rep.  Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, is telling Iowans he wants younger Iowans to get back to work as the state begins to reopen, tweeting April 28 that ""seeing so many young people afraid of re-opening the economy because of the virus...Someone should tell them they have a greater chance of being killed by the HPV vaccine than COVID-19.""  seeing so many young people afraid of re-opening the economy because of the virus...Someone should tell them they have a greater chance of being killed by the HPV vaccine than COVID-19   Shipley later tweeted that the remark was not meant to be taken literally, but as a ""hyperbole to engage critical thinking and relative public health risk."" Shipley said in a phone interview with *The Daily Iowan* he did not have data to support his point about young people having a greater chance of being killed by the HPV vaccine than COVID-19 so we checked, and found his statement to be inaccurate.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no deaths have been linked to the use of the HPV vaccine. The CDC recommends all children receive the vaccine at ages 11-12, though it can be used as early as age 9 and up to age 26.  The vaccine can prevent cancer-causing HPV infections.  Shipley said in the interview he wanted to raise a point that young people have less risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 than older adults. He said young people should return to work, though public health experts say it isn’t safe for them to do so yet.  ""What I’ve seen is a lot of young people are voicing that they’d much rather stay on welfare or unemployment than go back to work, and now they’re kind of complaining that they have to go to work, and they’re saying they don’t feel safe,"" Shipley said. ""I was really upset and kind of angry. And they say they are unsafe, but there’s really no data to support that.""  While older adults are most at risk of dying from COVID-19, young people are not immune. In Iowa, 2 percent of deaths from COVID-19 have been individuals under the age of 40.  In the U.S, at least 325 people under the age of 35 have died of COVID-19 as of May 6, according to the CDC, though this accounts for less than 1 percent of COVID-19 deaths nationwide.  Data from the World Health Organizations indicates that in studies of the HPV vaccine, the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in those who received the vaccine than those who received a placebo injection.  Christine Petersen, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Disease at the University of Iowa, said in a phone interview the risk of dying of COVID-19 is higher, given that no deaths have ever been linked to the HPV vaccine. The HPV vaccine prevents the most common types of human papillomavirus strains, which can cause cervical and other cancers.  ""Roughly, for every 100,000 people in the state of Iowa, there are five who have had cervical cancer, there’s been zero that have died from the vaccine. We know that across the Iowa population, 7.27 people out of 100,000 have died of coronavirus,"" Peterson said.  Shipley said he believes people who are most at risk should be social distancing, while younger adults can return to work.  ""There’s a lot of ways we can protect ourselves and enforce social distancing between myself and my parents and my grandparents or whoever it is,"" Shipley said. ""Just because there are people at risk, that doesn’t necessarily mean we all need to stay home, collect government checks, and not go to work.""  Petersen warned that separating those at-risk from those who are not is not an easy task.  ""I would caution that it’s not so easy to target at risk or not at-risk people,"" Petersen said. ""You can be undiagnosed with a disease that can cause you to be impressively immune compromised and not even know it yourself yet, or you can not want to declare it to the rest of the world.""  Petersen said COVID-19 still has a reproductive rate of 2 in Iowa, meaning on average, each positive case will spread the virus to two others.  ""Those people may not show symptoms for at least a day, maybe two, so taking precautions isn’t just to protect yourself, it’s to protect those at risk people,"" Petersen said.  Shipley wrote that young people are more at risk from the HPV vaccine than COVID-19. Both the CDC and the WHO have concluded that no deaths have been caused by the HPV vaccine, while young people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S and in Iowa.  While young people are less at risk from the coronavirus than older people, adhering to social distancing protects people at risk of having greater complications from the coronavirus – including those who might not yet know they are at a higher risk. Moreover, Shipley conceded that he made the statement in order to start a discussion, not to give accurate information that could be taken literally. We rated Shipley’s claim as Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/may/12/jeff-shipley/covid-19-vs-hpv-vaccine-covid-more-deadly/

NC Democrat misrepresents Tillis position on aid for states
","Local and state governments are expected to have budget shortfalls as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. And, according to the Democrat in North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race, the Republican incumbent thinks struggling communities should go bankrupt. That’s what Cal Cunningham said about Sen. Thom Tillis. ""Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed,"" Cunningham tweeted April 24, linking to a Politico story. Is that true? There’s a lot of context being left out. Yes, Tillis did say he is ""more or less aligned"" with what McConnell, the U.S. Senate majority leader, said about not giving more federal dollars to states that had pre-existing budget problems. McConnell proposed allowing them to file for bankruptcy, which states are not currently permitted to do. But Cunningham exaggerated what we know about Tillis’ position. Tillis’ comments clearly show he doesn’t want the federal government to pay for state debt that wasn’t incurred during the coronavirus outbreak. What’s less clear is whether he wants those states to go the bankruptcy route. So what did McConnell say about bankruptcy? In a radio interview on April 22, McConnell said states with pre-existing problems might be better off declaring bankruptcy than by expecting additional funding from the federal government. But he didn’t specifically say he ""wanted"" states to declare bankruptcy, only that he supports it as an option. ""I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there’s no good reason for it not to be available,"" McConnell said. ""My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that. That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of."" As The Atlantic reported, McConnell expanded on his bankruptcy comments in another radio interview that day: ""We’re not interested in solving their pension problems for them. We’re not interested in rescuing them from bad decisions they've made in the past, we’re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created themselves (with) bad decisions in the past."" That brings us to Tillis and how closely he has ""agreed"" with McConnell. Audio of the April 24 town hall shows a constituent named Charles saying he has a question about the future: ""Will the Senate vote to bail out poorly-run states that were near bankrupt before COVID-19 hit?"" Tillis wasn’t asked about states in general. He was asked specifically about ""poorly-run states that were near bankrupt"" prior to the pandemic. Tillis said he doesn’t think those states should be bailed out.  ""Well, Charles, that's a great question and personally I don't think we should, and I don't think that we can,"" Tillis said.  He then said the $2 trillion economic stimulus gave him ""pause,"" but was worth it. Then he used North Carolina’s state government as an example of good financial stewardship: ""I'm not so sure that taxpayer dollars for North Carolina should go to a state, a county, or a city that, like you said, was in poor economic shape before we ever had the virus. We need to take care of first responders. We need to take care of law enforcement. And we will do that. But I don't believe that I can support any measure that is effectively a bailout for poorly run state and local governments. ""We can look at things on a case-by-case basis where it's very clear that the damage is done because of the virus impact. But a broad-based bailout is not something I'd be prepared to support.""  That’s when Tillis brought up McConnell’s comments. ""You probably heard Leader McConnell's comments about it, I'm more or less aligned with Leader McConnell on the issue,"" Tillis said, a few seconds later adding: ""I think we need to work on executing (plans already signed into law) and not really entertain a discussion of trillions more going into jurisdictions that really need to get their financial houses in order."" Cunningham spokeswoman Rachel Petri said Tillis’s comments about McConnell show he’s in lockstep with the Senate leader, who said ""I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route."" Tillis elaborated on his position in an interview with Fox News radio's Guy Benson on April 29. Benson asked him about McConnell’s comments that money should not cover pre-pandemic budget holes (without mentioning the bankruptcy idea). Tillis said the Senate ""will go back and take a look at well-documented cases for the costs of the response, potentially the cause of some of the revenues in this year based on closures.""  When PolitiFact asked about Tillis’ position on the bankruptcy option, Tillis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said: ""Sen. Tillis has never advocated for any state or municipality to go bankrupt as a result of COVID-19, has already delivered billions of dollars in relief to North Carolina, and has consistently said that he supports providing targeted assistance for communities that have been impacted by the virus."" Cunningham tweeted, ""Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed."" The tweet lacks so much context that it’s several degrees removed from what’s actually been said.  McConnell wasn’t talking about just any states, he was talking about states that were in poor financial shape before the coronavirus outbreak. Additionally, McConnell said he supported bankruptcy as a novel option for states, particularly for those with pre-existing pension liabilities. Tillis said he agreed with McConnell ""more or less."" He agreed that Congress shouldn’t pay for revenue losses that aren’t related to the coronavirus outbreak. But Tillis never actually said he wanted states to go bankrupt. And he said he will consider federal aid for smaller governments on a case-by-case basis. Cunningham’s tweet exaggerates what McConnell said and misrepresents what Tilils has said about federal coronavirus aid. It contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

There's a story behind this Biden misquote
","Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" on May 1 and denied a sexual assault allegation made by Tara Reade, a staff assistant who worked for him in the 1990s when he was a U.S. senator. He released an extended statement about it the same day. A Facebook post claims that Biden said on the show that whatever he did in the past shouldn’t be made public while he runs for president. The post reads: ""‘The things I did while in elected office should not be made public while I am seeking a higher public office’ — Joe Biden this morning on MSNBC…"" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is not a direct quote from Biden. It appears to be a loose paraphrasing of Biden explaining what’s in his sealed senatorial records that are stored at the University of Delaware, his alma mater. Reade said she filed a written complaint with the Senate in 1993 about Biden, but no documentation of that complaint has surfaced. During his appearance on MSNBC, Biden called on the Senate-controlled National Archives to search for and publicly release any such complaint, and said that’s the only place it could be. The University of Delaware, meanwhile, maintains a sealed collection of more than 1,850 boxes of Biden’s papers that span his 36-year career in the Senate. The library received the collection in June 2012, when Biden was vice president. ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski asked Biden about reports that the university’s records were supposed to be released to the public but were instead resealed until Biden leaves public life. The university posted the new policy in April 2019, just before Biden announced his presidential campaign.  ""The collection, which also includes extensive electronic records and media, will remain closed pending completion of processing. The records will be available no sooner than the later date of December 31, 2019, or two years after the donor retires from public life,"" the university says on its website. Biden said those documents wouldn’t include any personnel records that would contain a complaint like Reade’s. He said the collection is of ""personal papers,"" such as speeches, policy positions, overseas interviews, and other official actions. He told Brzezinski that, if released, the records could be taken out of context and used against him as campaign fodder. This was his full response:  ""The fact is that there’s a lot of things, of speeches I’ve made, positions I’ve taken, interviews that I did overseas with people, all of those things relating to my job, and the idea that they would all be made public in the fact while I was running for public office, they could be really taken out of context. They’re papers or position papers. They are documents that existed and that — when I met, for example, when I met with Putin or when I met with whomever, and all of that could be fodder in a campaign at this time. I don’t know of anybody who’s done anything like that. And so the National Archives is the only place there would be anything having to do with personnel records. There are no personnel records in the Biden papers at the university."" The National Archives said it has no record of any personnel files that would contain such a complaint, and Biden forwarded the request to Julie Adams, the secretary of the Senate. In response, Adams said she can’t disclose the information, citing ""strict confidentiality requirements"" in the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices and advice from the Senate legal counsel. Archivists familiar with the personal papers of politicians told Politico that Biden’s arrangement at the University of Delaware isn’t uncommon, saying that it is standard practice for members and former members of Congress to close their records when they run for another office. We reached out to Biden’s campaign for comment but did not hear back by time of publication. A Facebook post claims Biden went on MSNBC and said, ""The things I did while in elected office should not be made public while I am seeking a higher public office.""  He didn’t literally say it.  During the interview, Biden denied the sexual assault allegation and called for the National Archives to release any complaint it found from Reade. He did say that his sealed senatorial records could be taken out of context if made public, referring broadly to his personal papers held by the University of Delaware, not specifically to a complaint by Reade.

Mail-in voting amid COVID-19 is among the options recommended by CDC, but not the only one

That’s what this whole pandemic is about: the election!"" stated a May 7 Facebook post. In March, the CDC posted recommendations for elections. At the time, many states were slated to have presidential primaries. Some were delayed amid concerns they could hasten transmission of the novel coronavirus, which spreads primarily from person to person through respiratory droplets expelled while breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing. The CDC’s recommendations listed voting by mail as one of multiple options.  The CDC recommended that election officials ""encourage voters to use voting methods that minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling stations."" Those specific recommendations included encouraging ""mail-in methods of voting if allowed in the jurisdiction.""  It also encouraged early voting, drive-up voting and voting at off-peak times. The CDC also recommended moving polling sites away from homes for senior citizens, sanitizing election equipment and encouraging social distancing at polling sites. We contacted the CDC to see if there had been additional guidance since March and did not get a response. It’s important to note that the CDC’s recommendations are intended as public health guidance; they aren’t equivalent to law. Generally, states set laws that outline their rules for voting by mail, early voting and Election Day voting. Local officials administer elections, which means the CDC can’t ban in-person voting. Just a handful of states hold only mail-in voting by law. In the other states, elections officials expect a massive increase in requests for absentee ballots, but they are still planning to provide in-person voting options. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered that all eligible voters receive absentee ballots, however there will be in-person voting sites as well.

Conspiracy theorist spreads false claim about Fauci, patents and COVID-19
","A conservative author who previously promoted the Obama birth certificate conspiracy is now publishing false claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci’s connection to the coronavirus pandemic. An April 28 article published on Jerome Corsi’s blog alleges that Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, owns some intellectual property tied to the novel coronavirus. It also floats the debunked idea that the virus was ""laboratory-created, possibly as a bioweapon."" ""Why does Dr. Anthony Fauci’s name appear on 4 U.S. patents for a key glycoprotein that appears to have been inserted into a SARS virus chassis to create the current COVID-19 epidemic?"" Corsi wrote. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  (Screenshot from Corsi Nation) Corsi is a conservative author and conspiracy theorist. He has made baseless allegations about former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate and spread misinformation related to QAnon, a broad right-wing conspiracy theory. As a friend of Roger Stone, a former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump, Corsi was part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into 2016 election meddling. Since the pandemic began, we’ve fact-checked several false claims about Fauci’s connection to the coronavirus. Corsi’s article is similar to a claim made in ""Plandemic,"" a viral documentary that makes a slew of wrong allegations about Fauci, vaccines and COVID-19. So we wanted to look into this article, too. Corsi uses a discredited research article to draw an unwarranted connection between a patent family for a potential HIV treatment and the novel coronavirus. His article feeds into the debunked conspiracy theory that the virus was created in a lab. Corsi lists four patents in his article. They all have to do with a potential HIV treatment patented by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The patents, three of which are active, all deal with a potential method for preventing HIV infection. That method includes ""a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that interferes with the interaction of gpl20 and α4 integrin ... thereby treating the HIV infection."" In plain English: the potential treatment aims to impede a chemical interaction between HIV and human cells that can lead to transmission of the virus. It was based on a 2008 study conducted by NIAID scientists. Fauci is listed as an inventor on the patents alongside a few other authors of the 2008 study. But the assignee — the entity that owns the patents — is HHS. We reached out to the NIAID for more context, but we haven’t heard back. Corsi is using a withdrawn article and a debunked conspiracy theory to link the HHS patents to the coronavirus pandemic. In his article, Corsi mentions a Jan. 31 piece published by a group of Indian scientists on bioRxiv, a repository of preprint research papers. The article — which was not peer-reviewed and was later withdrawn — found a connection between a protein present in HIV and the novel coronavirus. The authors wrote that ""amino acid residues"" in the coronavirus were similar to gpl20, the HIV protein that NIAID scientists studied in 2008. The protein is mentioned in the HHS patents. But the authors withdrew their findings after other scientists criticized them as circumstantial and adding fuel to an unfounded conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus was created in a lab.  RELATED: What we know about the source of the coronavirus pandemic Researchers have concluded that the genetic structure of the novel coronavirus rules out the possibility of laboratory manipulation.  A Nature article published March 17 says the genetic makeup of the coronavirus, documented by researchers from several public health organizations, does not indicate it was altered. Instead, scientists have two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host, or natural selection in humans after the virus jumped from animals. ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the article reads. We contacted Corsi by email but haven’t gotten a response. Corsi’s article claims that Fauci’s name appears on four patents for a protein that was used to create the novel coronavirus. That’s wrong. Three of the patents that Corsi identified are active and owned by the Department of Health and Human Services. But they are unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic. They deal with a potential treatment for HIV that NIAID researchers studied in 2008. Fauci is listed as an author on that study and as one of the inventors on the patents. There is no credible evidence that COVID-19 is related to HIV or was created in a lab. The coronavirus’ genetic makeup precludes the possibility that it was man-made. And Fauci is helping lead the U.S. response to the pandemic. The article is inaccurate. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2020/may/12/jerome-corsi/conspiracy-theorist-spreads-false-claim-about-fauc/

No, the media did not “pretend there was a deadly surge in COVID cases” after Wisconsin election
","A far-right news broadcast shared widely on Facebook says the ""mainstream media"" is misleading people about Wisconsin’s mid-pandemic election. The election has remained a hot topic nationally, as it was effectively a study in what can happen when a large number of people go out in public together amid a lockdown order. It’s a unique datapoint as politicians and citizens alike argue over how and when to re-open. And one TV outlet says you’re being lied to about it. On the One America News Network, host Liz Wheeler described it this way in a May 8, 2020, clip labeled online as ""What the (mainstream media) was afraid to tell you"": ""There is no evidence to date that there was a surge of infections due to the April 7, 2020, election in Wisconsin. … But did the mainstream media report on this? No, no,"" she said. ""In fact, the mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting.""   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)    Wheeler is right about there being no evidence of a surge. We’ve repeatedly debunked claims that there was one. But her generalization about ""mainstream media"" claiming otherwise? That’s ridiculous. Let’s take a closer look at how this topic has been covered by prominent media outlets.  For starters, let’s be clear that there was no election ""surge."" As of May 11, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services identified 71 people who tested positive for COVID-19 after voting or working the polls in the April 7 election, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt. The important caveat here is that it’s impossible to say how many were infected at the polls since some reported other possible exposures. The 71 tally runs from April 9 to 21, when the two-week incubation period for the coronavirus would have ended. There were 1,864 positive tests in that span in Wisconsin, so the cases known to intersect with election activity accounted for less than 4% of that total. Now on to the ""mainstream media"" reports. Wheeler’s report cites no sources for the claim the media said there was a surge in cases, so we cast a wide net looking at news coverage ourselves. CNN — a favorite target for far-right claims of media bias — reported on April 22 about what was then 19 cases in people who voted or worked the polls. The third and fourth paragraphs of the story detail the caveat that those people had other exposures, so it’s impossible to say the election was the source. ABC News published a similar report April 21, prominently noting the same caveat in the second paragraph. The Associated Press, reporting on updated data April 29, said 50 people connected to the election had tested positive. It noted the origin caveat in the second paragraph. Like the CNN and ABC reports the week before, it contained no hyperbolic language calling this a surge or anything close to that. In-state sources were even more clear.  An April 22 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story was headlined, ""Two weeks after election, COVID-19 cases have not spiked in Wisconsin but experts urge caution about conclusions."" A Wisconsin State Journal report on April 23 worked the ""can’t say for certain"" caveat into the lead sentence. It did the same for a May 8 story when the tally had grown to 67. And a fact-check published by both PolitiFact Wisconsin and USA TODAY rated False a claim from a little-known news outlet that there had been a ""surge"" in COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin after the election. Here’s what that fact check said about the sloppily-reported claim from SecondNexus.com: ""The data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days’ new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days."" Both the article and the tweet it was based on were removed after that fact-check published. We won’t bother to dive deeper into Wheeler’s ""pretended"" claim. That adds another layer of absurdity since it implies some kind of intentional coverup or falsehood, when there’s no proof the coverage was wrong in the first place. The One America News Network claimed in a video posted to Facebook that ""mainstream media pretended there was a deadly surge in COVID cases thanks to Wisconsinites voting."" We didn’t find a single traditional or ""mainstream"" news outlet that characterized the election-related cases as a surge or anything close to that — much less anything that would support this kind of sweeping generalization. The reports prominently noted the caveat that officials can’t say for certain that the election caused the cases we are aware of, and they had made no exaggerated claims about how large those numbers were. (And, to be clear, the 71 cases certainly don’t constitute a surge.) So Wheeler is flat wrong in both her claim about coverage and the related implication from the use of ""pretended"" that something was reported wrong intentionally.

Can N95 masks be sterilized 20 times with no degradation, as Northam says?
","Gov. Ralph Northam announced that Virginia has received decontamination systems that will help provide front-line health workers with protective equipment against COVID-19. Each of the systems can massively sanitize for reuse much-sought-after N95 face masks. The systems were developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio, and received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been sending the equipment, free of charge, to various locations. Northam announced during a May 1 news conference that Virginia has gotten three of the systems, to be located in Chesterfield County, Newport News and Blacksburg.  ""These systems have multiple units that are each the size of a storage container and can clean up to 80,000 masks per day using a hydrogen peroxide vapor,"" Northam said.  ""(Personal  protective equipment) can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading."" Traditionally, N95 masks have been designated for only single use. So we fact-checked Northam’s statement that the system allows the masks to be ""decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading."" The Battelle process Hospitals send the masks to N95 sanitization centers Battelle has helped set up, including in coronavirus hot spots such as New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. Battelle says the masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times. But, as PolitiFact National recently noted, that’s not a best practice. The FDA, in its letter designating emergency approval, specified that Battelle’s decontamination system ""may be effective"" safely recycling masks 20 times, but it advised that recycling should only be done ""when there are insufficient supplies."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse ""only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy."" There are several reasons. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it’s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. ""Decontamination is a complicated process,"" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. ""Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research.""  N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle’s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask’s filtration. Mask integrity Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95Decon report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator’s fit.  ""If [an N95] doesn’t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn’t matter how good a filter it is,"" said Patrick Kenney, medical director of the Yale-New Haven Health’s corporate supply chain. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected ― since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard — and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility.  ""These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,"" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle’s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. We should note the PolitiFact National fact-checked an April  23 statement by President Trump. He said, ""We’re also using a sterilization process ― some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks."" PolitiFact rated the statement Half-True, saying, ""Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as ‘ordering 20 times more masks.’"" Our ruling Northam said with decontamination systems being set up in Virginia, ""PPE can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading."" The systems are excellent news for Virginia which, like practically all states, has struggled to acquire N95 masks for medical workers. But the governor’s words are still rosy. The FDA, in its letter of emergency approval, said the decontamination system ""may be effective"" safely recycling masks up to 20 times, but warned the process should  only be used when there are ""insufficient (new) supplies."" Some early research suggests the structure of the masks may be compromised through the repeated process, making them less-secure fits on faces. So Northam’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.  ",/factchecks/2020/may/12/ralph-northam/can-n95-masks-be-sterilized-20-times-no-degradatio/

""It would have been bad even with the best of governments,"" Obama said May 8. ""It has been an absolute chaotic disaster."" Obama’s words drew anger from President Donald Trump’s supporters, one of whom tweeted on May 10: ""Barack Hussain Obama is the first Ex-President to ever speak against his successor, which was long (a) tradition of decorum and decency."" Trump retweeted the claim, adding the comment: ""He got caught, OBAMAGATE!"" He got caught, OBAMAGATE! https://t.co/oV6fum0zIS By tradition, former presidents extend some graciousness to their successors. But there is no hard and fast rule. And as you’ll see, former presidents have, when it suited them, criticized the person who followed them into the White House. The first example that leaped to mind of three presidential historians we contacted is President Herbert Hoover, who lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. ""He railed against the New Deal, FDR, liberalism and, in some ways, modernity itself, from the time he left office in 1933 until his death in the mid-1960s,"" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. At the 1936 Republican convention, Hoover cast Roosevelt and the New Deal as a step toward dictatorship.  ""The New Deal may be a revolutionary design to replace the American system with despotism,"" Hoover said. ""Their product is the poisoning of Americanism."" A generation later, Harry Truman seized the moment at the Democrats’ convention in 1956 to attack his Republican successor, Dwight Eisenhower, Claremont McKenna College’s John Pitney noted. ""For three and half years, the Eisenhower administration has been using every trick and device to pry our water power, and our forest, our parks and oil reserves out of the hands of people and into the pockets of a few selfish corporations,"" Truman said Aug. 17, 1956. Jump forward to 1977, when Republican Gerald Ford ridiculed the economic policies of the man who ousted him from office, Jimmy Carter. ""Mr. Carter's anti-inflation program came in like a lion,"" Ford said three months into Carter’s presidency. ""It's going out like a mouse."" Carter carried on the tradition. In November 1982, he said President Ronald Reagan had undermined confidence in America’s global leadership. ""There's not that assured feeling now that our country is in the forefront of peace, nuclear arms control, human rights and environmental concern that it was before,"" Carter said in a news conference. At the same event, Carter chastised Reagan for faulting Carter for the problems Reagan faced. ""There is always the temptation for an incumbent politician to blame all his mistakes on his predecessor,"" Carter said. ""Most are willing to withstand the temptation. Mr. Reagan, apparently, is not."" The idea that Obama is the first president to criticize his successor has been around since at least 2018, when Snopes found it false, citing Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as recent examples. ""Trump’s claim is simply not true under any possible definition of ‘speak against’ or ‘successor,’"" said Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. A Twitter post, retweeted by Trump, claimed that Obama ""is the first ex-president to ever speak against his successor.""  There are several examples of former presidents criticizing the person who followed them into office. For much of the past century, Republicans have spoken ill of Democrats, and Democrats have done the same with Republicans. While the tradition of exercising restraint exists, it has its limits, and in at least one case, an ex-president spoke out as early as three months into the new administration.

Trump falsely implies Arizona audit has exposed fraud
","Former President Donald Trump, continuing to air falsehoods about the 2020 election,  highlighted an ongoing partisan review of ballots underway in Maricopa County, Ariz., that he claimed had uncovered fraud.  ""The 2020 presidential election was by far the most corrupt election in the history of our country,"" Trump said June 5 at the North Carolina GOP convention, contradicting officials from his own administration who declared in November the election the ""most secure in American history"" and multiple state officials, court rulings and audits that affirmed the results.   Trump then offered his congratulations to ""Republican state senators in Arizona and other places for their great work that they are doing in exposing this fraud"" — a reference to an ongoing audit organized by Arizona GOP state senators. Trump’s praise for the senators ""exposing this fraud"" gives the false impression that the GOP-led review of ballots in Arizona’s largest county has uncovered signs or evidence of fraud. That’s not the case. No findings have been released. Trump also said, ""I have nothing to do with the Arizona situation."" That’s misleading, too. American Oversight, a watchdog group, used public records requests to obtain emails by Republican Senate President Karen Fann about the audit. In a Dec. 28 email, Fann wrote that she was doing everything legally possible to do a forensic audit and was suing Maricopa County.  ""I have been in numerous conversations with Rudy Giuliani over the past weeks trying to get this done,"" Fann wrote, referring to Trump’s lawyer. ""I have the full support of him and a personal call from President Trump thanking us for pushing to prove any fraud."" Joe Biden beat Trump in Arizona by about 10,500 votes, the first time a Democrat won there since 1996. Biden also won the vote in Maricopa County, home of the capital, Phoenix. Maricopa County conducted its own hand count audit of a sample of ballots as required by state law and hired independent firms to conduct a forensic audit of tabulation equipment. The county found no abnormalities. Judges rejected lawsuits on behalf of Republicans seeking to halt certification of the vote or alleging wrongdoing.  But Republican state senators ordered up their own full audit of Maricopa’s 2.1 million ballots. They acknowledged that the audit would have no impact on the 2020 election outcome. The state Senate Republicans hired a team that included Cyber Ninjas, a little-known group headed by Doug Logan, who promoted ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.  The audit has faced widespread condemnation by election experts nationwide, including Republicans, for its partisanship and lack of objective standards. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors — four of whose five members are Republicans — called the audit a ""circus"" in a May letter to Fann. ""Our state has become a laughingstock,"" they wrote. ""Worse, this ‘audit’ is encouraging our citizens to distrust elections, which weakens our democratic republic."" The audit started in late April and is expected to be completed in June. Randy Pullen, a former state GOP party chairman who is a spokesperson for the audit, told PolitiFact that the organizers are not releasing partial results while the audit continues. Once it’s done, the auditors will take a few weeks to write a report about their findings and hand it over to the state Senate.  ""Nothing is going to happen until the audit is done,"" Pullen told PolitiFact June 7. ""The Arizona senate will review the report, and if there is something in there indicating potential fraud they will turn it over to the (state) attorney general for their review and determination if there was fraud."" We looked for voter fraud prosecutions for Arizona’s 2020 election and could only find one. Attorney General Mark Brnovich announced in December that a state grand jury indicted two individuals for collecting four completed ballots during the August primary, a violation of state law that only allows for certain individuals such as family members to collect ballots from another person. The cases are still pending. The prosecution is unrelated to the audit.  A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Attorney said their office did not have any voter fraud cases for the previous election. Trump’s office did not respond to our request for evidence to back his claim. Trump said ""Republican state senators"" are ""exposing this fraud,"" through their audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Ariz. The comments are misleading and premature. The organizers of the audit say they aren’t releasing partial findings and don’t expect to complete the audit until later in June, after which they will take a few weeks to write a report. If the Republicans find indications of potential fraud, they would forward that information to the state attorney general for investigation. We rate this statement False.

Despite that, a screenshot of a headline posted on Instagram makes this claim: ""920 women lose their unborn babies after getting vaccinated."" The caption for the photo says ""this data is from the U.K."" It also references the United States, adding that there have been ""571 miscarriages following the Covid vax that have been reported in the U.S. The info is very easy to access and is confirmed by the CDC since the CDC uses VAERS data."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) We found the article that goes with that headline on a website called The True Defender. The story does not offer support for 920 miscarriages or repeat the number. The article claims that statistics from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database, called VAERS, shows ""395 women have reported losing their unborn child as a result of Covid vaccinations."" VAERS is a tool that can be used by anyone to report any reactions and adverse events experienced after any vaccination. But the fact alone that something was submitted to the database does not prove that the reaction or event happened as a direct result of vaccination. (Years ago, someone testing the system entered a report claiming that an influenza vaccine turned him into The Hulk.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the federal agencies that oversees VAERS, told PolitiFact that as of May 28, there had been 439 reports of miscarriages among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. ""However, these are not confirmed cases,"" said Benjamin Haynes, a CDC spokesperson. ""VAERS is not designed to determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event. While some reported adverse events may be caused by vaccination, others are not and may have occurred coincidentally. Each of these are investigated with local health officials."" A spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which also oversees VAERS, told PolitiFact that VAERS has ""received reports of spontaneous abortions after COVID-19 vaccination. However, a review of available clinical information does not establish a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" The VAERS website also cautions that the reports in its database ""may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind."" PolitiFact has reported that VAERS has been useful for health agencies and researchers to collect and analyze data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. But given the database’s open-access system, allowing reports to be entered before they are verified, some have mischaracterized the data or taken it out of context. (We have fact-checked similar claims about deaths following vaccines.) For this fact-check, we also reached out to the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for more information. We did not hear back in time for publication. But the agency in April told PolitiFact that ""there is currently no pattern to suggest an elevated risk of miscarriage related to exposure to the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy."" Miscarriage is estimated to happen in about 1 in 4 pregnancies in the U.K. (outside of the pandemic) and most occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, so some miscarriages would be expected to occur following vaccination purely by chance, the agency said. The agency also said that it was closely monitoring a small number of reports of miscarriage following vaccination in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Studies in animals receiving a COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies, the CDC said. Clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy are underway or planned, the CDC said. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and analyzing data from people who participated in the completed clinical trials, received the vaccine and became pregnant. The CDC has more details about the safety of vaccines for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. A headline in an Instagram post said: ""920 women lose their unborn babies after getting vaccinated."" We did not find evidence confirming that COVID-19 vaccines directly caused hundreds of miscarriages. A U.S. database aiming to monitor vaccine side effects has recorded more than 400 reports of miscarriages following a COVID-19 injection. But agencies overseeing the database say that the number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of potential problems associated with vaccines.

Titled ""How to Kill Mosquitoes - NOT A JOKE,"" the author of the message says they were at a party where guests were being plagued by mosquitoes until a man sprayed Listerine mouthwash around the immediate area, seemingly repelling the pests. ""The next year I filled a four-ounce spray bottle and used it around my seat whenever I saw mosquitoes,"" the post claims. ""And voila! That worked as well ... during the summer, I don't leave home without it.""

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Claims about Listerine's ability to fight more than just plaque and gingivitis have persisted for nearly two decades, seemingly first appearing in chain emails from the early 2000s. The primary belief behind these claims is that the essential oils used in the mouthwash act as natural bug repellents, according to The New York Times. The oils contained in Listerine — which the brand says are used for their ""disinfecting abilities and antimicrobial qualities"" — are derived from thyme, eucalyptus, mint and wintergreen plants. While most repellents use synthetic compounds like DEET or picaridin as active ingredients to ward off mosquitoes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified a refined form of lemon eucalyptus oil as being safe and effective in plant-based repellents. The agency doesn't recommend using pure lemon eucalyptus oil as a repellent. ""It has not undergone similar, validated testing for safety and efficacy and is not registered with EPA as an insect repellent,"" the CDC said.  A study conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the 1990s found that eucalyptus-based insect repellent did provide protection against mosquitos on par with repellents containing DEET. However, the eucalyptus-based repellents used in the study contained a 50% concentration of the oil. Listerine contains concentrations of less than 1% of the essential oils. The CDC reports that a bug repellent must have at least 10% of the active ingredient to offer even a limited amount of protection against mosquitos. Even then, that protection would last only one or two hours. Commercial products like Repel's plant-based lemon eucalyptus insect repellent contain around 30% of the oil. Another plant-based repellent, Off! Botanicals, uses a 10% concentration of a synthetic version of the active ingredient.  We tried to contact Johnson & Johnson, the producer of Listerine, about the claims, but didn’t get a response. A Facebook post claimed Listerine was an effective mosquito repellent. Similar claims point to the essential oils contained in Listerine as the source of its bug-fighting powers. While the CDC considers oil of lemon eucalyptus an effective repellent, it found that the concentration of the oil must be at least 10% in order to provide even limited protection. The concentrations of the oils used in Listerine are less than 1%. We can’t say the scenario described at the party never happened. But we can say that science doesn’t approve this method to keep mosquitoes away. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/08/facebook-posts/no-listerine-doesnt-work-mosquito-repellent/

Rumors spread online about Tim Tebow, Aaron Hernandez and jersey No. 85
","The NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars recently signed 33-year-old hometown hero Tim Tebow as a tight end, and the former quarterback and newly retired baseball player has been photographed in his new jersey, No. 85.  A rumor spreading on social media claims that Tebow is wearing that number in honor of Aaron Hernandez, his college teammate and former New England Patriots tight end  who was convicted of murder and committed suicide in prison. ""Tim Tebow says he is wearing #85 to honor (his) former friend/teammate and fellow TE Aaron Hernandez, who passed away in 2017,"" the post says.  There’s no evidence that this is true.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Tim Tebow runs during practice, Thursday, May 27, 2021, in Jacksonville, Fla. The Heisman Trophy winner quarterbacked for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets about a decade ago. He also played at the University of Florida with Hernandez, and he called the murder charge against him ""heartbreaking and sad.""  Tebow wore No. 15 in college, and he kept that number as a quarterback on the Broncos and Jets. This year, the NFL relaxed its rules that governed which positions were eligible for certain jersey numbers, so that tight ends can be assigned any number from 1 to 49, or 80 to 90, as long as it’s not already taken. But No. 15 was not available on the Jaguars, because their quarterback uses it. Sports Illustrated reported on May 20 that the Jaguars assigned 85 to Tebow, noting that the number is ""a typical number for a tight end."" When he was a rookie tight end for the Patriots, Hernandez was issued No. 46. He then switched his jersey number to 85 after it became available when another tight end was released from the team. Hernandez switched numbers again and played his final two seasons in 2011 and 2012 wearing a No. 81 jersey.  We found no credible sources to corroborate the claim that Tebow is wearing No. 85 as a nod to Hernandez.  On May 20, a Twitter account for ""Barry McCockiner,"" which Fox Sports Radio once described as a ""satirical prankster"" who ""continues to dupe some of the biggest names in sports broadcasting,"" tweeted that Tebow was wearing No. 85 to honor Hernandez.  ""I understand Aaron killed people, but as long as he said he was sorry for it, that’s good enough for me,"" the account quoted Tebow as saying.  There’s no evidence that Tebow actually said this, or that he’s wearing No. 85 for Hernandez.  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/08/viral-image/rumors-spread-online-about-tim-tebow-aaron-hernand/

Wisconsin U.S. Rep. misses mark on claim that removing troops from Afghanistan will save U.S. money
","After nearly 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan, the United States has pledged to withdraw its forces from the country.  President Joe Biden announced a plan to have all U.S. troops out of the country by Sept. 11, 2021, but an accelerated pace of withdrawal could have troops completely out of the country by mid-July, according to a May 25, 2021 report from the New York Times.  As America’s longest war draws to a close, arguments have sprung up over what to do with the money the country is currently spending on the conflict -- and how much will actually be saved by pulling troops out of the unstable region.  U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, claimed that withdrawing troops from Afghanistan could save the country $50 billion a year in a May 21, 2021 tweet --  money he argues could be cut from the Pentagon budget and put towards something else, such as ending homelessness.  For the purpose of this fact check, we’re going to focus on the first part of his claim.  Can bringing home the troops in Afghanistan really save the country $50 billion?  In short, not as a practical matter. When we reached out to Pocan’s office seeking backup, communications director Usamah Andrabi said that the $50 billion had been widely reported, and shared a link to a report by The Balance, a nonpartisan financial advice and news site, based in New York City. The war started off in 2001, with 9,700 people on the ground in Afghanistan, at a cost of $23 billion, according to The Balance.  That number has grown since then, hitting $107 billion in spending in 2011, with more than 94,000 people on the ground. Since then, yearly spending has dropped as the number of troops stationed in the country has declined. In 2018, that number dropped to $52 billion in spending, and remained the same for 2019, according to an estimate by The Balance. Spending for 2020 was not yet available.  But even though the U.S. is currently spending about $50 billion a year on the war, that doesn’t mean that pulling troops out will amount to that same figure in savings.  Jonathan Bydlak, director of the Governance Program for the R Street Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, said estimating cost savings from shifts in ground troops and other foreign policy decisions isn’t straightforward. There are three things that would need to be considered to reach an estimation of savings, he said:  The direct costs of engagement. Changes in the base Department of Defense budget because of reduced engagement. Ongoing/long-term costs, primarily veterans’ medical/disability benefits and interest.  Bydlak estimated the U.S. could see about $4 billion to $6 billion in direct savings, about $1 billion to $2 billion in base budget savings and about $28 billion to $42 billion in long-term costs. That puts total savings somewhere between $33 billion and $50 billion a year.  So, Pocan’s claim is on the very high end of that range. But that savings could shrink if Biden opts to only withdraw a portion of the troops currently on the ground, leaving a small residual force. In that case, savings would only be about $7 billion to $10 billion.  There are also other costs that could crop up, too, Bydlak said: If the U.S. decides to provide more aid to Afghanistan, to help encourage stability; if more money is spent by the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of withdrawal; or if the domestic cost of housing troops is greater than the cost of stationing them in Afghanistan, due to a higher cost of living.  Others worry that any savings for the U.S. could be eaten up -- at least in the short term -- by the cost of pulling troops and supplies out of Afghanistan.  Mackenzie Eaglen, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning public policy think tank, said in an April 26, 2021 report that spending in Afghanistan will still remain high without boots on the ground due to ongoing investments in counterterrorism and salaries and other expenses for the 3,000 members of the Afghan National Security Forces.  Among other potential costs Eaglen included in her report: Breaking contracts with private entities for property, buildings and equipment and bringing home the equipment the U.S. brought with its troops.  ""It will require more forces than are in the country now,"" the article said.  Bringing troops home isn’t an end to the mission that started in 2001 in Afghanistan, it’s a mission change, Eaglen wrote.  ""If Congress is expecting a windfall of savings to result from the Afghanistan withdrawal, it is likely to be disappointed,"" Eaglen wrote. ""Threats will still need to be managed -- just from slightly farther away. In the meantime, it will discover that leaving is hard, dangerous, and expensive.""  Pocan claimed in a tweet that the country could save $50 billion a year by pulling troops out of Afghanistan.  The U.S. could save up to $50 billion, or as little as $7 billion on withdrawing troops, according to one expert. But that just covers one side of the ledger.  There are many other potential costs that must be accounted for, such as the possibility of a small residual force left on the ground in Afghanistan, mental and physical health care for veterans returning home, or even the higher cost of housing active troops as they return to the states.  One expert suggests that leaving Afghanistan, at least in the short term, will likely cost the U.S. more than it saves, because of the need to continue funding counterterrorism infrastructure, end contracts with local entities and pay for removing equipment from the landlocked country.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.  ",/factchecks/2021/jun/08/mark-pocan/wisconsin-us-rep-misses-mark-claim-removing-troops/

""Oh the irony only the non vaxed can fly."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim has been debunked before. There is no evidence that airlines gathered to ""discuss the risks"" of carrying vaccinated passengers. ""We’re not aware of any such meeting having taken place on 30 May or otherwise,"" said Perry Flint, the U.S. head of corporate communications for the International Air Transport Association, an airline trade group.  A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines said the company didn’t ""have any knowledge"" of any such meeting and added that ""we have not had internal conversations on this topic."" There is also no evidence airlines have expressed concerns about blood clots among vaccinated passengers or about liability associated with them. ""IATA’s position is that travelers who are vaccinated should be free to travel without restriction,"" Flint said. In the U.S., about 41.9% of the population — or about 138 million people — has been fully vaccinated, and about 51.5% of the population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Blood clots were a known risk of long-distance travel long before COVID-19 or vaccines for the disease existed. The clots associated with travel are known as deep vein thrombosis and are caused by long periods of immobility. The CDC has had a webpage about how to mitigate the risks of blood clots when traveling long distances since at least 2013.  Those clots are different from the handful of cases of extremely rare blood clots that are associated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. They involve clots known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. They form in the brain, which means they can lead to headaches or stroke, according to Business Insider.  Experts caution that people who contract COVID-19 are at greater risk for developing abnormal blood clots. ""Vaccinated people would have a far lower risk of getting blood clots, because they have a far lower risk of having COVID, and having COVID is what causes blood clots,"" explained Dr. Mark Crowther, a thrombosis expert for the American Society of Hematology and chair of the department of medicine at McMaster University. Crowther noted that neither of the mRNA vaccines approved for use in the U.S. has been linked to an increased risk of blood-clotting disorders, while the J&J vaccine has been associated with a ""tiny increase in the risk of a very rare blood clotting disorder.""  ""If I were an airline I would be very concerned about unvaccinated people — for more than one reason — and would welcome vaccinated people onto my aircraft,"" he said.  An Instagram user claimed, ""Airlines are meeting today to discuss the risks of carrying vaxed passengers due to the risk of clots and the liabilities involved,"" and suggested that soon only unvaccinated people would be allowed to fly.  Industry leaders said they had no knowledge of such a meeting, and there is no evidence that any airlines plan to prevent vaccinated people from flying.

Is whole milk prohibited from being offered in New York schools? Yes
","Milk may not be the most urgent issue for school administrators these days, but the issue came up in a New York state Senate hearing earlier this year. During a Feb. 24 hearing of the New York Senate Agriculture Committee, agricultural law attorney and dairy producer Lorraine Lewandrowski called for a greater investment in dairy farms and rural communities.  Lewandrowski prefaced her testimony by describing several issues that dairy farmers are struggling with. Including New York state’s strict laws on milk pricing.  Lewandrowski said dairy farmers face strict production limits, reducing their bargaining power. ""Our food model is based on faraway sources while we throw our rural communities away,"" she said.  One of the points Lewandrowksi made in her testimony is that public school students in the state should be able to consume whole milk. ""Make it legal for a New York state student to have a glass of fresh whole milk,"" Lewandrowski said. ""A beautiful food from a beautiful land."" Is whole milk really prohibited in New York public schools? Basically, yes. In 2006, New York City school districts underwent a far-reaching rebranding of their student lunch programs, focusing on improving the meals’ nutritional values. As a result, whole milk was removed and ultimately banned by the city's education board. The options left on the menu were 1% milk, skim, and skim chocolate milk. Then, in 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act was passed by Congress. The law altered school lunch programs nationally by banning whole milk, 2% white milk, 2% flavored milk, and 1% flavored milk. This left students’ milk options to flavored skim, white skim, or white 1%. During the 2017-18 school year the regulations were loosened and Congress allowed schools to offer 1% flavored milk with proof of operational hardship. By 2018-19, schools were allowed to offer the 1% flavored milk without citing an operational concern, according to the USDA. But whole milk remains unavailable. In March of 2021, Reps. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., and Antonio Delgado, D-N.Y., introduced the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2021. It would allow flavored and unflavored whole milk back into school cafeterias. New York state Sen. George Borrello, a member of the Agriculture Committee, told PolitiFact that he ""wholeheartedly"" supports efforts to return whole milk to schools. He said that doing so would provide children in New York with another option at lunch while also aiding the state’s dairy industry. Dairy farmers want to be able to sell whole milk in addition to the other types because they contend that it’s more nutritional and cuts down on waste by students who don’t like the taste of lower-fat milk. Food Waste Warrior, a project of the World Wildlife Fund, found that as much as 45 million gallons of milk were wasted in 2019 in school lunchrooms, a value of $138 million. The study predicted that total food waste in schools could cost as much as $9.7 million per day or $1.7 billion per school year. ""We are losing an entire generation of students who don't know about appreciating a good glass of flavorful milk,"" said Lewandrowksi ""How could this be good?  If food is given to students, wouldn't choosing foods that children prefer be better?"" Lewandrowski said it’s not currently ""legal for a New York State student to have a glass of fresh whole milk."" New York City banned providing whole milk in schools in 2006, and the federal government banned whole milk nationally — and therefore in all of New York state — in 2010.  We rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2021/jun/07/lorraine-lewandrowski/whole-milk-prohibited-being-offered-new-york-schoo/

Kamala Harris Gets It Mostly Right On Claim One-Third Of Small Businesses Shut Down During Pandemic
","There’s no doubt small businesses have suffered during the COVID-19 crisis, especially those that rely on walk-in customers like restaurants, cafes, salons and barber shops.  But what percentage shut their doors during the pandemic?  Vice President and former California Sen. Kamala Harris claimed during a recent interview on MSNBC that a huge chunk had closed.  ""Sadly, during the course of the pandemic, one-third of our small businesses have closed,"" Harris said in the interview that aired June 1.  She did not say whether she meant one-third had closed permanently or at some point during the past year. Even so, we decided to check the facts on this important topic.  Our Research Economists say it’s difficult to pinpoint the percentage of small businesses that have closed and whether those are temporary or permanent. Official closure statistics lag and might not be known until later this year or next.  But there are some places to look for early indicators. To support the vice president’s statement, Sabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Harris, pointed to a Harvard University-based project called The Economic Tracker. The online platform provides data about real-time economic trends and uses financial transaction activity to suggest whether a business has closed. As of this week, the Tracker showed there were 37.5% fewer small businesses open nationwide compared with January 2020, two months before the pandemic hit the United States. In California, the share of small businesses decreased 39.1% over this period.  The online platform doesn’t say why businesses shut down or whether the closures are temporary. The Tracker relies on data from the software company Womply, which counts a business as closed after observing three consecutive days without credit card payment transactions and open once transactions resume, explained Michael Stepner, a postdoctoral fellow at Opportunity Insights, the Harvard based nonprofit that runs the platform. ""Some of those closures are surely temporary,"" Jeff Michael, executive director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, said in an email, noting that Harris’ statement lacks this context. ""But I don’t think that takes away from the factual accuracy that small businesses have been disproportionately hit."" Michael said larger businesses were better equipped to adapt to a world of e-commerce, curbside fulfillment and drive-through windows. They also had more financial resources ""to weather the economic shock,"" he added.  An April study by the Federal Reserve Board somewhat complicates Harris’ statement. It examined how many businesses shut down for good during the pandemic. While it doesn’t offer a definitive answer, it said permanent closures are ""likely to have been lower than widespread expectations from early in the pandemic. Moreover, businesses have recently exhibited notable optimism about their survival prospects.""  We found one more data point that supports Harris’ assertion.  A survey published last May by the Small Business Roundtable found 31% of small businesses reported that they were not operating. That’s close to the ""one-third"" figure Harris used in her statement.  Those doing the worst at the time were hotels, restaurants, cafes and similar businesses, according to SBR, which advocates for small businesses. Representatives for the organization did not immediately say whether they had updated the survey or determined how many closures were temporary.  Our Ruling Vice President Kamala Harris claimed one-third of the nation’s small businesses have closed during the pandemic.  A survey by the Small Business Roundtable and data tracked by Harvard University generally support Harris’ statement. But they don’t offer clear information about how many small business closures were temporary and Harris didn’t either.  A recent Federal Reserve Board study found more businesses than expected reopened after initially shutting down.  Harris’ statement could have used some additional context, but is generally accurate.  We rated it Mostly True.  MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",/factchecks/2021/jun/07/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-claimed-one-third-small-businesses-c/

Federal law still prohibits marijuana use, including on college campuses
","In late March, New York state lawmakers passed — and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed — a bill that legalized recreational marijuana statewide. Soon after, students at SUNY’s University at Albany received an email from Clarence McNeill, the dean of students, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported on Apr. 7. In the email, McNeill wrote: ""Despite this change to state law, the use and possession of marijuana on UAlbany’s campuses remains prohibited under federal law."" Is it correct that New York state’s recreational marijuana legalization would have no effect on the state’s college campuses? That’s largely correct, but with some legal gray areas, experts say. While McNeill’s words were addressed specifically to University at Albany students, the same federal law barring marijuana at the University at Albany would also apply to other campuses in states that have legalized recreational marijuana. (McNeill could not be reached for comment.) The Controlled Substances Act is a federal law that was enacted in 1971. Under the law, marijuana is categorized as a ""Schedule I"" drug, defined as having ""no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.""  Schedule I drugs are classified as illegal, and years-long efforts by marijuana advocates and lawmakers to change that classification have not succeeded. However, there is a bit of a gray area. While federal law designates marijuana as an illegal substance, the federal government isn’t, as a practical matter, enforcing that part of the law today, said Mason Tvert, a communications advisor for Vicente Sederberg LLP and former director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project. ""It’s not like DEA agents are going to come in and make an arrest for individual possession, because then they would have to refer it to the Justice Department and they wouldn’t prosecute that,"" Tvert said. Jonathan Caulkins, a professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, agreed. ""The federal government doesn’t really pursue marijuana charges,"" Caulkins said. Even if the Biden administration steers clear of changing marijuana’s scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act, Caulkins said, the administration is unlikely to change the current hands-off prosecution policies for simple marijuana possession. On the one hand, state, local, and campus police forces that have jurisdiction over campuses in states with legalized recreational marijuana would not have a law to use in arresting students of legal age for simple marijuana possession, Tvert said. However, it is within a college’s rights to prohibit marijuana possession or use on its campus, and many universities have such policies in place for their students, Caulkins said. The patchwork of sometimes conflicting laws worries some institutions, Caulkins said. ""There are various federal contractors that are understandably concerned about the inconsistencies between federal and state law and, frankly, between federal law and federal law,"" Caulkins said. Tvert said it makes sense for universities to be concerned that federal funding could be at risk if they involve allow marijuana use. McNeill wrote, ""Despite this change to state law, the use and possession of marijuana on … campuses remains prohibited under federal law."" He is correct that marijuana possession and use has been illegal under federal law for four decades. That said, the federal government does not typically prosecute marijuana possession and use cases, leaving it up to states to either enforce their own laws against marijuana or else legalize the drug within the state’s borders. However, even in states that have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, universities can still choose to ban the drug from their campuses. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/jun/07/clarence-mcneill/federal-law-still-prohibits-marijuana-use-includin/

The credentials of Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, include research funding from the Canadian government and the Canadian Cancer Society, as well as dozens of publications in research journals. But experts told PolitiFact that, despite a document Bridle cites, there is no evidence to back his claim that what is known as the vaccines’ spike protein produces a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage. ""There is no data that the spike is a toxin,"" said Dr. Drew Weissman, a vaccine expert and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The document he cites is an anti-vaxxer product with no real scientific data supporting its claims."" Bridle began a Canadian talk show interview with a dramatic warning: ""I’ll forewarn you and your listeners that the story I’m about to tell is a bit of a scary one.""  Describing himself as ""very much pro-vaccine,"" Bridle said he had assembled scientific information that he intends to make public, but ""your listeners are going to be the first to hear the public release of this conclusion.""  He claimed the information shows that the spike protein produced by the vaccines, which is intended to prevent the coronavirus from infecting the body, does not remain in the shoulder muscle but gets into the blood — and can lead to clotting, bleeding, heart problems and neurological damage.   ""In short, the conclusion is, we made a big mistake,"" Bridle said. ""We didn’t realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin, and was a pathogenic protein. So, by vaccinating people, we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin. Some people, this gets into circulation, and when that happens in some people, they can cause damage, especially in the cardiovascular system. And I have many other legitimate questions about the long-term safety, therefore, of this vaccine."" The interview led to claims widely shared on websites and social media, including posts that linked to an article from the website of the Hal Turner Radio Show, which uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. The article carried this headline: ""Doctor on COVID Vax: ‘We Screwed-Up. We didn't realize the Spike Protein is a TOXIN’ Does this mean everyone vaccinated is manufacturing their own Spike Protein Toxins in their own bodies?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) COVID-19 mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines use the human body’s natural immune response to its advantage. The shot contains the recipe for making the molecule known as the spike protein, which the COVID-19 virus uses to bind to cells. Once the cell receives these instructions, it creates the protein and displays it on its surface. The immune system then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to fight it. The technology in the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna stems from research that began in the early 1990s, said Weissman. He and his colleague Katalin Karikó, a senior vice president of BioNTech, are credited with the breakthrough discovery that enabled these vaccines to be safe and highly effective. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls the spike protein harmless, says: ""Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection."" PolitiFact emailed Bridle on June 3 asking for the evidence to back his statement, and received an automated reply from him. The reply said that the radio interview led to ""vicious attacks,"" including a website that emerged May 28 bearing his name. Bridle’s email said that he believes the website — which anonymously critiques Bridle’s claims — to be libeling him. Also in the email, Bridle cited a document that he said supports what he said in the interview, and that he would be writing a more comprehensive public report. The document claims that ""recent studies suggest that the spike protein produced in response to vaccination"" could result ""in damage to various tissues and organs. This risk, no matter how theoretical, must be investigated prior to the vaccination of children and adolescents.""  On that point, the document links to one Journal of Respiration article published Dec. 31, days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The article describes how the spike protein in the coronavirus affects lung cells and says that because the spike protein will be administered in vaccines, ""it is critical to understand the biological effects of this protein on human cells to ensure that it does not promote long-term adverse health consequences."" Weissman said Bridle’s conclusion that the vaccines are toxic is off-base, especially given that the vaccines do not deliver spike protein to the lungs. ""Reports of spike protein trouble are interesting and important for coronavirus infection, but they do not mean that the vaccines themselves are going to cause similar problems,"" said a May 4 commentary in Science Translational Medicine, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The commentary notes that ""the spike protein is not released to wander freely through the bloodstream,"" and says the fact that the vaccines ""are aimed at the spike means that they’re protective in more ways than we even realized."" Despite the widespread administration of the vaccine, Dr. Walter Orenstein, professor and associate director of Emory University’s Emory Vaccine Center, said he is ""not aware of any data to support the allegations"" made by Bridle.  ""It would be nice to have any direct evidence if this were true,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  ""We are at nearly 300 million doses given (in the United States) and a robust surveillance system in a population that is certainly not shy about reporting problems"" about vaccines to public health authorities, Offit said. A post widely shared on social media claims a viral immunologist said COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein means people are being inoculated ""with a toxin."" Experts say there is no evidence that the spike protein produced by the vaccines is a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage. The Canadian viral immunologist who made the claim has not produced evidence to back it up. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jun/07/facebook-posts/no-proof-researcher-claim-covid-19-vaccines-spike-/
