Reince Priebus says Mitt Romney 'gave away his father's inheritance'
","
Mitt Romney, the self-made man. 
That’s part of the ""Mitt Romney story"" that Republicans plan to tell at their convention in Tampa this week.

His father may have been well-to-do, but Republicans have been emphasizing for weeks that Romney made his millions on his own.

Romney’s father, George, was chief executive of Detroit automaker American Motors Corp. and a three-time governor of Michigan who ran for president in the 1960s. Mitt grew up in a wealthy Michigan suburb, attending prep school and ultimately Harvard.

He's been the target of silver-spoon attacks because he’s worth more than $100 million. (Perhaps far more.)

But Republicans argue he wasn’t handed his wealth — he earned it.

He even ""gave away his father’s inheritance,"" national committee chair Reince Priebus repeatedly told TV interviewers on Aug. 26, 2012, as the party prepared to open its convention.

We’ve rated a related claim from Romney himself that he ""didn’t inherit money"" from his parents. That earned a Half True, because he previously told interviewers he did get an inheritance, but donated it to Brigham Young University.

This time we’re checking whether he ""gave away his father’s inheritance.""

We’re short on primary evidence for the claim — we haven’t seen his father’s will, nor a receipt from Brigham Young. But there’s a strong circumstantial case that Priebus is correct.

Rich get richer

George Romney died in 1995 at age 88. By that time, his son had led Bain Capital, the private equity firm he launched in 1984, for more than a decade.

As Romney told a C-SPAN interviewer in 2006:

""I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn’t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that’s where his inheritance ended up.""

Why did he give the money away?

""I figured we had enough of our own,"" he said.

According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death.

Our ruling

Reince Priebus says that Romney ""gave away his father's inheritance.""

Romney has repeatedly said so himself and that's backed up by the simple fact that Brigham Young University has an institute named for his father launched just a few years after his death. And there’s no reason to think Romney would have needed the money a decade after his lucrative move to Bain Capital.

We find the evidence supports the claim and we see nothing to contradict it. If any evidence emerges, we'll review it. But in the meantime, we rate Priebus’ claim True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/27/reince-priebus/republican-national-committee-chair-reince-priebus/

Barack Obama's campaign says his recovery has outpaced Ronald Reagan's in job creation
","
Stephanie Cutter, President Barack Obama’s deputy campaign manager, said her boss one-upped President Ronald Reagan in economic rebuilding following a crippling recession. But was she right? 
On the Aug. 22, 2012, edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Willie Geist asked Cutter what argument she would make to someone who had been out of work under Obama and who was wondering whether it’s time for a change. 
Cutter responded, ""Well, I think that worker probably has a good understanding of what's happened over the past four years in terms of the president coming in and seeing 800,000 jobs lost on the day that the president was being sworn in, and seeing the president moving pretty quickly to stem the losses, to turn the economy around, and over the past, you know, 27 months we've created 4.5 million private sector jobs. That's more jobs than in the Bush recovery, in the Reagan recovery, there's obviously more we need to do...."" 
Many readers contacted us to ask if the Obama recovery has really outpaced the recovery from the 1981-1982 recession under Reagan. (We’re focusing on the Reagan comparison because readers emailed us saying they thought Cutter was wrong.) 
The answer is that, however you slice it, it hasn’t. Here’s a rundown. 
Using Cutter’s methodology 
Cutter counted the past 27 months. That’s the most favorable measurement for Obama, since 27 months ago was the low point in employment numbers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal scorekeeper for jobs numbers. Cutter also used private-sector job numbers rather than the overall job numbers, which helps Obama’s case too; government job losses have been a drag on the overall numbers over that period. 
Between March 2010 and July 2012 (which is actually 28 months), the number of private-sector jobs rose from 106.9 million to 111.3 million, an increase of 4.4 million -- just shy of Cutter’s 4.5 million. 
What about Reagan? The low point for employment under Reagan was December 1982, with 72.8 million private-sector jobs. Fast-forward 27 months to March 1985 and the number of private-sector jobs was 80.4 million. That’s an increase of 7.7 million -- a far bigger jobs bump than under Obama. 
Even more impressively, the Reagan recovery took place within a much smaller economy. The 27-month Reagan recovery represented an 11 percent increase in jobs, compared to a 4 percent increase during the comparable period under Obama. 
So the Gipper wins this faceoff. 
(Using Cutter’s method, President George W. Bush oversaw an increase in 4.3 million jobs in the first 27 months following the low point during his tenure, so he had slightly fewer than Obama.) 
Starting with the beginning of the recovery 
The comparison is even more unflattering to Obama if you use a less cherry-picked time frame than the one Cutter used -- one that starts when the recoveries officially began, rather than the low point for jobs. 
Using this formula, Obama’s numbers change quite a bit, since he’s suffered from the growing pattern of recoveries creating fewer jobs, and more slowly, than was typical in past recoveries. 
The recession under Obama officially ended in June 2009. That means that the number of jobs continued to fall for another nine months before hitting rock bottom. Counting these nine extra months of job losses, Obama’s private-sector job creation total falls to 3.4 million over three years and one month. 
By contrast, using this formula actually boosts Reagan’s private-sector job-creation totals. The recession under Reagan officially ended in November 1982, almost simultaneously with the low point in jobs. Over the next three years and one month -- the comparable period under Obama -- the number of private-sector jobs increased by 9.1 million. 
Taking into account the growth of the workforce overall, employment has grown by 3 percent during the Obama recovery, compared to 13 percent under Reagan. 
Chalk up an even stronger win for the Gipper. 
Our ruling 
Even using Cutter’s cherry-picked formulation, job creation under Obama has dramatically trailed the pace set by Reagan. In fact, adjusting for the size of the workforce, Reagan’s recovery was more than four times bigger than Obama’s has been so far. We rate Cutter’s claim False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/27/stephanie-cutter/barack-obama-says-his-recovery-has-outpaced-ronald/

Mitt Romney is right, getting a job right out of college can be tricky business
","
As former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.,  fielded questions from New Hampshire voters this week, Romney shared a new take on the American Dream.

A junior at St. Anselm College in Manchester, NH, where Romney and Ryan visited, asked Romney what he’s going to do to help American students with debt coming out of college.

""The first thing I’m going to do for you, is make sure we don’t keep on adding more, more and more debt that you don’t even know about,"" Romney said. ""That’s number one. Number two, the next thing I’m going to do for you, is to make sure that when you graduate, you can get a job. Half the kids coming out of college this year, half, can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree. It's unacceptable. We have to make sure young people coming into the workforce can get a job.

""I think it was Dick Armey the other day, who practiced a little humor, he said, ‘It used to be in America, that the American Dream was owning your own home. Now it’s getting kids out of the home you own.’ I want to make sure that you’re able to get a home of your own. That you can have a good job. That you can start paying back the debt.""

The former Texas congressman’s joke got some chuckles from the crowd. But half of college graduates are either unemployed or underemployed? That’s not a laughing matter.

PolitiFact decided to check the claim to see if Romney was right.

First, we reached out to Romney’s campaign to get the sources behind his statement.

Romney spokesman Ryan Williams pointed to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates.

PolitiFact also checked its coffer of claims and found a similar statement made by the Republican Jewish Coalition in June. It said, ""One out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job,"" which was deemed Mostly True.

PolitiFact used that same Associated Press article, which has the headline, ""In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed,"" to reach its ruling.

The article is based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs.

Here’s how the AP summarized the findings:

""A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ...

""About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year.""

According to our interpretation of the article, Romney got it right: about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree.

The Republican Jewish Coalition missed the fact that a large part of the 50 percent figure is made up by students that are underemployed.

PolitiFact also checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research for the Associated Press story. Sum agreed with our analysis.

We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. People shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which was most recently recorded at 8.5 percent for June 2012. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities.

According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- ""before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields."" That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets.

Still, there’s reason to be concerned about the current rate: At 53.6 percent, it’s the highest it’s been in at least 11 years.

Our ruling

Romney was right to say that half of American college graduates this year are either unemployed or underemployed, and he interpreted the corresponding research correctly. We give him a True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/27/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-right-getting-job-right-out-college-ca/
"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Lamar Smith']","
Lamar Smith says top 20 percent of income earners pay nearly 70 percent of federal taxes
","
Speaking in Austin recently, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said he believes Congress will reach a compromise to extend the so-called ""Bush tax cuts"" before they expire at the end of this year.

We were already working on a related fact-check of the San Antonio Republican: In an Aug. 1, 2012, press release, Smith touted his vote for the extension that day and said, ""The top 20 percent of income earners (over $74,000) pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes.""

Smith, whose district takes in part of Travis County, gave similar figures in his Aug. 23, 2012, speech to the Austin-Oak Hill Rotary Club. We’ll describe those but stick to checking his earlier 20-percent claim.

The Bush tax cuts are a mix of changes to tax rates, exemptions, deductions and credits enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush and extended in 2010.

Smith’s press release credits its numbers to a July 22, 2012, Wall Street Journal chart, which in turn cites a July 10, 2012, study of 2008-09 data by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Journal’s bar chart shows the top 20 percent of U.S. wage-earners made $74,000 or more and paid nearly 70 percent of federal taxes.

Though there wasn’t a precise percentage on the bar chart, there was in the CBO’s report on its study: 67.9 percent.

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us by email that allowing for rounding, Smith’s full statement was correct except for some clarification needed on the $74,000 salary figure (which was also on the Journal’s chart).

That’s how much a single person living alone would have had to earn to rank in the top 20 percent in 2009, Williams said, but the CBO adjusts its figures for household size. ""A two-person household had to make $104,700 and a four-person household had to make $148,100 to hit the top quintile,"" Williams said.

Whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers or for everyone except ""rich"" taxpayers is a major part of the battle in Congress, where Democratic plans have proposed extending the cuts for households with income below a cutoff point (which has ranged from $200,000 for individuals to $1 million). The Republican-majority House approved a plan extending the cuts for all taxpayers in the August vote Smith cited in his press release.

During the debate, politicians have made a range of claims about how much of the nation’s revenue comes from the wealthiest households. Smith’s 20-percent statistic avoids a pitfall PolitiFact has found in some of those statements.

In 2010 and 2011, Republicans fell foul of the Truth-O-Meter by claiming the top 1 percent of wage earners paid more than 40 percent of ""the entire revenue"" and ""all taxes."" That group paid more than 40 percent of all income taxes, but income taxes are only about half of the total federal revenue pie.

Smith also cites ""all federal taxes"" -- the whole pie, including payroll, corporate income and excise taxes -- but includes a lot more taxpayers. According to supplemental data for the July CBO report, there were 23.6 million households in the top 20 percent of wage-earners and 1.1 million households in the top 1 percent.

The top 1 percent, the report says, earned $282,900 or more per single-person household and paid 22.3 percent of all federal taxes.

That’s closer to the stats Smith gave in his Austin speech, which included measures for the top 1 percent but referred only to share of federal income tax revenue.

He told us he usually gives rounded versions of the percentages, and produced his reference material -- a chart he keeps in his wallet, based partly on Oct. 24, 2011, data from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- showing the top 1 percent earned 16.9 percent of 2009 income in the U.S. but paid 36.7 percent of federal income taxes. 
Our ruling

Smith said the top 20 percent of taxpayers shoulder nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes. According to the CBO’s latest math, it’s 67.9 percent. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/27/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-top-20-percent-income-earners-pay/

Charlie Crist said the GOP platform bans abortion even in cases of rape
","
The Democrats have been attacking Mitt Romney and the Republicans for their opposition to abortion rights. On the eve of the Republican convention in Tampa, they got some help from Republican turned independent Charlie Crist, the former governor of Florida.

Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times, and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues.

""Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims,"" Crist wrote.

Crist refers to Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri. The GOP establishment , including Mitt Romney, called for Akin to withdraw after he said that ""legitimate rape"" rarely results in pregnancy. Akin apologized for his comment but refused to back out. Democrats have been tying Akin to the GOP and Romney ever since.

To assess the accuracy of Crist’s statement, we asked whether Akin’s views are part of the GOP 2012 platform and whether there is such a thing as an Akin amendment in the first place.

 What the platform says

A party’s platform document is supposed to capture the values and policies its presidential candidate will advance if she or he wins the White House. We should note that presidential candidates don’t always agree with every element of the platform, but it is a statement of the party’s overall principles.

The 2012 platform remains unofficial until a formal vote by the convention delegates but the staff of the Republican National Committee sent PolitiFact the current text of the section on abortion.

The key portion reads ""We assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children.""

What these words mean is subject to interpretation, but at the very least, they call for nullifying Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion as a private decision that should be left, within limits, to the woman.

We attempted to reach Crist to hear why he believes this language would ban abortion in cases of rape, but we were unsuccessful.

We did speak to David O’Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. O’Steen said the platform does not prohibit abortion when rape produces a pregnancy.

""It states a broad policy,"" O’Steen said. ""It says Roe should be reversed and human life should be protected and that elected representatives should have the right to pass those protections.""

But O’Steen said those protections are not absolute, and Congress and individual states would have to decide what exceptions to allow. O’Steen compared those exceptions to laws regarding capital punishment. For example, homicide is a crime but killing a person in self-defense is not.

""It all depends on the circumstances,"" O""Steen said. Similarly, Congress and states could pass laws that allow or prohibit abortion in cases of rape. O’Steen says this would hold true if Congress passed the human life amendment or other legislation that declares that legal personhood begins at the moment of conception.

That legal opinion is far from universal.

Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a staff attorney at the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, told Mother Jones magazine, ""Anywhere they give legal rights to and define 'person' as beginning at fertilization, you have the 'personhood' effect."" In the article, the personhood effect is defined as effectively banning all abortions.

As for whether states would have the flexibility to set their own conditions for abortions, Suzanne Novack, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in the same magazine article, ""It wouldn't go back to the states. It would be the law of the land.""

We should note that the current wording in the GOP platform has been in place at least since 2004. Republican candidates have run on that platform and have endorsed exceptions for abortion in cases of rape and incest. As PolitiFact has reported before, since about 2000, the human life amendments introduced in Congress have included those exceptions, too.

However in 2008, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., failed in an effort to include the rape and incest exceptions in the platform itself. Also, O’Steen says while the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed Romney, the ""ideal policy would have an exception to protect the health of the mother only."" 
An ""Akin"" amendment?

So is the personhood amendment fairly described as the Akin amendment?

As far as we can tell, there is no Akin amendment. We were unable to reach Crist to ask what he meant by the term. O’Steen told us that Akin ""was nowhere close to the platform committee.""

Romney’s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., has joined Akin on legislation to limit Medicaid funding for abortions to cases of ‘forcible rape.’ PolitiFact has found that Ryan opposes  the rape exception for abortion, as does Akin.

The advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America told us that ""someone started to refer to the abortion language in the GOP platform as the ""Akin amendment"" because it did not explicitly include exceptions for rape and incest. That said, Akin didn’t play a role in drafting that language.""

We found an article that credits the Obama campaign for applying that label to the GOP platform position on abortion, which we believe is quite a stretch given Akin has not been involved.

Our ruling

Crist said the GOP platform includes ""the Akin amendment ... which bans abortion, even for rape victims.""

The platform clearly opposes most abortions but is vague on the details. It does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims.

Also, there is no official Akin amendment, and the legal implications of a human life amendment and some versions of personhood bills are debatable.

However, there is no dispute that all such measures would nullify Roe v. Wade. Some leading anti-abortion groups would like to ban abortions even in cases of rape and believe personhood bills would help them do this.

Anti-muslim website says Bill Haslam promotes the interests of radical Islamists
","
Earlier this summer, a handful of Republican Party county committees in Tennessee passed resolutions criticizing Republican Gov. Bill Haslam for hiring Samar Ali, an accomplished young Muslim-American native of Waverly, Tenn., and honors graduate of Vanderbilt University and its law school. Now, at least two new websites are attempting to perpetuate the idea that Tennessee’s governor is somehow involved in a massive conspiracy to ""promote the interests"" of ""Islamist radical ideology,"" including ""Shariah compliant finance.""

For the purposes of this item, we are going to examine a statement from billhislam.com: ""The Governor of the great state of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, has made it clear by his repeated actions that he will pursue a policy that promotes the interest of Islamist (sic) and their radical ideology as long as he is governor.""

We’re feeling déjà vu. PolitiFact Tennessee addressed an associated claim in July when GOP state Senate candidate Woody Degan of Shelby County charged the Haslam administration was ""making our Economic Development Department Sharia compliant,"" in part by hiring Ali as international director earlier this year. The governor and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) rejected the contention that Ali or the department was doing anything relating to Sharia. We gave it our Pants On Fire ruling as not just false, but ridiculous.

At its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. But most people, constitutional scholars and others, agree that attempting to install Sharia as U.S. or Tennessee law would be unconstitutional and there’s been no bills at the state level to attempt it.

The voters of Senate District 32 gave Degan a drubbing. He got 10 percent of the vote against state Sen Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in their Aug. 2 primary. Despite that, the shadowy movement that Degan connected with during his campaign has not been deterred.

In addition to billhislam.com, there’s another anonymous blog calling itself the ""tn Council 4 political justice,""  which has posted 39 ""newsletters"" on its site since April 9, focused on the purported threat of Islam on Tennessee and the Haslam administration’s role in it. The latest of these, posted Aug. 23, attempts to link Samar Ali’s father, noted Waverly, Tenn., physician Subhi Ali, to The Jerusalem Fund. The anonymous bloggers write that the Washington, D.C.-based humanitarian non-profit’s policies ""reflect overtly pro-Palestinian/pro-Hamas/anti-Israel positions."" The bloggers also claim that ""in addition to making grants for social services in the ‘Occupied Palestinian Territories,’"" a branch of the Fund also ""supports the Palestine Diabetes Institute"" and that Samar Ali served as the transatlantic liaison during the development of that project.

From diabetes to terrorism?

Those behind billhislam.com make that leap: they titled their Aug. 23 link to the tn Council 4 political justice ""newsletter"" on Dr. Ali and the Jerusalem Fund as ""Dr. Jihad."" They go even further, with one post trying to connect the dots between ""Sharia compliant finance investments"" that the Haslam administration strongly denies going after to the potential maiming of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Dave Vance of Big Rock, Tenn., writes on billhislam.com that ""Apparently, Governor Haslam is comfortable with the distinct possibility ... that at least some of the SCF (Sharia compliant finance) investments on which he intends to spend taxpayer funds will go to provide funds to the very people who are killing American troops in Afghanistan.""

It would be one thing if all this had stayed buried in the cyber netherworld but it worked its way into Degan’s campaigns and aforementioned resolutions passed by a few county GOP organizations (notably including the state’s most affluent county, Williamson). Even the governor feels compelled to spend time addressing it occasionally. Last week, his top assistant, Deputy to the Governor Claude Ramsey, wrote the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Chris Devaney, a letter disputing the allegations so Devaney could assure the GOP faithful that their standard-bearer is not a radical Islamist.

We will note that Haslam is an elder at Knoxville’s Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.

The blog and the website cite voluminous ""research"" in ""connecting the dots,"" as one section of billhislam.com is labeled. But none of it that we’ve waded through has a shred of evidence to support the central claim.
 
We received no response to inquiries to the site’s administrator, listed as Steven Curtis of Dover, Tenn., nor the contact email listed on the website.

Wayne Powell says Eric Cantor has received most oil money in Congress
","
Democratic Congressional candidate Wayne Powell is trying to tie Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, to big oil.

On his website, Powell claimed, ""This year, Eric Cantor has received more money from oil companies than any other member of Congress.""

When we contacted the campaign, advisor Dave ""Mudcat"" Saunders said the statement was inaccurate and he took it down.

The claim was replaced by, ""Eric Cantor has received huge contributions from big oil companies.""

OpenSecrets.org, the website for the Center for Responsive Politics, tracks campaign donations. Among members of Congress during this election cycle, Cantor ranks No. 10. His $187,250 from the oil and gas industry groups trails Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who topped the list with $358,200.

Others who surpass Cantor in oil and gas money are Rep. Rick Berg, R-N.D.; Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont.; Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio; Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich.

Among House members, he ranks No. 7. In the 2009-10 cycle, he ranked 18th.

Cantor’s campaign committee had raised $6.3 million and spent $5.1 million as of July 30. That ranks No. 4 among current House candidates, behind Boehner, Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Allen West, R-Fla.

In his leadership PAC, the Every Republican Is Crucial PAC, Cantor raised $4.4 million and spent nearly all of it. Oil and gas industry groups donated $68,650 to his PAC.

Powell’s campaign has apologized for the inaccurate claim and changed the statement, which we encourage others to do when they realize their claims aren’t up to snuff.

Our ruling

The Powell campaign accused Cantor of having collected more money from oil and gas industry folks than any other member of Congress. They quickly acknowledged that the statement was false and changed it.

We applaud them for changing the claim, but we still have to rate the original one.

Baldwin says Thompson wants to give millionaires a tax cut while raising taxes on the middle class
","
This is Democrat Tammy Baldwin’s message for voters who may fondly remember former Gov. Tommy Thompson as a just-folks friend of the little guy: ""He’s not for you anymore.""

In a new campaign ad in the U.S. Senate race, the congresswoman from Madison says Republican Thompson is ""the guy who's gotten rich working for D.C. lobbyists"" since leaving state and federal posts.

The ad’s punch line: ""He wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class."" On screen, after images of a limo and private jet, a tree-lined street scene with the words: ""Raise taxes $1,300 on middle class families.""

Baldwin’s claim underlines what could be a key division in the campaign.

But is she right?

The 30-second spot cites two liberal sources for the claims: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a report prepared by the staff of a Democratic U.S. senator active on budget issues.

Both studies relate to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan -- not one authored by Thompson. Ryan, of course is the party’s vice presidential pick and on the ballot for an eighth term in the House.

But Thompson endorsed without qualification Ryan’s 2013 federal budget plan, so it’s reasonable to examine its impact.

But it’s worth noting Thompson calls for a 15 percent flat tax while Ryan wants to drop down to two individual rates, 10 percent and 25 percent. Either plan would be a big change from the rates of 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent in place for 2012 under current law.

So let’s look at how millionaires would fare under Thompson’s own plan, then the Tommy-endorsed Ryan plan.

Would Thompson’s plan cut taxes for millionaires?

The overall answer is yes, though some may already be paying lower rates than 15 percent. 
In June, we rated Mostly True a Baldwin claim that Thompson's plan ""amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent"" based on IRS data. People with income over $1 million are part of that category. 
Thompson’s campaign did not dispute Baldwin’s 1 percent analysis, saying the tax cut for the wealthy was needed because the top 1 percent  pay 37 percent of all income taxes collected, while half of Americans don’t pay any federal taxes.

Newt Gingrich, a Thompson backer, also proposed a 15 percent flat tax during the GOP presidential primaries, and it would have meant massive six-figure federal tax cuts for million-dollar earners, according to a study by the respected Tax Policy Center, an Urban Institute-Brookings Institution project that analyzes candidate’s tax proposals.

Baldwin’s TV spot adds a specific claim: Thompson favors giving a ""new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires.""

It cites the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, but that number originally came from the Tax Policy Center.

The Tax Policy Center study did, as Baldwin notes, estimate that those earning at least a million dollars would receive an average tax cut of $265,000 under that plan. That scenario assumes the Bush-era tax cuts would be extended.

We asked William McBride, chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, about the Tax Policy Center study and he offered no criticism of it.

Overall Baldwin is on pretty firm ground regarding how the plans Thompson has endorsed would affect high income earners.

The middle class

Now let’s turn to Baldwin’s claim that Thompson wants to raise federal taxes on the middle class, to the tune of $1,300.

Notably, Baldwin’s ad turns away from the Tax Policy Center report it relied upon regarding the Ryan plan’s effect on millionaires’ tax bills.

One reason may be that the Tax Policy Center report showed that Ryan’s plan would mean a net tax cut for every income group over $30,000 a year -- not a tax hike for the middle class as Baldwin claims.

Baldwin got the $1,300 increase from the report prepared by staff for U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania Democrat who chairs the US Congress Joint Economic Committee.

That report said the net effect of the Thompson-endorsed Ryan plan would be a $1,358 increase for households earning between $50,000 and $100,000.

The discrepancy stems from a huge difference in methodology between the Casey report and the Tax Policy Center analysis of Ryan’s plan.

The Casey report assumes -- without really knowing -- that Ryan and fellow Republicans would eliminate current deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, remove the employer‐provided health insurance exclusion, and tax 401(k) contributions. The authors of the study explained that Ryan ""potentially"" would have to cut those tax breaks in order to achieve his goal of cost neutrality on his tax cuts.

Losing those deductions has the effect of wiping out the tax cuts those middle-income people would see under Ryan’s plan to cut the tax rates, McBride said.

But that approach amounts to relying on facts not in evidence -- and taking the worst-case approach to make the point.

The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, attributed no elimination of deductions to Ryan’s plan, noting that his plan doesn’t specify what Republicans would do. (Ryan’s plan does strongly suggest that some tax breaks would go and others would remain, but specifics are lacking).

That’s why that study shows the middle class still getting a tax cut.

Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said Baldwin’s mixing of the two studies is a problem.

""They are not even apples and oranges,"" Williams said. ""It’s more like apples and toast.""

Both Williams and McBride expressed some concerns with the Democratic study because it assumes Ryan would eliminate major tax deductions that greatly benefit the middle class and below.

""We had no basis to decide what Ryan would pick"" to eliminate, Williams said. He also criticized the Democratic study as using questionable estimates.

McBride, though, said its undeniable that if Republicans end some major deductions while cutting the top tax rates, it would ""disproportionately benefit high income earners.""

That’s all related to the Ryan plan.

Thompson’s own plan talks of protecting -- not ending -- the deduction for home mortgage interest and charitable deductions. He does not rule out eliminating other deductions, though. In the absence of details, specific conclusions about how middle-income families would fare are difficult.

Finally, Baldwin’s ad says Thompson is himself a millionaire.

Thompson hasn’t disclosed tax returns, but his required financial disclosure statements show he reported $5.2 million in earned and noninvestment income between January 2010 and October 2011. That shows him to be in the million-dollar club during that period.

Our rating

Baldwin charged that Thompson ""wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.""

There is no real dispute that Thompson’s own plan and the Ryan plan he endorsed would yield a big tax cut, on average, for million-dollar earners. And the $265,000 figure is from calculations by a respected group.

The impact is far less clear for the middle class. To establish a tax increase, the ad cites a report that assumes key, worst-case details about the Ryan plan and ignores that Thompson has specifically opposed scrapping some of the deductions.

Baldwin’s ad draws a debatable conclusion about the middle class by splicing together two very different studies on the tax implications of the tax-rate cuts Thompson favors.

U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos claims United States has the “highest corporate tax rate in the world”
","
When it comes to taxing businesses, the United States is leading the world, according to Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos.

As he looks to unseat Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez this November, Kyrillos has refused to sign an anti-tax pledge, but maintained in an Aug. 20 interview on WOR-AM that he’s looking to lower tax rates.

""We've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world, in the world,"" said Kyrillos, a state senator representing Monmouth County. ""So, I’m about reducing tax rates.""

As far as the corporate tax rates on the books, Kyrillos’ claim is on the money. However, when you factor in various tax breaks, the rate actually paid by U.S. businesses has been among the highest in the world, but not in first place, studies show.

For this fact-check, we’re focusing on two different types of corporate tax rates: statutory and effective rates.

To back up Kyrillos’ claim, a spokeswoman pointed to the top statutory corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent in the United States. That figure represents a combination of federal, state and local tax rates imposed by law before any tax breaks.

Once Japan reduced its combined corporate tax rate in April, the U.S. rate became the highest among industrialized nations, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group.

So, Kyrillos’ claim about a first-place finish is on target in terms of statutory rates.

But the United States does not necessarily lead the world when you consider the effective tax rates paid by U.S. businesses. Due to various tax breaks, those rates are typically lower than the top statutory rate.

In a September 2011 report, the Tax Foundation summarized the findings of the latest 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world. Due to different methodologies, those studies determined U.S. effective tax rates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, according to the report.

The United States did not rank first in any of those studies, but in 10 of them, U.S. effective rates ranked among the top five highest for the countries analyzed, the report states. However, the effective rate in Japan will likely drop, possibly moving the United States to the top spot in future studies.

Apart from that Tax Foundation report, it’s worth noting that a separate analysis found thirty Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes over the 2008-2010 period. That study was done by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

So, what’s the better measure -- statutory or effective rates?

According to Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge, statutory rates make for better comparisons. Effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries, but the statutory rates are fixed, Hodge told us.

""(The effective tax rate) will differ from industry to industry and business to business, whereas the list price is what it is and everyone starts at that point,"" Hodge said.

But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, argued that ""effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens."" 
Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, added in an e-mail that ""both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax.""

 Our ruling

In a radio interview, Kyrillos claimed, ""We've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world.""

It’s accurate that, at 39.2 percent, the United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. But with various tax breaks, U.S. effective corporate tax rates range anywhere from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, studies show.

Those effective tax rates may not land in first place, but they’re still among the highest in the world.

"['Workers', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says the state government workforce grew when Tim Kaine was governor
","
Republican Senate candidate George Allen scoffed when his Democratic rival Tim Kaine said in a July debate that he undertook a series of budget cuts as governor.

""You talk about budget cuts,"" Allen said to Kaine during a July 21 debate at Hot Springs. ""But Virginia, at the end of your term, had a larger state workforce than at the beginning of your term.""

Politifact Virginia previously checked a claim from Allen that the state workforce declined substantially while he was governor from 1994 to 1998 and rated it Mostly True.

We wondered if it was true that Virginia’s workforce saw a net increase while Kaine was governor.

The Allen campaign, on its website, backs Allen’s claim by pointing to U.S. census tables showing the full-time equivalent employment for Virginia’s state government. Those tables show that from March 2006 to March 2010, the number of full-time-equivalents rose from 122,634 to 124,709.

But those census tables only look at a state’s employment levels as of March of each year.

Kaine was sworn into office on Jan. 14, 2006, and left office on Jan. 15, 2010. So Allen’s campaign is looking at a time period that starts about two months after Kaine was inaugurated and ends two months after Kaine left office.

The census numbers also include jobs in the judicial branch of government, over which a governor has limited control.

Seeking tallies more closely aligned with Kaine’s tenure and control, we turned to the website for the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management, the agency that keeps tabs on the size of the state workforce.

Anne Waring, a DHRM spokeswoman, said the department does not keep records of the workforce size on every single day. But the agency does count the size of the state’s staff as of the last day of every month.

As in our previous story about Allen, we examined tallies of full-time equivalent workers in the executive branch, since that’s the part of the bureaucracy employs about 96 of workers and  over which the governor has the most control.

There are two logical points to start counting. One is to compare the size of the workforce on Dec. 31, 2005 -- two weeks before Kaine took office -- and compare that to Dec. 31, 2009, two weeks before Kaine left office.

Between those dates, the total number of full-time-equivalent employees in the executive branch fell from 116,334 to 113,425. That’s a drop of about 2,909, or 2.5 percent. By this measure, Allen’s statement is wrong.

But since Kaine was inaugurated in the middle of January, we also looked at figures from Jan. 31, 2006, to Jan. 31, 2010. Between those dates, the number of workers rose from 111,917 to 112,212 -- an increase of 295 employees, or one-fourth of 1 percent. That makes Allen’s statement right, but not by much.  

One reason the shift in the number of employees is so dramatic is because between the end of December 2005 and the end of January 2006, the number of temporary workers -- those paid on an hourly basis -- fell from 19,579 to 15,060. Waring explained that temporary employees at colleges and universities who were counted in December were on winter break in January and, therefore, not counted as working that month.

Finally, we looked the DHRM numbers from March in 2006 and 2010 to see if they showed an increase in state employment that was similar to the census figures cited by Allen for those two months. They did not.

The census figures Allen uses show Virginia’s payroll increased by 2,175 employees from March 2006 to March 2010. DHRM data shows a decrease of 828 full-time equivalent workers in the executive branch over the four-year span.

Our ruling

Allen said the state workforce expanded during Kaine’s governorship. But there are no records that tabulate the number of executive branch employees on the mid-January day when Kaine took office in 2006 and the day he left four years later. Allen backs his claim by using U.S. Census data that only allows a comparison of numbers in March 2006 -- two months after Kaine entered office -- to March 2010 -- two months after Kaine left.

The Census data also includes workers in the judicial and legislative branches, over which a governor has limited control.

Better information is available from Virginia’s government, which counts the number of state employees at the end of every month. Determining the increase or decrease in the workforce under Kaine depends on when you start counting.

If you compare Dec. 31 figures from 2005 to 2009, the executive workforce -- controlled by the governor -- dropped by 2,909 full-time equivalents. The decrease appears largely because of the number of temporary employees on Virginia’s payroll at the close of 2005. If you compare Jan. 31 figures from 2006 to 2010, the state staff increased by 295.

Contrary to the Census numbers cited by Allen, state records show that the bureaucracy under the governor’s control shrank by 828 full-time equivalents between March 2006 and March 2010.

So Allen’s information does not come from the best source: The state government. Using state numbers, Allen is barely right by one measure and wrong by two others.

Allen’s statement, while containing an element of truth, ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/27/george-allen/george-allen-says-state-government-workforce-grew-/

On eve of GOP convention, McDonnell says Romney leading Obama by 10 points among independents
","
Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s surprise endorsement of President Barack Obama came with a warning for the Republican Party.

Crist, who was elected governor as a Republican and then ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate as an independent, penned an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times that told arriving Republican National Convention delegates that an element of the GOP had veered too far to the right on women’s issues, immigration, seniors and students. 

ABC’s This Week host George Stephanopoulos used Crist's endorsement to press Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, chairman of the Republican party’s platform committee, to respond to the charge. 

McDonnell replied that Crist was ""wrong on the platform. He also missed the point. What matters is getting the nation back on track, the federal government out of debt, and jobs for the American people. 

""So on the things that really matter to voters, George, I think the records are stark, and I think that's why independent voters have a 10-point margin in favor of Mitt Romney right now,"" McDonnell said. 

Romney is ahead by 10 points among independents? We looked at the most recent national polls to find out if that was correct.

We found that while national polls showed Romney leading Obama among independent voters, the Republican’s advantage varied from a few points to 11 points. 
  

It’s worth nothing that Obama was ahead among independents in the days before Romney chose U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice presidential pick. CNN and Fox polls showed that about three weeks ago, Obama was ahead by 11 percent. 

We also took a look at recent polls in three key battleground states. 

A Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Thursday showed that Romney was ahead 48 percent to 44 percent among independents in Florida. This was within the poll’s margin of error. 

That same poll in Ohio showed Romney was ahead of independents 48 percent to 43 percent in Ohio.

In Virginia, data from the firm Public Policy Polling showed Romney with a 46 to 43 lead among independents.

Romney ad says Obama attacked McCain on Medicare in ‘08
","
As the presidential campaigns trade attacks about Medicare, a new TV ad from Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of hypocrisy.

The ad says that in 2008, Obama attacked his opponent, U.S. Sen. John McCain, for wanting to cut Medicare -- and then did so himself to to pay for Obamacare.

The ad uses a clip of Obama speaking at a campaign rally in October 2008.

""Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth,"" Obama says from a podium.

The ad then says Obama ""cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare"" -- a claim PolitiFact previously rated Half True -- and concludes with another clip of Obama saying ""it ain’t right.""

""No, Mr. President,"" the announcer says, ""it ain't right.""

Here, we’ll rewind to 2008 to see how candidate Obama handled the delicate topic of Medicare. It turns out we fact-checked Obama's claim back then.

Rallying voters in Virginia

We went back to a transcript of the 2008 event to make sure Obama's comments were not taken out of context. Speaking before a crowd of more than 8,000 on Oct. 17, 2008, Obama unloaded on McCain’s Medicare proposal, according to a transcript of the event:

""It turns out, Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth, $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care, to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall.

""Now, this should come as no surprise. It's entirely consistent with Sen. McCain's record during his 26 years in Congress, where time and again he's opposed Medicare. In fact, Sen. McCain has voted against protecting Medicare 40 times -- 40 times, he's failed to stand up for Medicare.

""So what would Sen. McCain's cuts mean for Medicare, at a time when more and more Americans are relying on it? It would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year.

""If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to get care and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs. You'll receive fewer services. You'll get lower-quality care.

""I don't think that's right. In fact, it ain't right. (Cheers.) When you've worked hard your whole life and pay into the system and done everything right, you shouldn't have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it.""

An ad, and ensuing criticism

Back in 2008, the Obama campaign released a television ad making the same basic claim.

""How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?"" the announcer said in the 2008 ad. ""His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion. That means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays. More expensive prescription drugs. Nursing home care could suffer. ... After a lifetime of work, seniors' health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan? It's not the change we need.""

PolitiFact examined the claim from Obama’s speech about McCain’s Medicare plan and rated it False.

""McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps,"" we wrote.

While not the same in every detail, McCain’s ideas for cost savings sound an awful lot like the ones Obama has pursued as president.

The New York Times was similarly critical of the 2008 ad, saying it  ""does mischaracterize Mr. McCain's plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back-of-the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group.""

Our ruling

Romney’s new ad says ""candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare.""

Tommy Thompson says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin wants to go ""far beyond 'Obamacare'""
","
A day after winning the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson used health care to contrast himself with his opponent in the general election, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison.

In the Aug. 15, 2012 interview with Vicki McKenna, a conservative radio talk show host based at WIBA-AM (1310) in Madison, Thompson declared:   

""Tammy Baldwin, who is a nice lady, but believes philosophically that she wants a health care system that is completely government controlled. She did not think 'Obamacare' went far enough. She was far beyond 'Obamacare.' She wants a Medicare system for all, in which the government makes all the decisions for your health care system.""

We rated Mostly True a Thompson claim that Baldwin is the most liberal member of the House. But with polls indicating most Americans want to repeal Obama’s federal health reform law, does Baldwin really want to go further? To a ""completely government-controlled"" health care system that provides Medicare not only for people over 65 but for everyone?

Health reform terms

As we begin, it’s important to look at key terms connected to health care reform and Obama’s reform law.

These definitions are from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent organization that analyzes the health care system.

Universal care: A system that provides health coverage to all people through measures such as an individual mandate or a single-payer system.

Individual mandate: A requirement that all individuals obtain health insurance.

Single-payer: A health care system in which the government pays for health care services, but is not involved in the delivery of health care.

Public option: An insurance plan administered and funded by the government that would be offered along with private insurance plans.

Obama’s health reform law

The health reform that Obama signed into law in 2010 law significantly increases government regulation of health insurers and includes an individual mandate for nearly all Americans.

(During the primary campaign we rated False a claim by Thompson, who supports repealing Obama’s reform law, that he never supported a mandate.)

Under the reform law, as PolitiFact National has reported, employers will continue providing health insurance to most Americans and, overall, more people will get private health coverage. And it goes without saying that the reform law doesn’t take the European approach, where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees; nor the Canadian universal-single payer approach, in which no private insurance is allowed.

Baldwin’s position

Now, let’s look at Baldwin, who was elected to the House in 1998, and see how she stands on these key points:

Universal care: Baldwin has long advocated providing health insurance for everyone.

In 1999, Baldwin spoke at a Washington, D.C. rally for the ""Universal Health Care 2000 (U2K)"" movement. In a news release about the event, she said she was one of the few politicians who ran for office in 1998 ""who dared to make ‘health care for all’ the focus of her campaign for Congress.""

Baldwin also announced that Wisconsin could be one of 10 states to receive grants to develop suggestions for a ""federal-state partnership to provide health coverage for all of their citizens.""

(Interestingly, the announcement was made with Thompson at the governor’s office in Madison, the release said.)

In 2000, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, which would have required states to provide universal coverage. The bill died without a House vote, as it did Baldwin after reintroduced it in 2002, 2004 and 2005.

Single-payer: Baldwin tried to get the government more involved in health care by making it the sole payer of health care services.

In 2009, on the day the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted for Obama’s reform law, Baldwin said: ""I am one of the members of this committee who believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system.""

That version of Obama’s measure didn’t include the single-payer element, but Baldwin said she had ""played a role in securing a commitment that a single-payer health care alternative will receive consideration by the full House of Representatives.""

So, in pushing single-payer, Baldwin would go beyond Obama’s law.

Public option: Baldwin advocates for the federal government offering health insurance along with private insurers.

Baldwin said she hoped a public option in Obama’s law would lead to single-payer. The version of Obama’s measure that Baldwin voted for in 2009 included the public option, but the final version did not.

Baldwin continues to advocate for going further than the Obama reform law does. On her official House website, Baldwin says her ""driving motivation in politics is to pass legislation that will guarantee health care for all in America."" She also says that the reform law ""is not perfect, and I will continue to work to improve it as it is phased in over the next four years. In particular, I strongly believe that allowing Americans the choice of a public option is essential.""

Now, to the third part of Thompson’s claim, that Baldwin supports ""Medicare for all.""

Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out that Baldwin was one of several dozen co-sponsors of the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, which has been introduced several times during her tenure. It would have provided universal care by creating a national health insurance program and prohibiting private insurers from selling coverage that duplicates benefits in the program.

Susan Giaimo, a visiting political science professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, whose specialties include health care politics and policy, told us the government would have had a lot of clout in negotiating prices with health care providers under the bill. It’s not clear whether ""Medicare for all"" would get rid of private health insurance, but private health care providers would remain, she said. And it doesn’t go as far as the British model of ""socialized medicine,"" with the government owning hospitals and employing the health care workers, she said.  

A final note:

Thompson and other Republicans like to cite a clip from a speech Baldwin made at a September 2010 political rally in which she said, chuckling: ""I actually was for a government takeover of medicine. I was for a single-payer plan.""

Baldwin actually was criticizing those who called Obama’s reform law a ""government takeover"" (which PolitiFact chose as its lie of the year for 2010). But she did go on to say she wanted to go further than the reform law does: ""I was for a single-payer plan and that isn’t, as we know, what we ended up with, but I also think what we ended up with was incredible progress for the American people.""

Our rating

Thompson said Baldwin wants a ""completely government-controlled"" health care system that goes ""far beyond 'Obamacare'"" and is ""a Medicare system for all.""

Baldwin hasn’t hasn’t advocated for socialized medicine. But she has pushed ""Medicare for all"" legislation and she supports single payer and the public option, government elements that go beyond Obama’s reform law.

The economy, he said, was ""dead in the water when we got here. Virtually no jobs created."" The White House told PolitiFact that by the end of the Trump administration, job creation had stalled out, and President Joe Biden's pandemic and economic recovery bill, the American Rescue Plan, accelerated economic expansion. Still, Klain’s framing was a significant exaggeration of reality. The Biden administration has some justification for being pleased with its job-creation record. In the 15 months since Biden took office, month-over-month job gains have exceeded 424,000 in 14 of those months. (The only exception was in April 2021, when job gains totaled 263,000.)  Those gains have brought the national employment level to just under 99% of what it was just before the pandemic hit. But the gains in employment didn’t turn on a dime when President Donald Trump left office and Biden took over. The recovery began under Trump.   In December 2020, the final full month before Biden took office, the employment level fell by 115,000, which has been the only absolute loss of jobs since April 2020, when the nation was suddenly plunged into lockdowns. But that month is unrepresentative of the final months of Trump’s presidency. The final three months under Trump prior to that December loss produced gains of 919,000, 647,000, and 333,000 jobs, respectively. Those gains are substantial, not ""virtually no jobs created."" Another key metric of economic health, gains in gross domestic product, also began their upswing before Biden took office.   Even setting aside the 33.8% increase in the third quarter of 2020, which was basically a reversal of the sudden -31.2% shrinkage the previous quarter, the fourth quarter of 2020, which came during Trump’s tenure, produced 4.5% growth. Klain said the economy was ""dead in the water when we got here. Virtually no jobs created."" The job creation record under Biden has been impressive, exceeding 424,000 in 14 out of the 15 months he’s been in office. However, the economy didn’t turn suddenly when he took office; it was already improving during the final months of Trump’s tenure.  While Trump’s last full month in office, December 2020, produced a loss in employment by 115,000, that was the exception. The final three months under Trump prior to that December loss produced job gains of 919,000, 647,000, and 333,000, respectively. Those gains are substantial, not ""virtually no jobs created.""

Neither is an exact figure; these estimates are based on people’s answers to survey questions. But since Gibbons name checked the Census Bureau, it’s worth noting that, according to the bureau, there were at least 13 million more registered voters than people who voted. That’s the opposite of what Gibbons asserted as fact. Gibbons spoke as if the Census Bureau was the gold standard for election results. But data collected from the states gives a more accurate picture of the number of registered voters and the number of ballots cast. In its latest report to Congress, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission said numbers sent to them by state election officials showed there were 209,441,338 active registered voters in 2020, more than the Census Bureau found. ""Active"" registered voters includes people who meet every requirement to walk into a polling station and cast a ballot. Finding that number nationwide isn’t as simple as it might seem. Not every state automatically reports the distinction between people who have voted recently and those who haven’t in a long time and need to reconfirm their address and voting status before they can vote. University of Georgia political scientist Trey Hood said there can be other complications in working with state data. ""Some states have same-day registration during early voting, or Election-Day registration,"" Hood said. ""Some of these figures may not get lumped in with existing registrants, depending on how the state records these statistics."" The commission’s questionnaire to state election officials aimed to cut through the clutter and capture the truest estimate of the people ready and eligible to vote. As for how many actually voted, the commission reported 161,303,109 ballots cast. There are other wrinkles to the data. Not every ballot included a vote for president. University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald estimated that the figure for the presidential election could be closer to 158,407,000.  Readers might find other numbers, based on earlier reporting and preliminary statistics, but in every case, the number of people who voted is many millions less than the number of people registered to vote. Based on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s work, there were about 48 million fewer votes cast than the number of registered voters, meaning than in total, Gibbons was off by about 53 million. Gibbons said that according to the Census Bureau, ""5 million more people voted than were registered to vote"" in the 2020 election. Contrary to what Gibbons said, the Census Bureau estimated that 13 million fewer people voted than were registered to vote. That was based on statistical sampling in a survey.  The U.S. Election Commission worked directly with state election officials and found that 43 million fewer people voted than were registered to vote. That report came out last year. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2022/apr/04/mike-gibbons/ohio-gop-candidate-falsely-says-more-votes-registe/

NC Democrat falsely claims Republican Richard Hudson opposed insulin price cap
","With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isn’t doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the state’s newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where he’ll face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clark’s campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: ""Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO."" Clark’s campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he ""voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District."" What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldn’t help the uninsured, the Associated Press reported. The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans — and congressional records show Hudson was one of them. Several media outlets — including Business Insider, the Daily Mail and Yahoo! News — named Hudson among the bill’s Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clark’s campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudson’s vote. The campaign, which deleted its tweet about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasn’t issued a correction to its email. ""We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times,"" the campaign said. ""After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center."" We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didn’t receive a response. Hudson’s office said the congressman’s March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudson’s advisors, said Hudson co-sponsored the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for some Medicare customers. ""Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didn’t change his vote,"" Shaw said.  Clark said: ""Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.""

Both parties’ tax proposals exaggerated in Facebook post
","A liberal group’s Facebook post comparing tax plans from Democrats and Republicans exaggerated the proposed changes and lacked important context about both policies. The March 30 Facebook post claimed that a Democratic proposal would ""tax billionaires to lower the deficit by $1 TRILLION and fund clean energy independence,"" while a Republican-backed plan would ""raise taxes on households earning less than $50,000 by an ADDITIONAL $4,500 after CUTTING taxes for the rich."" The post instructed viewers to ""vote accordingly."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The ""Democrat’s plan"" mentioned in the claim points to parts of President Joe Biden’s proposed budget for 2023. The ""Republican’s plan"" appears to be a reference to an 11-point proposal Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., released in February. Let’s dive into both. The description of Biden’s budget proposal overstated the impact a higher tax on wealthy individuals would have on the country’s deficit. It also lacked broader context about how much debt the U.S. would still accrue, even after factoring in this tax revenue. While it’s true that billionaires would be subjected to higher taxes under Biden’s proposed budget, so would some millionaires. The name of the tax itself, the ""Billionaire Minimum Income Tax,"" is misleading since it would impose a tax on all households worth more than $100 million. Under this rule, wealthy individuals would pay a tax rate of at least 20% of their income, including any unrealized capital gains, such as stocks. If approved, this tax would impact about 20,000 households, or less than 0.01% of the country’s population, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Most of the people impacted would be multimillionaires. There are roughly 700 billionaires in the U.S. The Biden administration estimated this tax would generate $360 billion in revenue over the next decade — not the full $1 trillion that the claim suggested. The rest would be made up by other measures in Biden’s budget proposal, but that, too, lacks detail. ""That overall budget includes a lot of blanks right now. There's a big kind of magic asterisk in this budget,"" Gleckman said. One missing piece in Biden’s budget is any effect of Build Back Better legislation, a domestic spending package of Biden priorities that remains stalled in Congress. It’s not clear how much spending will be included in these bills, how Congress will pay for it, and what the effect on the deficit would be. ""Without knowing that, this budget doesn't really lower the deficit by $1 trillion. It aspires to it, but it doesn't do it,"" Gleckman said. The deficit is the difference between what the U.S. takes in and spends each year. Even when accounting for this $1 trillion in net deficit cuts, the country’s debt is still expected to go up by $14.4 trillion over the next 10 years. Biden’s budget shows the U.S. spending $72.7 trillion over the next decade, while bringing in $58.3 trillion in tax and other revenue. Clean energy initiatives are a big focus of Biden’s budget, as the claim said. The plan sets aside $45 billion for the federal government to address climate change, including $90 million to modernize the country’s electrical grid and $502 million to weatherize and retrofit low-income housing, among other initiatives. In February, Scott put forth a proposed agenda if the GOP were to win the majority in Congress after the midterms. Scott is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. One part of the agenda opines that all Americans should pay income tax. ""All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount. Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax,"" Scott’s plan states. So far, Scott’s wish has found many attacks and few takers. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the notion of new taxes in light of Scott’s comment. Some Americans don’t owe any federal income tax because they don’t earn enough money to have income tax liability and they may receive tax credits. The share of people who did not pay income tax increased during the pandemic to 61%, up from 40% in 2019. This percentage dropped to 57% last year and is expected to continue to decrease to about 42% in 2022, according to the Tax Policy Center. Scott’s plan does not provide any details as to how much Americans who don’t pay income taxes would be taxed under his outline, so the $4,500 is rather baseless. The Tax Policy Center conducted an analysis to estimate how much people who don’t currently pay income tax would owe under Scott’s proposal. Hypothetically, every household would owe at least $100 in income tax, no matter how much they earned. Creating a minimum income tax for all Americans would eliminate tax credits and lower the standard deduction for low- and middle-income earners. In this model, households earning less than $27,000 a year would pay an average of $1,000 more a year in taxes. This estimate is much lower than the $4,500 amount asserted in the claim. The part of the claim that says this tax increase would occur ""after cutting taxes for the rich"" presumably is a reference to the GOP’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This legislation cut taxes for most Americans, not just wealthy individuals. A Facebook post claimed that the Democrats’ proposal would ""tax billionaires to lower the deficit by $1 TRILLION and fund clean energy independence,"" while the Republicans’ plan would ""raise taxes on households earning less than $50,000 by an ADDITIONAL $4,500 after CUTTING taxes for the rich."" The claim exaggerated what both the Democratic proposal and the Republican plan would do, if implemented. It also left out broader context about the initiatives and who proposed them.

In Ohio US Senate race, Mandel falsely claimed that Gibbons said military service isn’t ‘real work’
","Josh Mandel and Mike Gibbons, two of the Republicans running for U.S. Senate in Ohio, nearly got physical at one point during a debate.  Mandel, a former Marine, former state lawmaker and former state treasurer, capitalized on the testy exchange by producing an attack ad against Gibbons, a businessman.  The TV spot features Ohio resident Sheila Nowacki, the mother of a marine killed in Iraq in 2005. She opens the ad by saying:  ""Mike Gibbons has the nerve to say military service doesn’t count as real work."" That’s not what Gibbons said in the debate. Mandel’s campaign told PolitiFact it did not want to comment on its ad. In searches of Google and Nexis, a database for news and other information sources, we found no instances of Gibbons saying that military service doesn’t count as real work.   News video of the March 18 debate, which also included the other three major GOP candidates, shows that Mandel criticized Gibbons’ business deals. He then sat down, and Gibbons was asked if he wanted to rebut.  After Gibbons rose, Mandel continued his criticism, and Gibbons objected to Mandel’s characterizations of his business deals. Seconds later, the two were standing toe to toe and this exchange occurred: Gibbons: ""You may not understand this because you’ve never been in the private sector.""  Mandel: ""I understand it."" Gibbons: ""No, you don’t. Mandel: ""I do."" Gibbons: ""You’ve never been in the private sector in your entire life."" Mandel: ""I worked, sir."" Gibbons: ""You don’t know squat.""  Mandel: ""Two tours in Iraq. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked."" Gibbons: ""You don’t know squat. You don’t know squat."" Mandel: ""Two tours in Iraq. Don’t tell me I haven’t worked.""  Gibbons: ""Back off, buddy, or you’re going to end up —  Mandel: ""You back off."" After some crosstalk, the exchange ends with: Gibbons: ""You’re dealing with the wrong dude."" Mandel: ""No, you’re dealing with the wrong guy. You watch what happens. You watch what happens."" USA Freedom Fund, a super PAC formed to support Mandel’s campaign, followed up with a similar attack on Gibbons in its own ad. Gibbons, whose son is a Navy pilot, then responded with an ad of his own, saying Mandel is ""lying"" in claiming that Gibbons doesn’t respect military service. While Mandel’s employment has largely been in the public sector, he has earned large sums as a member of corporate boards and by joining startups, the Columbus Dispatch reported in August 2021.  The Dispatch reported that Mandel earned less than some of his opponents in the Senate race, but campaign disclosures showed ""the business dealings of a man accustomed to public life who suddenly — and quietly — started to make his way in the private sector."" The Ohio Senate seat is opening because the incumbent, Republican Rob Portman, is not seeking reelection. Both the GOP and the Democratic Senate primaries, to be held May 3, are contested. Besides Mandel and Gibbons, the Republican candidates include Ohio state Sen. Matt Dolan,  former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance. The leading Democratic candidates are U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. Overall, the Ohio race is rated variously by campaign watchers as ""lean"" Republican, ""likely"" Republican and ""solid"" Republican. Mandel claimed in an ad that Gibbons said ""military service doesn't count as real work.""  Gibbons said in a debate that Mandel has never worked in the private sector; he didn’t say what this ad claims.

Ad claiming Evers tried to ‘make us pay even more at the pump’ is running on half tank
","Drivers are taking a hit to the wallet as world events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, are causing crude oil prices to increase, sending gasoline prices to record-breaking levels. During the week of March 7, 2022, the average national gas price hit $4.104 per gallon according to GasBuddy.com. The previous all-time high was set in 2008 at $4.103 per gallon. Since then, prices have nudged downward, with GasBuddy reporting $3.69 to $3.79 per gallon in Milwaukee, Franklin, Wauwatosa and Waukesha and $3.85 in Lannon on April 1. In the midst of that, an affiliate of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) – the WMC Issues Mobilization Council – released a TV ad that slammed Gov. Tony Evers’ economic record.  Among the claims in the ad: Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax."" Is the group right? When asked for backup or the claim, Nick Novak, WMC’s vice president of communications and marketing, pointed to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s summary of Evers’ proposed 2019-21 budget.  On page 406, under the heading ""Motor Vehicle Fuel Tax Rate Increase,"" is the following:  ""Increase the motor vehicle fuel tax rate (gasoline, gasoline blended with ethanol, and diesel) by eight cents per gallon resulting in a rate of 38.9 cents per gallon, effective October 1, 2019. The current motor vehicle fuel tax rate has been in effect since April 1, 2006, when the final annual indexing adjustment increased the rate to the current 30.9 cents per gallon rate.""  In other words, the gas tax would be increased and – in the future – be tied and rise automatically with the rate of inflation. That’s what’s meant by indexing. For instance, the fiscal bureau estimated the gas tax under the plan would rise to 39.7 cents in April 2020 and 40.5 cents in April 2021. These increases would have cost Wisconsinites $41.6 million over the 2019-21 budget period. (A more recent memo from the bureau, dated March 31, 2022, estimated that the indexing would have brought the total to 42.0 cents per gallon on April 1, 2022. ) So, Evers definitely pushed a gas tax increase. But that’s only part of the picture. When the increase was proposed – with the money it generated to go toward increased transportation funding – Evers also proposed eliminating the state’s longstanding minimum markup law for gasoline. The minimum markup law was created during the Great Depression to protect small business from larger rivals. The law mandates a price floor where goods like gas, groceries, and beer are ""marked up"" so they are not used as ""loss leaders"" at a price level where the other businesses can’t compete.  The state Department of Administration – overseen by Evers – said repealing the minimum markup law (which it labeled a ""hidden tax"") would save up to 14-cents per gallon. In other words, the Evers plan would have resulted in a net reduction for drivers at the pump of 6 cents per gallon. (From that perspective, even with rises tied to indexing in the subsequent years, based on the new fiscal bureau memo there would still be a per-gallon savings – though, of course, this is taking a narrow look at the gas tax, not overall economic matters that would affect price.) At  the time, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative law firm, in an analysis of the Evers proposal noted elimination of the minimum markup law ""could immediately put more money back into the pockets of hard-working Wisconsinites all over the state"" but argued it ""should be fully repealed – not just for gasoline – and it should not be contingent on a tax increase.""  The idea from Evers was not entirely new. Republican lawmakers floated a similar plan in 2017 that would have raised the gas tax while curbing the minimum markup law, but the idea flopped when then-Gov. Scott Walker said he would not back it.  This time, the GOP-held Legislature ultimately rejected Evers’ proposal and instead raised the title fee paid when vehicles are purchased by 137%, from $69.50 to $164.50. They also raised annual vehicle registration fees by $10, from $75 to $85. In any case, all of that goes against the idea that the primary aim of Evers’ plan was to simply raise the gas tax Kayla Anderson, an Evers campaign spokeswoman, said the governor ""was intentionally trying to ensure consumers would pay less at the pump, not more, by repealing the state's minimum markup law. Studies from both sides of the aisle have shown that the minimum markup law results in higher prices for consumers."" That’s fair, to a point.  But Novak, the WMC spokesman, noted ""even the Legislative Fiscal Bureau explained at the time that there may not be a change in the retail price of fuel by repealing the minimum markup law."" Indeed, a March 2019 summary of the governor’s 2019-21 budget from the fiscal bureau said: ""Changes in retail fuel prices as a result of the provision, if any, would be subject to a variety of market and competitive factors, which are assumed to exert considerable influence on final retail prices independent of the statutory markup."" A WMC Issues Mobilization Council ad claimed Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump by hiking the gas tax."" In his first budget, the governor did propose an increase in the gas tax. But the ad ignores what was coupled with it: A move to eliminate the state’s ""minimum markup"" law as it relates to gasoline, which Evers and his office argued would be a net reduction for drivers.  The inclusion of the elimination of the minimum markup law for gasoline in the plan undermines the idea that Evers was trying to make consumers pay more. At the same time, it was – and remains – far from clear that the elimination would reduce prices in the long run. And we have already seen, with inflation, that much of that initial savings would already have been eaten up. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. ",/factchecks/2022/apr/01/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/ad-claiming-evers-tried-make-us-pay-even-more-pump/

Social media post makes inaccurate comparison between antigens in vaccines, food allergies
","The process of introducing solid foods to a baby can be messy, entertaining and, as any parent who has been through that process knows, deliberate. Cereals should be fortified with vitamins, doctors say. Fruits and vegetables should be introduced gradually, one ingredient at a time. So, with all that careful planning about food for the baby’s health, how is it that health officials seem to believe vaccines for infants are ok? That’s the conundrum one widely shared Facebook post raised — but we found its assumption is based on unfounded claims about infants’ immune systems ability to handle ingredients in childhood vaccines.  ""If you think a baby’s immune system can safely handle 8 different antigens (toxins, bacteria, DNA) in 1 day but when introducing food they should be fed 1 by 1 to catch an allergic reaction, you might be brainwashed,"" read the March 23 post.   It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it gives an inaccurate representation of vaccine safety.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends several vaccines for children before their first birthday in order to strengthen their immune systems against serious diseases,  including Hepatitis B, rotavirus, and diphtheria. Vaccines given to babies do not overload their immune systems, according to the CDC.  Vaccines use small amounts of antigens, or parts of germs, to help babies recognize and learn to fight diseases. Babies encounter many more antigens in their environment every day than they do when they are vaccinated, the federal public health agency says. Thirty years ago, vaccines used 3,000 antigens to protect against eight diseases by age two. Now, children up to age two receive vaccines that use 305 antigens to protect against 14 diseases, according to the CDC.   It’s unclear what’s the basis for the post’s claim that there are ""8 antigens"" in childhood vaccines. We spoke with Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and he also doesn’t know where that number comes from. Overall, he said doctors have 200 years of experience with vaccines, and have evidence of their safety and efficacy. Rarely, about one out of two million children, have an immediate reaction to gelatin, which is used as a stabilizer in vaccines. In the flu vaccine, there is a very small amount of egg protein, but the amount is too small to cause an allergic reaction, even in people with severe allergies, Offit said.  The CDC recommends that when people with severe egg allergies are vaccinated against influenza or yellow fever (which is recommended for some travelers), they do so in a medical setting where they can be monitored in case of any reaction.  The Facebook post suggested that vaccines are not safe because they have toxins, bacteria and DNA. Vaccines can contain viral and bacterial proteins. They can also have toxins in very small amounts. But these are not harmful. Even though fetal cells are used to grow vaccine viruses, vaccines do not contain these cells or pieces of DNA that are recognizable as human DNA, according to information published by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. These vaccines, for varicella, or chickenpox, rubella, and hepatitis A, are administered after the first birthday.  Regarding the introduction of new foods to babies in order to test for an allergic reaction, Offit said that those allergens are in much greater quantities in food, even if you’re feeding very small amounts. The CDC recommends introducing one single-ingredient food to a baby at a time, to see if the baby has an allergic reaction. Caregivers should wait three to five days before introducing each new food. Foods such as eggs, peanuts, yogurt made with cow’s milk, and shellfish can cause an allergic reaction.  A Facebook post implies that a baby’s immune system can’t handle antigens from vaccines, because new food must be introduced slowly to identify allergic reactions.  There are antigens in vaccines, but they are in very small amounts, less than what a baby encounters in their daily environments, according to the CDC.  Allergens in food are present in greater quantities, even in small portions, leading to recommendations that babies try new foods slowly, to test for any allergic reaction. The post’s comparison is not adequate, and the premise that vaccines are not safe due to antigens is wrong. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2022/apr/01/facebook-posts/social-media-post-makes-inaccurate-comparison-betw/

Donald Trump wrong that Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been ‘mostly empty’ for decades
","Facing record-high gas prices and volatile conditions in the international oil market, President Joe Biden announced the largest release from the nation’s oil stockpiles since they were created almost five decades ago. On March 31, Biden said he would order the release of about 1 million additional barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve every day for six months. It was unclear whether this would be enough to lower U.S. gasoline prices, especially if other overseas producers lower their production to cancel out the additional oil, thus keeping supply the same and prices high. But Biden’s presidential predecessor, Donald Trump, issued a statement critical of the move. ""So after 50 years of being virtually empty, I built up our oil reserves during my administration, and low energy prices, to 100% full,"" Trump said. ""It’s called the Strategic National Reserves, and it hasn’t been full for many decades. In fact, it’s been mostly empty."" Federal data and energy experts made clear that Trump is wrong on several counts, most notably in the assertion that the stockpile has been ""mostly empty"" for decades. ""I'm not sure there's anything in that quote that makes any sense at all,"" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Trump’s press office did not respond to an inquiry. For starters, Trump got the stockpile’s name slightly wrong: It's the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The reserve dates from OPEC’s oil embargo in 1973 and 1974, when an oil price shock battered the U.S. economy. It was designed to protect the country from the effects of a severe energy supply interruption, according to the Congressional Research Service. The reserve has a capacity of more than 700 million barrels, stored in underground geological formations known as salt domes. The reserve encompasses four sites, two each in Louisiana and Texas. The stockpile’s holdings can be drawn down by about 4.4 million barrels a day. The reserve stores crude oil rather than gasoline, partly because crude oil is more stable. So any oil that’s released must be refined before coming to market. It takes about two weeks for a new release from the reserve to enter the market. (Once the oil price declines, the U.S. can purchase additional oil to replenish the reserve.) Biden tried a smaller version of this tactic several months ago. On Nov. 23, 2021, Biden ordered the release of some 50 million barrels of oil from the reserve, or roughly two and a half days of U.S. demand. It was only the fourth time a president had done so. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush released reserves as the Persian Gulf War threatened the international oil market. In 2005, President George W. Bush did it after Hurricane Katrina destroyed oil infrastructure on the Gulf coast. And in 2011, President Barack Obama did it during the civil war in Libya, which prompted concerns about international supply disruptions.  But last November’s release didn’t move gas prices in the U.S. significantly, in part because six weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine, and as a protest, some Western nations, including the U.S., sought to cut back on buying Russian oil. So in March, prices at the pump in the U.S. began setting new records, setting the stage for Biden’s latest move. It’s wrong for Trump to say the stockpile has been ""mostly empty"" for decades. Since 1987, about a decade after the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began accepting crude oil, the amount stored has not dropped below 540 million barrels by the end of the calendar year. And most of the time, it was well above that.   Between 2003 and 2020, the level in the stockpile ranged from a low of 634 million barrels to a high of 726 million barrels. While the maximum capacity of the reserve varied somewhat over that period, that represented a big percentage of the stockpile’s maximum capacity. For instance, in December 2009, the reserve was 100% filled, with 727 million barrels. By the time Trump took office in January 2017, the reserve was in excess of 90% full. The current capacity is slightly lower than its 2009 high; at the end of 2021, the stockpile was roughly 82% full. Meanwhile, contrary to what Trump said, the stockpile was never completely full while he was in office. Between the end of 2016 and the end of 2020, roughly when Trump was in office, the level of oil in the reserve fell from 695 million barrels to 638 million barrels, a decrease of about 8%. And by the time Trump left office, the stockpile was about 89% full, not 100% full. The decline on Trump’s watch stemmed from lower-profile reasons, notably sales of crude in the stockpile to capitalize on high oil prices and generate revenue that reduces the federal deficit.  Similar sales were made under Obama. (There was a temporary uptick of 31 million barrels in the stockpile’s level on Trump’s watch between April 2020 and July 2020. That was during the coronavirus pandemic, when demand cratered and prices fell, making additions to the stockpile economical. But this uptick was almost entirely reversed by October 2020.) Trump said, ""It’s called the Strategic National Reserves, and it hasn’t been full for many decades. In fact, it’s been mostly empty."" First, it’s called the ""Strategic Petroleum Reserve."" Beyond that, the stockpile has been entirely full as recently as the early 2010s, and for almost a decade before Trump took office, the stockpile was generally 90% full or higher. Meanwhile, the percentage filled actually fell on Trump’s watch. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2022/apr/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-strategic-petroleum-reserve-has/

She also said the gender pay gap is even worse for Black, Latina, Asian American and Native women.  An extra 2 whole months and 15 days.That’s how long it takes for white women to make the same amount men made in the same job last year.And it's even worse for women of color.On #EqualPayDay, let's be clear: We need equal pay for equal work for ALL women—and we need it now. The well-documented pay gap between men and women has existed ever since women began entering the professional workforce in large numbers, but Duckworth’s claim was very specific to white women in the same job. PolitiFact has checked similar claims in the past and there has always been much debate about the specificity of the science behind gender gap claims, so we decided to check. Asked for her sources, a Duckworth spokesman said she referred to the National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE), the founder of a gender pay gap metric known as Equal Pay Day. He also referred us to the American Association of University Women (AAUW), a nonprofit organization advocating equity for women. Both organizations are members of the Equal Pay Day Coalition. Each year, the coalition uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine the date into the next year a woman must work in order to make the same as a man makes the previous year. This year, according to the coalition, that Equal Pay Day was March 15.  ""If you look at what all women, not just white women, made in full time jobs year round and compare it to what all men made in the same year, then the (Equal Pay) date marks how much longer women would need to work to catch up to men from the previous year,"" said Carolyn York, the NCPE secretary and treasurer.  York said the annual study is to illustrate a general point, and lacks the level of specificity Duckworth — and many others — have attributed to it.  The study does not separate out white women, and does not examine the same professions nor the qualifications of either gender. That means in 2021, it took women overall 14.5 months to earn the same median salary earned by men overall in just 12 months. Duckworth is not the first to make the mistake of over-hyping the specifics of Equal Pay Day.  Former U.S. President Barack Obama was rated Mostly False by PolitiFact when he said in 2012 that ""women are paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" In 2014, he was found Mostly True after adjusting to say that ""women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.""  Then-U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris also received a Mostly False rating when she claimed ""women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work"" during a 2019 appearance on CBS’s ""Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" So prolific is this mostly false claim, PolitiFact developed its own PolitiFact fact sheet: The Gender Pay Gap. Several factors other than job titles influence the pay gap, including the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and years of work experience. Research suggests women are overrepresented in jobs that tend to pay less. When we informed Duckworth’s office the study does not compare white women to men nor the same jobs, Ben Garmisa, her communications director, gave us the following emailed statement. ""Whether two months and fifteen days or just two days, the point—and the problem—here is that women have to work longer than men to make the same amount of money, and women of color have to work even longer than other women. Senator Duckworth is focused on not just raising awareness of these disparities, but on fixing them.""  We could find no study that comprehensively breaks down the pay gap by all professions, but some studies have examined specific occupations like COVID-19 frontline workers.  As for the second half of Duckworth’s claim which said ""women of color"" have it worse, here too Duckworth is suggesting an analysis of women in the same jobs as men. Again, the data does not examine professions. Generally, however, the pay gap is worse for all women of color regardless of their jobs.  The Equal Pay Day report says it takes Latina women overall twice as long — an extra 12 months — to match the median annual salary for all white men. Black women have to work an extra nine months, Asian American women an extra five months and Native-American women have to work an extra 11 months.  Duckworth claimed it takes an extra 2.5 months for white women to earn the same as all men working in the same job. The study to which she refers does not separate white women and does not examine occupations. While it is true the gender pay gap is worse generally for Black, Latina, Native and Asian American women, Duckworth made the same mistaken comparison about occupation. We rate this claim Mostly False. 
MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2022/apr/01/tammy-duckworth/Duckworth-overstates-specifics-of-gender-pay-gap/

Evidence does not support the claim that Pfizer staged Oscars confrontation to promote new drug
","Social media posts are falsely claiming that a confrontation between two celebrities at the 94th Academy Awards was actually plotted by Pfizer, one of the sponsors of the ceremony, to promote a new medication. At the March 27 event, comedian Chris Rock made a joke about the shaved head of actress Jada Pinkett Smith, who has an autoimmune disease called alopecia areata that causes hair loss. After Rock’s joke, actor Will Smith, Pinkett Smith’s husband, walked onstage and slapped him. In the days that followed the ceremony, several viral Facebook posts said that Pfizer staged the confrontation to put alopecia areata in the headlines, since the drug company ""has a new alopecia medication coming out."" A March 28 post said the incident was ""a great marketing tool for Pfizer,"" to use ""such a ‘high end’ celebrity whose husband just so happens to be winning an Oscar that very night to promote their ever so ‘promising’ (medication)  for…you guessed it ALOPECIA."" One March 29 post said, ""So let me get this straight, the person who sponsored the Oscars has a new alopecia medication coming out, and alopecia is trending on social media now because of the Chris Rock and Will Smith smack down... I’m sorry but this is no coincidence!?!?!"" The post also said the incident was ""a bunch of actors acting."" And yet another post on March 29 said, ""You know what would be crazy? If the sponsor of the 0scars was in Phase 3 clinical trials for a new drug ritlecitinib to treat alopecia, with a projected $750 million annual revenue, just awaiting FDA approval. Wouldn’t that be crazy? Coincidence?"" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Pfizer does not have any drugs for alopecia areata that are ready for imminent release. The company has two medications — ritlecitinib and etrasimod — under development to treat the condition, but neither will be available to the public in the near future. Pfizer does not anticipate federal regulatory approval of ritlecitinib until at least 2023, according to the company’s December 2021 presentation to investors. Ritlecitinib successfully completed Phase 2b/3 trials in August 2021 for patients with alopecia areata. Pfizer said at the time that the data from the trial ""will form the basis for planned future regulatory filings,"" but the company has not released any further information about the filing. The other drug, etrasimod, successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for treating ulcerative colitis, the company announced on March 29. The medication is also being investigated for other immuno-inflammatory diseases including alopecia areata. Etrasimod is not anticipated to be approved for use for alopecia areata until 2028. Pfizer was a ""proud"" sponsor of the Academy Awards — the top tier of sponsorship — along with Rolex, Verizon and Crypto.com, AdWeek reported. Despite the posts’ claims that Pfizer used its clout as a sponsor to stage the incident between Smith and Rock, media reports have said there is no evidence the slap was staged. That night, Smith apologized to the Academy and other nominees when accepting his own award for Best Actor in the movie ""King Richard,"" and the following day, he apologized to Rock via an Instagram post. The Academy’s Board of Governors said it has initiated disciplinary proceedings against the actor ""for violations of the Academy’s Standards of Conduct, including inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior, and compromising the integrity of the Academy."" It will decide at an April 18 meeting whether to suspend, expel or otherwise sanction him. Facebook posts say that Pfizer staged a confrontation between Smith and Rock at the Academy Awards to put alopecia areata in the headlines, since the drug company ""has a new alopecia medication coming out."" Pfizer has two medications — ritlecitinib and etrasimod — under development to treat alopecia areata. But neither drug will be available to the public in the near future.

Claim about German tax on feminine hygiene products relies on outdated information
","A Facebook post about a German tax on feminine hygiene products is based on outdated information. The March 29 post says that Germany imposes a 19% tax on feminine hygiene products but a 7% tax on books, so one company is packaging tampons as books. It’s a screenshot of a March 24 tweet. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Prior to 2020, the details of the post were accurate — but that’s no longer the case. As of Jan. 1, 2020, Germany reduced its tax rate from 19% to 7% on female sanitary products. And the ""Tampon Book"" pictured in the post was one element used in a 2019 protest against Germany’s previously higher tax, according to reporting by The Guardian. Germany's tax laws charge 19% for luxury items and 7% for food products and everyday necessities, according to the U.S. Library of Congress. Before the 2020 change, female sanitary products were categorized as luxury items. ""Books are taxed at 7% in Germany, and so the founders of the Female Company, which sells organic sanitary products, decided to publish one and include tampons inside it,"" The Guardian reported in 2019. ""Released earlier this spring, the first print-run sold out in a day and the second in a week."" Supporters of changing the law said sanitary goods in such a manner unfairly burdened women, particularly  poor women. As the Washington Post noted, some studies have shown that lack of access to menstrual pads or tampons is one reason girls around the world miss out on school. In early 2019, Germans submitted a petition to parliament with the required number of signatures to bring the topic up for debate in a public hearing, according to the Library of Congress. Later that year, parliament voted to reduce the tax on female hygiene products. The claim that Germany imposes a 19% tax on feminine hygiene products but a 7% tax on books, so one company is packaging tampons as books, contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression..

Terrorism bulletin not attempt to criminalize free speech, despite claim
","A recent terrorism bulletin from the federal government warned that false information about election fraud and COVID-19 is contributing to a heightened threat of domestic extremist attacks. Some are using that February document to falsely claim that President Joe Biden is trying to criminalize free speech. A Facebook post by former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin shows a video with the caption, ""Sen. Blackburn exposes the Biden admin's attempt to criminalize free speech."" The video shows a speech delivered on the Senate floor by Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Feb. 7 bulletin says the U.S. is in a ""heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories,"" and other forms of misinformation. It warned that foreign powers amplify those falsehoods to damage the U.S. The bulletin states that ""grievances associated"" with false or misleading narratives about election fraud and COVID-19 ""inspired violent extremist attacks during 2021."" The bulletin doesn’t cite any examples, but that’s likely a reference to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which has resulted in more than 775 individuals arrested, including some defendants who carried weapons, assaulted police officers or were associated with extremist groups. ""We've seen real-life harm caused by election disinformation,"" said Jesse Littlewood, vice president for campaigns with Common Cause, a voter advocacy group. He cited the Capitol attack. (The Common Cause Education Fund has provided financial support to PolitiFact.)  ""It is abundantly clear that we live in a time of increased threats of violence against election officials and poll workers fueled by election disinformation and conspiracy theories and like a pile of dry kindling it only takes a spark to ignite real world violence,"" Littlewood wrote in an email. The bulletin encourages citizens to report potential threats to authorities. Nowhere, however, does it suggest they report people for having dissenting views, but rather for ""suspicious activity"" or ""threats of violence."" Ben Wizner, deputy project director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s speech, privacy and technology project, said Palin’s social media take on the DHS document is ""beyond hyperbole."" The DHS bulletin ""does not establish any effort to criminalize free speech,"" Wizner told PolitiFact. ""At most, it establishes that the government has decided to keep an eye on people because of free speech, which may or may not be appropriate in different circumstances, but it’s certainly not criminalizing it."" The DHS under Biden has warned in a terrorism bulletin repeatedly about the dangers of false narratives and conspiracy theories. This is the fifth such bulletin since he took office.  In the very first bulletin on Jan. 27, 2021, DHS warned that ""perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence."" Bulletins in May, August and November also discussed misinformation, which prompted false claims that the government was calling Trump supporters terrorists. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said it’s a mischaracterization to say the DHS report seeks to criminalize free speech. He said the document accurately summarizes the ""consensus of trends observed within the extremism monitoring profession."" Levin said that conspiracy theories and false narratives are key components in online radicalization recruitment. Levin said only a fraction of today’s conspiracy theories represent a direct threat, but the spread and acceptance of misinformation can impact ""small informal cells and idiosyncratic loners,"" both here and abroad. Levin pointed to violent incidents in 2021, including one where a Maryland man was accused of killing his pharmacist brother over COVID-19 vaccines that he thought the government was using to poison people. Warnings about conspiracy theories aren’t unique to this administration, although Biden has put an increased focus on domestic extremism in the wake of the Capitol attack. DHS issued only two terrorism threat bulletins in 2020 and those focused on external threats. However, President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security Director Chad Wolf issued a Homeland Threat Assessment in October 2020 that, while mostly focused on white supremacy and Russian disinformation, did discuss conspiracy theories and political commentary as contributing to possible threats from domestic violent extremists. While campaiging for the presidency, Biden promised to work for a new domestic terrorism law that ""respects free speech and civil liberties."" In June 2021, the White House released a National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which also mentioned misinformation and stated the administration’s intent to protect ""bedrock American civil rights and civil liberties."" Alan Chen, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law and an expert on free speech issues, said there are two ways the government might restrict free speech: either by imposing criminal or civil penalties on a person because of their views, or by creating conditions that can have a chilling effect on expressing them. ""There is nothing in the bulletin that falls into that first category,"" said Chen. To the second point, he said Blackburn seemed to be implying that the document could chill the speech of dissenters, which he said is possible.  But the post’s assertion that this shows the Biden administration is trying to criminalize speech is wrong on two counts, he said. The government stating an opinion about the effect of election misinformation doesn’t mean it is imposing a penalty on those who believe the election was stolen, Chen said. And the bulletin makes a verifiable statement that domestic extremists continue to advocate for violence in response to false election claims. Threats of violence are not speech that is protected by the First Amendment, he said. The ACLU’s Wizner said calling for the overthrow of the U.S. government online is protected speech, but nothing written in the bulletin criminalizes that speech. While there may be concerns about surveilling people because of their ideology, he said, Palin and Blackburn overstate them. ""My message is, (it’s) good to keep an eye on the government because they don’t have a great track record historically of staying within bounds when they’re doing security-related domestic surveillance, but the claim here is beyond hyperbole. It’s just false,"" Wizner said. A video shared on Facebook by Palin said that Sen. Blackburn exposed ""the Biden admin’s attempt to criminalize free speech."" In the video, Blackburn criticizes a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin. The document from DHS mentions false narratives and conspiracy theories shared online as a contributing factor in a ""heightened threat environment."" But simply drawing attention to online misinformation does not constitute an attempt to criminalize free speech and nowhere in the document does the administration advocate for a policy that would criminalize it. The Biden administration has multiple times expressed its intent to protect free speech in other documents related to the role of misinformation in domestic extremism.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/mar/31/sarah-palin/terrorism-bulletin-not-attempt-criminalize-free-sp/

Donald Trump says stores don’t have bread. They do
","In an interview, former President Donald Trump voiced his dismay at the state of the country under President Joe Biden. He said shopping has changed. Hardware stores and Tiffany don’t have what you need, he said. Trump gave one particularly downhome example.  ""You go to a store, they don’t have bread,"" Trump said in a March 29 interview with the conservative Just the News. ""We’re like a third world country."" We asked Trump’s office for examples of bread shortages in stores and did not hear back. Such examples might themselves be in short supply. For several months late in 2021 and into early 2022, some stores did have shortages of certain products, bread included. Finding bread is not an issue today.  Stores, by and large, are stocked with bread, said Katie Denis, vice president of communications for the Consumer Brands Association, a food and household industry trade group. ""Any spotty outages are driven primarily by labor shortages,"" Denis said. ""Earlier in the winter, omicron absenteeism was a major cause of shortages. If a truck driver was unable to work due to COVID exposure, that could mean a delay in some products reaching store shelves."" At the best of times, stores might not have your favorite cinnamon raisin or deli rye on the shelf. Before the pandemic, according to the market data company IRI, stores would be missing some baked item 10% of the time. Recently, that number has been at 13%.  But that doesn’t mean there’s no bread. ""It might mean that the brand of wheat bread you normally buy is not available, but there might be another variety of the same brand that is,"" said Joan Driggs, vice president of content and thought leadership at IRI. Whatever snags stores face seem to be easing. One IRI measure shows steady, if modest, week-over-week improvement in the supply of baked goods. Ricky Volpe, an agribusiness economist at California Polytechnic State University, said he hasn’t ""seen any evidence to suggest that the food retail sector is facing any structural or widespread shortage of bread products."" Inflation has raised the price of bread, and the war in Ukraine will likely reduce world wheat supplies. Ukraine is the world’s eighth largest wheat producer, and Russian attacks have devastated the annual planting season. And Russia, the third largest producer, is subject to severe sanctions. Major supply interruptions generally drive prices even higher.  But that is a problem for the months ahead, not a force shaping how much bread is on the shelves today. Trump said stores ""don’t have bread."" His office didn’t provide any examples, and industry data shows no major issues. A particular baked good might be missing briefly from a grocery store’s shelf, but stores carry many varieties of bread. If one is unavailable, customers generally have many other options.

Alopecia areata is ""a disease that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks hair follicles, often on the scalp or face, but sometimes on other parts of the body,"" the AP reported. ""Sometimes hair falls out in chunks and only partial baldness results. Sometimes hair grows back but repeated bouts of baldness can also occur."" It is not life-threatening, but there is no cure.
