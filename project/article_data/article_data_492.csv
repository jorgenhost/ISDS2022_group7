If you pay no taxes, will you end up with more money under GOP tax plan?
","Will the Republican tax proposals be a boon for Americans who currently don’t earn enough to pay taxes? Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., says yes. Days before the Senate was slated to take up the tax bill, Scott was interviewed by Martha Raddatz on ABC’s This Week. Here’s a portion of their exchange about the Senate legislation: Raddatz: ""About 45 percent of Americans don't pay income tax, and many of those are the working poor. So, how does it help them?"" Scott: ""Well, if you don't pay income taxes and we increase your refund by 40 percent, that is a direct dollar impact. In other words, you'll have more money to use to keep those ends together, those single mothers like mine, who are working paycheck to paycheck, they will now not get a $9,300 deduction."" To streamline the wording, we decided to fact-check his overall point that a typical family not currently paying income taxes would receive more money under the overhaul. (His office did not object to that paraphrase.) These people would not be getting an increased ""refund of 40 percent,"" or a ""$9,300 deduction,"" even though Scott said that. Those changes would not improve the position of people who already do not pay income taxes. (Scott’s office said those points referred to an earlier discussion in the interview.) The 40 percent figure refers to early estimates by the Republican staff of the Senate Finance Committee about how Americans with specific income and family structures would gain from passage of the bill. (More recent projections are here.) As for the $9,300 deduction, that’s roughly the amount the Senate bill would increase the current standard deduction for single heads of households. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., interviewed on ABC's ""This Week"" Again, those don't apply here, even though they were in Scott's claim. So we wondered how it would be possible for Americans who already don't pay income taxes to see money from the proposed tax overhaul. If a household already was paying no taxes, having more money in their pocket would require either getting more money back from the government through the tax process, or arguing that the economic growth spurred by the tax bill would inevitably generate raises for the workers in that household. However, the GOP tax bills do not expand the earned income tax credit, which is a refundable credit designed to put more money in the pockets of the working poor. If anything, the bills' use of a slower-growing inflation measure called chained CPI would make EITC refunds less valuable over time. And another refundable tax credit, the child tax credit, would see tighter eligibility rules for the refundable portion, which could result in some households losing that portion of the credit. Meanwhile, even those who argue that the bill’s corporate and income tax cuts will spur economic growth can’t guarantee that any particular American will receive a raise. As it turns out, Scott’s office offered a different justification -- one involving the proposal in the Senate bill to rescind the individual mandate for purchasing health insurance. That provision of the Affordable Care Act requires that Americans who don’t have health insurance to pay a tax penalty. ""By repealing the individual mandate, a tax paid overwhelmingly by the middle and working classes, the Senate bill removes a burden placed on low-income families,"" said Michele Exner, a spokeswoman for Scott. The individual mandate penalty does fall disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households. And lower- and moderate-income households are also likeliest to owe no federal income taxes. Here’s how Scott’s example of a family saving money from the tax bill would work. Say you’re a family that did not earn enough to face a tax burden. Currently, you’d have a choice regarding health coverage -- either pay for insurance, at roughly $2,500 a year after subsidies for a typical Affordable Care Act plan, or forgo insurance and pay the penalty. This year, the penalty is either 2.5 percent of income, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a family maximum of $2,085 —whichever is higher. If the individual mandate is rescinded, this family would have a different choice: Either keep paying for insurance, or drop their insurance and save whatever their individual-mandate penalty would have been. Does Scott’s justification hold water? This scenario could leave certain low-income households with more money in their pocket -- but there's no guarantee. One possibility is that a family would keep their insurance despite the removal of the individual mandate; in that case, they wouldn’t be assured of saving any money. Health care experts say that if too many young and healthy Americans go without insurance, the premiums for everyone else will go up. If that scenario plays out, this group might end up with less money in their pocket, contrary to Scott’s assertion. The alternative would be for this family to drop their insurance. This could lead to a gain in pocket money, depending on how much they spend on health care. That's because the family would now be on the hook for all of their medical expenses. If they were blessed with luck and stayed healthy, they would come out ahead compared to the status quo. But if they fell seriously ill, the costs could be ruinous. ""Whether I will have more or less money in my pocket at the end of the year depends on whether or not I incur sufficiently higher medical expenses to wipe out the savings,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. ""Even insofar as the statement is literally true in some cases, it’s fundamentally dishonest and misleading."" So how would lower- to middle-income families fare overall under the Senate bill that includes the elimination of the individual mandate? The Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress’ nonpartisan office for analyzing tax proposals -- has found that the provisions in the Senate bill, taken collectively, would increase tax collection from the lowest income ranges. In 2019, each of the three income ranges below $30,000 would see increases in tax revenue. (This refers to cumulative totals for all households within that income range; individual households may see their taxes go up or down, depending on their specific situation.) And by 2027, every income range below $75,000 would see a collective tax increase. Here’s the summary table. (This assumes no further action from Congress during that time.) Lower-income Americans could get another hit from the Republican tax proposal if budget cuts are needed to offset the loss of federal tax revenue for programs that help the poor, said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. All in all, McGill said he finds Scott's argument to be an odd one. ""If I quit paying rent, I’ll have more money in my pocket, but I’ll be homeless,"" he said. ""Or if I quit buying food, I’ll have more money -- until I’m dead."" Scott said, ""If you don't pay income taxes ... you'll have more money"" under the Republican tax plan. Scott’s logic rests on Americans who do not pay income taxes no longer having to pay the penalty for not carrying health insurance. However, people who decided to keep buying health insurance despite the lifting of the individual mandate penalty wouldn’t benefit under Scott’s scenario. And if they decided to forgo health insurance and pocket the amount of the individual mandate penalty instead, they would only end up ahead if they remained healthy enough to keep their medical costs low. That’s more of a gamble than anything close to a certainty. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD6D3C0>],/factchecks/2017/nov/29/tim-scott/if-you-pay-no-taxes-will-you-end-more-money-under-/

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire 'unsolved mystery' attack on Joe Scarborough
","President Donald Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the firing of NBC’s Matt Lauer over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while encouraging the network to look deeper into its employees. ""Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.' But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!,"" Trump tweeted Nov. 29, 2017. He then followed up: ""So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!"" Trump mentioned three NBC officials -- Lack, the chairman of NBC News, Griffin, the president of MSNBC, and Scarborough, a former Florida congressman who hosts Morning Joe on MSNBC. In this fact-check, we are focusing on Trump’s attack of Scarborough’s ""unsolved mystery."" Trump is referring to an incident in 2001, when a 28-year-old congressional aide to Scarborough was found dead in one of Scarborough’s district offices. Scarborough represented Florida Panhandle counties as a Republican from 1995 to 2001. PolitiFact founder Bill Adair, then the Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times, covered the death. His report is only 286 words long, so we are republishing it in full. A congressional aide in Fort Walton Beach told people she was feeling ill the day before she was found dead, according to a police report. The Fort Walton Beach Police Department report says Lori Klausutis, an aide to Rep. Joe Scarborough, told a co-worker on July 19 that she was not feeling well, but did not elaborate. She made a similar comment to a mail carrier. She was found dead in Scarborough's district office the next morning by two people who came to seek help with an immigration case. Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk. The head injury caused the death, Berkland said. The report, which was released Monday, quotes friends and relatives as saying Klausutis was happily married and was known as ""Little Miss Mary Sunshine."" They said she was under moderate stress in the days before she died. She had two assignments due for college courses. She and her husband had recently moved into a new house, and she was looking for a new job because Scarborough recently resigned from Congress, effective in September. Relatives told police she was upbeat about a job possibility at a local radio station and had recently received a $6,000 raise. Relatives said she had been taking medication for acne and that she suffered a head injury in a traffic accident when she was a teenager that left her in a coma. When she recovered, she had signs of short-term memory loss. A mail carrier who came in the office on July 19 said she appeared nervous. He said Klausutis told him she did not feel well. The story has dogged Scarborough among conspiracy-minded individuals. Markos Moulitsas, founder of the liberal website Daily Kos, was banned from MSNBC for suggesting Scarborough may have played some role in Klausutis’ death. The guts of the conspiracy theory center around Scarborough’s announcement in May 2001, two months before Klausutis’ death, that he would resign from Congress on Sept. 6, 2001, to spend more time with his two sons. Scarborough was divorced but had joint custody of his two sons. ""It's impossible to be a good father and a good congressman,"" Scarborough said in an interview the St, Petersburg Times, which is now the Tampa Bay Times. ""You are home 180 nights out of the year and you're in D.C. 180 nights. No matter where you are, the kids are going to be without you half the year."" There’s little more to the conspiracy, but the clarity of the medical examiner’s report did not satisfy people who believe the conspiracy. That list apparently includes Trump. Scarborough responded to the president on Twitter, saying: ""Looks like I picked a good day to stop responding to Trump's bizarre tweets. He is not well."" Trump has been engaged in a running feud with Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski. Trump said Scarborough is party to an ""unsolved mystery"" from his time as a congressman in Florida. The guts of the attack are nothing more than an unproven conspiracy theory -- no different than President Barack Obama being born outside the United States or Ted Cruz’s father being involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This case is not unsolved. It is not a mystery.

Here comes that claim again: Does Wisconsin have the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country?
","Mahlon Mitchell, the latest in an historic number of Democrats who are running for governor of Wisconsin in 2018, entered the race ready with criticism of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Mitchell, president of the Professional Firefighters of Wisconsin union, was asked what changes he would make from the policies of Walker, who is seeking a third term. On the Nov. 19, 2017 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a Milwaukee-based TV talk show, Mitchell replied by saying:   Well, there’s a lot of them. I think we actually have to make sure the people of Wisconsin are first. We need to make sure that we raise wages. We haven’t done that. We have the highest -- and the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country. Let’s see if Mitchell’s statement about the fastest-shrinking middle class -- while criticizing Walker, but not directly blaming him -- fares better than two similar statements that both failed on the Truth-O-Meter. Two past fact checks Both of the previous claims were about the rate of decline of the size of the middle class. 1. In 2015, liberal MSNBC talk-show host Rachel Maddow said that under Walker, ""the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country."" Our rating was False. Maddow cited a March 2015 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a widely respected nonpartisan research organization. Between 2000 and 2013, the size of Wisconsin’s middle class shrank by 5.7 percentage points -- the largest among the 50 states. But Walker didn’t become governor until January 2011. We ran updated University of Minnesota data, the same used by Pew, to compare 2010, the year before Walker took office, to 2013, the latest year then available. Wisconsin’s middle class had dropped by 0.5 percentage points, 24th among the 50 states. 2. In January 2017, state Rep. Peter Barca, a Kenosha Democrat who was then the Assembly’s minority leader, said Wisconsin’s middle class is the ""most diminished"" in the United States. Our rating was False. Barca also relied on the 2015 Pew report. We ran updated University of Minnesota data and found that in 2015, the size of Wisconsin’s middle class was down 4.5 percentage points from 2000 -- the 10th-largest decline of any state, not the largest. To back Mitchell’s statement, his campaign also cited the 2015 Pew report. But, as we noted, more recent data is available, so we again ran the University of Minnesota numbers. Latest numbers Using Pew’s formula, a Wisconsin household was in the middle class in 2016 if its income was between $38,063 and $113,622. For that year, 48.5 percent of Wisconsin households were in the middle class. Here’s how Wisconsin ranked comparing 2000 -- the year the Pew report, which was cited by Mitchell, used as a starting point -- to 2016, the latest year available; and comparing 2010 to 2016, for Walker’s tenure: Period Percentage points shrinkage in size of middle class Rank among the states 2000 to 2016 6.1 1st 2010 to 2016 0.9 14th But his statement was made in the context of criticizing Walker, and during Walker’s tenure Wisconsin ranked 14th, not first. During both periods, most Wisconsin households that left the middle class went to the higher income bracket, rather than dropping down out of the middle class. But when adjusting for inflation, the median household income in Wisconsin -- where half of households earn more and half earn less -- was lower in 2016 than it was in 2000. Our rating Mitchell said Wisconsin has ""the fastest-shrinking middle class in the country."" Mitchell pointed to a report by Pew Charitable Trusts, which compared the states going back to 2000. Using Pew’s formula and running the latest-available data, we found Wisconsin ranked first in the shrinkage of the size of its middle class when comparing 2000 to 2016. But Mitchell made his statement while criticizing Walker, and during Walker’s tenure, Wisconsin’s shrinkage ranked 14th when comparing 2010 to 2016. For a statement that contains an element of truth but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7DD340>],/factchecks/2017/nov/29/mahlon-mitchell/its-close-wisconsin-doesnt-have-fastest-shrinking-/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says close to half of voters only pay the payroll tax. Not quite
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has worked to persuade Republican leaders to expand the child tax credit so the tax overhaul benefits more working families. To do this, Rubio said he wants to make the credit refundable against payroll taxes. The Republican tax framework proposes increasing the credit from the current amount of $1,000 and raising the current income threshold at which the credit phases out, but does not include plans to make it refundable against payroll taxes. This means it only affects families with a federal income tax liability, but a good chunk of people don’t pay income taxes because the tax code exempts them. ""We have to make (the child tax credit) refundable against the payroll tax,"" Rubio said in a Nov. 26 sit-down with CBS4’s Jim DeFede. ""Close to half of the voters in America, the only tax they pay is the payroll tax."" Experts have told us that the amount of tax relief working families receive under the plan greatly depends on what happens to the child tax credit. But we wondered about Rubio’s point about payroll taxes. (He said ""voters,"" but we’ll focus on the available data for households.) Rubio’s exact point is a stretch, but experts said he ""has the spirit of the situation right."" ""If the senator was trying to emphasize the widespread burden of the payroll tax as a larger component of most families’ tax burdens, he is right about that,"" said Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. For the most part, payroll taxes are one of two things: deductions from an employee’s paycheck, and taxes paid by the employer based on the employee's earnings. The payroll tax is a big money generator for the government and is used for social programs, such as Medicare and Social Security. We were not able to identify an exact percentage of Americans (or voters) who only pay the payroll tax, and Rubio’s office didn’t provide any evidence to back his specific claim. We did find one estimate from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center relating to Americans that pay taxes on their income. The center estimated that 44 percent of households paid no federal income tax in 2016. In a subsequent report using the same estimates, the center said about 60 percent of people who paid no income tax still worked and owed payroll taxes. Based on the center’s estimates, this means about a quarter of all households pay payroll taxes, but not income taxes. That’s half as large as what Rubio said. So where does Rubio’s factoid come from? Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas pointed to research from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation that shows the vast majority of workers pay more in payroll taxes than they do income taxes. (The data behind the analysis came from the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office.) Specifically, it found that about 80 percent of American taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than in individual income taxes. (Keep in mind, though, that the bottom 40 percent of earners pay no individual income tax.) Len Burman, a Tax Policy Center fellow, said that 76 percent of taxpayers in 2017 owe more payroll taxes than income taxes if you include the employer portion of the tax. If you only consider the employee portion of the payroll tax, Burman said, 54 percent of households owe more payroll tax than income tax. Looney also mentioned estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which found that for 65 percent of taxpayers, the payroll tax represents the largest component of their total tax burden. ""The correct observation is that for most people who pay taxes, their payroll tax payments (counting their employers’ payments as their own, which accords with economic theory) are greater than their income tax payments,"" said Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist. It’s worth remembering that people pay a lot of other taxes besides income and payroll taxes that contribute to their overall burden to Uncle Sam — there are federal and state excise taxes, state and local sales taxes, and local property taxes. ""Rubio is trying to make a reasonable point that many people try to make, but in doing so, (he) forgets that poor people pay more than just payroll and income taxes,"" said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts. Our ruling Rubio said, ""Close to half of the voters in America, the only tax they pay is the payroll tax."" Rubio garbled the specific percentage, as the closest estimate we could find shows that about one-quarter of all households in 2016 paid the payroll tax but not the income tax. However, experts said that the point Rubio was trying to make  — that for most people, the burden of the payroll tax exceeds that of the income tax — is correct.

Donald Trump wrongly claims Doug Jones wants to ‘raise taxes to the sky’
","President Donald Trump waded into Alabama’s Senate race to blast Democratic challenger Doug Jones as a tax-happy puppet of the liberal establishment. Rather than fully embrace the controversial Republican nominee Roy Moore, who's embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl and several other teenagers, Trump has supported Moore by bashing his opponent ahead of the Dec. 12 special election. ""The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY.

The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster! Trump’s tweet is chock-full of potential claims. Given Republican lawmakers’ urgent push to pass a tax bill, we decided to focus on his claim that Jones wants to raise taxes. No, Jones has not campaigned on a platform of raising taxes. We did not find examples of Jones calling for tax hikes, and the White House did not respond to our request for supporting evidence. Jones has embraced some elements of the Republican tax plan while appearing to oppose it overall. Jones told Alabama voters that unlike some Democrats, he favors lowering corporate taxes and believes it would make American business more competitive, according to the Washington Post’s coverage of a Nov. 21 candidate forum in Huntsville. ""I generally try to support cutting corporate taxes to try to get reinvestment back into this country,"" Jones told reporters Nov. 16, the day the House passed its version of the tax plan. (We’ve previously reported that around $2.8 trillion in untaxed corporate earnings is parked overseas.) Despite his support for a corporate tax cut, Jones has criticized the GOP tax plan as fiscally irresponsible, and skewing too heavily in favor of the rich while either ignoring or hurting the middle class. ""What I have said all along is that I am troubled by tax breaks for the wealthy, which seem to be, in this bill, overloaded,"" Jones told reporters Nov. 16. ""I'm troubled by what appears to be, ultimately, tax increases or no tax cuts for the middle class."" Needless to say, Jones’ support for cutting the corporate tax rate, and his concern for giving tax breaks to the middle class — or at least not raising their taxes — is at odds with Trump’s claim. At the same time, Jones’ campaign literature, which bemoans tax breaks and loopholes for wealthy Americans, raises the question of whether Jones wants to end these benefits, effectively hiking taxes on the rich. ""All Americans should have a place in this economy,"" reads Jones’ campaign website, ""and tax breaks or loopholes for the wealthiest among us hurt our ability to invest in education and other needs for lower to moderate income families."" Jones' website also calls for government spending on education and job training, and defends the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, which was financed through tax hikes. Jones’ campaign declined to answer our questions about whether Jones would support raising taxes and how he would pay for the programs he champions. Trump said Jones wants to ""raise taxes."" While Jones has criticized tax breaks for the rich, we found no examples of him calling to raise taxes. On the contrary, we found several instances of Jones supporting tax cuts for corporations and the middle class. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.

No proof that Melania Trump said if ISIS harms her son she will scratch out Obama's eyes
","No, the first lady did not really issue a threat to former President Barack Obama over the safety of her son. A headline on Yournewswire.com fabricated the quote in a clickbait headline: ""Melania Trump: ‘If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out."" Facebook users flagged the Nov. 23 post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Yournewswire.com is a fake news website. In this case, the article is not entirely fictional because it was based on a threat by an ISIS supporter. However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama. Yournewswire.com cites an article in the Washington Free Beacon, which stated that pro-ISIS internet channels called for the assassination of the son of Melania and President Donald Trump. The Free Beacon attributed the information to the Middle East Media Research Institute, an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda. The institute found the information about the threat against Barron on Telegram, a social media network. Here’s what the group reported: On November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag ""handle the son of the mule of America,"" the supporter, who uses the name ""Dak Al-Munafiqeen,"" Arabic for ""striking the hypocrites,"" wrote: ""Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington."" The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post. The report drew scant mainstream media attention. While Telegram is used by a lot of people worldwide, it is particularly popular with jihadis and ISIS supporters, said Steven Stalinsky, MEMRI executive director. ""It's the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda,"" he said. The threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact. ""The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn’t make it a significant threat,"" he said. ""Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way.""

Missouri's growth in high-tech industries mostly in line with claims
","In efforts to lure Amazon to the Midwest, Missouri officials sent three proposals to the tech-giant by Oct. 19 to be considered for the location of its second headquarters. Kansas City and St. Louis officials threw their hats into the ring, and state officials proposed an innovation corridor along I-70, which would link the two metro areas. Missouri’s brochure released on the MakeMOHQ2Home website claims the state ranked third in ""average yearly growth of high-tech industries."" When you think of a ""high-tech"" state, California and New York may be the first states to come to mind, but not Missouri. We wanted to find out how high-tech Missouri really is, and how it ranks in the country. We spoke with the researchers behind the data and economic experts who all agreed that rate of growth can be misleading. The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that defining high-tech is a moving target. Generally, though, it considers jobs with lots of workers in science, technology, engineering and math fields to be part of the high-tech industry. Missouri officials used a 2016 Milken Institute study in their claim. The Milken Institute is a nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank. The Milken Institute has a ""free-market slant,"" said Michael Leeds, chair of the economics department at Temple University, ""but (is) a credible group of scholars."" Minoli Ratnatunga, director of regional economics research at the institute’s Center for Regional Economics, was a researcher in the study. Ratnatunga said the group considered 19 industries it thought were high-tech. A few of these industries include: pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, commercial and service industry machinery manufacturing, medical equipment and supplies manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems design. The Milken Institute’s 2016 State Technology and Science Indexshows that Missouri ranked third in average yearly growth of high-tech industries from 2010 to 2015. However, this is just one component that makes up Missouri’s overall placement. In 2016, Missouri ranked 28 out of 50. Two years prior, Missouri ranked 34 out of 50. In 2012, Missouri ranked 29 out of 50. These scores are based on several factors: human capital investment, research and development, risk capital, technology and science workforce, and technology concentration. Massachusetts, Colorado and Maryland were ranked the top three states overall in 2016. Kansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma ranked behind Missouri, with West Virginia rated last. ""That tells us where Missouri ranks relative to its peers,"" Ratnatunga said. ""It’s improving, and things like (high-tech) growth is one aspect that’s impacted its overall ranking, but it’s not in the top tier."" Ratnatunga said it’s easy for Missouri’s high-tech industry to look as if it’s grown exponentially. ""If you have a relatively small sector, it’s easier to get a higher growth rate,"" Ratnatunga said. ""The same 500 jobs added in California would be a smaller growth rate."" Leeds also said the rate of growth can be deceiving. ""If you have a very small base, twice a very small number is 100 percent growth, but it can be a very small number,"" he said. Ratnatunga said companies like Amazon need to look at the index overall when considering a state’s economy. This means recognizing qualities like overall growth in the economy, the quality of the workforce, universities, capital investments and research and development inputs. ""If it doesn’t meet Amazon’s requirements, it might be a great choice for other companies that are looking to grow in high-tech,"" Ratnatunga said. Missouri officials claimed Missouri ranked ""3rd (in) average yearly growth of high-tech industries."" While Missouri high-tech industries may have seen growth, the size of base matters. Missouri has seen a growth in high-tech jobs, but the claim can be misleading when you don’t consider the size of the base. Overall, Missouri is about average in the rankings.

Fake news says Trump sending stimulus money to retirees for Christmas
","Christmas has arrived early for retirees thanks to President Donald Trump, at least according to an article making the rounds on Facebook. ""President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees,"" read a Nov. 24, 2017, headline on the website Reaganwasright.com. The story claimed that millions of retirees will get letters from the IRS ""informing them that President Trump has declared them the recipients of a Christmas stimulus to offset the horrible performance of this year’s Black Friday."" If this story seems too good to be true, it is. The story comes from a website associated with a self-described liberal troll who says he tries to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. We found the story about a senior stimulus after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story says that to qualify for the stimulus, recipients must be over 65, retired, receive Social Security and have an income under $40,000 per year. ""The letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable,"" stated the article. The article then directed readers to call the White House switchboard if they don’t receive the letter. (The number printed in the article and it is indeed the switchboard.) Reaganwasright.com describes itself as a satirical website that uses ""humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues."" The about us page links to the Facebook page of America’s Last Line of Defense, which is run by Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to ""feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama."" They’re also a vehicle to make money. The point, of course, is to get someone on Facebook to click on the post thinking it is real. ""I discovered that Facebook following plus blog plus ads equals income,"" Blair told us previously. In this case, the Reaganwasright Facebook post includes an innocuous headline, ""President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees,"" and a caption that asks people to share the post 1,000 times to show appreciation for Trump. As of this writing, it had been shared 768 times.

How much does the Trump family have to gain from GOP tax bills?
","One of the arguments from Democrats against the Republican overhaul of the tax code is that President Donald Trump, a billionaire, stands to benefit handsomely from the changes being proposed. In a Nov. 20 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas — a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee — argued that a vote for the tax bill amounts to a vote to give the president a massive windfall. ""The result in the House (of passing the tax bill) was just a matter of arithmetic and was never much in doubt,"" Doggett said. ""I am pleased that all Democrats and 13 Republicans voted against what I consider to be a real job-killing bill. I'm not surprised President Trump would come (to Capitol Hill to support the bill) because he and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally."" He repeated a similar version of the claim on the PBS NewsHour. Our research suggests that Trump and his family (as well as other wealthy Americans) do stand to benefit from the bill. However, this billion-dollar talking point needs important context that Doggett didn’t provide, including key differences between the House and Senate bills. (Doggett's office did not reply to an inquiry for this article.) Also, we don’t know much about Trump's tax situation due to his own actions. The estimates we have depend on a leaked tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may have changed since then. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. The vast majority of the savings for Trump come from fully repealing the estate tax, which is part of the House-passed bill but not the Senate’s. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers. In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from the tax, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. However, family-owned farms and closely-held businesses may be able to pay less or pay in low-interest installments. Analyses by the New York Times and NBC attempted to understand how Trump's finances would be impacted by the House bill, relying on a partial tax return from 2005. There's no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump’s finances, which would skew the results of a forward-looking analysis. Still, the New York Times analysis found that Trump’s taxes could be cut by more than $1.1 billion. The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.) But the biggest benefit would come from changes to the estate tax — $1.1 billion more for Trump — under a full elimination. The NBC analysis undertaken by Maury Cartine, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group, found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax, plus $1.1 billion from shelving the estate tax. In other words, the vast majority of the ""more than a billion dollars"" Doggett referred to stems from the estate tax. But Doggett left out a few important pieces of context about that figure. • Trump’s finances are shrouded in secrecy. It’s important to emphasize that any estimates of Trump’s potential savings are subject to a lot of uncertainty due to a lack of hard data on his finances. Trump refused to follow the decades-old presidential precedent of releasing his tax returns (and broke his promise to release them).  Trump’s current income and wealth picture is unclear, and would change by the time of his eventual death. • The final tax plan may not include a full estate tax repeal. While the House bill would end the estate tax after 2024, the Senate bill would keep it, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million. This would drastically lower Trump’s estimated savings to the tens of millions, rather than $1.1 billion, according to the analyses we just described. Both the New York Times and NBC analyses assumed that the estate tax would be totally eliminated when they made their calculation that Trump would save $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked at the alternative Senate approach. Doggett, a House member, was apparently referring to the House bill. However, the reality is that the fate of the estate tax -- and the subsequent effect on Trump’s taxes -- remains up in the air. • Trump wouldn’t simply ""walk away"" with that much money. Trump might save tens of millions of dollars in short order, according to the two media-sponsored analyses, but any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after a death, presumably years down the road. ""To get it as high as $1 billion, one needs estate tax repeal, and it is certainly right to note that this would be deferred,"" said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. ""Indeed, under present law the estate tax wouldn’t be levied until Trump’s wife died, rather than just him."" Melania Trump is 47, 24 years younger than Trump. She could outlive him by decades, delaying any estate tax benefit to the family’s heirs. Doggett said that under the Republican tax bill, Trump ""and his family would walk off with more than a billion dollars personally."" Independent analyses, working from bare-bones public information about Trump’s income picture, suggest that he stands to benefit in the short term by somewhere in the low tens of millions of dollars. Getting that figure up to $1 billion requires factoring in the estate tax -- but that demands some caveats that Doggett didn’t mention. There is no certainty that the House version of the bill, which eliminates the estate tax entirely, will ultimately prevail. And the family couldn’t simply ""walk off"" with $1 billion in benefits; to achieve that windfall might require waiting until Melania Trump’s death several decades from now. Tens of millions of dollars in tax savings would be real money to most Americans, but it’s far less than the catchy $1 billion figure Doggett has repeatedly highlighted.

","Southwest Airlines is known for its cheap deals -- but a deal to fly for free? ""Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!"" states a headline circulating on Facebook on soutwest-air.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. A Southwest Airlines spokesman, Dan Landson, confirmed that it is a scam. The phony website promotes a deal that promises that viewers have been ""selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Southwest Airlines Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!"" Upon completion of the survey participants get a message: ""Congratulations! You won 2 Free tickets at Southwest Airlines!"" But don’t expect those tickets to ever arrive. ""A good rule of thumb is that if something sounds too good to be true, it generally is,"" Landson told PolitiFact. Landson pointed to a few signs that this is fake news: the airline’s official website is Southwest.com while this website is sout-west.com. The date written as ""27. November 2017"" is also not a format that Southwest uses. ""And, we never just give out free tickets,"" Landson said. Landson said Southwest is in its 47th year, not its 50th. (Landson originally said the airline had celebrated its 48th birthday, which is incorrect.) There’s been some type of scam like this floating around for several years. (We found an example of the scam reported in the Miami Herald in 2011). A similar previous version offered travelers free first-class tickets to a ""dream destination"" and $5,000. Graham Cluley, a security analyst, wrote about the repercussions of such a scam in 2016. ""The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam."" Consumers can get actual information about Southwest at 1-800-I-FLY-SWA or Southwest.com.

Satanic Temple has not 'teamed up' with Planned Parenthood or ACLU
","U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., has been circulating a petition, encouraging constituents to add their names to ""Stand for Life"" against Satanists, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. She’s posted on Twitter and Facebook, linking to a petition on her campaign website, that says ""Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn."" She went into more detail in an Oct. 25 Facebook post, Wagner wrote, ""As Planned Parenthood continues its march through Missouri to expand abortion practices, an organization called the Satanic Temple has emerged as their ally, pressuring legislators and filing state and federal lawsuits in an attempt to erase protections for the unborn. I refuse to stand by as unabashed Satanists challenge our respect for life in Missouri. Add your name to stand in support of life."" In her social media posts, Wagner also includes a graphic that shows a red pentacle next to the text, ""Stand Against Planned Parenthood and The Church of Satan."" We reached out to Wagner to see where she was getting this information. Her campaign manager, Brecht Mulvihill, sent us a link to a statement from The Satanic Temple, and linked to articles from The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Newsweek, Slate and Huffington Post. We wanted to know, has The Satanic Temple ""teamed up"" with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri as Wagner claims on her website? Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple have taken separate court cases seeking to lower restrictions on abortion in Missouri. In November 2016, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging a Missouri statute that required abortion clinics to be licensed as ""ambulatory surgical centers."" The lawsuit also challenged requirements that stipulated that physicians who provide abortions must have admitting privileges from a nearby hospital. After a judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Director of Department of Health and Senior Services Randall Williams appealed the case. Most recently, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri lost a separate lawsuit that challenged the state’s 72-hour waiting period requirement. The Satanic Temple has filed its own lawsuits at both a state and federal level challenging the state’s informed consent materials, ultrasound and 72-hour waiting period requirements. The organization is claiming the requirements violated a Satanic Temple member’s First Amendment rights. One of the first outlets to report the simultaneous court cases was a Slate article published on Sept. 12. The author suggests a recent increase in abortion access in the state may be because of The Satanic Temple’s lawsuit, writing, ""Missouri’s recent stroke of good fortune in the reproductive rights realm may have to do with intervention from the fiery underworld."" The Slate article was picked up by other sites and is referenced in other articles from outlets such as The Kansas City Star and Patheos. Brietbart also wrote about the recent efforts by Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple. However, the Brietbart article took the story a bit further and claimed in its headline that the two organizations teamed up and that, ""The Satanic Temple has often lent its muscle to pro-abortion efforts alongside Planned Parenthood."" The fact-checking website Snopes debunked this and rated this claim false in a fact-check published on Sept. 14. The Satanic Temple also tweeted about their independence: Wagner not only claimed that The Satanic Temple was ""teaming up"" with Planned Parenthood, but also the ACLU. Spokespersons from both organizations said there was no relationship with the temple. Lucien Greaves, co-founder and spokesman for The Satanic Temple, said early attempts to get the ACLU’s help didn’t work. ""We are not collaborating nor competing with Planned Parenthood and we have no formal relationship with the organization,"" Greaves said. ""We contacted the ACLU of Missouri when we were initially seeking legal counsel for the case we’re now litigating. After a few enthusiastic calls wherein we were led to believe they were interested in taking our case they soon stopped responding to our messages and we never heard from them again."" Laurie F. Maffly-Kipp, a professor in the humanities and religious studies program at Washington University in St. Louis, observed that Wagner may be drawing connections between the two groups for political reasons. ""It looks like a scare tactic to me,"" Maffly-Kipp said. ""My observation is that many conservative Christians use the specter of Satanism as a way to rally support behind their cause."" So what does The Church of Satan have to do with all of this? In Wagner’s Facebook post, she names The Satanic Temple in the text but also names The Church of Satan in the accompanying graphic. Those are two separate organizations. The Church of Satan pointed this out to Wagner by replying to her tweet with the incorrect graphic on Oct. 25, writing, ""We have nothing to do with this,"" and linking to a statement on its website. We reached out to The Church of Satan, which confirmed that Wagner seems to have its organization confused with The Satanic Temple. The Church of Satan said it has not received a response from Wagner to its tweet, and said it believes the confusion began with ""a mix of ignorance, laziness, and intentional misinformation."" Rep. Ann Wagner claimed on her campaign website that ""Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn."" The Satanic Temple, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have all disputed the notion that the organizations are collaborating, teaming up or acting as allies. Furthermore, Wagner has incorrectly lumped the Church of Satan with The Satanic Temple. To hell with this claim.

Trump overstates credit for $700 million in savings for F-35s
","President Donald Trump told military commanders in Tampa that he will deliver new airplanes at a massive savings to taxpayers. ""We're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment,"" he said  at U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base Feb. 6. ""You have been lacking a little equipment. We are going to load it up. You are going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me."" Trump then gave himself credit for saving millions of tax dollars during his first two weeks in office: ""But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that."" The savings with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are real, but they were in the works before Trump cried foul about the price tag. A Trump spokesman did not reply for this fact-check. (The Washington Post Fact Checker previously looked at a claim that Trump took credit for cutting $600 million and gave it Four Pinocchios.) Trump’s transition tweets about the F-35 program The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin. Plans call for acquiring more than 2,400 aircraft over about 20 years at a cost of around $379 billion. Trump raised concerns about the F-35 program while campaigning. ""I’m hearing that our existing planes are better,"" he told radio show host Hugh Hewitt in October, 2015 questioning why the United States was spending ""billions and billions of dollars."" He upped his criticism of the cost after he won the election. ""The F-35 program and cost is out of control,"" Trump tweeted Dec. 12. ""Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th."" Following Trump’s tweet, Lockheed Martin’s stock plummeted, and government officials defended the program. A week later, the F-35 Joint Program Office released the final price for the contract, which showed the airplanes for the Air Force and Marine Corps reduced by $5.9 million and $2.4 million respectively, while the Navy model saw an increase of $3.2 million. Air Force Lt. Gen Chris Bogdan told reporters that he anticipated that costs would ""come down in price significantly"" and put the savings ""somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane, per variant."" The Washington Post calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for the full lot of 90 planes. During his transition into office, Trump convened top military brass, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, at his estate at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach on Dec. 21 to discuss how to bring costs down for the F-35 program. (Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was also there. Boeing is the contractor for Air Force One, another project that Trump said was too expensive.) The next day, Trump tweeted: ""Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!"" A week before Trump’s inauguration, Hewson said her company was close to a deal to significantly lower costs after the Mar-A-Lago meeting. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On Feb. 3, the Defense Department announced it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a $728 million reduction, leading to the ""lowest priced F-35s in program history."" Lockheed Martin issued a statement praising Trump’s involvement: ""President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price."" That, however, is not the end of the story. Costs predicted to drop for years Defense and budget experts offered a big caveat to Trump’s claim: Costs had been coming down for years. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015. ""The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,"" Ellis said. ""He’s not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene."" The cost per plane has always been a moving target, The Arizona Republic reported in 2014, and Lockheed Martin officials had said that costs had been coming down. The initial production model delivered in 2010 cost about $220 million, while the projection for 2020 ranged from $75 million-$85 million. The general manager of Lockheed's F-35 program, Lorraine Martin, said in 2015 that costs would drop further, ""allowing us to provide our warfighters a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade."" The savings can be attributed to a normal learning curve, said Todd Harrison, a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""As you build more copies of an item you naturally get more efficient at the work,"" he said. ""That is a big part of what we are seeing here, and that would have occurred regardless of who won the presidential election."" However, Harrison said that Trump can take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of airplanes. ""For the previous lot of F-35s, DOD negotiated with Lockheed for about a year and a half and never reached a deal,"" he said. ""DOD ultimately used a somewhat unusual method for finalizing the contract unilaterally in late 2016."" Ben Friedman, a military budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the savings have nothing to do with Trump since they were already in the works. ""First, there are no savings yet, as they are anticipated, perhaps hopefully,"" he said. ""Second, it is normal for costs to fall as production goes forward and problems are solved. Third, it's not as if no one before Trump was looking to cut F-35 costs. It has been a fixation in the Pentagon for a long time."" Our ruling Trump said, ""I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35."" The Department of Defense announced a $728 million reduction on Feb. 3 for the aircraft. But Trump ignores that the government and Lockheed Martin were working toward reducing the costs for years — long before Trump’s tweets in December criticizing the price tag.

Donald Trump wrong to say Kuwait followed his lead on visa ban
","President Donald Trump's favorite social media tool is Twitter. But Trump turned to Facebook recently to defend his executive order on visas and travel from seven countries. Trump’s Facebook post seemed to rally supporters around the wisdom of his executive order, which suspended entry for most foreign travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days. He commented, ""Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.’ "" The post linked to an article published on the English-language version of the Arabic-language website Al Bawaba on Feb. 1 that featured the headline Trump quoted in his post:  But the government of Kuwait -- a small, Arab monarchy wedged between Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the Persian Gulf -- publicly rejected the notion that it had followed Trump’s lead by banning travel by Muslims. Kuwait ""categorically denied media reports that it planned to stop issuing entry visas for some nationalities,"" read a statement from Sami Al-Hamad, Kuwait’s assistant foreign minister for consular affairs. He added that ""citizens of those countries mentioned by social media visited Kuwait regularly through direct commercial flights."" Other diplomats, including the Pakistani envoy in Kuwait and Kuwait’s charge d’affaires in Iran, backed up Kuwait’s statement. Kuwait’s denial was picked up by such mainstream media outlets as Reuters. But as of the afternoon of Feb. 7, Trump’s post remained up and uncorrected, as did the Al Bawaba article he had linked to. So what’s going on here? The short answer is that Trump’s Facebook post was wrong. The longer answer, however, needs to fill in some important background. (The White House did not provide PolitiFact with any backup material. Attempts to reach the Kuwaiti embassy in Washington were unsuccessful.) Travel restrictions for Kuwait happened years ago We found several news accounts from years ago that generally said Kuwait had banned visas for several Muslim countries in 2011 before easing the rules a bit in 2013. A Gulf News article dated May 22, 2011, said that ""Kuwait has banned nationals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan from entering the country, local media reported. The ban includes suspending all tourism, visit and trade visas as well as visas sponsored by spouses, immigration sources said, quoted by Kuwaiti media yesterday."" The article cited unnamed sources saying that the ""visa ban,"" which was described as ""temporary,"" stemmed from the ""difficult security conditions in the five countries"" and to ""the remarkably increasing tendency of nationals from the five countries to apply for visas to bring in relatives who faced or could face arrest by the local authorities to Kuwait."" Another Gulf News article dated July 8, 2013, noted that Yemen was later added to the visa-ban list. The 2013 article noted that in January of that year, Kuwait ""eased"" the ban from those six countries by allowing public-sector workers to bring their wives and children with them, and by allowing private-sector workers to bring their sons if they were under 15 years old and their daughters if they were under 18. Finally, in 2014, Kuwait eased its visa rules -- but excluded Iran, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, or Afghanistan from those expanded rules. So, while Trump was wrong to say in his Facebook post that Kuwait had followed his lead, Kuwait did have restrictions in previous years. ""Historically, Kuwait has issued travel bans on certain nationalities due to specific events,"" said Edward W. Gnehm Jr., who studies the Gulf region at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. He noted that Kuwait banned entry by Palestinians, Yemenis and Iraqis after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 since it considered those countries or their people to have been supportive of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. That said, Kuwait has some practical restrictions on how firmly it can crack down on travel from these countries, said Kristin Smith Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. ""There are lots of Syrians living in Kuwait, and they certainly haven’t been evicted,"" Diwan said. ""It also would have been very unpopular with Kuwaitis who had enormous sympathy for Syrians and the uprising, especially in the early part of the war."" Diwan added that Kuwait ""has lots of business with both Iraq and Iran,"" making a total ban difficult. In fact, she said, the Kuwaiti Emir recently visited Iran to explore the potential for de-escalation on behalf of Kuwait and its neighbors. Another key point is that the immigration systems of the United States and Kuwait are akin to ""apples and oranges,"" said David Andrew Weinberg, a Gulf specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Kuwait, unlike the United States, is not a multiethnic democracy,"" Weinberg said. ""It is a family-ruled monarchy and ethnically-based nation that does not offer a route to citizenship to immigrants. In fact, Kuwait doesn’t even grant citizenship to enormous numbers of ‘bedoon’ individuals who have been there for generations but aren’t recognized as ‘Kuwaiti’ by the state."" Estimates put the number of expatriates in Kuwait at more than 2 million, accounting for about two-thirds of the country’s population and much of its workforce. In other words, Weinberg said, Kuwait, unlike the United States, doesn’t have an immigration system for people to come and stay and become citizens. So any movement toward a stricter immigration policy would have much bigger consequences in the United States than in Kuwait. If you click through the Al Bawaba story that Trump linked to, that article sources its information to another article, from a London-based website called The New Arab. That article now includes a note at the bottom stating in part, ""This article has been updated to reflect the fact that the ban came into force, unofficially, in 2011, and was not a reaction to Donald Trump's recent executive order."" So the original media source that Trump’s post is based on doesn’t even stand by the message of its original headline. Our ruling On Facebook, Trump said, ""Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.' "" That’s wrong -- news coverage suggests that Kuwait implemented a visa ban on a half-dozen predominantly Muslim nations in 2011, six years before Trump took office. Meanwhile, any argument that Kuwait’s past actions indicate a like-minded approach between Trump and Kuwait sidesteps the reality that pursuing such a policy in the United States inevitably has a much bigger impact because the U.S., unlike Kuwait, allows a path to citizenship for legal immigrants.

Trump's executive order on immigration did not lead to ISIS leader's arrest in New York
","A fabricated news story claiming Donald Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration led to the arrest of a suspected terrorist doesn’t pass inspection. ""Executive order leads to capture of ISIS leader, Rasheed Muhammad,"" reads the headline on a Jan. 31, 2017, story at USAPoliticsZone.com. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of the website’s efforts to identify potentially contrived news stories. The story is false, however, and appears to have originated on a website chock full of fabricated content. Trump’s Jan. 27 order barred citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. The order drew protests at airports nationwide. Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Jan. 30 for refusing to enforce the order. The action is currently on a nationwide temporary restraining order pending judicial review. You can review some key issues about the order in this explainer. The next day, the website Times.com.mx posted the story that a suspected terrorist named Rasheen Muhammad had been arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. It included a photo of a handcuffed man flanked by men in FBI windbreakers. The story said stricter screening procedures in place because of the order were to credit, and said Yates apologized via Snapchat for being wrong. The story also quoted FBI Director James Comey as saying details would not be released as the agency investigates. None of these things happened. There was no arrest of any person named Rasheen Muhammad at JFK, terrorist or otherwise. The only Rasheen Muhammad we could find in a news search during the proper time frame was a 19-year-old gang member in Chicago being held in Cook County Jail on Feb. 4 for a juvenile warrant. Yates, who had said she was not sure Trump’s order was legal, also did not apologize for refusing to enforce it. There are no reports of such an apology, whether on Snapchat or otherwise. Comey also did not address the arrest, seeing as how the arrest never happened. Times.com.mx is another website that attempts to imitate legitimate news outlets with fake stories to lure readers. USAPoliticsZone.com and several other sites copied the story verbatim. None of the photographs are of someone named Rasheen Muhammad. Anyone with eyes can see that the three photos are actually of different people: USAPoliticsZone.com also added this image, which is of Sajmir Alimehmeti. The Bronx, N.Y., man was arrested in May 2016 on charges of providing material support to a terrorist organization for failed attempts to join or aid ISIS. Finally, USAPoliticsZone.com included this image, a still from a video of Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who really was an ISIS leader. Al-Adnani, considered the official spokesman for the Islamic State, was reportedly killed while fighting in Syria last fall.

No proof ISIS leaders using Donald Trump's travel ban for recruitment
","A Democratic congressman called out President Donald Trump’s travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries as counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. ISIS has already used the executive order in its recruitment propaganda, said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. In a Jan. 31 CNN interview, Moulton disagreed with Trump’s misleading comparison of his executive order to actions taken by President Barack Obama’s administration on Iraqi refugees in 2011. ""Improvements to the vetting process are something that you'll find bipartisan support for here in Congress. What Trump has done in contrast is just put this blanket ban that will be used against us and our troops,"" said Moulton, who served four tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer. ""In fact, ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side."" We previously confirmed that Trump was featured in terrorist propaganda videos for comments during the presidential campaign. But is the text of his executive order now being circulated to incite attacks against the United States and for terrorist recruitment? Experts said there have not been official releases from major terrorist groups, though their supporters are talking about it on social media. Trump’s executive order About a week into his presidency, Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants and nonimmigrants from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also banned refugees for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order was quickly challenged in courts and as of early Feb. 7, there was a temporary restraining order on Trump’s mandate ruled by a federal judge in Washington. The issue is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We had not seen reports of ISIS using the ban for recruitment during that week, so we asked Moulton’s office for support for his claim. They directed us to a Jan. 29 Washington Post article headlined, ""Jihadist groups hail Trump’s travel ban as a victory."" A comment on a pro-Islamic State channel on a social media platform, Telegram, compared Trump’s executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, ""which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a ‘blessed invasion’ that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world,"" the Washington Post reported. Other comments described Trump's order as one that would convince American Muslims to align with extremists, the article said. It also includes comments by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on the Jan. 29 edition of CBS’ Face the Nation: ""The effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda."" McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., released a similar, forward-looking statement that said: ""Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism ... Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security."" Moulton’s team referred us to tweets by Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, a group monitoring jihadist websites. Katz’s tweets posted Feb. 3, a few days after Moulton’s comment, said: ""First official #AQ response to #Trump presidency calls him""foolish"" says ""the flame of Jihad has been ignited & reached the East & West"" ""2) #AQ on #Trump's vow to ""eradicate radical Islamic terrorism"": ""not directed only to the mujahideen...but also to the Muslims in general""  1) First official #AQ response to #Trump presidency calls him""foolish"" says ""the flame of Jihad has been ignited & reached the East & West"" pic.twitter.com/C7uX6n5bRf  2) #AQ on #Trump's vow to “eradicate radical Islamic terrorism”: ""not directed only to the mujahideen...but also to the Muslims in general"" Katz told PolitiFact her Feb. 3 tweets were about a statement by al-Qaida, not ISIS, and that the statement she was referring to only mentioned a botched Yemen raid and Trump’s vow to ""eradicate radical Islamic terrorism,"" not the ban specifically. ""At the official level, there have been no direct mentions of the travel ban by ISIS, al-Qaida, or any other major jihadi terrorist organization,"" Katz said. ""Even the sixth issue of ISIS’ monthly Rumiyah magazine, which was released this past Saturday, did not mention it."" Katz said silence from such groups is ""absolutely noteworthy, and goes against the conventional jihadi propaganda practice to exploit any event—especially high-profile ones like that of the travel ban—by which Muslims are affected."" Terrorist groups' supporters, mainly al-Qaida supporters, have discussed the travel ban citing deceased al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki’s statement that the United States will ""turn against its Muslim citizens,"" Katz said. She tweeted about that Jan. 29. In wake of #MuslimBan, jihadis invoke Awlaki's prediction that US will""turn against its Muslim citizens"";call #Trump ""best caller to Islam"" Pro-ISIS social media channels are largely posting links to articles with very little commentary, Katz added. Moulton’s office also linked us to a tweet from @theosint, identified on its Twitter bio as a contributor to open source and social media investigation group Bellingcat. The tweet, posted Jan. 28, reads: ""ISIS doesn't even share its own propaganda anymore. It just shares CNN and NYTimes articles about the @POTUS muslim ban on Telegram."" ISIS doesn't even share its own propaganda anymore. It just shares CNN and NYTimes articles about the @POTUS muslim ban on Telegram. Rukmini Callimachi, a New York Times correspondent who reports on ISIS and al-Qaida, asked @theosint to name what channel was sharing New York Times stories, because she had not seeing that happen. @theosint replied to her clarifying that the New York Times article wasn't specifically about the ban. On Jan. 30 Reuters reported that an Islamic State supporter in response to Trump’s order posted on Telegram: ""Your decision will do nothing. Attacks will come at you from inside America, from Americans born in America with American parents and grandparents."" Several channels on Telegram and on which Islamist militants posted about Trump’s order have been taken down, Reuters noted. Still, some experts are cautious about reading sympathizers’ support as official communication. Terrorist organizations are emboldened by statements or actions from elected officials, ""but not always in as visible or simple a way as is often implied,"" said Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, based in London. ""I am in no doubt that Trump's executive order will make the lives of ISIS and its like-minded rivals easier, but I would be wary of drawing too linear a link. So far at least, ISIS has made no official pronouncement on the policy, nor has (al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula),"" Winter said via email Feb. 6. ""That said, supporters of the former have expressed that Trump is something of a ‘useful idiot’ to their group and official propagandists for the latter have written extensively about why Trump bolsters the salafi-jihadist worldview."" Terrorist groups like ISIS use Trump’s ""anti-Islam rhetoric to say that the U.S. is waging war on Islam,"" said William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law. However, Banks said he was not aware of specific incitements or attacks based on Trump’s executive order. A New York magazine profile story on Callimachi, the New York Times correspondent focused on ISIS and al-Qaida, also notes that ISIS still had not made an official statement, though militants applauded the order. The New York piece published online Feb. 5. J.M. Berger, a fellow at International Centre for Counter Terrorism at The Hague, said that while he hasn’t been tracking Islamic State activity daily since Trump’s inauguration, claims like Moulton’s ""often get out ahead of the actuality."" But he agrees with concerns that Trump’s order may endanger America. ""There are several levels at which the travel ban makes things worse. It furthers the jihadist narrative that America is broadly at war with Islam. It also creates new tensions with countries we should be cooperating with,"" Berger said. Our ruling Moulton said, ""ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side."" Experts we communicated with said they believe the order plays into terrorist groups’ message that the United States is at war with Islam. Terrorist groups' sympathizers have discussed the ban on social media channels. However, experts said that neither ISIS or other major groups had made official announcements on Trump’s policy.

Is $135 billion enough to end global poverty? No.
","Twitter followers of the cheekily named What the F*** Facts got some bold guidance recently. ""The world spent $1,735 billion on war in 2012,"" the outfit tweeted on Jan. 24, 2017. ""It would take $135 billion to eradicate global poverty."" This claim has been popping up on the web since at least February 2013, but the 5.5 million followers of WTF Facts has to count as one of the widest audiences yet. The world spent $1735 Billion on war in 2012 it would take $135 billion to eradicate global poverty. We decided to vet the numbers. The takeaway is while $135 billion wouldn’t hurt, the statement glosses over a host of problems that undercut the core promise to end poverty. It isn’t central to this fact-check, but the military spending figure largely checks out using data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Now to assess the money needed to lift people out of poverty. We started with the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day, which is the current global poverty line. Estimates vary, but economists at the World Bank put the 2012 figure at 880 million people. Then we calculated how much more the average poor person in that group would need to make to get above $1.90 a day, with the help of World Bank economist Christoph Lakner. The approximate answer for 2012 is it would have taken about $187 billion to lift each person out of poverty that year, or $50 billion more than the $135 billion in the tweet. That’s a lot, but on the other hand, the economists we reached said none of the figures are rock solid. ""The numbers are approximate for several reasons,"" said Indermit Singh Gill, professor of public policy at Duke University. ""One is the correction for purchasing power. These are based on surveys every five years or so, done by different agencies in various parts of the world. The second are corrections within countries for cost of living — especially between rural and urban areas."" Whatever the right amount it would take to eradicate poverty, economist Charles Kenny at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C., said the concept of giving the world’s poorest people more cash has a lot of merit. ""All the evidence is that if you give them money they spend it wisely on things that can increase their long-term earnings — better nutrition, health care, education, investments in equipment and so on,"" he said. But Kenny also said the practical challenge of getting the money to the right people is enormous. ""We have estimates of global poverty, but we don’t know which households are actually poor on this standard, and who they are changes a lot over the course of a year,"" Kenny said. Skeptics of simple cash tranfers abound. International development researchers David Steven and Ben Oppenheim at the New York University Center on International Cooperation emphasized that much more than a lack of income makes people poor. ""$135 billion is roughly the same as current overseas development aid, and it hasn't ended poverty yet,"" Steven said. Oppenheim said the quality of government makes a big difference and donor nations can’t ""buy development."" ""If we could do that, Afghanistan would look more like Switzerland by this point,"" Oppenheim said. ""The central lesson from decades of semi-successful efforts at poverty reduction is that effective institutions are absolutely critical. And the ingredients for that are time and political will, not just capital."" The tweet didn’t say that the money had to come from the wealthiest nations. Laurence Chandy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote recently that in many nations, local billionaires could make a big dent in their home country’s poverty. They note that the task is easier today than in 2012 because the world has far fewer poor people. Chandy and his colleagues Christine Zhang and Lorenz Noe asked what would happen if the uber-rich gave away half their wealth over a span of 15 years. The results varied from place to place. In Colombia, Georgia and Swaziland, they wrote, a single billionaire’s gift could end extreme poverty immediately. In other countries, it would take the generosity of all of their billionaires. ""This would end poverty in China, India, and Indonesia — countries that rank first, second, and fifth globally in terms of the absolute size of their poor populations,"" they said. An article from the Center for Global Development calculated that about three-quarters of global poverty could be eliminated if developing countries gave cash to the poorest by raising taxes on their wealthiest citizens, eliminating subsidies for fuel and reducing their military spending. Our ruling What the F*** Facts said that in 2012, $135 billion would eradicate global poverty. In 2012, there were about 880 million people living on less than $1.90 each day. Using World Bank numbers, the one-year price tag back then would have been closer to $187 billion. While the data are far from perfect, the tweet’s figure falls short by about 25 percent, which is a significant gap. But the bigger problem is the idea that a cash transfer alone would eradicate poverty. The experts we reached emphasized that good governments and other institutions were essential to eliminating poverty in the long-run. While money would help, it couldn’t deliver the desired results on its own. The statement has some superficial accuracy, but it suggests a simple fix to a much more complicated problem.

Were the 7 nations identified in Donald Trump's travel ban named by Barack Obama as terror hotbeds?
","Two days after President Donald Trump temporarily banned certain groups of people from entering the United States, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended the executive order by directing attention to terrorism and Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. The protest-triggering order has been criticized as a ""Muslim ban"" (it is and it isn’t, we found). But Trump refutes that, asserting that the part of the order targeting seven Muslim-majority countries is aimed at fighting terrorism. Priebus, a Wisconsin native, appeared Jan. 29, 2017 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" and said: Here’s the deal: If you're coming in and out of one of those seven countries -- by the way, identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists and affirmed by Congress multiple times -- then you're going to be subjected temporarily with more questioning until a better program is put in place over the next several months. As we noted in our Muslim ban article, the large majority of jihadists committing acts of terror in America have been American citizens or legal residents. And since 9/11, no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack by someone from the seven countries, though there have been at least three non-deadly cases in which the perpetrator was connected to Iran or Somalia. So, were the seven nations that are identified in Trump's travel ban pegged by the Obama administration as the ""seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists""? Not quite in that way, but Priebus has a point.

Trump’s order Trump’s executive order has two major components. It suspended entry of all refugees -- those who want to resettle in the United States -- for 120 days and barred refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also prohibits nearly all citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. That travel part of the order is a Muslim ban in the sense that most residents of those seven countries are Muslim. But it’s not a ban, in the sense that the vast majority of Muslims in the world don’t live in those countries and thus are not affected by the order. A week after the order, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, lifting the ban, although more court action followed. The Obama connection The travel part of Trump’s order does target the same seven countries that were singled out with a law Obama signed in December 2015. The Obama-signed law contains provisions that restrict travel to the United States for people who lived in or visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011. They must have a visa to enter the United States; they can’t use what is known as the Visa Waiver Program, which allows 90-day U.S. visits to other foreign visitors. The law was soon expanded by Obama’s Department of Homeland Security to cover Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. They were identified in the agency’s announcement as ""countries of concern,"" a phrase used in the law. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us Priebus’ claim is not misleading, but that the law Obama signed doesn’t define the seven countries as the most dangerous in terms of harboring terrorists. There are other countries where terrorists are active but could have been left off the Obama list for other reasons, he said. There are countries, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and others, where militants have significant space to operate, but there could be a variety of reasons why they were not included with countries where travel without visas is restricted by Obama law, he said. For instance, the U.S. government has a delicate relationship with the Pakistani government and there might be a desire on the part of the United States not to restrict travel from people in certain countries. Two notes before we close that don’t directly bear on Priebus’ claim, but shed light on the seven countries: Iran (added in 1984), Sudan (1993) and Syria (1979) are the only countries on the U.S. State Department’s list of ""state sponsors of terrorism."" They were determined by the secretary of state to have ""repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism."" Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are on the State Department’s list of ""terrorist safe havens"" -- where terrorists operate ""in relative security."" But nine other countries or regions are on the safe havens list, too. Our rating Priebus said Trump's executive order that temporarily bans nearly all travel to the United States from seven nations were ""identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists."" Prompted by concerns about terrorism, the Obama administration did put those seven countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- on a list that makes travel into the United States somewhat more difficult. But that list doesn’t necessarily identify the seven as being the most dangerous. For a statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAB53C0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/07/reince-priebus/were-7-nations-identified-donald-trumps-travel-ban/

Donald Trump wrong that media is not reporting on terrorism any more
","During a visit to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, President Donald Trump took a shot at one of his favorite targets -- the media. This time, he blamed the media for letting Islamic terrorists get away with attacks without covering them. ""Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino and all across Europe,"" Trump said. ""You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported, and in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that."" The remark quickly inspired puzzled reactions. Is it accurate? Before we start, it’s worth noting that terrorism happens every day somewhere in the world -- dozens of attacks around the globe each day, according to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database. Media outlets could cover terrorism attacks from far-flung locales around the clock and not have any space left for other news. ""Due to geography, terrorism in the West is overreported compared to terrorism elsewhere,"" said Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The vast majority occurs in the non-western world, generally amid civil wars, and those attacks receive far less coverage than ones closer to home."" But recent attacks on U.S. soil -- including the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, Calif., and the 2016 attacks on an Orlando nightclub, a New York City street and a college campus in Columbus, Ohio -- have received heavy media attention, often including live coverage for hours at a time and continuing coverage for days afterward. Europe, the other locale Trump mentioned, has had a number of big attacks in recent years as well, including major incidents in Paris, Brussels and the French city of Nice. These attacks have also received extensive coverage in the United States. Experts who study terrorism told PolitiFact that, in general, terrorist attacks in the United States or Europe do get covered, though the extent of the coverage can vary based on the severity of the attack and whether there are casualties. ""Attacks are always reported, in my experience, somewhere,"" said Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. The exceptions, he said, may include ""failed plots, aborted plans, or bombs that failed to explode."" John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. ""There are some incidents of such trivial nature that local authorities are hard put to decide whether it is terrorism or hooliganism,"" Pike said. ""But if an American or European civilian or officer is seriously injured or killed, it gets reported."" The White House didn’t offer any elaboration, but the strongest defense of Trump’s remark came from Ted Bromund, a foreign policy specialist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. While Bromund said he doesn’t believe the media has failed to report attacks, as Trump asserted in Tampa, he added that he sees ""ample evidence that the nature of the attacks has been downplayed."" Often, this has come from the media reporting on the words of political leaders, as in the case of a statement by President Barack Obama in February 2015 in which he called a shooting at a Kosher supermarket in Paris ""random."" For years, the Obama administration officially labeled the shootings at Ft. Hood, Texas, ""workplace violence"" rather than domestic terrorism, even though it was committed by Nidal Hasan, who had become an Islamic radical. And more generally, Obama, as Trump and others have often noted, went out of his way to avoid specific rhetorical references to Islamic terrorism, favoring instead broader terms like ""violent extremism."" Bromund said he reads Trump’s comments -- which, he said, ""are admittedly not fully clear"" -- as being ""a statement of the obvious: Leading politicians, and many media outlets, have been very hesitant to describe terrorist attacks as being motivated by radical Islamism, very eager to come up with other explanations for those attacks, and even more hesitant to acknowledge that there is any relationship at all -- even a perverted one -- between radical Islamism and Islam itself."" Still, it’s worth noting that it’s not always clear-cut whether an attack was driven purely by religious ideology or by a combination of factors -- and law-enforcement officials aren’t always definitive, either. For instance, in September 2014, Alton Nolen of Moore, Okla., attacked two co-workers with a knife, killing one and wounding the other. His social media accounts suggested an interest in ISIS and beheadings, but he also had long-standing workplace conflicts, and it was not clear that religion was the primary motivation. Ismaayil Brinsley, the man who police said ambushed and killed two New York Police Department officers in Brooklyn in December 2014, had some jihadist connections in his social media accounts but also was dealing with a variety of personal demons, including mental health issues. In the meantime, some argue that -- if anything -- terrorism inspires too much media coverage. ""Due to its sensational nature, it’s over-reported compared to other forms of violence and causes of death that kill more people,"" said Friedman of Cato. ""Media has a strong incentive to focus on scary political violence – the aphorism ‘if it bleeds, it leads’ is a sound business principle in news media, especially television."" Failing to report on terrorist attacks is actually something Trump has done himself, said Barnett R. Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. Trump has not yet personally commented on the recent shooting that killed six and injured five at a Mosque in Quebec City. News reports have noted that the alleged shooter is white and had expressed xenophobic sentiments. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump had spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying it was a ""senseless act of violence that cannot be tolerated"" but that it was best to be ""cautious to draw conclusions on the motives at this stage in the investigation."" Our ruling Trump said that terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe have ""gotten to a point where it's not even being reported."" We found no support for the idea that the media is hushing up terrorist attacks on U.S. or European soil. The media may sometimes be cautious about assigning religious motivation to a terrorist attack when the facts are unclear or still being investigated. But that’s not the same as covering them up through lack of coverage. There is plenty of coverage of in the American media of terrorist attacks. We rate the statement Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b82d39fc-cb0f-4459-b7fa-88831caa85c7",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA60540>],/factchecks/2017/feb/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-media-not-reporting-terrorism-a/

","President Donald Trump defended the rollout of his executive order restricting immigration from seven Middle Eastern countries in an interview before the Super Bowl with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. In addition to repeating false claims about widespread voter fraud, Trump also brushed off criticism of how his travel ban was implemented. The order has been temporarily halted by a federal judge, with a protracted legal battle on the horizon. ""I think it was very smooth,"" Trump said in part of the interview that aired Feb. 5. ""We had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully."" ""You wouldn't do anything differently if you had to do it over again? Some of your people didn’t really know what the order was,"" O’Reilly asked. ""Well, that's not what General (John) Kelly said. General Kelly — who's now Secretary Kelly — he said he totally knew, he was aware of it, and it was very smooth. It was 109 people,"" Trump repeated. Trump and his administration have used this figure to downplay the effects of the order many times. Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,..... But it is not accurate. Trump severely understated the scope of his action. He was referring to the number of people who were in transit to the United States when the order was released and detained at airports. The story is more complicated and far-reaching than the frantic 24-hour travel period after the order’s release. The official estimate of the number of revoked visas alone is 60,000 — or almost 520 times the amount of people Trump claimed — and does not account for any refugees that were temporarily banned from resettlement. Travel ban refresher Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order suspends entry into the United States of most foreign travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days. This encompases refugees, visa holders and U.S. permanent residents, who may apply for waivers. (Read PolitiFact’s explainer for more context, and whether it’s really a ""Muslim ban."") The order was halted after a week following court intervention. Here’s a timeline: • Feb. 1: The states of Washington and Minnesota sued Trump over the order, requesting an emergency restraining order. •  Feb. 3: District Court Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, granted the restraining order, effectively halting enforcement of the executive order: • Feb. 4: Trump called the ruling ""ridiculous"" on Twitter. The State Department reversed its revocation of visas, and the Department of Homeland Security suspended implementation. The Justice Department filed a motion appealing the decision and seeking to reinstate the ban. • Feb. 5: The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Justice Department’s motion, but requested more briefs from the federal government and the states that sued. • Feb. 6: The Justice Department had until 3 p.m. (Pacific time) to respond to the ruling.   The number of people affected is much higher than 109 The White House referred us to press secretary Sean Spicer's Jan. 31 comments that the 109 figure refers to number of the people who were ""in transit at the time the executive order was signed."" Obviously, a lot more people were affected than just those were traveling that night. Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2, more than 1,200 people were denied boarding flights to the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Another 87 received waivers to board their planes and enter the country during that time. A lawyer for the Justice Department told a federal court in Virginia that about 100,000 visas were revoked on Jan. 27. But the State Department pinned the number at fewer than 60,000 visas issued to nationals of the seven countries and said they are currently investigating the discrepancy, according to The Hill. A spokesperson for the State Department told PolitiFact that the 60,000 figure does not include refugees. We wanted to provide a sense of the possible scope of people who were affected, though it is a bit imprecise. The State Department provides reports on the number of visas issued by country for each fiscal year, but the details for each visa’s validity period and allowed length of stay vary. That makes it hard to know how many of the visas issued in the past year or two would have been affected by the executive order. Furthermore, the official numbers also include visas that would have not been affected by the order, such as diplomatic visas. Similarly, the department’s refugee processing center provides breakdowns of how many refugees are accepted in each fiscal year. But it’s not clear how many of them had yet to arrive in the United States by the time of Trump’s temporary suspension. With these caveats in mind, we tallied up the State Department’s annual visa reports and refugee admissions data. About 117,000 people from the seven countries were issued immigrant or nonimmigrant visas or admitted as refugees in the 2015 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2014 to Sept. 30, 2015). Another 68,000 were granted immigrant visas or admitted as refugees in the 2016 fiscal year. (Data for nonimmigrant visas was not yet available). Here’s a breakdown: In other words, the United States approved at least 185,000 people from the seven countries for visiting or residence in the last two fiscal years. On top of 60,000 valid visas affected by the order, there could be an additional 64,000 admitted refugees barred entry to the United States. That’s nearly 1,140 times as many people as Trump claimed. Our ruling Challenged about the rollout of his administration’s temporary travel ban, Trump said the process was ""smooth"" and affected ""109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers."" This refers to the number of people who were in transit when the ban was announced. It doesn’t account for people who tried to board flights to the United States (over 1,200) and were denied, for visas that were revoked (about 60,000 according to the State Department) or for refugees admitted (64,000 in the last two fiscal years). Trump’s narrow claim ignores the full scope of his order’s impact. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43c63873-076f-4bc1-a756-3a314dea028b",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD62E80>],/factchecks/2017/feb/06/donald-trump/president-trump-says-109-people-were-affected-trav/

Fake news claims that Walmart bananas have HIV virus are fruitless
","Fake news is bananas by nature, but one particularly slippery claim is actually about bananas said to be infected with HIV. ""HIV virus detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus,"" reads the headline on a post we first saw on Feb. 6, 2017, from a website called CNNews3.com. Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stamp out fabricated news stories. The fake story, which is undated, said eight children younger than 17 had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS in the month of March (it doesn’t say in which year). All eight allegedly ate bananas purchased at a Tulsa, Okla., Walmart store, with the boy in the headline developing symptoms within a week. The text falsely says Walmart stores are recalling bananas nationwide. The post included a contrived photo (shown above) featuring a red-streaked banana. The screenshot is made to resemble a breaking news alert from CNN. But the website is not the real CNN, and there is no epidemic of HIV-infected bananas. The story is instead a symptom of a long-running online infection of fake news stories about disease-ridden fruit. CNNews3.com is filled with several obviously untrue posts about libidinous gorillas and dubious Big Mac ingredients made up to look like news reports, as well as other headlines that could be construed as real without any indication otherwise. The site’s administrators did not answer our attempts to contact them, but it’s obvious that CNNews3.com is attempting to masquerade as the cable news giant with a similar name. For the record, HIV can’t survive outside the human body, so it’s not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana. The CNNews3.com tries to cast doubt on this by noting researchers were puzzled by the banana-borne infections. Here’s what is true: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that the virus cannot be spread by food. ""Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus,"" the CDC says. This particular fake story is a variation on an Internet hoax that has been around for a few years. One version said the World Health Organization issued a warning about bananas being infected with HIV in India. Another said the South African government warned its citizens of a similar problem, then took down warnings to avoid a panic. This particular strain of the story can plausibly be traced back to one Facebook user’s photos of red-streaked bananas in November 2015. User Anna Aquavia claimed that her friend’s sister bought bananas in Nebraska that had been injected with HIV-positive blood. The photos are now gone, but you can see them at this Washington Post story. The Post credited the images to a Colorado woman named Amanda Andrys, who said Del Monte told her the red streaks were from a bacteria-induced disease called mokillo. Mokillo is more colorfully known as finger-tip rot, and can be a problem for banana growers. The disease doesn’t harm humans, but it does require banana growers to disinfect farming equipment. Once we peeled back the layers on this story, it was obviously a fake. We rate it Pants On Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e585b449-4fe0-480e-8201-b78b5a4bc979",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA88D00>],/factchecks/2017/feb/06/cnnews3com/fake-news-claims-walmart-bananas-have-hiv-virus-ar/
"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'John Humphries']","
Schools candidate John Humphries says Tony Evers oversaw reading decline
","In his bid for state school superintendent, John Humphries is trying to use incumbent Superintendent Tony Evers’ long tenure against him. ""It's time for Tony Evers for State Superintendent to be held accountable for statewide outcomes,"" Humphries posted Jan. 12, 2017 on Facebook. ""We've dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation under his watch while other states have made substantial gains."" Humphries, a consultant with the Dodgeville School District, is in a three-way primary battle with Evers and retired Beloit Superintendent Lowell Holtz. The primary election is Feb. 21, 2017. To back up his claim, Humphries’ campaign pointed to an analysis by the Wisconsin Reading Coalition, a grassroots group of educational advocates that wants changes in reading instruction. The group has endorsed Humphries and believes Evers has not pushed education schools to use new methods for instructing teachers how to teach reading, said Steven Dykstra, a psychologist who co-founded the coalition. The coalition published a historical look at Wisconsin’s reading ranks based on annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which bills itself as the ""largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know."" The ranking The NAEP test, taken by a small sample of students, is the best source to analyze Humphries’ claim, though it is not without drawbacks. Let’s take a look at the 4th-grade scores, the only elementary-school grade that NAEP tests. NAEP publishes two types of rankings. One simply orders states by their average reading scores. But because those scores often are too closely bunched to be significant, NAEP also reports how many states have statistically higher or lower scores. Here’s the history on Wisconsin’s rankings, using both methods: 1998: 6th by raw order; 1 state significantly higher 2003: 22nd, 8 states significantly higher 2005: 24th, 11 states 2007: 25th, 8 states 2009: 30th, 19 states 2011: 25th, 15 states 2013: 31st, 15 states 2015: 25th, 12 states So by the cruder measure, the raw ranking, Wisconsin was a top-10 state. The most recent year showed a ranking of 25th -- not the 30th Humphries claimed. But its ranking has been as low as 31st on 4th-grade reading during Evers time as superintendent. (Wisconsin’s scores were stagnant while the national average increased). On Evers’ watch? So the history helps Humphries’ case, but did that decline come, as Humphries claimed, under Evers’ watch? Only if you define Evers’ ""watch"" as dating to 2001, when he was appointed deputy superintendent of public instruction under newly-elected State Superintendent Elizabeth Burmaster. Evers took control of the agency after he won the spring 2009 election. At that point, Wisconsin’s reading rank already had fallen to 30th, with 19 states significantly ahead. That gives a different perspective on Evers’ record. Comparing the first test in Evers’ time atop the agency to the most recent, the ranking improved from 30th to 25th, and from 19 states significantly better to 12 states. Two final notes before we grade this. The picture for Wisconsin is somewhat brighter using the second, more statistically precise ranking method published by NAEP. In 1998, Wisconsin was sixth in raw order, but only one state was ""significantly higher."" In the most recent three tests, Wisconsin’s rank in raw order was 25th to 31st, but only 12-15 states were ""significantly higher."" The state Department of Public Instruction, the agency Evers heads, has used both measurements in its public statements on NAEP over the years. Finally, Wisconsin looks better on 8th-grade reading, where it ranks 9th. But Humphries’ claim focused on referenced elementary school, generally considered Kindergarten-5th grade. Our rating Humphries said Wisconsin has ""dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation"" under Evers. The drop is real, by an oft-cited ranking from a credible source, but the latest rank is 25th, not 30th. And Facebook readers who aren’t deeply familiar with Evers' career might assume from Humphries claim that the decline happened while Evers was state superintendent. Evers was a top staffer for much of that time, but most of the decline came before he took over. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA854C0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/06/john-humphries/schools-candidate-john-humphries-says-tony-evers-o/

Business group says bathroom law could lose Texas $8.5 billion in GDP, up to 185,000 jobs
","A major business group predicts billions of dollars in economic losses should Texas lawmakers advance ""discriminatory"" legislation including so-called bathroom bills or measures limiting local control of non-discrimination ordinances. We checked on whether the widely cited projections, linked to actions in other states, hold up. Portions of the study commissioned by the Texas Association of Business proved solid. But other elements were shaky. One projection, for instance, rests in the Super Bowl set for Houston on Feb. 5, 2017 being moved to another state. Another extrapolates Texas losses from research rooted in Arizona’s immigration law--not that state’s failed proposal targeting LGBT residents. And the report’s biggest projected loss to Texas starts from an Indiana legislator’s comment that might lack documentary backup. There could be heft to claims that a Texas Senate proposal poses economic risks. Opponents of Senate Bill 6, requiring Texas residents to use bathrooms matching their assigned sex at birth, underscore North Carolina’s experience, which gets TAB attention elsewhere in its report presenting the possible economic losses. In 2016, Republicans in the Tarheel State curbed protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, touching off economic losses mostly tied to boycotts adding up to as much as $201 million, PolitiFact North Carolina confirmed. The TAB, which calls itself the state’s leading advocate for employers, initially highlighted the study that caught our attention in a Dec. 6, 2016, press release urging the 2017 Legislature to spurn ""discriminatory legislation."" That release said the study, undertaken at St. Edward’s University in Austin, found that a  discriminatory law could result in $964 million to $8.5 billion in reduced state gross domestic product and up to 185,000 lost jobs, partly due to fallout in the tourism sector. State GDP refers to the market value of all final goods and services produced within a state in a particular period of time. We broke down the figures in the study, exploring research assumptions and identifying instances of unstated or questionable sourcing. Separately, outside experts sounded a few cautionary notes. University researchers unavailable for interview We were barred from talking to the people who made the projections. But at the association’s request, Brad Zehner, a St. Edward’s associate professor of management, addressed a set of questions in writing. We fielded Zehner’s responses by email from the association’s Belinda Matingou after a university spokeswoman, Mischelle Diaz, advised by email that faculty and students who did the study had signed non-disclosure agreements prohibiting additional commentary. She further said the ""research provided should not be interpreted as the official position of the university, but rather that it contains views and opinions of the student teams based on discussions, observations and analysis."" Study’s timeframe, scope Zehner wrote that four St. Edward’s business graduate students under faculty supervision reached the projections in December 2015--or more than a year before the 2017 legislative session. That timeframe explains why North Carolina’s experience wasn’t considered; its law won legislative approval in March 2016. We noticed too that as of 2017, none of the study’s three analyzed states still had a mandate like the ones gauged by the study. Arizona’s proposal was vetoed, a Louisiana gubernatorial order was rescinded and Indiana’s law was amended not to apply to LGBT residents. Also, the study presents the potential Texas costs as a three-year forecast. Zehner, asked to explain that length of time, said: ""A singular event such as the loss of the Super Bowl or the March Madness tournament does not have a one-time impact on an economy but rather ripples through multiple years as ancillary businesses are impacted. Think about tourism. If out-of-state tourists have a great experience in Austin, Dallas, Houston, or San Antonio, they will tell friends who might decide to vacation in Texas the following year. A multi-year projection is more meaningful than a single-year projection."" State by state Let’s look at the numbers behind the projections, state by state. Arizona In 2014, Arizona’s legislature advanced a proposal, vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer, allowing businesses to deny services on religious grounds--a change in law widely taken as permitting discrimination against gays. Prior to the veto, the study says, ""several large businesses expressed formal opposition to the bill, including the National Football League, which threatened to take the Super Bowl to another state, at a potential cost of $500 million."" The study says Arizona estimates ""of costs incurred over the course of three years in cancelled conventions and travel costs equaled $140 million."" The study attributes that figure to a February 2014 Arizona Republic news story, though the story attaches that predicted effect to an earlier state law targeting unauthorized U.S. residents that was partly overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012. We asked Danny Court of Elliot D. Pollack and Company, the Scottsdale-based firm that reached the figure, to review the Texas citation. By email, Court commented: ""Our report had nothing to do with issues pertaining to religious freedom policies."" Court further said it’s ""unclear, but likely, that the $140 million figure was not the correct figure to base an extrapolation from."" Then again, he said by phone, he hasn’t probed if a Texas law would result in greater or lesser losses. In the Arizona analysis, the Texas study says the estimated three-year impact of similar Texas legislation could be $464 million to $964 million, that high-end figure, we confirmed, rests in Texas losing the equivalent of the 2017 Super Bowl. The study says: ""• Houston is scheduled to host the 2017 Super Bowl. LGBT activists have lobbied for the National Football League to move the event, but it will continue as planned. ""• As Texas’ travel and tourism industry is three times larger than Arizona’s (Dean Runyan Associates, 2015), the potential drop in tourism could amount to $464 million over three years. ""• This equates to a loss of approximately 12,000 jobs."" We confirmed the listed travel and tourism figures, also determining from Matingou and Zehner that the researchers calculated job losses by dividing the economic loss projections by the $46,000 annual average Texas wage as of May 2015. A Bureau of Labor Statistics chart pegs that wage for all Texas occupations -- meaning plenty of jobs not directly connected to tourism -- was $46,560. Louisiana Louisiana legislators in 2015 didn’t reach a law to protect businesses from negative consequences for denying services on religious grounds. Gov. Bobby Jindal then placed such provisions into an executive order later rescinded by Jindal’s Democratic successor, John Bel Edwards. According to the Texas study, the city of New Orleans predicted Jindal’s order would cause 85 percent of the city’s top conventions not to return. The study, applying that declaration to conventions in Houston and to Texas sales tax revenue, says the estimated impact of a Texas law could be as high as $1 billion, risking 26,000 jobs. We didn’t see a source in the study for New Orleans’ top conventions not returning. But a web search yielded a May 2015 Travel Weekly news story quoting Stephen Perry, ceo of the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau, talking about the failed legislation. According to the story, Perry said 80 percent to 85 percent of the city's ""most important corporate customers"" called to say that if it were to pass, ""it’s unlikely we’re going to be able to come back here."" The story also quoted Perry saying Jindal’s order ""caused a lot of consternation and confusion."" We asked a bureau spokesman, Kristian Sonnier, about Perry’s conventions statement. By email, Sonnier offered that ""our industry had approximately $1 billion/year in corporate convention and special event business at stake that would have been put at risk by our state government passing an anti-LGBTQ bill and,"" he said, Jindal’s order. Indiana In 2015, the TAB-requested study says, Indiana’s legislature voted to allow businesses to refuse service due to objections on religious grounds. After negative reactions, the study notes, legislators amended the law to blunt its effect on LGBT residents. Still, the study says, the economic impact was calculated as $1.5 billion in short-term losses alone. The study footnotes that figure to a web link that didn’t work when we tried. But we found an April 2015 WNDU news story attributing the $1.5 billion figure to an Indiana legislator, Terri Austin, quoted saying that she’d talked to industry professionals and concluded the original Indiana act had caused the state to lose $1.5 billion in meetings and conventions. ""I talked to some of the industry professionals just to get the facts and figures so I didn't just pull them out of thin air,"" Austin said. We tried to reach Austin about what went into her figure, which she brought up in April 2015 legislative debate. At our inquiry, John Schorg, a staff spokesman for Indiana’s Democratic House caucus, said Austin told him that she drew on discussions she had with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the Indiana Restaurant and Hotel Lodging Association and the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce. Schorg said documentation of the figure, if any, is long gone. Indiana’s losses might not have been that huge. A web search led us to a January 2016 Indianapolis Star news story stating that according to the city’s tourism agency, the furor surrounding Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act ""might have cost the city of Indianapolis as many as 12 conventions and up to $60 million in economic impact,"" which would break out to 4 percent of the bandied $1.5 billion figure. The story said Chris Gahl, vice president of marketing for Visit Indy, reported that in 2015, 12 conventions cited RFRA as at least one reason they chose not to book Indianapolis. But that loss of $60 million amounted to a small piece of Indianapolis's $4.5 billion tourism industry, the story said. Matingou put us in touch with Gahl, who affirmed the $60 million loss, adding by email: ""This economic impact number would have significantly escalated had the amendment"" protecting LGBT residents ""not been put in place so swiftly."" Neither he nor other Indiana officials we reached offered a basis or backup data for the $1.5 billion figure. The Texas study accurately recapped fall-out in Indiana before its law was amended including an NCAA chief expressing serious concerns over hosting events in the state, Apple CEO Tim Cook penning a critical commentary and Indianapolis-based Angie’s List saying it was cancelling a $40 million headquarters expansion due to Indiana’s law. The Texas study says that if a similar law passed in Texas, the estimated impact could reach $8.5 billion. How so? ""Given that the Texas travel industry has a $31 billion annual impact, a 15 percent reduction would result in an overall loss of $8.5 billion,"" the study says, ""or 0.5% of the State GDP, the same percentage GDP loss experienced by Indiana,"" which equates to more than 150,000  jobs, the study says. This needed unpacking. We didn’t see a study source for the stated $31 billion annual impact of the Texas travel industry though Matingou pointed out that Oregon-based Dean Runyan Associates, which employs its model to calculate travel and tourism spending for states, pegged the 2015 GDP of the Texas travel industry at $33.5 billion. Also, Matingou told us, the ""15 percent"" reduction was a typo that should have said ""0.5 percent,"" as the study states otherwise. She further said the researchers projected Texas potentially losing $8.5 billion in GDP starting from the realization that the $1.5 billion in declared losses to Indiana was equal to 0.5 percent of that state’s GDP. Applying the same percentage to Texas’s GDP of $1.7 trillion, she noted, breaks out to $8.5 billion. We didn’t spot sources for state GDPs in the study. When we asked, Matingou said the study relied on a July 2015 report from the Texas state comptroller stating Texas had a 2015 Gross State Product of $1.657 trillion; researchers rounded that up to $1.7 billion, she said, with 0.5 percent of that being $8.5 billion. Outside experts Experts including economist John Gnuschke of the University of Memphis mostly saw no major problems with the research approach. Gnuschke wrote: ""State-to-state impact comparisons are widely used for studies of this kind but are difficult given the wide range of policy variations and economic conditions in each state,"" Gnuschke wrote. ""Individual states find it difficult to assess the impact of any policy."" But economist Craig Depken of the University of North Carolina-Charlotte and Timothy Werner, a University of Texas professor, each urged caution in converting data from other states into specific Texas forecasts. Werner said: ""One of the biggest challenges faced by this sort of study is that we don’t have a lot of data on the actual effects of these bills, as only one (in North Carolina) has gone into effect."" A Wharton professor, Maurice Schweitzer, and Don Hoyte of Austin, a former 20-year analyst for the Texas state comptroller’s office, each said he’d expect an anti-LGBT law to be detrimental to the Texas economy. Schweitzer said, though, precise ""figures are difficult to forecast, because the effects can snowball—once one company or sporting event boycotts a state, others are more likely to follow. Though I cannot forecast the exact amount, I am positive that a measure limiting transgender bathroom choices will harm the Texas economy."" Hoyte said a weakness is the study’s focus on the overall state economy when it makes better sense to expect distinct effects among local economies--tourism-dependent San Antonio, for instance, or other big cities in terms of the likelihood of big sporting events not coming to town. Matingou later reminded us the study presented ranges of possible impact, also saying: ""The researchers you consulted echo TAB’s concern that discriminatory legislation will have a significant, negative impact on the Texas economy."" Our ruling The TAB said a study projects up to $8.5 billion in lost GDP and up to 185,000 lost jobs in Texas if lawmakers approve a discriminatory measure like proposals in other states. Such a law might cause economic shivers. But we find this study’s headlined figures, reached about 13 months ago, to be based on predicted or actual effects of discriminatory mandates in Arizona, Louisiana and Indiana that didn’t make it into law or were rescinded or softened. Moreover, not all the study’s numbers, calculations and assumptions proved solid and a key figure, reflecting on Indiana losing $1.5 billion in conventions, doesn't appear to have a documented basis. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Democrats didn't object to Neil Gorsuch's 2006 confirmation, Mitch McConnell says
","Republican leaders say Democrats are being hypocritical to come out swinging against Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch when they supported him in his previous judicial confirmation.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is one of the Republicans who rushed to support Gorsuch after President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31. ""Not a single Democrat opposed #NeilGorsuch’s confirmation in 2006,"" McConnell tweeted Feb. 1. ""I hope & expect that all senators will again give him fair consideration."" McConnell’s general point is correct: the Senate confirmed Gorsuch for a court of appeals seat by unanimous consent in 2006. That means there was no roll call vote, but news articles at the time show no dissent in the Senate. (Our fact-checking friends at Snopes previously looked at similar claims.) Gorsuch in 2006 Gorsuch was nominated by President George W. Bush on May 10, 2006, for a seat on the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 10th Circuit based in Colorado. His nomination drew scant media attention and few comments from senators. On the day his name was announced, the Democratic senator from Colorado, Ken Salazar, didn’t instantly commit to backing him but offered early praise: ""I have recently met with Mr. Gorsuch and believe he has impressive credentials."" The Denver Post wrote that Gorsuch glided through a 20-minute Senate Judiciary Committee hearing June 21. Salazar and Colorado’s Republican senator, Wayne Allard, ""introduced Gorsuch, both giving glowing reviews,"" the Post wrote. That committee approved Gorsuch by a voice vote on July 13. When Gorsuch moved on to the full Senate July 20, Salazar had more praise for the ""intelligent, thoughtful and appreciative"" nominee, saying Gorsuch met a ""very high test"" to join the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, opened his remarks in an earlier hearing by saying Gorsuch's record showed he ""appears to be a very conservative nominee."" But before the Senate July 20, Leahy was on board with the nomination of Gorsuch and three other nominees: ""I am pleased that the Republican leadership has scheduled debate and consideration of these nominations and am glad that the Republican leadership is taking notice of the fact that we can cooperate on swift consideration and confirmation of nominations. Working together, we can confirm four judges today. "" A transcript of the July 20 Senate meeting shows no senator objected to Gorsuch and he was confirmed in a voice vote. (When the vote happened, one person is heard saying ""aye"" and no one objected.) McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart said that any member could have gone on record with an objection but none did. ""The Congressional Record lists no objections,"" he said. ""There was unanimous consent to the vote."" Republicans have noted that Democrats in the Senate at the time include some major party heavyweights: Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Harry Reid. However, the majority of current senators were not in the Senate in 2006. And the stakes now are higher, says Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor. ""Senators may view the prospects of confirming a nominee to the court of appeals differently than they view a nominee for the Supreme Court,"" she said. ""The stakes of confirming someone to the Supreme Court are really just so much higher and more salient to the public. Senators should scrutinize any lifetime appointment to the bench -- but especially those to the Supreme Court."" Many judicial nominees have sailed through confirmation by unanimous consent or in a unanimous roll call vote. But the process has become more acrimonious in recent years, and roll call votes became more common under the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Binder said that recorded roll call votes on appellate court nominees were very rare before 1997. ""Starting in late 1990s, Republicans in the Senate majority started to call for recorded votes as a way to put senators on record for or against Bill Clinton's judicial nominees,"" she said. ""Since then, recorded votes have been more likely (as have cloture votes on those nominees)."" Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert at the Brookings Institution, pulled together data on circuit court nominations during the presidencies of Clinton, Bush and Obama using the U.S. Senate website, the Federal Judicial Center’s Biographical Directory of Federal Judges, Congress’s ""Presidential Nominations"" website, and Congressional Record reports. During Bush’s tenure when Gorsuch was confirmed, Wheeler’s data shows 12 circuit court nominees confirmed through voice votes and 30 through roll call votes that were unanimous. There were three confirmation votes in which there was only one ""no"" vote and 14 in which there were multiple ""no"" votes. Decades ago it was common for nominations to sail through without objections from the opposing party, ""but things have gotten more contentious,"" Wheeler said. Our ruling McConnell said, ""Not a single Democrat opposed Neil Gorsuch's confirmation in 2006."" Gorsuch was approved by unanimous consent by the Senate for a court of appeals seat during Bush’s presidency. That means no roll call vote was required, but senators could have raised objections but none did. The majority of circuit court confirmations under Bush occurred through unanimous consent or by a roll call vote that was unanimous.

America’s refugee vetting robust, not ‘haphazard’ as Calif. congressman claims
","Background checks on refugees seeking to enter the United States are among the most stringent in the world. California Congressman Tom McClintock recently claimed, however, those screenings were anything but strict under the Obama Administration. ""The vetting was very haphazard,"" McClintock said in a Jan. 31, 2017, interview with Capital Public Radio. ""In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants."" McClintock is a Republican from the Sacramento area. In the interview, McClintock said he supports President Donald Trump’s immigration order, which temporarily bans all refugees from entering the country and indefinitely bars Syrian refugees. In addition to the refugee halt, Trump’s executive action also suspends immigration for citizens of seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days. They are: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. McClintock said Trump is rightly taking time to create a new vetting system because, as he put it, Obama’s was ""very haphazard."" Given the ongoing immigration debate, we decided to fact-check McClintock’s statement. Before we start, here’s some background on refugees: The federal government defines a refugee as any person outside of the U.S. that is of special humanitarian concern to the U.S. and ""has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,"" according to the Pew Research Center. Trump’s executive action affects many categories of immigrants from students to employees to refugees. Refugees, notably, have not been the primary perpetrators of any of the country’s major terror attacks that killed Americans in recent decades. Trump has said his order was necessary to ensure national security. Our research When asked about McClintock’s claim, Jennifer Cressy, a spokeswoman for the congressman said he was referring to testimony Congress received in 2015 from federal law enforcement that ""the vetting process hinges on the word of the applicant due to lack of reliable documentary proof of identity."" That testimony focused on Syrian refugees, which have accounted for a small but growing share of refugees admitted to the country. As our national partner PolitiFact has reported, there are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees. No system is foolproof. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015 that the intelligence in Syria is ""not as rich as we would like it to be,"" while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are ""gaps"" in data availability. The lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, told PolitiFact in November 2015. CIS advocates for limited immigration. There are examples of refugees accepted under Obama who joined, or attempted to join, terror networks in the Middle East after arriving in the United States. Cressy, McClintock’s spokeswoman, pointed to Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, a refugee who after arriving in the U.S. traveled to Syria to fight for the Nusra Front, and then returned to settle in Sacramento. He is awaiting trial on terrorism charges. There are no examples, however, of any refugee committing fatal terror attacks on U.S. soil since the 1970s. More than three million refugees have arrived in the country since that time, making the odds of an American falling victim to a refugee in a terror attack miniscule, as PolitiFact California recently examined. McClintock’s claims about ""very haphazard vetting"" and that ""we simply accepted the word of applicants"" are overly broad and do not match up with how refugee screenings work. Refugee advocate responds Karen Ferguson is executive director of the Northern California International Rescue Committee, which helps resettle refugees in the United States. She responded to McClintock’s claim in an interview on Capital Public Radio’s Insight show early this month. ""The idea that it would be haphazard is erroneous,"" Ferguson said. ""The vetting system now takes anywhere from 16 to 36 months. It includes screenings from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, State Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, and the U.S. Intelligence Community."" ""There have always been multiple interviews, additional interviews,"" Ferguson added. ""So, the vetting process is already there. And this statement that it’s been haphazard needs to be countered. It’s not true. And (refugee vetting) has been proven to be effective."" For a fact-check in November 2015, PolitiFact spoke with experts and advocates who pushed back on the notion that the United States accepts refugees with no intelligence at all. In contrast to refugees worldwide, Syrians tend to have identity documents and the reasons they give for missing documents (i.e. a barrel bomb dropping on their house) can be verified, according to the State Department. Steps in vetting process The U.S. refugee admissions process has been in place since 1980 and was strengthened after 9/11. PolitiFact has outlined its many steps this way: Before refugees even face U.S. vetting, they must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations is the main authority that determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This can take four to 10 months. Once the cases are referred to the United States, refugees are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Typically, about half of refugees are turned down, according to the State Department. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. For Syrian refugees, there’s one additional step. Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. McClintock’s claim about ""haphazard vetting"" comes as the U.S. grapples with how to ensure Syrian refugees are fully-vetted. Advocates for the stronger vetting, including the congressman, have described Syria as ""a hot-bed for terrorism."" Experts on this process, however, say the United States has successfully vetted refugees from similarly challenging countries in the past. ""We’ve also resettled thousands in recent years from the Central African Republic, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have faced similar terrorist threats and have unstable governments that present challenges for the vetting process. But we’ve done this successfully time and time again without incident,"" Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, told PolitiFact in 2015. Our ruling California Rep. Tom McClintock recently claimed refugee vetting was very haphazard,"" under the Obama Administration. ""In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants."" Federal law enforcement told Congress in 2015 that there are gaps in the available data for Syrian refugees, which represented a small but growing share of the refugees admitted to the United States under Obama. All sides in this debate acknowledge no vetting system is foolproof. McClintock’s claim about a ""haphazard system,"" however, ignores the facts. The United Nations examines refugee applications and designates a small fraction as eligible. From there, refugees under consideration by the U.S. undergo a strict process that can last up to three years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Of the more than 3 million refugees admitted to the country since 1980, none has carried out a fatal terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Advocates for the process say this is evidence the vetting works and is already robust. Given the challenges with Syrian refugee vetting, there’s an element of truth in McClintock’s statement. But his claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Fact-checking Kellyanne Conway on the 'Bowling Green massacre'
","When White House counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared at a town hall event with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, she mentioned ""the Bowling Green massacre"" -- a terrorist attack that, the social media world would quickly determine, did not exist. This exchange stemmed from her defense of President Donald Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days and putting Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. (We go over some of the key issues in this explainer.) Trump’s action inspired protests, but Trump and others in his administration cited as a precedent an action taken by the Obama administration. ""My policy is similar to what President (Barack) Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,"" Trump said. Specifically, the government instituted new background checks for visa applicants from Iraq and expanded screening for Iraqi refugees who had already settled in the United States. (We largely disagreed that the two actions were equivalent, so we rated Trump’s statement Mostly False.) So what does any of this this have to do with Bowling Green, a city in western Kentucky? The Obama-era action was taken after a failed plot by Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green to send money, explosives and weapons overseas to al-Qaida. The two men were arrested by the FBI in May 2011 for actions committed in Iraq and trying to assist overseas terrorist groups. That’s the context in which Conway brought it up during a town hall at American University on Feb. 2, 2017. ""I bet it's brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,"" she said. After some cross-talk between Conway and Matthews, Conway added that the incident ""didn't get covered."" So there was indeed a terrorism-related situation in Bowling Green, Ky., but it wasn’t a ""massacre."" No one died in Bowling Green. And before long, social media lit up with mockery of Conway, from reminders of a 2013 football blowout of Northern Illinois University by Bowling Green State University to a website for the mythical Bowling Green Massacre Victims Fund. Lots of wags added that it was no wonder that the media didn’t cover the massacre because … it didn’t happen. The next morning, Conway clarified matters on Twitter. She tweeted, ""On @hardball @NBCNews @MSNBC I meant to say ‘Bowling Green terrorists’ as reported here."" She also tweeted that ""honest mistakes abound."" So Conway has publicly acknowledged her error. Still, we thought it would be important to clear the air about what actually happened and what did not. The account below is largely taken from a fact-check we originally published on Sept. 23, 2014, in which we gave a False rating to the statement that, ""In 2011, (the Islamic State) attempted to attack Fort Knox"" in Kentucky. That was just one of a number of inaccurate statements circulating at the time about terrorist activities in and around Bowling Green, Ky. On Feb. 3, 2017, we ran our original fact-check by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, and he said that our original account remains accurate. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Iraqi nationals in Kentucky The details of the Kentucky case were indeed alarming. In September 2009, the FBI, based on a tip, launched an investigation into an Iraqi, Waad Ramadan Alwan, who was living in Bowling Green. A confidential source for the FBI started talking with Alwan in 2011. Alwan discussed how he previously worked as a bombmaker in Iraq. He boasted about blowing up American Hummers and targeting U.S. soldiers, claiming he used improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, hundreds of times, according to court documents. The FBI even matched a fingerprint from Alwan to an unexploded IED that was discovered by the military in 2005. (There’s a warehouse outside of Washington, D.C., that houses thousands of bombs found by the military). That enabled investigators to determine that Alwan had likely killed U.S. troops while in Iraq. The confidential source continued to meet with Alwan and recruited him to assist in an operation in the United States to send explosives, firearms and money to al-Qaida of Iraq. Al-Qaida of Iraq later morphed into the Islamic State or ISIS, according to terrorism experts. The sting On five occasions, Alwan helped procure and load money and weapons he believed were going to help al-Qaida of Iraq fight U.S. troops. In January 2011, Alwan recruited a friend to assist him — Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, another Iraqi who had moved to Bowling Green after first living in Las Vegas. Alwan and Hammadi entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork. From January to May 2011, the two worked together on five missions to send grenade launchers, machine guns, explosives, sniper rifles, hand grenades, missile launchers and $565,000 to al-Qaida of Iraq. Of course, this was all a sting operation. While Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping insurgents in Iraq, in reality, the FBI was monitoring all of their actions -- a common tactic for sting operations involving suspected terrorists. The weapons, which the FBI rendered unusable, were merely transferred from one location under FBI control to another. In May 2011, Alwan and Hammadi were arrested. In December 2011, Alwan pleaded guilty to a 23-count indictment, including conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad and multiple charges of weapons and terrorist activities. Hammadi pleaded guilty to a 12-count indictment, including attempting to provide material support to terrorists. For cooperating with authorities, Alwan received a reduced sentence of 40 years in prison followed by a lifetime under house arrest. Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison. The charges None of the charges filed against Alwan and Hammadi were for domestic terrorism plots. They were not convicted of any crimes related to domestic terrorism. All of the charges against these individuals were for actions committed while in Iraq or for trying to assist terrorist groups operating overseas. PolitiFact has combed through hundreds of pages of court documents that were available online. The only conceivable reference to any other terrorist activity is in Hammadi’s appeal of his sentence. There, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote: ""Hammadi and Alwan also plotted to murder a U.S. Army Captain whom they knew from Iraq."" An ABC investigative report had a few more details: ""Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home — and to possibly attack other homeland targets."" We should also note that while Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping a predecessor of the Islamic State, al-Qaida of Iraq had no communication with them. At root, this was a case of two Iraqis with dangerous backgrounds who were duped by the FBI into believing they were helping Islamic insurgents fight Americans overseas. Conway’s statement So how does Conway’s original (and now inoperative) statement stack up? Most importantly, there was no ""massacre"" in or around Bowling Green that was either carried out or attempted. In addition, while the two men were charged with serious crimes and were sentenced accordingly, it’s important to remember that everything that happened was part of a sting operation by the FBI. This means that the people of Bowling Green were not endangered at any point, and that the entire incident can be viewed as a law-enforcement success. The fact that it was a sting undercuts Conway’s use of the word ""masterminds."" Conway also said the event ""wasn’t covered"" by the media. We used the Nexis database to search media reports from around the time of the arrest and found that it wasn’t a huge, newscycle-dominating story. But several major news outlets did cover the story when it broke, including CNN, CBS and the Associated Press. And they also covered the debate that followed — including the call by some members of Congress to send the Iraqis to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the fact that it exposed a gap in the refugee screening process. In her tweet correcting her statement on MSNBC, Conway linked to a news story about the two Iraqis and other refugees, a 2013 article by ABC, headlined, ""US May Have Let 'Dozens' of Terrorists Into Country As Refugees."" Our ruling Conway said that ""two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. … It didn't get covered."" Put simply, there was no massacre. While Conway admitted her mistake the following morning -- and we're happy she did -- it's important to make sure the record is crystal clear. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8550f4d4-9408-4f33-899d-ec9ca31437a9",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD7D080>],/factchecks/2017/feb/03/kellyanne-conway/fact-checking-kellyanne-conways-bowling-green-mass/

Old Internet claim that Obama will be on new $1 bill is still wrong
","A persistent, false claim running on numerous blogs says former President Barack Obama will replace George Washington on the $1 bill this year. The report is actually worthless. ""Barrack Obama will be on new $1 dollar bill 2017,"" reads a headline on a Jan. 26, 2017, post on TrueAmericans.me. It included a illustration (shown above) of what such a dollar may look like. The same site posted a poll asking readers whether they supported the move. The claim was flagged by Facebook, which is trying to crack down on fabricated articles that resemble real news. The false story, complete with the misspelling of ""Barack,"" appeared on several other websites in January. The story says Obama will displace George Washington, and that the public will be able to help choose from among several designs — in early 2016. That’s an easy clue that this fake story is both wrong and outdated. For the record, Obama will not be going on the $1 bill, although some new bill designs (including a $20 featuring Harriet Tubman) are in the works. The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing says there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill, because it’s seldom the target of counterfeiting. There are also some legal roadblocks. The U.S. Treasury does not permit living people to be on currency notes, and Congress has prohibited a redesign of the single greenback in its omnibus spending measures. The vending machine lobby convinced lawmakers to leave the dollar alone, mostly because it would be expensive for vendors to upgrade bill readers to recognize cash sans Washington. It’s hard to tell where the idea of Obama headlining the base unit of American currency originated, but contrived news stories about it go back to at least 2012. Supermarket tabloid Weekly World News ran a story falsely saying the Obama administration had approved a new design for all bills, including a dollar featuring the 44th president that would be worth 47 cents. The story made reference to the Dollar ReDe$ign Project, a branding experiment going back to 2010 that solicited new currency designs. Other blogs reran the Weekly World News story as fact. We found the version of the story currently in circulation on blogs going back to 2014, with the same faux dollar illustration. The United States Mint did strike a pair of bronze medals commemorating Obama’s two terms in office. You can buy replicas of both, but they are not legal tender. You also can buy several forms of joke bills featuring Obama from private online vendors, including denominations of $44, $2,008 and even $1 million. But Obama appearing on any real currency, like making it onto the United Federation of Britain’s $50 in the 2012 remake of Total Recall, will remain fictional for now.

Testing Paul Ryan claim on Obamacare premium increases of up to 116 percent
","U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has received a lot of criticism (and a False rating from us) for his claims that actuaries say Obamacare is in a ""death spiral."" But it’s far from his only criticism of the former president’s trademark health care law. Ryan has repeatedly brought up rising premiums as well, notably in his Jan. 5, 2017 weekly briefing where he ran off a list of increases for 2017. ""This law is hurting people right now. I mean, look at these premium increases,"" the Janesville Republican said, then ticked off a series of states. ""This year Arizona, 116 percent increase in premiums. Tennessee, 63 percent increase in premiums. Oklahoma, 69 percent increase in premiums. Illinois, 43 percent increase in premiums. North Carolina, 40 percent increase in premiums. Nebraska, 51 percent. Pennsylvania, 53 percent. These aren’t statistics, these are real lives,"" he said. ""These are real families facing huge premium increases."" Are the premium increases Ryan cited correct, ""hurting people right now"" and attributable to Obamacare? Numbers are on the mark The basic numbers are easy to confirm: Those increases are indeed accurate for 2017 compared to 2016 within the Obamacare marketplace. Arizona has by far the largest increase in the nation, and Oklahoma is second. The states all are among the Top 10 in percentage increase over 2016, according to estimates the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released in October 2016. As such, they are not a representative sample of all 50 states, but Ryan never claimed they were. And they are the headlines in a clear national trend. Premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Only one state (Indiana) saw premiums drop in 2017. The calculation is based on the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old, a plan widely used as a benchmark to compare rates between years and geographic areas. Premiums affect many people Ryan’s description of the law as ""hurting people right now"" is a bit subjective, but it’s clear enough for us to examine since he later expanded on this by referencing ""families facing huge premium increases."" Obamacare supporters often claim premium increases are irrelevant due to the subsidies built into Obamacare. Those subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (that’s $48,240 in 2017 for a single person). For 2017, 81 percent of consumers enrolled in the marketplace through Dec. 24, 2016 were in line to receive a subsidy. That means 19% of those insured will receive no subsidy and therefore bear the full weight of those premium increases (assuming they stay on the same plan). That’s more than 2 million people, based on the latest enrollment data. Fair to attribute increase to Obamacare? The final hurdle for Ryan’s claim is the matter of blame. He says the law itself is hurting people right now — in other words, that increases due to Obamacare go beyond the general trend of rising health care costs. This year’s 25 percent increase is by far the largest since Obamacare began. Premiums rose around 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015, based on the HHS analysis of the same benchmark plan. For starters, that jump is far beyond what is expected industry wide. The National Business Group on Health estimates employees of the nation’s largest businesses — an indicator of overall health insurance costs — will see about a 5 percent premium increase in 2017, based on a survey of 425 large employers. Obamacare premiums are rising far more in part because of several mechanisms built into the healthcare law that have ended or not worked as intended — reinsurance and risk corridors. Both were set up as temporary measures from 2014 to 2016 to subsidize the marketplace, artificially keeping prices low. Reinsurance was designed to reduce the incentive for insurers to charge higher premiums to higher-cost policyholders in the first years of Obamacare, which was accomplished by transferring funds to the plans for those policyholders. Risk corridors were designed to transfer money from profitable insurers to those losing money on the ACA exchange, discourage insurers from setting high premiums due to the uncertainty of the new market. They were originally pitched as a mechanism that would bring in money, then as one that would break even. But the latest data shows in 2015 claims from insurers for payment through the program outweighed the money paid in by $5.8 billion, so the expected funds weren’t available to redistribute. Now that the programs have ended as designed, premiums are rising to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer plans in the marketplace. This is by no means an exhaustive accounting of the factors driving 2017 premiums upward. Experts say general growth in health care costs still play a role, as do changes in who is signing up, provider networks and the small group market, among others. Our rating Ryan said soaring Obamacare premiums are ""hurting people right now,"" including one state with an increase of 116 percent. The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren’t eligible for subsidies. And while we can’t exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up. The missing nuance in Ryan’s claim is that it doesn’t acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn’t have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we’ll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE42C40>],/factchecks/2017/feb/03/paul-ryan/testing-paul-ryan-claim-obamacare-premium-increase/

Kellyanne Conway wrongly says this is longest the U.S. has gone without a Treasury secretary
","White House counselor Kellyanne Conway blasted Senate Democrats for holding up Cabinet nominee appointments and said their delay has unprecedented consequences. ""I was told yesterday, that this is longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, at least in modern times,"" Conway said Feb. 2 on Fox and Friends. ""If it's not the longest, it's darn close to it."" This piqued our interest. Is this really the longest the United States has gone without a secretary of the Treasury? Well, no. In fact, you don’t have to look that far back to find a longer period of time when the United States was without a president-appointed, Senate-confirmed Treasury secretary. Donald Trump nominated longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin to fill the Treasury secretary position in late November. The Department of the Treasury oversees financial and monetary matters, and its secretary is fifth in the presidential line of succession. Since Jan. 20, 2017, Adam Jacob Szubin has served as acting Treasury secretary — taking over the job from former President Barack Obama’s appointment, Jack Lew. So over the past two weeks, there has actually been someone in place overseeing the agency’s business, unlike what Conway intimated. An incoming administration also has the power to designate acting heads of the various departments until the confirmation process is over. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee delayed a vote on Mnuchin Jan. 30 by refusing to attend the meeting, denying Republicans the number of Democrats they need to go forward with a vote. (The Democrats did the same thing for other Trump appointment Rep. Tom Price, the health and human services nominee.) The issue they had with Mnuchin, they said, was that he made misleading statements during his nomination hearing about whether his former bank, OneWest, used automated ""robo-signings"" of foreclosure documents. But Republicans fought back, changed procedural rules and advanced the nominee through the committee Feb. 1. His nomination will now move on to the full Senate. Conway said that this is the longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, but there have been longer periods with an acting secretary. When former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner left the post in 2013, Obama nominated Jack Lew to replace him on Jan. 10, 2013. Geithner left office on Jan. 25, and Lew was not confirmed until Feb. 27, 2013. From Jan. 25, 2013, to Feb. 27, 2013, Neal Wolin served as acting secretary. Adding up the days in that gap show the United States did not have an officially appointed Treasury secretary for 34 days, obviously longer than the 14-day window Conway mentioned Feb. 2.   Going back a little further to the transition of power from former President George W. Bush to Obama in 2009, there was a only a seven-day gap between when acting Treasury Secretary Stuart Levy served and Geithner took office. Bush nominated three Treasury secretaries during his tenure, all with varying times before taking office. The first nomination was Paul O’Neill in 2001. He only served until Dec. 31, 2002, so Bush nominated John Snow on Jan. 13, 2003, to fill his spot. Snow wasn’t appointed until Feb. 3, 2003, so Kenneth Dam served as acting secretary from Dec. 31, 2002, to Feb. 3, 2003. That’s 35 days. After Snow, Bush nominated Henry M. Paulson in 2006. Before he was confirmed, Robert Kimmitt was acting Treasury secretary for 11 days. Conway’s slight walkback that if Mnuchin’s wait is the longest ever — if not ""darn close"" — doesn’t hold up. Our ruling Conway said, ""This is longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, at least in modern times. If it's not the longest, it's darn close to it."" Conway is wrong. The United States didn’t have a president-appointed, Senate-confirmed secretary of Treasury for 34 days in 2013. Mnuchin’s confirmation could drag out longer, but Conway made this claim on Feb. 2, 14 days after inauguration.
