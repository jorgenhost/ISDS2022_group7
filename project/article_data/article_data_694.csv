Is Jim Justice the first West Virginia governor to fight for teacher pay raises?
","West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, facing a competitive Republican primary in 2020, recently introduced an ad touting his accomplishments in office, including a focus on K-12 education. The ad, released in a Dec. 4 tweet, features several West Virginians reading off a series of scripted accomplishments from Justice’s tenure. One of the accomplishments, voiced by a teacher, is that ""Jim Justice is the first West Virginia governor to fight for pay raises for educators."" Governor @JimJusticeWV’s campaign released a new television ad titled “Right Reasons” today. The ad highlights successes during his time in office, including creating jobs, growing the economy, a ten percent pay raise for educators, and getting results for West Virginians. #WVGov pic.twitter.com/ujWxekP34h This struck us as odd, since governors of all parties regularly tout their support for teachers — a group that’s popular with voters and, in many states, a politically powerful constituency. Teacher salaries have been an especially sensitive issue in West Virginia. Between 2005 and 2017, West Virginia teacher salaries never rose higher than 44th in the nation. That history set the stage for a 2018 teacher strike in West Virginia, which was the state’s first major K-12 walkout in almost three decades. Justice eventually signed a 5% pay bump, which is more than the legislature had offered prior to the strike. So is Justice really the first West Virginia governor ever to push for teacher pay raises? His office did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we found that each of Justice’s five immediate predecessors either proposed or enacted teacher pay raises. In his first state of the state address in 2011, Tomblin proposed a one-time, across-the-board $800 increase for teachers. ""Frankly, it should be more and we need to strive for a day when our teachers are paid at a rate equivalent to the most important role they play,"" he said in the speech, according to the Associated Press. In 2014, despite offering few increases in his relatively austere budget proposal, Tomblin did include a 2% pay raise for teachers. The bill he eventually signed contained a $1,000 raise for teachers for the 2014-2015 school year.  As governor, Manchin — now a U.S. Senator — periodically sparred with teachers’ unions over the size of his salary increase proposals. But both Manchin’s Senate office and West Virginia teachers’ unions agree that he proposed a teacher salary increase and signed it into law. During his tenure, Manchin raised teacher salaries by 3.5%, according to a joint statement released by the West Virginia Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, and the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association when the groups endorsed Manchin’s Senate reelection bid in 2018. Manchin’s Senate office cited the same 3.5% increase when we inquired. The legislation Manchin signed also improved teachers’ annual salary increments and allowed educators to move from a 401(k)-style defined contribution plans to a defined-benefit system. In his 2001 state of the state address, Wise proposed raising teacher salaries by $1,000, plus $2,500 in incentives. ""Teachers are the heart of the educational system. We must honor the work of our teachers,"" he said. After leaving the governor’s office, Wise became CEO of the Alliance for Excellent Education, an education advocacy group. In his 1998 state of the state address, Underwood proposed giving teachers a $750 pay raise. He signed a three-year pay raise into law later that year. Caperton was governor during a divisive, 11-day West Virginia teacher strike in 1990, but he ended up presiding over a significant pay increase for the state’s teachers. The strike was settled when all parties agreed on a $5,000 pay increase phased in over three years. Last year, PolitiFact reported that most significant recent improvement in West Virginia teacher pay compared to other states came between 1990 and 2000, a period during which Caperton and Underwood were in office. Like Wise, Caperton headed an education group — the College Board — after serving as governor. Justice’s ad said he’s ""the first West Virginia governor to fight for pay raises for educators."" That’s far off-base. Seeking pay raises for teachers is practically a rite of passage for governors, and West Virginia is no exception. Not one, not two, but each of Justice’s five most recent predecessors — Tomblin, Manchin, Wise, Underwood, and Caperton — either proposed a teacher pay raise, signed one into law, or both.

Is Jim Justice right about growth in West Virginia tourism?
","West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice took to Facebook in October to tout gains in his state’s tourism industry. ""When I took office, I made tourism a top priority because I knew it had all the potential in the world,"" Justice wrote in his post. ""Today I am proud to announce that West Virginia’s tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58%! Way to go West Virginia Tourism!""  The post linked to a press release that provided additional detail and cited a study conducted by  Dean Runyan Associates, an economic consulting firm that has examined the state’s tourism industry annually since 2000. A year ago, we fact-checked how well Justice described the previous year’s statistics and rated it Mostly True, because Justice glossed over some of the report’s negative findings. How about this year? Let’s take a look, point by point. (Justice’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) This is accurate.  The report found that overall spending on tourism in West Virginia grew from $4.14 billion in 2016 to $4.28 billion in 2017 to $4.55 billion in 2018. That’s an increase in the most recent year of 6.5%, easily exceeding the rate of inflation. Spending also grew for the second straight year if you set aside gambling revenue. It rose from $3.48 billion in 2016 to to $3.63 billion in 2017 to $3.91 billion in 2018. That’s an increase in the most recent year of 7.5%. This also exceeded the rate of inflation. This is accurate, too. According to the data in the report, the rise over the past two years came after four consecutive annual declines, as this chart shows:   The report also provides data for the national tourism market that’s comparable to the West Virginia numbers. According to the report, spending was $980 billion in 2018, a 4.1% increase over 2017. (These figures are not adjusted for inflation, but neither is the West Virginia figure, so the national and state figures can be compared equitably.) Justice’s 58% figure appears to come from comparing the most recent one-year increase in West Virginia (6.5%) with the most recent one-year increase nationally (4.1%). The West Virginia percentage increase is 58.5% bigger than the national increase. Justice said, ""West Virginia’s tourism industry has grown for the second consecutive year, reversing years of decline and outpacing national growth by 58 percent.""  These numbers align with the findings of a longstanding annual study of the West Virginia and national tourism economies.

What religious exemptions exist for justices of the peace in Texas?
","During an interview on a Fort Worth radio program with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, host Chris Salcedo pressed his guest about the case of a Waco justice of the peace who was sanctioned by a state commission earlier this month for only officiating opposite sex, but not same-sex, marriages. The State Commission on Judicial Conduct issued Justice of the Peace Dianne Hensley a public warning over her refusal to perform same-sex ceremonies; the commission could take further action if she refuses to stop the practice. Paxton, a Republican, reiterated the stance of his office, one that has not changed since just after the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage. He said people are entitled to religious exemptions when it would violate their faith to carry out the duties of their job. On the show, Salcedo characterized the case as such: ""I shouldn’t have to give up my career — make a choice, either give up your career or violate your religious beliefs,"" Salcedo said. ""The government shouldn’t put me in that position."" Saledo’s description of Hensely’s situation is inaccurate. No one is asking Hensley to violate her religious beliefs to keep her career: officiating marriages is an optional activity. A state commission’s opinion on the matter suggested she could officiate all or no marriages, but not selectively choose one type. Protection of religious beliefs Justices of the peace handle low-level civil and criminal cases, including traffic and other Class C misdemeanor cases and civil cases involving up to $10,000. They can also officiate marriages, but this is considered ""extra-judicial,"" an optional activity that earns them thousands per year in personal income. So while there may be some financial incentive to do it, it is by no means required.  In fact, some justices of the peace in Texas have chosen not to officiate any marriages in order to avoid the religious dilemma, including in McLennan County, where Hensley hails. The commission decided to investigate Hensley based at least in part on a Waco Herald-Tribune article in which she was quoted about her decision to decline same-sex marriages and how she believed she was entitled to a religious accommodation. It found that she had refused to perform same-sex marriages since 2016, instead only performing opposite-sex marriages and referring same-sex couples to other officiating JPs and clergy. The state commission that sanctioned Hensley said her actions cast ""doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person’s sexual orientation."" Now, Hensley can appeal the sanction, start performing same-sex marriages or stop performing marriages altogether. Hensley has argued that she is entitled to a ""religious exemption,"" but there is no law or legal precedent in Texas establishing such an exemption for a justice of the peace in this context. This question varies by state, depending on whether the state’s Supreme Court has taken up a case and established a precedent.  In separate interviews, Douglas Laycock and John Dzienkowski, law professors at the University of Texas, said they weren’t aware of any such cases in Texas.  Two legal opinions on the subject that have been issued by state agencies — a 2015 opinion from the attorney general’s office and the Judicial Commission sanction — are nonbinding. In a 2015 opinion filed after the U.S. Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage, Paxton supported people’s right to assert a religious exemption under the First Amendment, though he noted that fines and litigation were possible. The recent Judicial Commission opinion punished Henlsey for giving off the appearance of bias, seeming to indicate an exemption would not be possible. But Laycock said neither document is legally binding. ""The basic answer is we don’t know yet,"" Laycock said. ""This may well wind up in the courts."" Some states, such as North Carolina, have passed laws on this subject, but Texas has not.  The North Carolina law allows some officials, similar to a justice of the peace, to decline to administer any marriages if they have a ""sincerely held religious objection"" to same-sex marriage, but they may not be selective and only marry opposite-sex couples. Other positions have different requirements People in other government positions, like county clerks who issue marriage licenses, have less flexibility, as issuing marriage licenses can be part of their job description.  Perhaps most famously, Kim Davis, a clerk in Kentucky, refused to issue a license to a same-sex couple and, in a high-profile case, she was sued. When she refused to comply with the judge’s order compelling her to follow the law, she was jailed for six days for being in contempt of court. Davis was later released after agreeing not to interfere with other clerks in the office issuing licenses. Some county clerks in Texas are allowing those officials who object to same-sex marriage to find another clerk within the office to issue a license in their place. But if everyone else in the office also refuses, the office as a whole can’t deny a couple the right to marry in defiance of the law, Laycock said. That may explain why no religious exemption case has risen to the Supreme Court level in Texas, Laycock said. As long as the couple receives their license or has their marriage officiated, the damages they can claim in court are limited to emotional distress. That someone in Hensley’s position should not be forced to choose between their job and religious belief, as Salcedo commented, is ""not a settled rule of law yet; it’s an opinion about what the law ought to be,"" Laycock said. Our ruling Salcedo said justices of the peace like Hensley are being asked to choose: ""give up your career or violate your religious beliefs."" Justices of the peace are not required to officiate marriages and do so mainly for their own benefit, not as an integral duty of the job. Clerks, on occasion, may not have the luxury of that choice, but that is not what Salcedo called out in the statement. Plus, there hasn’t been an authoritative ruling in Texas on either situation.

Would a Virginia bill really ban dads from teaching sons how to use hunting rifles?
","A prolific conspiracy theorist is sounding a ""TYRANNY ALERT"" about a bill introduced in the state Senate that he claims would ban firearms training and martial arts instruction in Virginia. ""It would even criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle,"" wrote Mike Adams in a Nov. 27, 2019 post on NewsTarget, one of several websites he operates that are anti-vaccine, critical of science, and promote guns and survivalism.  Adams is based in Cody,  Wyo. In June 2019, Facebook revoked an Adams’ page promoting alternative medicine for violating spam rules. The page, called NaturalNews, reportedly had 2.9 million Facebook likes. Adam’s recent post on Virginia centers on a bill recently introduced by state Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, that would add restrictions to Virginia’s paramilitary activities laws. Passed in 1987, the laws make it a felony to assemble - or teach how to assemble - guns, explosives or incendiary devices with the intention of abetting civil disorder. Violators face a maximum 10 years in prison and $2,500 fine. Lucas’ bill would also make it a felony for people to gather ""with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons by drilling, parading, or marching with any firearm, any explosive or incendiary device, or any components or combination thereof."" It comes after the August 2017 white supremicist rally in Charlottesville that left one counterprotestor dead and others injured.  Adams wrote that the bill, in addition to banning a father from teaching his son how to hunt with a rifle, ""would also criminalize all firearms training classes, including concealed carry classes."" He added, ""The law would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons.""   In fact, the legislation would do none of these things. Lucas’ bill, as we noted, adds to the list of illegal acts and Virginia’s paramilitary laws. But it leaves intact the next section of the code, which which exempts from paramilitary laws: *""Any activity, undertaken without knowledge of or intent to cause or further a civil disorder, which is intended to teach or practice self defense or self-defense techniques such as karate clubs..."" *""Lawful activities related to firearms instruction or training intended to teach the safe handling and use of firearms.""  *""Lawful sports or activities related to the individual recreational use or possession of firearms."" We tried to contact Adams, but received no reply to three emails sent to an address on one of his websites for media inquiries. A person answereing the phone in Adams' media relations office, who didn’t give her name, told us ""there probably won’t be a response."" It should be noted that Lucas introduced identical bills in each of the last two years that were killed in Republican-controlled Senate committees. GOP senators voiced concern that the bill would be hard to enforce and might violate citizens’ constitutional right to assemble. Videos of the hearings show no one raising concerns that the bill would affect firearms training or self-defense instruction. The bill may face better prospects this year, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly for the first time this century. Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, has endorsed the legislation. Our ruling Adams wrote that a bill in the General Assembly ""would criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle."" That’s flat out wrong. The bill would add a clause to the state’s paramilitary laws making it a felony for groups to train or march with weapons with ""the intent of intimidating others."" The bill, however, does not change a code section that exempts from the paramilitary act ""lawful activities related to firearms instruction."" Another ridiculous Adams’ claim: The bill ""would instantly transform all martial arts instructors into criminal felons."" State paramilitary laws specifically exempt common efforts to  ""teach or practice self defense or self-defense techniques such as karate clubs."" Adam’s claims are devoid of truth and inflammatory.

No, koalas are not ‘functionally extinct,’ but they are in trouble
","As catastrophic bushfires spread across parts of Australia, misinformation about one of the region’s most beloved animals, the koala, spreads, too. Areas of Australia started to burn in September 2019, marking an early start to the region’s fire season and scorching more than 5 million acres in News South Wales and parts of Queensland.  When the fires became international news, online stories – like this one – went viral with shocking headlines that claim koalas are now ""functionally extinct"" as a result of the blaze. It is true that several hundred koalas have died in the bushfires (some estimates put the death toll in the thousands) and large swaths of the marsupial’s habitat have been destroyed. However, the claim that koalas are ""functionally extinct"" is inaccurate. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It appears that the idea that koalas are ""functionally extinct"" started when the Australian Koala Foundation, a local conservation nonprofit that advocates for koala protection and preservation, released a statement in May 2019 calling on Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to enact the Koala Protection Act, which was written in 2016. ""The Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) believes Koalas may be functionally extinct in the entire landscape of Australia,"" the statement says. ""The AKF thinks there are no more than 80,000 Koalas in Australia."" Since the fires, the organization released another statement in October 2019 standing by its use of the term.  Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the US-based Center for Biological Diversity, told PolitiFact there are two different definitions of ""functionally extinct."" One is that a species still occurs in the wild but can’t effectively reproduce, so is all but extinct. The other, is that a species is so reduced that it can no longer play its role in the ecosystem. Neither definition, he says, applies to the koala. The koala population is indeed declining, but AKF’s estimate is much lower than other assessments.  The International Union for Conservation (IUCN), the global authority on the conservation status of all species, approximates that 300,000 mature adult koalas remain in the wild, and lists the species as vulnerable, a step above endangered and two above critically endangered.  But IUCN last assessed the koala population in 2014, and the species may very well be worse off due to food degradation, deforestation, hunting, drought and fires over the last several years. That said, another group of scholars studied the koala population in 2016 and found comparable numbers.   Nevertheless, several wildlife experts reject the notion that koalas are currently ""functionally extinct."" ""By either definition, it's hard to see koalas as functionally extinct,"" Greenwald said. ""The last estimate for their numbers is roughly 300,000, and in some places they are very much playing their ecological role of munching on eucalyptus leaves.""  Wildlife conservation experts also told National Geographic that it’s difficult to measure koala populations, even at the best of times, because the animal has a wide range across eastern Australia, are human-shy and live very high up in trees. Christine Adams-Hosking, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Queensland in Australia, told PolitiFact that koalas ""are certainly not functionally extinct"" in Australia. And though they have been affected by habitat loss as a result of the fires, she said, it’s too early to know the impact.  ""We will never know exact numbers because we don’t know how many koalas exactly there were there in the first place,"" she said. ""Time will tell. Over the next few years, the burnt areas will need to be monitored to see how many koalas recolonize the burnt areas and whether they can successfully build up their population numbers again."" PolitiFact also reached out to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia about the claim. The organization’s senior manager for land clearing and restoration, Stuart Blanch, told us that while the bushfires are a setback for koala conservation, WWF-Australia does not agree that the species is functionally extinct. The organization estimates that from July to November, the fires scorched more than 8% of the known koala forest in New South Wales and that, even before the fires, koala populations disappeared from large areas of eastern and southern Australia. ""While koalas will survive this bushfire crisis, the longer-term picture in New South Wales and Queensland is not good unless excessive tree clearing is halted,"" Blanch said. ""WWF-Australia has published a report projecting ‘that koalas will become extinct in the wild in eastern Australia by as early as 2050 – and highly likely by 2100 – if deforestation and other threats continue.’ "" The organization said that koalas require remaining eucalypt forests to be preserved, cleared forest areas to be regenerated, and isolated patches of habitat to be connected by newly planted wildlife corridors.  As catastrophic bushfires burn in Australia, claims that koalas are now ""functionally extinct"" have gone viral. Many wildlife experts reject this designation, and several estimates suggest there are around 300,000 koalas left in the wild. However, the population is currently listed as vulnerable, and its numbers are steadily declining as fires, and other issues, threaten the animal. This claim has some truth to it but omits crucial context that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/dec/16/blog-posting/no-koalas-are-not-functionally-extinct-they-are-tr/

Biden misstates Delaware’s black population
","Former Vice President Joe Biden exaggerated the size of the black population in Delaware in an interview in which he spoke about why he thinks he has more black support than Mayor Pete Buttigieg. ""I come out of an environment where I have the eighth-largest black population in the country, in my state, and that's where I got my political education,"" he told Axios.  Biden was referring to a comparison of the black population in states and Washington, D.C. by percentage, but he didn’t mention the word ""percentage"" in that interview.  In terms of raw numbers, Delaware — a state with a population of just under 1 million — has a small black population that does not rank among the top states.  RELATED: U.S. minorities surpassed 25% of electorate when Obama ran in 2008, and it's going up The U.S. Census sent us 2018 data showing the percent of the African American population in each state. Delaware was in seventh place — about 22.5% of the population is black. The top states in order were Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Maryland, Alabama, South Carolina, Delaware and North Carolina. If we include the District of Columbia, then Delaware would be in eighth place.  But if we look at raw numbers, Delaware does not rank among the top states for the size of the black population. Delaware has about 220,000 black residents, placing it around the bottom one-third of states. By population, the top five states would be Texas, Georgia, Florida, New York and California. William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who is known for his research on race, said it is appropriate to look at the percent of the black population for the state. However, Frey said, Biden’s comment would be more compelling if applied to a state with a large black percentage and sheer numbers such as Georgia.   A Census spokesman told us that both metrics — the percentage and raw numbers — are useful data, but it provides a more complete picture to look at both of them. In Biden’s case, he was using the statistic to make his case that he has a history of representing black voters and cares about issues of importance to them.  But it’s important to understand how small the Delaware population is.  ""There are more black people in one county in Florida than in Delaware,"" said Keneshia Grant, a Howard University political scientist who does research on black voters. ""It looks like the ten cities with the largest black populations all have larger black populations than the entire state of Delaware."" The percentage of black residents in Delaware is significant in terms of showing that Biden had to take into account the concerns of black voters when he was a senator there, University of Delaware political scientist David Redlawsk said. ""This is best expressed in terms of a percentage, which provides the relative importance to his own elections,"" he said. We found that in some interviews Biden states that he is talking about a percentage while in other instances he omits that crucial explanation. (Biden has been making similar statements at least since 2006.) Biden said Delaware has the ""eighth-largest black population in the country."" As a low population state, Delaware does not have anywhere near the eighth largest black population in the country. Biden’s team told us he was referring to the percentage of black residents in states and D.C., which he didn’t specify in the Axios interview. Biden has used the statistic repeatedly in recent appearances — sometimes he says that he is referring to a percentage, and sometimes he doesn’t.  We rate his statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2019/dec/16/joe-biden/biden-misstates-delawares-black-population/

Would Chicago’s casino tax plan raise city’s take?
","During her visit to Springfield last month, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot pressed state lawmakers to lower tax rates on a future city casino after a consultant found the tax burden would be so heavy it could seriously jeopardize the casino’s ability to turn a profit. But in an interview conducted in mid-November shortly after the legislature’s fall veto session, a Republican state lawmaker claimed Chicago’s proposal would actually raise the city’s take of casino tax revenue while leaving the state with less cash for projects that could benefit communities across Illinois. ""They wanted lower taxes paid to the state and higher taxes paid to the city,"" state Sen. Dave Syverson of Rockford told WCIA’s Mark Maxwell in a sit-down at the capitol, which aired Dec. 8. ""The amount of taxes would be the same, but Chicago wanted to keep more of it."" ""As quick example,"" Syverson continued, ""in all the other casinos in the state, the local community keeps 5% of the revenue and then the state gets an average of about 35%. Under this scenario, Chicago — instead of 5% — Chicago would be keeping about 22% or 23% of the revenue and the state would get half the amount of what every other casino in the state was paying."" There’s a lot of moving pieces in Syverson’s claim, but the text of the bill he was referencing makes clear Chicago would have to cut its share as well — a point the senator conceded when we spoke with him. The plan Syverson referenced was introduced on the final day of veto session as an amendment to the gambling law that passed in the spring. It didn’t gain enough traction for a floor vote this fall, but lawmakers could take it up again when they return to Springfield next month. Lightfoot continues to push hard for a change to the original gambling bill, pointing to a state-mandated consultant’s report from August that called the tax structure on a Chicago casino ""onerous."" The consultant report warned that after accounting for operating expenses the effective tax rate on the Chicago casino would be 72%, leaving a profit margin of only 1% or 2%, or even exceeding casino revenue entirely. To address this, Democratic state Rep. Bob Rita of Blue Island introduced a city-backed plan to lower both state and city tax rates for Chicago’s casino, which is likely to become the state’s highest grossing. The gambling bill that passed the General Assembly in the spring and was later signed into law by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker calls for a 33.3% tax on the casino’s gross receipts dedicated to the city’s pension obligations. Rita’s legislation would have eliminated the city’s flat tax and replaced it with rates ranging from 10.5% to 34.7%. ""It would be a cut to the city, because you’re eliminating that 33% [flat rate],"" Rita told us in a phone interview. Meanwhile, the state’s original graduated rates of 15% to 50% on the casino would have been lowered to a range of 12% to 40%, according to the bill. The varying rates would be applied at different levels based on how much money the casino brings in under the plan. A similar series of graduated rates for both Chicago and the state would apply to revenue from table games. When we ran the bill’s specifics by Syverson, he agreed the legislative language would cut rather than raise Chicago’s take. ""If, in fact, we use the strict definition of the bill and Chicago was only going to get the tax rates that you gave me … then I would concede that Chicago would get a little bit less money,"" he said. ""Now, having said that, anyone with any common sense would say, why would Chicago introduce a bill that says, ‘We want less money’?"" Rita’s rejoinder: Without a lower tax structure that encourages companies to build and run a Chicago casino, there won’t be a casino for the city or the state to tax. Still, Syverson remains concerned about the plan. He said his job as a state senator is to ensure Illinois doesn’t lose out on needed funding from a Chicago casino and noted Lightfoot and the Chicago City Council have other tools to further tax the casino without getting an OK from the legislature. Speaking about a proposal to change the tax structure for a future Chicago casino, Syverson said the plan would lower taxes paid by the casino to the state and increase the taxes it pays to the city so that the overall amount would be the same but Chicago would ""keep more of it."" That doesn’t entirely square with the language of the bill. As he said, it would have reduced tax revenue for the state — but it also would have lowered taxes paid to the city. Syverson conceded that last point in response to our inquiry. We rate his claim Half True.

Ilhan Omar saying the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman ""wants to redefine U.S. foreign policy as we know it."" Omar elaborated on her philosophy by addressing military spending. ""We can fight to have our Green New Deal. We can certainly get Medicare for All. We can cancel out student debt. We can certainly pass our Housing for All bill. We can get a universal school meals program up and running,"" she said.  ""But in order to do all of those things, we have to stop policing the world, right? We have to not have over 800 military bases around the world. We have to not spend 57 cents on the dollar on defense."" Omar’s major claim is wrong.  Defense spending accounts for only 15% of the federal budget. In 2015, we rated as False a claim that 57% of federal spending goes to the military and just 1% goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps. Rather than being dominated by the military, the budget was actually dominated by spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we found. At the time, military spending, including spending on homeland security, accounted for 54% of discretionary spending — that is, not-mandatory spending.  But it accounted for only 16% of federal spending overall. ""This is a common mistake,"" Robert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, which works for fiscal responsibility, said about Omar’s claim. In fact, a spokesman for the congresswoman said Omar was referring to discretionary funding. He cited a Washington Post article that says defense would be 57% of discretionary spending in the 2020 federal budget request unveiled by President Donald Trump in March 2019. The percentage of the total federal budget spent on defense has been in the same range for years. 2007: 19%, FactCheck.org found 2011: About 25%, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker 2017: 15% according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Currently, about 17% of the federal budget goes toward defense, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — a figure confirmed to us by Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  The Peter G. Peterson Foundation puts the figure there, too, at 15%.  As for the dollars, the 2018 federal budget contained, according to a June 2019 report by the Congressional Budget Office: • $1.3 trillion went to discretionary spending, including $600 billion for defense. That would be about 46%. • Total outlays were $4.1 trillion, with defense getting $623 billion. That’s 15%. The 15% figure also holds true for 2019, as well. Omar said the U.S. spends ""57 cents on the dollar on defense."" Overall, defense accounts for about 15% of the federal budget.

Fishy stat: Elizabeth Warren goes overboard with claim on re-imported fish
","The first quick-fire question Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon put to Elizabeth Warren Dec. 5 was, ""What is the most important issue facing American voters today?"" ""Corruption,"" Warren fired back. That fits well with her campaign message that big corporations and the uber-rich have wormed their way into the corridors of power in Washington. But Warren has another bit of fishy business on her mind. In a Dec. 10 policy brief, she laid out plans to leverage the power of the oceans to fight climate change and boost jobs in the fishing industry. Among her points, Warren said America had offshored too much of the fish processing business. ""We must also rebuild the necessary infrastructure to once again support vibrant coastal communities and a local seafood economy,"" Warren said. ""Today, roughly one in four fish eaten in the United States was caught here and sent to Asia for processing before being re-imported for American consumers. By building processing plants in the United States, we can not only decrease the carbon footprint of the seafood industry, but we can also create a new class of jobs in the Blue Economy."" Dare we say, that 1-in-4 statistic had us hooked. We got in touch with the fishery researchers who wrote the paper Warren used to support her assertion. They said they didn’t offer that stat, and while they don’t have an exact estimate, her figure is probably too high. Should Warren throw this one back? Let’s break it down. Off Alaska, up in the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands, trawlers bring in over 1.3 million metric tons of Alaska pollock, a versatile white fish. The catch is huge, amounting to a third of America’s total seafood output. Measured in sales, about a quarter of the catch stays in the United States and shows up on grocery shelves as everything from filets to breaded fish sticks to imitation crab meat. China buys about 14% of the catch. And some of that comes back to the United States. ""Fish is processed in places like China because the costs of processing are cheaper than they are in the United States,"" said former U.S. Agriculture Department chief economist Joseph Glauber. As much as $900 million worth of pollock and other seafood is caught in U.S. waters, processed in China and sold here as filets and fish sticks. The general pattern repeats for pink salmon. It’s caught in Alaska, sent to countries  such as China or Thailand, and comes back as salmon burgers or perhaps salmon in a can. Other species of fish, to a lesser extent, also make this global round trip. Warren said that about one out of four fish Americans eat are part of this cycle, citing a National Academy of Sciences paper from a multi-university research team. But you won’t find Warren’s stat in that article, because the article tackled a different question. The authors wanted to debunk a talking point that only 10% of the seafood Americans eat is domestically produced. (This is a popular talking point among some top U.S. officials.) The researchers wrote that a better estimate of the fish caught and eaten here would be about 35% to 38%. Warren’s staff told us they took the difference between 10% and 35%, got 25% and used that to come up with the statistic that 1-in-4 fish was caught here, sent overseas, and re-imported. ""That would not be the correct approach,"" said co-author Jessica Gephart at American University. ""The 10% was not a solid number to begin with."" In other words, the article did not take the 10% as given, and then add in the re-imported fish. It was a complete reworking of all the numbers. Martin Smith, professor of environmental economics at Duke University, offered support for the topline results of Gephart and her colleagues for domestic-origin consumption. He reached a similar percentage based on the 10-most commonly eaten fish in the United States. ""So, that’s a totally different methodology that gets to a similar number,"" Smith said. All researchers agree that there’s a severe lack of good data, and estimates will vary. And what Warren described is a real issue. But the actual number of fish caught here, processed in Asia, and then sold here, Gephart said, is likely ""significantly less"" than one out of four. Warren said one out of four fish caught in the United States is processed in Asia and then eaten here. That relies on a misreading of a research article that aimed to debunk a widely used statistic. One of the co-authors said Warren’s statistic was significantly too high and the method her staff used to derive it was not correct. The issue of domestic seafood being processed overseas is large, but experts said it is not as large as Warren said. We rate this claim Mostly False. CORRECTION (April 20, 2020): This fact-check originally relied on government data that blended live weight with processed weight. This led us to understate the share of pollock sold overseas, and overstate the amount that went to China. The fact-check has been reflected to show the accurate figure.",/factchecks/2019/dec/13/elizabeth-warren/fish-tale-elizabeth-warren-goes-overboard-claim-re/

Wisconsin State Rep. Hutton delivers with claim about level of porch piracy
","The 2019 holiday shopping season is upon us. A new NerdWallet survey estimates more than 223 million Americans (88%) plan to purchase gifts this holiday season, spending an estimated $184 billion. Of course, many of those purchases will come in brick-and-mortar stores, but increasingly shoppers are making their buys online. Some believe that trend could get a boost this year due to the short window between Black Friday and Christmas -- 26 days from Thanksgiving to Christmas, down from 32 in 2018. With that backdrop, state Rep. Rob Hutton, R-Brookfield, used the Dec. 4, 2019 GOP weekly radio address to tout his soon-to-be introduced bill to increase the penalties for stealing mail and packages. Hutton started circulating the proposed bill for co-sponsors Dec. 12, 2019.  ""Of course, it’s already against the law to steal mail or any other item,"" Hutton said. ""Our laws need to keep up with the shift toward purchasing products online."" He also said: ""A recent study showed that nearly half of all gifts bought for the holidays are now purchased online. Unfortunately, another study showed as many as 1 in 4 people have had a package stolen from their residence."" Is he right about the number? The evidence When asked to provide backup for the claim, Hutton’s staff pointed us to the ""2019 Porch Package Theft Report"" by Shorr Packaging Corp., an Aurora, Ill.,-based distributor of packaging products, equipment and services.  Here is what the company’s website says about the methodology: ""We surveyed 1,052 online shoppers and asked a variety of questions related to online purchasing habits, package delivery tendencies, and security as it relates to receiving goods purchased online. All respondents live in the U.S., are between the ages of 18-100 and have indicated that they purchase items online through retailers. The survey was conducted between 10/30/2019 and 10/31/2019."" Shorr Packaging teamed with marketing and analytics agency Garrison Olson on the survey. Kyle Olson, co-founder of Garrison Olson, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin the participants were selected using SurveyMonkey's audience network -- that is, people who volunteer to take surveys. The margin of error is +/- 3%.  Here is the relevant line from the report: ""Nearly 1 in 4 online shoppers surveyed (24%) had personally experienced package theft, a 7% decrease compared to the 31% of self-reported package theft victims in our 2017 Package Theft report."" So, the first part of that sentence tracks with Hutton’s claim on the current number, though the second part suggests security precautions may be making a difference.  Indeed, the report itself notes: More than half those surveyed had taken some sort of precautions to prevent package theft, with 45% scheduling a delivery and 33% relying on home security tools. Some 64% of victims have sent packages to a location other than their home to prevent theft. And 78% have changed their plans to be home when a package arrived, even though the package did not require a signature. The study also reported that one of the hottest items on many people’s holiday shopping list this year is a video doorbell. In fact, of the respondents who have been a victim of package theft, 41% said they had purchased a video doorbell. We did find two other sources, both of which are similar surveys, that bolster Hutton’s claim. Security.org surveyed 1,011 shoppers in mid 2019 about package delivery. Only those who have packages delivered to their homes were asked to participate.  That effort found ""close to 40% of people have been the victims of so-called porch pirates, who snatch package deliveries from porches, stoops and doorsteps.""  Meanwhile, home security company Canary said in its November 2019 ""Porch Pirates Beware! Report,"" nearly 1 in 5 Americans were a victim, or know someone who was a victim, of porch pirate thefts during the 2018 holiday season.  Total sample size was 1,238 adults. The survey was conducted online between Oct. 24 and 25, 2019. A margin of error was not provided. Just how big is the problem? According to Security.org, federal data does not distinguish package theft from other larceny, so it’s not clear exactly how many package thefts take place every year across the country.   But according to the FBI’s 2017 Crime in the United States report, the most recent annual data available, more than 5.5. Million larceny thefts were reported across the country Our ruling In the GOP radio address, Hutton said a ""study showed as many as one in four people have had a package stolen from their residence.""  A trio of surveys of online shoppers supports that number, though statistics from law enforcement are hard to come by. We rate the claim True.                                                                 How to avoid porch piracy  Milwaukee Police Officer Jennifer Feather in a ""Cyber Monday"" message posted Dec. 2, 201,9 on the Nextdoor social network for neighborhoods, said porch piracy is preventable.  ""The Milwaukee Police Department wants to remind residents to be vigilant this holiday season as packages begin to arrive on our doorsteps.""  Feather also offered tips to neighbors to help thwart package thefts: 1. Keep each other updated about recent package theft activity 2. Share surveillance footage of a package theft in action 3. Ask a neighbor to pick up a package if your plans have you away from home 4. Offer to pick up a neighbor’s packages 5.

Christie says neighbors of San Bernardino shooters knew more than they did
","The threat to the United States from Islamic terrorists was a lead-off topic in the Republican debate in Iowa, and the December shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., was a prime example of how real that threat can be. Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about the reluctance of the shooters’ neighbors to report suspicious activity by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik. They didn't want to be seen as using ethnic profiling. Christie said what the neighbors saw had nothing to do with profiling. ""These folks had weapons, they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it,"" Christie said. ""That's not profiling, that's law enforcement."" Kelly interjected, ""They didn't know they were going to attack the country."" ""They knew they were talking about attacking people,"" Christie shot back. We looked for any reports of the neighbors saying they had an inkling of any plans for an attack. We didn’t find any. We did find second-hand reports that weren’t well sourced, and these were repeated primarily on right-leaning news websites.  This excerpt from the conservative website Daily Caller was typical: ""A neighbor of Farook’s mother in Redland — said that another neighbor told him ""they had I guess been receiving packages — quite a few packages within a short amount of time, and they were actually doing a lot of work out in the garage."" ""She was kind of suspicious and wanted to report it,"" Elswick explained, ""but she said she didn’t want to profile."" There were many articles of this sort. All of them sourced back to a local ABC news affiliate broadcast and all of them had pretty much the same details. None of these accounts supports Christie’s assertion. First, they talk about what the neighbors of Farook’s mother saw, not the neighbors of Farook and Malik themselves. The mother lived in Redlands, not San Bernardino. We should also note that this account comes from a neighbor saying what he learned from another neighbor, not what he saw himself. Second, no one was reported as saying that they thought an attack was being planned. Soon after the shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that neighbors and friends described the couple as ""quiet, religious people who didn’t attract attention or suspicion."" Our ruling Christie said that neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters knew that they were talking about attacking the country. The most that was reported is that a neighbor of a neighbor of one of the shooter’s mother said there was suspicious activity. There was no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious, much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned. Christie jumbled the details in the news.

Ted Cruz said he never insulted Donald Trump. The record suggests otherwise
","During the Fox News-Google debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said he’s taken the high road in his squabbling with fellow candidate -- and frontrunner -- Donald Trump. ""I have not insulted Donald personally, and I don't intend to,"" Cruz said during the Jan. 28, 2016, debate. We wondered, is Cruz’s claim accurate? Not really. Cruz, who once had a warm relationship with Trump, has been increasingly taking jabs at him, ever since Trump attacked him for possibly not qualifying for the presidency (due to his birth in Canada) and for saying things like, ""Ted is a nasty guy. People don't like him."" (Cruz’s staff did not respond to an inquiry.) One attack line Cruz has used that might be considered a personal insult is that Trump embodies ""New York values."" During a previous GOP debate in North Charleston, S.C., moderator Maria Bartiromo pressed Cruz on his use of that line. The Texas senator doubled down. ""You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are,"" Cruz said. ""I am from New York,"" Bartiromo said. ""I don't."" Cruz responded, ""What? You're from New York? So you might not. But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do."" Later in the debate, Trump parried Cruz’s attack by citing the city’s response to the 9/11 attacks as examples of ""New York values."" Trump received plaudits from many observers for his counter-shot, but that didn’t stop Cruz from later releasing a television ad with the closing line, ""Donald Trump: New York values. Not ours."" Another example of a Cruz swipe at Trump: After Trump pulled out of the Des Moines debate, saying that Fox moderator Megyn Kelly was biased against him, Cruz mockingly referred to the businessman as ""gentle Donald"" at a West Des Moines event. ""Apparently Mr. Trump considers Megyn Kelly very, very scary,"" Cruz continued. ""And, you know, Donald is a fragile soul."" He also said that debate questioning could make Trump’s hair ""stand on end."" Cruz also had a joke at Trump’s expense during an appearance at the Jackson County Fairgrounds in Iowa. Cruz referred to Trump’s earlier citation of ""two Corinthians"" in the Bible, rather than the more usual title, ""Second Corinthians."" Cruz joked, ""Two Corinthians walk into a bar -- Ah, yes, Ricardo Montalban -- genuine Corinthian leather!"" (Those Cruz’s age or older may recall the old Chrysler Cordoba commercials in which Montalban, the late, debonair actor, touted the car’s ""Corinthian leather,"" which was actually a figment of the carmaker’s marketing imagination.) Then there’s the line Cruz used earlier in the very same Des Moines debate in which he made light of the absent Trump’s habit of insulting his fellow candidates: ""Let me say I’m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly. And Ben (Carson), you’re a terrible surgeon. Now that we’ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way…."" To be fair to Cruz, there’s a fuzzy line between making personal insults and fair-game critiques. And Todd J. Gillman has written in the Dallas Morning News that Cruz’s attacks ""are sharp but indirect. And usually, he leaves enough wiggle room that Iowans believe him when he insists that he’s the one taking the high road, refraining from name-calling and personal insult."" For instance, Gillman cited a comment Cruz made on the Christian Broadcasting Network, that ""this election is not about any one person, any one individual who believes he or she will make America great. You know what, for seven years we’ve had a president in the White House who has had a Messiah complex."" Gillman asked, ""Did Cruz say Trump has a Messiah complex? Not exactly, but it definitely sounded that way."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""I have not insulted Donald personally."" Determining what qualifies as an ""insult"" is somewhat in the eye of the beholder, but Cruz has certainly mocked Trump during several recent public appearances.

Ted Cruz says Barack Obama 'dramatically degraded our military'
","During the Republican debate on Fox News, Sen. Ted Cruz portrayed President Barack Obama as weak on military spending amid the battle against ISIS and terrorism. ""Barack Obama right now, No. 1, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war,"" the Texas senator said. ""When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272."" Has Obama slashed the military during his tenure? We found that Congress shoulders a good deal of the responsibility, and Obama has actually asked for larger increases than Congress approved. A Cruz spokesman declined to respond on debate night. Military spending under Obama It is a common talking point among Republican candidates to portray the United States’ military spending as weak during Obama’s administration. They argue that the cuts, known as sequestration, make it harder for the United States to battle terrorists. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims related to the military budget as well as whether our Navy and Army are shrinking. We will recap our earlier findings here. Spending on national security includes the Pentagon budget as well as other agencies, such as the Energy Department’s work on nuclear weapons. Spending increased in 2010 and 2011, but it has fallen every year for four years since then by a cumulative 15 percent. Other ways of looking at the question show declines as well. National security spending made up 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but in 2015 it was 15.9 percent. Over the same period, spending fell from 4.6 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent. There are two main reasons for the spending drop. The first is the Obama administration’s decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second has to do with a process known as sequestration. Sequestration refers to automatic, across-the-board cuts to both military and nonmilitary spending that were originally designed to force bipartisan negotiators in Congress to strike a deal in 2011. Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward’s book The Price of Politics showed that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House. But the intention was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect. But negotiations fell apart, so the cuts went into effect. The bipartisan nature of the sequestration provision means that both parties merit a share of the blame, experts say. The most recent Obama budget proposed a 7.8 percent increase in the base Defense Department budget between 2015 and 2016. The spending bill enacted this fall puts the defense budget on a path to start growing in fiscal year 2016, up about 6 percent from the previous year. ""For five years in a row, Congress enacted a defense budget that was less than President Obama requested,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told PolitiFact the night of the debate. ""So I don’t think it’s accurate to pin the blame on the president for reductions in defense spending."" Army, Navy and military equipment Another way to look at Cruz’s statement is by the size of military services and the status of military equipment. Army: In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. Reductions over several years have taken it down to its current size of about 490,000. In July, the Army said that it plans to cut the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018, or a total of 40,000 positions. ‎As of early December, 1,299 soldier positions have been cut. The new cuts, which are scheduled to end by October 2018, will save about $7 billion. It’s unclear if all the planned cuts will occur and some experts argue we only need a larger Army if we are going to reoccupy Iraq or invade and occupy other countries. Navy: It’s a popular talking point about the United States having the ""smallest Navy"" in almost a century. In 1916, the U.S. Navy had 245 active ships. The number peaked at a massive 6,768 ships during World War II. Then the number drifted down during most of the 20th century, with slight upticks during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. As of Dec. 9, 2015, the number of active ships stood at 272, which is the lowest since 1916. However, today’s ships are far more powerful than those of 100 years ago. Today’s ships are outfitted with more advanced technology than they were during World War I. And today, the U.S. Navy has certain types of ships capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles that didn’t exist in 1916. In March 2015, the Navy set a goal of goal for a fleet of 308 ships though the earliest that could be met is 2022 if sequestration ends. New military equipment: The United States is building various military equipment including ballistic submarines and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, though there is debate among experts as to whether it is happening fast enough. Our ruling Cruz said, ""Barack Obama, right now, No. 1, over seven years has dramatically degraded our military."" It’s inaccurate for Cruz to solely fault Obama for budget cuts as a result of sequestration. Both Democrats and Republicans share the blame for the budget negotiations that fell apart. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth in that military spending has decreased, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-barack-obama-has-dramatically-degrad/

How often do presidential candidates skip debates? More than you think
","Donald Trump says he will sit out Thursday’s presidential debate after clashing with Fox News over the network’s inclusion of Megyn Kelly as a moderator. Trump’s beef with Kelly started in the first GOP debate last August, when the Fox anchor questioned him on his remarks about women. The Trump campaign demanded Kelly’s removal from the Jan. 28 debate, but the network refused, inciting the billionaire’s ire and a boycott. In response, the network wrote in an official statement: ""Donald Trump is refusing to debate seven of his fellow presidential candidates on stage that night, which is near unprecedented. ""We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage. Capitulating to politicians’ ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly."" We were curious about Fox’s assertion that Trump’s decision is ""near unprecedented."" We didn’t hear back from the network, but our research finds Fox’s claim is slightly exaggerated. Many other candidates on both sides of the aisle have ditched debate, but the clearest connection to Trump happened more than 35 years ago, when then-frontrunner Ronald Reagan skipped the final debate before the Iowa caucus in 1980. Let’s go through some examples of candidates passing up the chance to debate, tracing back from the cycle we’re in now. 2016 cycle Trump’s Fox News debate boycott marks the third time Trump has threatened to pull out of a debate (though he has showed up to all of them so far). But Trump isn’t the only candidate who’s toyed with the idea, and one candidate actually beat Trump to it. After failing to qualify for the main debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul skipped the undercard round hosted by Fox Business News and Facebook on Jan. 16. ""I won’t participate in anything that’s not first-tier because we have a first-tier campaign,"" Paul said. Paul’s self-extraction from the earlier debate isn’t quite the same thing as Trump, the front runner, pulling out of the prime time event in Iowa days before the Iowa caucuses. But Paul isn’t the only other example, and Trump isn’t the only leading candidate to have refused to debate.   2012 cycle There were 20 GOP primary debates in 2012. (The Democrats did not have any, given President Barack Obama’s incumbency.) Eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney was invited to the first Republican debate on May 5, 2011, before he announced his candidacy, but Romney opted out. Similarly, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman declined an invitation for the second debate held June 13, 2011, by CNN and announced his candidacy the following day. Huntsman then skipped another CNN debate to attend a town hall forum instead. Five out of seven Republican candidates (Romney, Huntsman, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Ron Paul) bowed out of a Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, 2011, — with Trump as the moderator. While the others cited conflicting schedules or didn’t say why they were declining, the Ron Paul campaign specifically named Trump himself as the reason, saying, ""Mr. Trump’s participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere."" Only former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Kentucky Sen. Rick Santorum accepted the invitation. The debate was cancelled after Trump withdrew from moderating. (Trump took to Twitter to air his grievances.) 2008 cycle In 2008, four leading Republican candidates — Arizona Sen. John McCain, Romney, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson — skipped a primary debate held Sept. 27, 2007, by PBS, citing conflicting schedules. A few months later, Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., boycotted a Univision debate because ""a Spanish debate has no place in a presidential campaign,"" he said. In the Democratic primary, Obama, then a U.S. senator from Illinois, Hillary Clinton, then a U.S. senator from New York, and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards declined to participate in a Sept. 23, 2007, debate hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus and Fox News. The three said they would participate in a CNN debate co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus instead, with an Obama spokesman noting that ""CNN seemed like a more appropriate venue."" The debate was canceled. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson did not participate in a radio-only debate hosted by NPR in December 2007 in order to attend the funeral of a Korean war veteran. Previous elections  Beyond the more recent cycles, there are even more examples of major candidates declining to debate in both primary and general elections. ""It’s not unprecedented for frontrunners to skip out in primary debates,"" said Mitchell McKinney, a University of Missouri professor of political communication who specializes in presidential debates. McKinney gave a few other examples of no-shows. In 1980, Ronald Reagan passed on the last debate before the Iowa caucus, thinking he had the state in the bag. However, he lost the caucus to George H.W. Bush, who had a strong performance. In 1996, Bob Dole skipped the first primary debate in order to campaign. And in 1999, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush was absent for the first two primary debates. (He had planned to skip all the debates until January 2000 but began participating in December due to falling poll numbers and pressure from the party, according to USA Today.) Even further back, there’s also Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (who refused to debate Barry Goldwater in 1964) and Richard Nixon (who, after debating and losing to John F. Kennedy in 1960, opted out in 1968 and 1972), according to Ohio University’s William Benoit, who’s authored several books on presidential debates. To debate or not to debate So Trump’s decision to skip the Fox News debate, while rare, isn’t unique. And what’s more, experts said, bowing out is an old strategy for moving forward. ""Candidates who lead may not want to risk making a blunder in the debate,"" Benoit said. ""Occasionally a candidate in the primary will skip a debate; for example a candidate who knows he or she will lose in Iowa might skip one or more Iowa debates to concentrate on New Hampshire."" Unlike other candidates who choose not to participate, Kinney argues, Trump doesn’t have to fear losing exposure (given his knack for garnering media attention) or being accused of weakness (given his blustery, aggressive brand). ""This Megyn Kelly (spat) has obviously been ongoing, but honestly it could be cover,"" he said. ""To use that to dodge attacks from anyone else on that stage — since frontrunners are in line of fire — it’s pretty smart."" Our ruling Fox News said Donald Trump’s decision to skip its upcoming debate in Des Moines ""is near unprecedented."" Fox takes its claim a bit too far, as we found many examples in recent cycles of candidates skipping primary debates and in some cases even sitting out debate for a year at a time. The clearest comparison to Trump happened with Reagan about 35 years ago. However, the news channel has a point that the Trump situation is pretty uncommon.  We rate Fox’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/28/fox-news-channel/how-often-do-presidential-candidates-skip-debates-/

Hillary Clinton wrong to say she's only candidate to lay out a 'specific plan' to fight ISIS
","National security has been something of a double-edged sword for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Clinton amassed extensive international experience during four years as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, but because of this, opponents can charge that she shoulders some of the blame for ongoing difficulties overseas. During a speech in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016, Clinton argued that on foreign policy, she was the only candidate to offer a thorough, detailed vision for the future. ""We know one threat we have to face right now, and that's from ISIS,"" Clinton said, referring to the group also known as the Islamic State. ""And I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS.""  Hillary Clinton addressing a crowd in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016. Clinton’s claim didn’t sound right to us because we’ve heard many candidates describe how they would take on the terrorist group. In fact-checking her statement, we aren’t taking a stance on the quality of her plan, or the other candidates’ plans, only the degree to which a candidate has laid one out. Our research found that Clinton’s plan is a bit lengthier and more detailed than the other ones we were able to locate. But she is hardly the only one to lay out a specific plan. The following table provides a rundown of the Democratic and Republican campaigns for which we found either a candidate’s speech addressing how to combat ISIS or an ""issues"" section of their campaign website that summarizes their views. If we found that the candidate offered both a speech and an issues Web page, we have analyzed the longer of the two. We were unable to find a written proposal for every candidate, so the list does not cover the entire field. But putting Clinton’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter only requires us to determine whether any candidate has laid out a ""specific plan."" The table shows the number of words in each candidate’s ISIS proposal and our count of how many individual agenda items were included in each proposal. Candidate Party Source Words in ISIS proposal Individual agenda items Hillary Clinton Democrat Speech 3,816 24 Jeb Bush Republican Speech 3,195 9 Bernie Sanders Democrat Speech 1,204 7 Marco Rubio Republican Web page 718 18 John Kasich Republican Speech 705 11 Martin O’Malley Democrat Speech 522 6 Ben Carson Republican Web page 429 7 Carly Fiorina Republican Speech 373 5 The table indicates that at least seven other candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, have offered plans, ranging from five to 18 agenda items in length. (You can scroll through them all here.) Notably, many of the points in Clinton’s plan appear in at least one other candidate’s plan, and often in several other candidates’ plans. They include stronger intelligence, more intensive airstrikes, the use of ground forces, improved cooperation with allies, more effective restrictions on terrorist financing, and better efforts to counter ISIS recruiting on the Internet. For instance, increased intelligence-sharing appears in plans not only from Clinton but also from Sanders, Rubio, Kasich and Fiorina. A greater role for Middle East allies was mentioned not just by Clinton but in one form or another by Bush, Sanders, Rubio, Kasich, O'Malley, Carson and Fiorina. Indeed, of the 24 agenda points we isolated from Clinton’s plan, we found just five that appeared to be only in her plan. They were passage of an updated authorization to use military force; curbing corruption among Middle East governments; securing loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons; improvements in airline-security techniques; and greater effort to ease the humanitarian crisis of refugees from the region. Meanwhile, elements of Rubio’s plans were at least somewhat unique: ""engage in global ideological pushback by exposing ISIS’s war crimes and sex trafficking and recruiting disaffected former members to tell their stories,"" and ""counter ISIS recruitment and propaganda by broadcasting U.S. victories, showing the world that ISIS is not invincible."" Bush, for his part, was the only candidate to specifically cite Canada’s practice of embedding in Iraqi units as a model, since it is being done ""to a very good effect,"" Bush said. When we contacted Clinton’s campaign for evidence, they pointed to several plaudits in the media for the comprehensiveness of her anti-ISIS plan. For instance, CNN reported that ""Michael Desch, an expert in international security at Notre Dame University, said that Clinton's speech was polished and showed her to be ‘head and shoulders’ above Republican candidates on framing an anti-ISIS strategy."" And the New York Times’ David Brooks wrote, ""While other candidates are content to issue vague calls to get tough on terror, Clinton offered a multilayered but coherent framework, not only dealing with ISIS but also putting that threat within the crosscutting conflicts that are inflaming the Middle East."" However, Clinton’s statement in Iowa wasn’t about whether her plan was an effective one; it was that it was the only ""specific plan"" in the entire field of candidates. And that’s clearly not the case. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS."" While Clinton’s plan is more detailed, by some measurements, than those of other candidates, at least seven other candidates in both parties have released multi-point plans for taking on ISIS. Some plans -- such as those from Bush and Rubio -- approach Clinton’s in either length or degree of detail. In fact, there’s a significant degree of overlap between the agenda items in Clinton’s plan and in plans released by other candidates. We don’t see strong evidence for Clinton’s claim that she’s the only member of the 2016 field with a ""specific plan.""

GOP Wisconsin lawmaker says the federal government refinances student loans, but it doesn't
","On Jan. 20, 2016, two lawmakers appeared on Wisconsin Public Radio’s ""Joy Cardin Show"" to discuss the State of the State speech given the previous night by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. One of the first topics to emerge was college affordability. State Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, called for state legislation to enable student loan borrowers to refinance their student loans. Refinancing, of course, allows you to get a lower interest rate on an existing loan when interest rates drop. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a Republican from the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, countered by saying it’s important to find ways to reduce the amount of loans students are amassing. And Kooyenga, an accountant, said he is open to discussing refinancing at the state level. Then, however, Kooyenga stated: ""A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government."" If they are, then why has there been so much debate -- at both the state and federal levels -- about legislation to allow refinancing? Past fact checks We’ve examined claims about college student loans before. Half True was the rating we gave U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., when she said in 2014 that four-year college students, on average, are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt. The best data available was mixed on whether the figure was accurate. Mostly False was the rating earned a couple of months later by Wisconsin’s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson. He had said the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families. In some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and, based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the federal government’s general fund. But that’s picked up by all taxpayers, not simply middle-class taxpayers with no ties to college. In that item we described in a nutshell how federal student loans work: The Department of Education budget draws on funds from the U.S. Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants and the repayment of some loans. When loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury. Student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government.   Private banks also provide student loans. Now to Kooyenga’s claim. Repayment options Private banks, of course, are free to refinance student loans. The decision is based on a number of factors, including whether the borrower has substantial income. After all, a student loan isn’t like a car loan, where there is a car to serve as collateral. But Kooyenga’s claim is that Uncle Sam refinances a lot of student loans. The federal government does offer consolidation for most student loans. That gives you one monthly payment on one loan, rather than multiple monthly payments on multiple student loans. But you might lose benefits such as principal rebates and end up with a longer payment period, racking up more in principal and interest payments in the process. Student borrowers can also take advantage of different payment plans. For example, lower monthly payments in the first few years after college and higher payments over time. But when it comes refinancing, the federal government doesn’t do it. As PolitiFact Texas found in a 2014 fact check, federal law simply makes no provision for the government to offer such refinancing. The non-profit group American Student Assistance states it flatly: ""There is no federal refinancing … you cannot refinance federal or private student loans into a federal loan."" Indeed, that’s why Democrats have been pushing legislation to allow federal refinancing. Backers include Baldwin and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, who is seeking to win back his U.S. Senate seat from Johnson in 2016, as well as 2016 presidential contenders Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley. In January 2016, Minnesota announced its own refinancing program and U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., announced new legislation that would do the same at the federal level. As for Kooyenga, he told us his ""comments were not meant that an individual with student loan debt could approach the federal government and refinance. I was speaking to the fact that beginning in 2008 the federal government began purchasing the loans made by private lenders."" So, he was using the term refinancing in a more technical way, even though the context of the discussion was about students refinancing their loans through the government. Our rating Kooyenga said: ""A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government."" Borrowers can refinance student loans through private banks, though it isn’t necessarily easy and comes with down sides. Democrats have pushed legislation to allow the federal government to offer refinancing, so that student borrowers can get lower interest rates. But that legislation has not been adopted, and the federal government does not do refinancing. Which means Kooyenga’s claim is False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/27/dale-kooyenga/gop-wisconsin-lawmaker-says-federal-government-ref/

Donald Trump says of course Mexico can pay for wall -- because of the trade deficit
","Donald Trump’s critics say Mexico can’t or won’t pay for a wall at the border, which he says is hogwash. ""When they say ‘but Mexico can't pay for the wall,’ I say of course they can,"" said the Republican frontrunner at a town hall in Norwalk, Iowa, on Jan. 20. ""We have a trade deficit with Mexico that's unbelievably big. Humongous. It's a humongous number. It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall. The wall's peanuts compared to that."" Trump’s statement prompted these questions: What is the amount of the trade deficit and the cost to build the wall? Mostly importantly, does a big trade deficit mean the Mexican government has money to pay for a wall? The Trump campaign did not respond for this fact-check. The size of the trade deficit  The U.S.-Mexico trade deficit was $50 billion for 2014. It was about $54 billion for the first 11 months of 2015. That means Mexico sold the United States $54 billion more in goods and services than the United States sold to Mexico. Balanced trade -- in which exports and imports are equal -- is rare. The U.S. economy has run overall trade deficits in every year since 1976. Sorting out the costs to build a wall is messier. Cost of a border wall The border with Mexico is about 1,900 miles. Federal law in 2006 required the construction of an approximately 700-mile fence. Border fencing and associated costs added up to about $6 billion as of 2012. ""It’s a lot more expensive than we expected when we started, and it was much more difficult,"" said Ronald Vitiello, deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, before a Senate committee in May. But the costs have left Trump, who promised to ""build a great wall,"" undeterred. His immigration plan includes no price tag, although he wants to force Mexico to pay for it by taking money from remittances and jacking up fees on visas. News reports estimating the price of a wall have varied widely. For the fence already built, the costs fluctuated depending upon the terrain. A Congressional Research Service report noted in 2009 that the challenges include ""costs versus benefits, location, design, environmental impact, potential diplomatic ramifications, and the costs of acquiring the land needed for construction."" Media reports we saw to complete such a wall ranged from $5.1 billion to $25 billion — plus additional costs to maintain it.   ""The only way to come up with any type of real cost estimate, you would have to do what we did: Get the Army Corps of Engineers or somebody else to survey and plan and come up with a fence type, and environmental impacts,"" said Thad Bingel, a senior official at Customs and Border Patrol during the George W. Bush administration. From an engineering standpoint, it’s possible to do it. But the cost would be enormous, and it would be more efficient to invest in equipment or staff, he said. ""Largely the reason we didn’t fence those portions was Border Patrol didn’t think we needed fencing there,"" because those portions had a river, mountains or a lot of desert, Bingel said. Trade deficit has nothing to do with cost of the wall So let’s review what we know so far: The trade deficit is about $50 billion. It’s difficult to pinpoint a price to build the wall, although the estimates we saw were smaller than the deficit. However, the bigger problem with Trump’s statement is he suggested Mexico can afford to pay for the wall because of the amount of the trade deficit. There is no proof of that. Several experts told PolitiFact that there is no connection between the size of the trade deficit and finding money to build the wall. ""Trump’s connection of the trade deficit with a Mexican border fence is just nonsense,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Just because the Mexican economy has a trade surplus relative to the United States doesn’t mean the Mexican government has the resources to build a border wall. It would be like me threatening my neighbor to build a new fence or else I’ll stop shopping at Walmart.""    Mark Perry, a University of Michigan professor and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the trade deficit is based mostly on trading and investment by private individuals and companies -- not the government itself. ""It’s not like there is $54 billion sitting around somewhere in Mexico, like a magic pile of dollars, that could be used to build a wall,"" he said. The Mexican government does not have adequate funds to pay for health, education or roads -- much less build a wall, said Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that analyzes globalization. ""The trade surplus does not represent money in some idle bank account controlled by the Mexican government,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said, ""When they say Mexico can't pay for the wall, I say of course they can. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that's unbelievably big. ... It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall."" The trade deficit is about $50 billion. Estimates to build a wall vary widely, though the ones we saw were smaller than the trade deficit. It’s impossible to know a precise figure because Trump hasn’t offered a detailed plan. However, Trump’s overall message here is misleading because he suggests that the size of the trade deficit is proof that Mexico could pay for the wall. In reality, the trade deficit has nothing to do with whether the Mexican government could afford to write the United States a check to build the wall.

Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz flat tax charges 16 percent on what businesses make and 16 percent on pay
","Ted Cruz’s tax plan, envisioning tax returns that fit on postcards, would whack businesses twice over, Marco Rubio says. We wondered about that. In the Jan. 14, 2016, Fox Business Network Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Rubio of Florida said that under the plan advocated by Sen. Cruz of Texas, businesses basically ""will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees."" A moment later, Rubio said Cruz’s plan ""does not eliminate the corporate (income) tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees."" Cruz disputed that characterization, saying in part that ""a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away."" Cruz’s plan replaces the corporate income tax, the payroll tax and others with a flat tax. Does it also make businesses pay 16 percent on profits and payroll, as Rubio said? Cruz’s plan outlined After emailing Rubio’s campaign about how he reached his 16 percent conclusions, we turned to Cruz’s tax plan as outlined by his campaign. ""Under the Simple Flat Tax,"" Cruz says on a campaign webpage, ""the current seven rates of personal income tax will collapse into a single low rate of 10 percent. For a family of four, the first $36,000 will be tax-free. The Child Tax Credit will remain in place,"" Cruz proposes, and the plan revamps the earned-income tax credit while preserving deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments. Here’s the flat-tax postcard as envisioned by Cruz:  SOURCE: Web page, ""The Simple Tax Plan,"" Ted Cruz presidential campaign (viewed Jan. 20, 2016) Next up: the 16 percent element. On Cruz’s website, we spotted no direct indication the 16 percent would apply to payroll spending. ""For businesses,"" Cruz says there, ""the corporate income tax will be eliminated. It will be replaced by a simple Business Flat Tax at a single 16 percent rate. The current payroll tax system will be abolished, while maintaining full funding for Social Security and Medicare."" Cruz further says the business flat tax ""will be based on revenues minus expenses such as equipment, computers, and other business investments."" In general, Cruz says, his proposed tax overhaul will deliver a tremendous economic boost, according to the ""well-respected Tax Foundation,"" a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that describes itself as a leading independent tax policy research organization. Independent breakdowns We fetched the foundation’s October 2015 analysis of Cruz’s plan which, the foundation said, would ""replace the corporate income tax and all payroll taxes with a 16 percent ‘Business Transfer Tax,’ or subtraction method value-added tax. In addition, his plan would repeal a number of complex features of the current tax code."" Farther along, the analysis spelled out a payroll aspect. Specifically, the foundation said, Cruz’s plan: ""Enacts a broad-based, 16 percent ‘Business Transfer Tax’ or value-added tax. This tax is levied on all business profits, less capital investment. This would include the payroll of business, government, and nonprofit institutions, as well as net imports. The tax would exempt from taxation the purchase of health insurance. A business transfer tax is also often known as a subtraction-method value-added tax. While its base is identical in economic terms to that of the credit-invoice VAT seen in many OECD countries, it is calculated from corporate accounts, not on individual transactions. The foundation also said: ""Under current law, some taxes on labor are explicitly levied on nominal wages, reducing take-home pay, while others are implicitly passed on to workers through lower nominal wages. The business transfer tax would also fall substantially on payrolls, but it would do so entirely through implicit reductions in nominal wages rather than explicit reductions in take-home pay."" That’s a bit gobbledy-gooky for us. A foundation official, Kyle Pomerleau, told us by phone and email that what Rubio said largely holds up, though it would be wrong to conclude businesses under Cruz’s plan would pay 16 percent on the same money twice. That is, Pomerleau elaborated, Cruz’s plan eliminates the existing payroll tax, which is 15.3 percent of wages (half of that paid by employers, the other half by employees), but the plan counts payroll expenditures as part of net business profits, which are taxed at 16 percent. ""Even though his plan gets rid of the payroll tax,"" Pomerleau emailed, ""his new Business Flat Tax will end up taxing that payroll by disallowing its deduction at the business level."" Another authority, Joe Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us by phone that Rubio was accurate about Cruz’s plan presuming he meant what most people define as ""profit"" by his phrase ""what you make."" Rosenberg walked us through how he sees Cruz’s plan working: Say a business buys something for 50 cents at wholesale and has to pay its employees 50 cents, accumulating $1 in costs. Then the business sells the something for $1.10, drawing a 10-cent profit. Under the Cruz plan, Rosenberg said, the business pays the flat tax solely on the 60-cent difference between the $1.10 in sales and the 50 cents spent on the wholesale purchase. And, Rosenberg noted, there’s another way to pin what Cruz’s plan subjects to the 16 percent tax -- by isolating what the business ""makes,"" the 10 cents, and then adding the 50 cents in employee payroll. ""It’s very fair to interpret what Sen. Rubio said as correct,"" Rosenberg said, though it’s also worth mention (again) that Cruz’s plan eliminates existing payroll and income taxes. Broadly, Rosenberg didn’t agree that Cruz’s plan whipsaws businesses, saying: ""It’s a change in the way they’re taxed. It’s not taxing something twice."" We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s camp about his claim nor did Cruz aides engage. Footnote: A Jan. 14, 2016, foundation post by economist Alan Cole says Cruz and Rubio aren’t proposing entirely distinct tax approaches. ""In fact,"" Cole wrote, ""if you put together two taxes from Rubio’s plan (and fiddle with the rates), you can actually synthetically construct the business flat tax from Cruz’s plan!"" Our ruling Rubio said that under Cruz’s tax plan, ""businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees."" Under Cruz’s plan, that rate applies both to net income and payroll expenditures though the way this description was phrased by Rubio merits clarification. That is, the 16 percent would not be applied to what a business makes and separately applied again to money paid to employees. Also unsaid: The proposed tax would replace taxes including payroll and income taxes. We rate this claim Mostly True.

What Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said about reparations for slavery
","From single-payer health care to free college tuition for all, Bernie Sanders’ policy proposals have been both dismissed and lauded as radical. But when it comes to reparations for slavery, some fault the Vermont senator and presidential candidate for holding a more conventional view. Sanders’ opposition to reparations has been the subject of some controversy after Ta-Nehisi Coates called him out in The Atlantic, writing, ""Unfortunately, Sanders’s radicalism has failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy. What he proposes in lieu of reparations — job creation, investment in cities, and free higher education — is well within the Overton window, and his platform on race echoes Democratic orthodoxy."" Meet the Press host Chuck Todd followed up with Sanders about Coates’ column Jan. 24, asking, ""Why aren't you for reparations because of slavery for African-Americans when you're calling for economic justice on so many other levels? Why do you stop short on that issue?"" ""Well, for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has,"" Sanders responded. ""And that is, it is absolutely wrong and unacceptable that we have so much poverty in this country and it is even worse in the African-American community."" Todd chided Sanders for not answering the question, but Sanders again deflected that it was for the same reasons as Obama and Clinton. Is it true that his position against reparations is the same as Clinton and Obama’s views? Sanders is right that Obama’s opposition echoes his own. (Coates calls this the conventional Democratic philosophy of ""a rising tide lifts all boats."") Clinton’s stance is less direct but largely follows the same rationale. Sanders’ case against reparations First, let’s explain why Sanders is opposed to reparations for African-Americans. When first asked about the issue by Fusion at the Jan. 11 Iowa Brown & Black Democratic Forum, Sanders stressed the political impracticability and polarizing nature of the proposal, and suggested prioritizing current economic inequality in lieu of compensating for past injustices. ""First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African-American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African-American community, we have a lot of work to do. ""So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most, and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African-American and Latino."" On Meet the Press, Sanders pretty much dropped the pragmatism argument (though he pushed back on the notion that his economic proposals are politically impossible) and focused instead on the second part of his rationale about improving economic conditions and schools for minorities. So how does this mirror, if at all, the approach by Obama and Clinton? Obama’s opposition In 2007 and 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama voiced his opposition to reparations, arguing that the best way to amend for the past is to focus on the present and future. ""I think the reparations we need right here in South Carolina is investment, for example, in our schools,"" Obama said in a July 2007 CNN debate. Obama couched his opposition somewhat differently in a 2007 NAACP presidential questionnaire. He said that ""nothing, including reparations, can fully compensate"" for the stain of slavery before arguing that reparations could lead to negligence on other matters of racial injustices: ""I fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'we’ve paid our debt' and to avoid the much harder work of enforcing our anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing; the much harder work of making sure that our schools are not separate and unequal; the much harder work of providing job training programs and rehabilitating young men coming out of prison every year; and the much harder work of lifting 37 million Americans of all races out of poverty. ""These challenges will not go away with reparations. So while I applaud and agree with the underlying sentiment of recognizing the continued legacy of slavery, I would prefer to focus on the issues that will directly address these problems – and building a consensus to do just that."" Obama explains he will not pursue reparations because the action could be used as an excuse not to work on other lingering problems for minorities. Here, Obama’s comments sound different from Sanders’. Sanders and Obama sound more aligned in these comments by Obama from July 2008, which both Obama and the Sanders campaign pointed out:   ""You know, I have said in the past — and I'll repeat again — that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed. ""And, you know, I think that strategies that invest in lifting people out of the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, but that have broad applicability and allow us to build coalitions to actually get these things done, that, I think, is the best strategy. ""You know, the fact is, is that dealing with some of the — some of the legacy of discrimination is going to cost billions of dollars. And we're not going to be able to have that kind of resource allocation unless all Americans feel that they are invested in making this stuff happen. ""And so, you know, I'm much more interested in talking about, how do we get every child to learn? How do we get every person health care? How do we make sure that everybody has a job? How do we make sure that every senior citizen can retire with dignity and respect? ""And if we have a program, for example, of universal health care, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because they're disproportionately uninsured. If we've got an agenda that says every child in America should get -- should be able to go to college, regardless of income, that will disproportionately affect people of color, because it's oftentimes our children who can't afford to go to college."" Obama, as far as we can tell through searching Nexis, has not changed or revisited his stance on reparations since 2008.   Clinton’s position Clinton’s recent and past comments suggest her ideas for helping the black community are no different from Sanders’ and Obama’s. Clinton didn’t directly answer the question about reparations at the Iowa Brown & Black Forum, but she also suggested investing in black communities and addressing poverty: ""I think we should start studying what investments we need to make in communities to help individuals and families and communities move forward. And I am absolutely committed to that. There are some good ideas out there. There’s an idea in the Congressional Black Caucus about really targeting federal dollars to communities that have had either disinvestment or no investment, and have had years of being below the poverty level. That’s the kind of thing I’d like us to focus on and really help lift people up."" In October 2015, she provided a similar response when asked by the hosts of the BuzzFeed podcast ""Another Round"": ""I’ll tell you what, I think we need to make many more investments in everything from pre-school education to affordable housing, that’s my form of trying to give people the chance to be empowered, to make the most out of their God-given potential."" As Fusion pointed out, this was largely Clinton’s answer in 2000 as well. When she was asked about reparations during her Senate campaign, she said African-Americans deserve an apology for slavery before pivoting to economic conditions. ""But I think that the people I know and the people I work with want us to stay focused on the future, keep our economy going, keep providing good public education, quality affordable health care — do the things that will enable people to have the best futures for themselves, and that’s what I’m committed to doing."" Our ruling Sanders said he opposes reparations ""for the same reason that Barack Obama has and the same reason, I believe, that Hillary Clinton has."" The reason, he said, is the need to focus instead on addressing current economic problems in the black community by improving education, providing jobs and addressing poverty. That is basically what Obama and Clinton has suggested in lieu of reparations. It’s worth noting that Sanders previously suggested that reparations were politically impractical and divisive. Obama and Clinton have not made comments to this effect. In 2007, Obama said reparations could be used an excuse not to do more for African-Americans.

Gun control group says since 1963 more Americans have died by firearms than in all U.S. wars
","During a recent rally at Capitol Square in Richmond, gun control advocates handed out fliers with a grisly statistic. ""Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars,"" says the brochure, distributed on Jan. 18 by the Virginia Center for Public Safety. The claim is familiar to PolitiFact; it’s been vetted by our colleagues in the national office twice over the years. We decided to take a new look through the lens of the latest available data. War casualties The most comprehensive list we found on U.S. war dead was compiled in January 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. It included casualties from the Revolutionary War through Operation Inherent Resolve, which is targeting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria. The number of U.S. dead in all those conflicts comes to nearly 1.2 million, according to the research service. We should add a qualifier here: The research service says that during the Civil War, the nation’s deadliest conflict, Union and Confederate losses combined were 525,000 to 530,000. But a 2012 study by a Binghamton University historian estimated the combined toll was much higher -- about 750,000. If we use that higher Civil War figure, it would bring the total U.S. deaths in military conflicts to about 1.4 million. Gun deaths The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a series of hard figures and estimates of yearly gunfire deaths in the U.S. from 1968 to 2014. They add up to about 1.5 million fatalities. The Virginia Center for Public Safety’s claim on gun deaths goes back a little bit further, to 1963.  We couldn’t find figures going back to that year, since the oldest year for which data were available was 1968. A CDC chart shows 24,000 gun deaths occurred that year. With that in mind, the figure of 1.5 million deaths since November 1963 surely is an underestimate of the level of gun violence since then, because it excludes four years. The actual number probably is close to 1.6 million. A key thing to know about these figures: They include not just murders but all gun deaths. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides; 33 percent were homicides; and the rest were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. Our ruling The Virginia Center for Public Safety says that since 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire than have been killed in all U.S. wars. Figures going back to 1968 show about 1.5 million firearms deaths have occurred since then. That doesn’t include data from gun deaths from 1963 to 1967, years for which figures aren’t available, so this is a conservative estimate on firearms deaths since Kennedy was assassinated. In contrast, a high-side figure for U.S. war deaths shows that about 1.4 million service members have been killed in conflicts. So we rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/26/virginia-center-public-safety/gun-control-group-says-more-americans-have-died-fi/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Florida', 'John Cortes']","
Dentists and the ADA agree: Ignoring a toothache could potentially kill you
","State Rep. John Cortes, D-Kissimmee, made a biting claim about the consequences of poor dental care during debate on a bill that would change the rules for Medicaid coverage. HB 819 is backed by MCNA, a Fort Lauderdale dental benefits company that lost its Medicaid contracts with the state after the 2011 switch to mandatory managed care. The bill allows the Legislature to take dental off the list of services that managed care plans are required to offer people on Medicaid. The state would then be able to contract with vendors like MCNA to provide the dental care instead. (Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry raised eyebrows for discussing the issue with Gov. Rick Scott on behalf of MCNA without first registering as a lobbyist.) Cortes, who voted for the bill, said he wanted to make sure proper dental care would be available for children, maintaining problems can easily arise without treatment. ""Anyone can die of a toothache,"" he said in a House Health Innovation Subcommittee meeting on Jan. 13, 2016. ""Believe it or not, you can."" The bill passed the committee by a 12-1 vote. Given this age of modern medicine, we wondered if Cortes was right. We decided to drill into this one to find out. The whole tooth We didn’t hear back from Cortes’ office, but unfortunately for all you odontophobes, you really should be getting checkups on a regular basis. ""Yes, it is possible to die from complications with an infected tooth,"" Thomas Porter, a faculty member at the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told PolitiFact Florida. ""Every year there are cases where the patient did not receive appropriate and timely treatment of an infected tooth. In most cases, the infected tooth starts as a localized site with pain and infection."" Obviously you’re not going to die of the physical pain, but these problems can start from some form of periodontal issue or, as is most often the case, cavities. The decay leads to abscesses, which are usually infections between the tooth and the gums. ""Not treated, the problem progresses and the patient becomes septic, which can lead to death,"" Porter said. Dr. Erin Sutton, a Fort Walton Beach dentist, pointed out the infection could either move to bone marrow or the bloodstream, causing sepsis and affecting major organs. This is not a new phenomenon, of course. Dental infections and other tooth-related problems were listed as the fifth- or sixth-leading cause of death in London back in the early 1600s. But it certainly happens today, too. The number of people who die from an untreated tooth problem is small, but the details can be harrowing. An oft-cited case is the 2007 death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died when bacteria from an abscess infected his brain. He had two brain operations totaling $250,000 before he died, but he could have been saved with a timely tooth extraction that would have cost $80. His family had no health insurance and had lost Medicaid benefits. Kyle Willis, a 24-year-old unemployed father from Cincinnati, died in 2009 after being unable to afford a tooth extraction and prescription antibiotics for an infection. John Schneider of Mt. Orab, Ohio, was 31 when he died in 2014 after what he thought was a sinus infection but was actually an untreated abscess that eventually led to multiple organ failure. The scope of the danger was highlighted four years ago by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which found preventable dental conditions made up more than 830,000 emergency room visits in 2009. That was up 16 percent from 2006. While the number of deaths aren’t regularly examined, a 2013 study published in the Journal of Endodontics offered a quick cross-section of the issue based on one kind of condition. Researchers found that between 2000 and 2008, there were more than 61,000 hospitalizations nationally for periapical abscesses, an infection at the tip of a tooth’s root that is a common symptom of untreated tooth decay. Of those 61,000-plus stays, 66 patients died. Our ruling Cortes said, ""Anyone can die of a toothache."" It’s not so much that you’ll die of pain, of course, but dentists and research confirm that an untreated abscess can infect other parts of the body, either through the bones or the bloodstream. Most people won’t die from a toothache, but it’s a condition that if left untreated can lead to the worst: a fatal result.

"['National', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders says he polls better against GOP candidates than Hillary Clinton
","In the runup to the Iowa caucus, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly said he has a better chance of beating the eventual Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 general election than fellow Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. ""Almost all of the polls that -- and polls are polls, they go up, they go down -- but almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton,"" he told voters during a Jan. 19 town hall meeting in Underwood, Iowa. We took a look at the various national surveys, as compiled by RealClearPolitics and PollingReport.com to see how that assertion stacks up against the data. The only recent national poll to look at the question at the time Sanders made his comment was completed Jan. 13 for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, it found, Sanders beats Trump by 15 percentage points compared to a 10-point win for Clinton. That certainly supports Sanders' claim, but that poll didn't compare him to any other GOP candidates. To find another poll to properly compare Clinton's and Sanders' relative strengths, you have to go back to a Quinnipiac Poll completed Dec. 20. There, Sanders beats Trump by 13 points while Clinton defeats him by 7 points. However, in a matchup against Republican Marco Rubio, Sanders loses by three points and Clinton wins by just a single point. Against Ted Cruz, Sanders loses by a point and Clinton ties Cruz at 44 percent each. So Clinton is performing slightly better, but these results are largely within the margin of error of +/- 2.9 points. A third poll, taken during the same timeframe as Quinnipiac by Public Policy Polling, found that Sanders would lose to Trump (by two points), Rubio (by three points), Cruz (by one point) and Jeb Bush (by one point). Clinton, in contrast, would beat Bush (by five points), Trump (by three points) and Cruz (two points), but lose to Rubio (by one point). Both Democrats would tie with Republican Ben Carson. The margin of error was +/- 2.8 percentage points. So the Public Policy Polling survey doesn't support Sanders either. (You can see a chart of the varying matchups and point differences at the end of this fact-check.) When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, they submitted a consultant's memo from Jan. 8, 2016, that focuses on the Quinnipiac study and two other polls, a CNN/ORC International Poll from Dec. 17-21 and an Economist/YouGov poll from Dec. 18-21. Neither the CNN/ORC survey nor the Economist/YouGov poll test Sanders in a general election against a Republican. Instead, the memo argues that Sanders, if nominated, is more likely to win in November because he polls better than Clinton among independent voters, he's ""viewed more favorably than any other presidential candidate of either party,"" and Clinton's support is slipping against the Republicans. (For the record, the Economist/YouGov poll found that Clinton's favorability score was just as high as Sanders, with both at 44 percent. Of the 2,000 respondents, 39 percent were not registered to vote.) Whether high favorability ratings directly translate into votes in a general election is an open question. Our ruling Sanders said, ""Almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton."" The NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll released before Sanders' statement supports his claim for Trump, but it has no data against Cruz or Rubio. Earlier polls say he doesn't outperform Clinton at all against Cruz, Rubio or Bush, and the narrow races combined with the margins of error make his contention even more dubious. Beating Clinton in only two of eight hypothetical matchups is far from ""almost all."" The statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.

Glenn Beck says before Ted Cruz, he'd never endorsed a candidate for office
","Glenn Beck, the conservative former Fox News host who now has a radio show and online live-video program, declared at an Iowa rally for Texan Ted Cruz that he was breaking with his own long history simply by endorsing someone for office. ""The press today has been reporting that I’m here to endorse Ted Cruz,"" Beck said at an appearance with Cruz in Ankeny, Iowa the same week Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump. ""But let me tell you, in 40 years of broadcast, I have never endorsed any candidate. And I haven’t endorsed any candidate mainly because for a lot of those years, nobody really wanted my endorsement,"" Beck said with a laugh. ""And quite honestly, I have never endorsed anybody because I haven’t trusted any of the weasels, no matter how good they are."" Beck made that comment a little over seven minutes into his half-hour presentation, which concluded with Beck saying the press was right: ""I am here to announce that I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz."" We were curious about Beck’s declaration that he hadn't previously endorsed a candidate. We failed to reach Beck for elaboration. Meantime, our search of the Nexis news database indicated no previous Beck endorsement of a presidential aspirant. And while we found we found two reports of Beck endorsing a candidate, further review showed one reported endorsement didn’t happen and the other was a Beck joke. Illinois ‘endorsement’ A Feb. 2, 2010, item, in the Inside the Beltway column in The Washington Times, said Illinois businessman Adam Andrzejewski, among Republicans running for governor, had been drawing fresh ""tea-party"" support. The item continued: ""Fox News host Glenn Beck has also endorsed Mr. Andrzejewski,"" as had commentator Rush Limbaugh. We reached Andrzejewski, who replied by email: ""In real-time, many people in Glenn Beck’s radio listening audience took his broadcast as an endorsement of my 2010 campaign for governor of Illinois. However, Beck clarified the following day that he did not endorse, but instead had just replayed the endorsement of my candidacy by Polish President and Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa."" Andrzejewski pointed us to a Feb. 2, 2010, post by the American Spectator stating Beck had said on the air that day that he was ""getting a lot of mail that I endorsed"" Andrzejewski when, Beck said, he’d only intended to share audio of Walesa speaking in favor of the candidate. ""I don’t endorse candidates and I don’t know this guy, but I wish him all the best,"" Beck said. California ‘endorsement’ On May 16, 2011, Californian Dan Adler’s House campaign issued a press release headlined, ""Glenn Beck`s Surprising First Ever Endorsement Goes to Democrat Dan Adler in California`s Special Congressional Election."" The release opened: ""For the first time in his life, conservative TV and radio personality Glenn Beck has given an endorsement to a candidate running for Congress in a special election tomorrow. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the endorsement did not go to someone of Beck's political extreme but to Dan Adler, a lifelong Democrat who is socially progressive. Adler, who has been urging voters of the South Bay community area to elect a citizen legislator instead of a career politician, recently caught Beck's eye for populist-themed Send a Mensch to Congress TV spots."" The release continued: ""In a posting on Beck’s website today, the conservative talk show host said, ‘people should vote based on principles and values and not race or creed,’ he then moved to ‘heartily endorse’ Adler."" The release said that on Beck’s May 13, 2011, radio show, ""Beck and his cohorts ridiculed the Asian American and other minority voters who make up nearly 50% of California’s 36th District. Then a confused Beck endorsed Adler’s candidacy, stating that Californians deserve to see Adler in Congress and that ‘you’re going to love him.’"" We clicked next to a May 16, 2011, post on Beck’s website suggesting Beck made his endorsement tongue-in-cheek (and there’s a full Beck-sponsored summary of the not-for-real endorsement here). According to the post, Beck had included an Adler ad on his program the week before as the worst political ad ever. The post on Beck’s site continued: ""The ads, promoting Californian Dan Adler, featured a Korean woman who said that she should vote for Adler simply because she’s Korean and he’s Jewish and that minorities should ‘stick together.’ The ad also featured several offensive stereotypes of Koreans and Asians. Glenn took issue with the ad, saying that people should vote based on principles and values, not race or creed."" That doesn’t read like Beck was poised to endorse. The post on Beck’s site went on: ""Somehow, Adler took Glenn’s criticism as an endorsement and released a statement declaring himself the candidate endorsed by Glenn Beck. This morning, Dan may regret his statement. ‘It doesn’t make any sense for a progressive to want my endorsement. So, today I heartily endorse — what’s his name? — Dan Adler. I want the voters in California to know that we are practically brothers of the brain,’ Glenn said. ‘We are so like minded, he has the same positions on almost everything, although he’s not coming out and saying those things.’ ‘We both believe that the rich are paying far too much. Pay their fair share? They pay more than their fair share. They deserve a tax break,’ Glenn declared in his support for he and Adler’s shared stance. Let’s see if the progressive Adler decides to run with Glenn’s support."" Next, we reached  Adler, whose current biographical entry on a business website says Adler’s candidacy drew ""Beck's first-ever political endorsement."" Adler, describing himself as a liberal Democrat, told us that after Beck criticized his ad, his campaign issued the 2011 release saying Beck had endorsed him toward building a pre-election buzz. ""I never saw it as a real official endorsement,"" Adler said though he called back to stress Beck’s statement at the time that California deserved Adler. ""Tongue in cheek or not, one would certainly count it as an endorsement,"" Adler said. Media Matters for America To our inquiry, Laura Keiter of the liberal Media Matters for America, whose declared mission is to monitor and correct conservative misinformation ""in the U.S. media,"" said by email that while Beck previously made no presidential endorsement, he had made clear who he supported or opposed, ""walking a thin line,"" Keiter said. Keitor offered instances of Beck seemingly taking a side such as Beck in January 2008 telling Republican hopeful Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, on the air that he would vote for him or Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president. Beck went on to say that if the nominee proved to be former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or Sen. John McCain (who later proved the nominee), ""I would look at those two guys and go, I can’t do that."" In an October 2010 web post, Media Matters said Beck had repeatedly said he doesn’t endorse candidates yet also had indicated support or opposition to specific hopefuls; that year, Beck urged listeners to oppose Democrat Richard Blumenthal in a Connecticut U.S. Senate race; called Democrat Chris Coons of Nevada a bad Senate candidate; and said he was about to break his no-endorsement policy by endorsing Marco Rubio and another hopeful for the Florida U.S. Senate seat ultimately won by Rubio. Our ruling Beck declared in Iowa he hadn’t previously endorsed a candidate. Beck made a kidding endorsement of a Democrat a few years ago and previously urged support for, or votes against, individuals. But we spotted no evidence of Beck lock-down endorsing a candidate before he stood with Cruz. We rate Beck's statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Could a GM worker afford college tuition on just two weeks' work in 1965?
","Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley recently offered a striking comparison about American families and college tuition. ""Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter’s college tuition on just two weeks' wages,"" O’Malley wrote in a post on Medium. ""Today, we are saddling our graduating kids and their families with more than $1.3 trillion in loan debt."" Really? We decided to take a closer look. What tuition cost The easier part of this equation to nail down is the average cost of college tuition. According to the U.S. Education Department, average undergraduate tuition and fees -- excluding room and board -- in the 1965-66 school year was $607 per year for a four-year college (public and private) and $203 for a two-year college. (Adding room and board bumps up those figures to $1,375 and $884, respectively, but O’Malley said ""tuition,"" so we won’t consider room and board.) What the average GM worker made According to an article in the Aug. 25, 1964, edition of the Chicago Tribune, the average hourly wage in the auto industry that year was $3.01. That grew a bit after a new union contract was negotiated later that year, but a figure in that ballpark is about right for the time frame O’Malley was talking about, said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry and labor group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Historical wage data from Ford, for instance, shows that the base wage for a ""major assembler"" was $2.91 an hour in 1965. Dziczek noted that workers in durable-goods manufacturing averaged 44 hours per week in 1965, with time-and-a-half for the final four hours. So a $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20 for the two-week period O’Malley cites. So if you ignore taxes -- a questionable policy, but one we’ll grant O’Malley for the sake of argument -- then two weeks of average GM pay would have been enough to pay for one year at the typical two-year college in 1965. But it would not be enough to pay for a year at typical four-year college. That would take a little more than four weeks’ work. What the O’Malley campaign says The O’Malley campaign said they took the wage number from a column by University of California-Berkeley economist Robert Reich, who also served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. In 2014, Reich wrote. ""Fifty years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker got paid $35 an hour in today’s dollars."" But that works out to $4.66 an hour in 1965 dollars, and contemporary evidence suggests that wage is about 50 percent too high. Meanwhile, on the tuition side of the equation, the O’Malley campaign said that one year of in-state, undergraduate tuition at University of Iowa in the 1964-65 school year cost $340, and that this was the case for other states, as well, such as New Hampshire. However, if you use the $3.10-an-hour wage -- rather than Reich’s $4.66-an-hour wage -- then two weeks’ pay, even when untaxed, would not quite cover a year’s in-state tuition at the University of Iowa. And since many GM workers wouldn’t have been residents of Iowa, and thus eligible for the in-state rate at the University of Iowa, we think it’s fairer to look at average tuition nationally. Comparing 1965 to today So O’Malley’s comparison doesn’t quite hold up. However, it’s fair to note that he has a point about the larger question. Namely, it was a whole lot more realistic to be able to pay for a year of tuition with just a few weeks of blue-collar income in 1965 than it is now. During the 2012-13 school year, a year’s tuition at the average four-year college was $14,101, and the base wage at Ford for a major assembler was $28.13 an hour. If you include overtime pay, then two 44-hour weeks at that wage (without setting aside anything for taxes) works out to about $2,700, or less than 20 percent of the one-year average tuition cost. At that rate, it would take more than 10 weeks’ work, including some overtime, to pay for a year’s worth of tuition. We should note that the rise of college tuition costs is the bigger culprit here. In nominal dollars, auto worker wages have grown ninefold since 1965. But average four-year-college tuition is up 23 times from what it was in 1965. Our ruling O’Malley said, ""Fifty years ago, the average GM employee could pay for a year of a son or daughter’s college tuition on just two weeks wages."" That’s not quite right -- it would have taken about four weeks of work at GM, not two, to pay for a year at the average four-year college in 1965, and more than that if you take account of taxes. Still, O’Malley has a point that the situation in 1965 was quite a deal compared to today, when a typical auto worker would have to work for 10 weeks in order to pay for a year of tuition at the average four-year college. We rate the statement Mostly True. CORRECTION, Feb. 2, 2016: The calculations in our original version slightly overstated the typical weekly and biweekly wages for UAW workers. A $3.10-an-hour wage (accounting for the increase in the 1964 UAW contract) would work out to $142.60 per week, or $285.20 for the two-week period Martin O’Malley cited.

"['Nevada', 'Candidate Biography', 'Disability', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton partially right in attack against Nevada Rep. Cresent Hardy
","For a first-term congressman, U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy seems to constantly be in hot water. Part of the reason is that as a Republican representative of a district that leans Democratic, Hardy holds a seat considered likely to flip in 2016, with a competitive four-person Democratic primary currently underway. The other reason? Hardy, a former state Assemblyman, has gained a reputation for stumbling when speaking off the cuff. Several of Hardy’s comments resurfaced during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s stump speech during a Democratic event in Las Vegas on Jan. 6. Here’s what Clinton said in full: ""You even have a Republican Congressman, Mr. Hardy, who says that Mitt Romney was right about the 47 percent and that people with disabilities are, and I quote him, 'a drain on society.' "" Because challengers to Hardy and now Clinton have repeatedly slammed him for this, we thought it was worth revisiting his comments. Let’s break this claim into two parts -- the ""47 percent"" claim and the disabilities claim. Clinton’s claims connecting Hardy with 2012 Republican front runner Mitt Romney’s infamous ""47 percent"" comments are largely accurate. Hardy made the comments during a September 2014 campaign meet-and-greet with voters at a private golf club in rural Mesquite. Video from the event shows Hardy responding to a question about the comparable sizes of the federal and private sectors by referring back to Romney’s ""47 percent"" remarks. ""Can I say that without getting in trouble like Gov. Romney?"" Hardy said. ""The 47 percent is true. It’s bigger now."" Hardy at the time refused to back down from the statement, saying ""Nevada has a long history of politicians willing to speak their mind, and if these comments lead Nevada voters to throw out everyone who has ever made a gaffe, I will proudly mark my calendar for Harry Reid’s retirement."" So it’s accurate to say that Hardy and Romney match up on the ""47 percent"" comment. But Clinton’s claim becomes much more convoluted over Hardy’s comments on people with disabilities. A Democratic campaign tracker recorded audio of Hardy making the comments in question on May 30, 2015, during a Libertarian Party event at the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel casino. The video quality is rather poor, and coupled with Hardy’s tendency to trip over words, it’s difficult to clearly understand. Here’s our transcription: ""I had three children: One was summa cum laude and two were magnum cum laude, and the other didn’t need an education, he works for Raytheon and is smarter than all the rest because he works hard. He builds things that are genius, and some people have that ability and I’m grateful [inaudible] I don’t know where that came from. But they all work hard. They’re raising their own families. They’re doing their own thing. They will not be a drain on society, the best they can. Hopefully they never have some disability that causes them to have to utilize that."" Clearly, nobody is going to mistake Hardy for Shakespeare. And it does seem that Hardy is insinuating having a disability might cause them to be a ""drain on society,’ but his wording is unclear enough to pin down what he exactly means. But Clinton’s line makes it appear that Hardy is directly saying that people with disabilities are a drain on society, which certainly isn’t the case as he never directly states that. Hardy’s campaign consultant told PolitiFact in an email that the Congressman is a strident supporter of people with disabilities, and scolded Clinton for taking the remarks out of context. ""The fact that anyone, let alone a candidate for the highest office in the land, would suggest that someone else was actually against the disabled -- just to get some cheap applause from a partisan crowd -- is sickening and sad,"" campaign consultant Ryan Erwin said in an email. Clinton’s campaign in Nevada declined to comment further than referring to Hardy’s full remarks. Hardy, both before and after the event, has a history of supporting programs for people with disabilities. His office funded a pool day for children with autism in August, after the comments were published, and his campaign released several letters to PolitiFact supportive of Hardy. Hardy has also been a longtime supporter of the Las Vegas-based Opportunity Village, a nonprofit groups dedicated to helping people with developmental disabilities find job training and work. The group’s former CEO, Ed Guthrie, said Hardy has attended events and helped facilitate contracts between the nonprofit and businesses in his district. ""He’s always been supportive,"" Guthrie said. ""We have no issue with the congressman. If he was misunderstood or if something was taken out of context or if he misspoke, the overwhelming body of evidence as a congressman and Assembly member shows he really does support people with intellectual disabilities and organizations like Opportunity Village."" Clinton is spot on in linking Hardy and Romney on the 47 percent comments, yet she’s off in criticizing him over supposed comments on people with disabilities. Because there are so many issues with the second part of Clinton’s claim, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/25/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-partially-accurate-campaiging-agai/

Van Cleave wrongly says Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican
","On the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gun rights supporters rallied on the state Capitol grounds against efforts to tighten firearm restrictions. Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, which organized the rally, disparaged the Democratic Party as the party of gun control. He then uttered what he said was a little-known fact: ""We’re here on a holiday, and this holiday is Martin Luther King’s birthday, right? Somebody who fought for civil rights to bring people to be equal,"" Van Cleave said. ""Let me ask you a question. What party was he with? He was a Republican."" That was news to us. We decided to investigate. We asked Van Cleave to support his claim that the slain civil rights leader was a Republican. He told us in a telephone interview that he’d heard that statement many times. He said he’d do some research on the origin of the claim and get back to us. He followed with an email saying his research found some claims that King was with the GOP and others saying his party affiliation was unknown. ""I’m also not finding an unimpeachable source either way. So I’d have to say that one can’t claim he was a Republican with absolute certainty, nor can one say he wasn’t a Republican with absolute certainty,"" Van Cleave wrote. ""Rather than get mixed up in this gray area, I’m just going to drop that one off my talking points,"" he added. Indeed, the Internet is replete with declarations from conservative groups that King was a brethren Republican. The claim rests, in large part, on comments made at least eight years ago by Alveda C. King, the civil rights leader’s niece. ""My uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his lifetime was a Republican,"" Alveda King said in a video posted on the National Black Republican Association website. Her statement has been dismissed by other members of King’s family. ""It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican,"" Martin Luther King III, the civil rights leader’s son, told The Associated Press in 2008. ""He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican."" And on the same day Van Cleave made his statement, Bernice King, the civil rights leader’s daughter, said in a radio interview that her father was ""never"" a member of the Republican Party. The video of Alveda King’s comments has been circulating for years. But in 2013, she retracted her claim in an op-ed for Newsmax.com, a conservative news website. King wrote that she regrets ""having said to a group of peers that my Uncle M. L. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) was a Republican. I said that without having all the facts."" Alveda King wrote that her uncle was ""an independent, who in his own words tended to vote Democrat."" She wrote that she had assumed her uncle was a member of the GOP because his father - Martin Luther King, Sr. - was a Republican. Alveda King wrote that before the election of Democrat John F. Kennedy as president in 1960, most blacks were Republicans. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island in 2012 also examined a claim that the civil rights leader was a Republican. They wrote that it wasn’t surprising that King’s father, who lived in Atlanta, was a Republican because most Southern Democrats at the time backed racial segregation. For more insight, we contacted Clayborne Carson, founding director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. We asked him if King was a Republican and whether there are any voter registration records that would confirm that’s the case. ""To the best of my knowledge, the answer to both questions is no,"" Carson replied in an email. Carson also is director of the King Papers Project, a research initiative with the King Center in Atlanta that is compiling the civil rights leader’s sermons, correspondence, speeches and other writings. He said that project has not found any records that show King registered with either political party.   Carson said King wasn’t completely enamored with Republicans or Democrats. ""There are many documents indicating that King was critical of both major political parties, because they were insufficiently committed to civil rights and ‘a better distribution of wealth,’"" he wrote. Lewis Baldwin, a professor emeritus of religious studies at Vanderbilt University who has written six books about the civil rights leader, told us there’s ""no evidence whatsoever"" that King was a Republican. Any assertion that King was a member of the GOP is ""absolutely false,"" he said. King said blacks ""should remain independent voters, and they should not become unduly tied to any party, Democrat or Republican,"" Baldwin said. Our ruling Van Cleave said at a rally that Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican. He told us he had heard the claim many times but, after doing some research, now concludes that the evidence is cloudy and said he will stop using the line in speeches. Experts say King eschewed party labels and was critical of both major parties. King’s son and daughter have denied claims that their father sided with the GOP. King’s niece, who once said the civil rights leader was a Republican, retracted that statement three years ago. The burden is on Van Cleave to prove his statement, and he, too, backs away from it. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/25/philip-van-cleave/van-cleave-wongly-says-martin-luther-king-jr-was-r/

Brown speaks the truth about California's job growth
"," Near the end of his 2016 State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown claimed: ""two million new jobs have been created,"" in California since 2011. That’s a lot of new employment, we thought, especially for a state ranked by some as having the nation’s worst business climate, thanks to high taxes and regulation. Brown has staked his legacy, at least during his second stint in the governor’s office, largely on what he calls the ""California comeback."" We decided to fact check his claim about job creation, which is a big part of that comeback. From 2007 to 2010, California lost more than a million jobs when the state’s housing and construction sectors collapsed. The loss of tax revenue and past skimpy savings meant multi-billion dollar budget shortfalls for California. It also meant heavy cuts in services for the poor, shuttering state parks and allowing levees, bridges and highways to crumble. In his speech at the state Capitol, Brown took some credit for the financial turnaround, noting that he’s helped pay down huge debts and create the state’s Rainy Day Fund. He didn’t take all the credit for the new jobs. ""Two million new jobs have been created and unemployment has dropped in half,"" since 2011, he said in his record 14th State of the State address. ""Of course, the global recovery has a lot to do with that. So, we should applaud, but we can’t control it, too."" We’ll leave the global impact on California’s recovery as a question for another day. Our focus is on Brown’s comment that ""two million jobs have been created"" since 2011, the year he returned to the governor’s office, and more than two decades after his initial stretch as the state’s top executive. Crunching the job numbers Sifting through jobs data can be dizzying. And there are many ways to look at the numbers. For some guidance, we turned to Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi, who tracks state employment. Adibi pointed to ""nonfarm payroll jobs"" tracked monthly by the state and federal governments. Economists consider that category the most reliable because it eliminates farm employment, which fluctuates considerably. Everyone in the nonfarm category is listed on a payroll and considered an employee. Data from that category show that California had 14,301,300 nonfarm jobs in January 2011, when Brown’s third term started. A report released the day after Brown’s address shows the state had more than 16,320,100 of those jobs in December 2015. That’s a growth of just over two million jobs. Experts we spoke with said this is a ‘net job creation’ total. And because many jobs were also lost during this period, the gross number of positions created would have been well over two million. ""I believe the governor is correct,"" Adibi told us. ""The economy actually has done pretty good during his leadership."" For some perspective, the two million jobs created in California accounts for about one-sixth of the nation’s net 12.4 million jobs added during the same period, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. It’s also roughly 600,000 more jobs than Texas added during the same period, the federal labor data show. Texas officials, including former Gov. Rick Perry, have made repeated efforts to siphon jobs away from the Golden State. Asked for the source of information for the California governor’s job creation claim, the Brown Administration pointed to the same non-farm payroll data as Adibi. Our ruling In his State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown said ""two million jobs have been created"" in California since 2011. The most reliable data used by both independent economists and the Brown Administration show California had about 14.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs when the governor returned to office in January 2011 and just over 16.3 million jobs last month. That’s a net growth of more than two million jobs. We rate the governor’s claim True. ",/factchecks/2016/jan/25/jerry-brown/brown-speaks-truth-about-californias-job-growth/
