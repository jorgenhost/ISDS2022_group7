Cantor says U.S. paid seniors $1.2 million to play World of Warcraft computer game
","House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says Washington’s spending habits are so bad that they’ve entered the realm of fantasy.

""The National Science Foundation spent $1.2 million paying seniors to play World of Warcraft to study the impact it had on their brain,"" Cantor, R-7th, claimed in a Feb. 19 news release identifying examples of what he said are wasteful spending.

World of Warcraft, also known as WoW, is a popular fantasy game in which players create virtual characters and enter an online world to battle orcs, kobolds, giant spiders, roving packs of wolves and other adversaries. Gamers pay a monthly fee to play the subscriber-based game in which they join other players to fight monsters and win treasure.

A September 2012 article in Wired magazine said the game peaked at 12 million users in 2010 and has since dropped to 9.1 million.

Were some of those gamers senior citizens that Washington paid to play to the tune of $1.2 million? We decided to check. Cantor’s statement has drawn attention from The Huffington Post and  WoW Insider, an online publication devoted to World of Warcraft.

We asked Cantor’s office where the majority leader got his information. Megan Whittemore, a deputy press secretary, sent us information about a $1.2 million grant by the National Science Foundation in mid 2009. The money was awarded to North Carolina State University and Georgia Tech to study whether computer games can slow the mental decline in elderly people and, if so, to develop specific ""brain games"" to achieve that goal. The premise is that the memory, problem-solving and strategies needed to master some online games may be beneficial to seniors.

The first part of the research involves seniors frequently playing Boomblox -- a spatial puzzle game on the Wii entertainment system in which players knock down blocks. About 200 participants undergo cognitive testing before they are introduced to the game and then again at a later date to see if playing has produced any changes.

The N.C. State researchers hope to identify the elements of Boomblox that led to mental improvements. That information will be shared with experts at Georgia Tech, who hope to incorporate data to develop new games that will help the elderly retain or improve their everyday cognitive skills.

The grant runs out this August.

You may have noticed that our explanation of the research has yet to mention the World of Warcraft, the game Cantor says U.S. taxpayers paid seniors $1.2 million to play. There’s a good reason: The National Science Foundation’s abstract on the grant makes no mention of anyone playing WoW.

Is any part of the $1.2 million federal grant being used to pay seniors to play World of Warcraft?

""The answer is an unequivocal no,"" said Anne McLaughlin, the principal researcher on the project and co-director of the Gains through Gaming Lab at N.C. State.

The information sent to us by Cantor’s office -- media reports, research publications and grant abstracts -- do not undercut McLaughlin’s answer.

WoW does have a tiny role in this story, however. In the spring of 2009, McLaughlin’s lab briefly studied how playing World of Warcraft affected seniors’ cognitive ability before receiving the federal grant. The research, on 39 elderly subjects, was funded with $5,000 provided by N.C. State. No federal money was involved, according to Jason Allaire, a co-director of the lab.

An experimental group of the seniors played WoW on their home computers for about 14 hours over the course of two weeks and were tested at the start and end of the period. A control group did not play the game, but also was tested at the same intervals.

The researchers concluded that seniors who scored well on the pretest for cognitive skills were not aided by playing WoW. But those who scored low on the initial test ""saw significant improvement in both spatial ability and focus.""

The purpose of the $5,000 study, in part, was to run a pilot project to help win the National Science Foundation grant, McLaughlin told us. It ""helped us look at what we wanted to measure in a big study and how to do it,"" she said.

Some media coverage of the Gains Through Gaming studies have noted there are skeptics of whether gaming has any potential to slow the effects of aging on senior’s brains.

Our ruling

Cantor said the federal government spent $1.2 million ""paying seniors to play World of Warcraft,"" a popular fantasy game. His facts are all messed up.

He’s referring to federal grant for a study to determine whether computer games can slow mental decline in the elderly. But the grant application never mentioned WoW and participants in the federally-funded study did not play that game.

Before applying for the federal money, the researchers conducted a small, pilot study in which seniors played WoW over the course of two weeks and were tested to see if it improved their cognitive abilities. This study was funded with a $5,000 grant from N.C. State. No U.S. money was involved.

The federal study involves hours of testing each participant and efforts to identify the aspects of computer games that might help seniors better deal with life offline. Cantor’s statement ridiculously suggests that Washington is sponsoring a geriatric gaming club.

Statement on stadium, minority businesses short on info
","
The Atlanta Falcons may not have made it to the Super Bowl this year. But their future is potentially brighter than ever. Team owner Arthur Blank* is pushing for a new $1 billion retractable-roof stadium to be built in downtown Atlanta in time for the 2017 NFL season.

The Georgia World Congress Center Authority -- which owns the Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, and would own the new stadium -- agreed to a framework for a deal in a nonbinding term sheet. That term sheet will provide the foundation for more negotiations later on any binding agreement between the GWCCA and the Falcons.

Left to be decided is who pays for the project. The latest funding plan has the Falcons contributing most of the money for construction, along with an upfront public contribution of $200 million paid through bonds issued by Atlanta’s economic development agency. The bonds would be backed with hotel-motel tax money.

While those negotiations continue, state Sen. Vincent Fort , D-Atlanta, questioned another part of the project: minority business participation. ""What concerns me is there is only two sentences (in the term sheet) that have been written about minority business,"" Fort said in a Twitter post earlier this month.

We wondered whether Fort’s comments about the 24-page document were correct and what this meant for the project.

The term sheet for the stadium project is available on the Georgia World Congress Center website. On page five of the term sheet under a category titled ""Additional Considerations,"" the first of four bulleted items addresses minority businesses.

""The Falcons and GWCCA will adopt a M/WBE participation program to be included in design and construction contract requirements pursuant to all applicable and/or customary governmental M/WBE requirements or guidelines.""

The one-sentence item is three lines long, so Fort is mostly correct on the simple logistics of the statement. But he appears to have a larger concern.

The federal government requires state and local governments to implement the federal disadvantaged business enterprise program if they receive federal money for transportation projects. The program is meant to level the playing field for businesses that are disadvantaged because of income or other factors when competing for federal dollars. Many state and local governments also establish their own programs for disadvantaged or minority and women-owned businesses in sectors outside transportation, and they set goals for contracts awarded to those businesses.

PolitiFact Georgia submitted questions to the GWCCA about disadvantaged business participation in the stadium project. In a detailed response, the authority’s chief operating officer said that records on that information did not exist.

But the details are almost sure to be outlined in the final contract before any work is done, said Lloyd Atkins, a consultant in the minority business development office of the University of Georgia’s Small Business Development Center.

""These minority and disadvantaged business participation goals are usually established early on because if not framed in the legal parameters of a contract there is no incentive to reach the goals,"" Atkins said.

With the proposed stadium’s probable public-private partnership, a lot of the push for minority participation will be ""political will,"" Atkins said, with adherence to any goals set possibly monitored by the city of Atlanta’s contract compliance office. (PolitiFact Georgia asked that office about any involvement in the project but received no response.)

Since Fort’s tweet and subsequent comments to PolitiFact Georgia, some members of the Atlanta City Council this week have lobbied for about 30 percent of the stadium work to be completed by minority contractors. Falcons executives said there will be an ""equal opportunity employment commitment"" at every stage of the project.

The GWCCA’s administrative policies and procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, goods and contractuals services states: ""It is the Authority’s policy to affirmatively encourage and solicit participation with respect to purchases of goods and services by qualified business enterprises to include disadvantage business enterprise (W/MBE) Women and Minority Business Enterprise.""

Although the Falcons stadium term sheet is one very early step in the process, Fort said the brevity of the statement did not bode well for the participation of minority businesses in the project. ""In a state with such a sorry history of using African-American vendors, I was not comfortable with ‘a wink-and-a-nod, trust me approach,’ "" Fort said.

Fort pointed to last year’s audit of the Georgia Department of Transportation’s disadvantaged business enterprise program. That audit -- publicized during the campaign for a regional transportation sales tax -- found that the state agency had fallen below its targets for awarding contracts to minority and/or women-owned businesses that met the federal definition of disadvantaged. Between 2009 and June 2011, the Transportation Department awarded eligible firms owned by African-Americans just 2.4 percent of its contracts even though those firms make up 14.1 percent of all companies available to perform construction and engineering work. Women owned-businesses received 8.4 percent of the work, and Hispanic-owned firms received 1.1 percent.

After the audit, the Georgia Department of Transportation increased its existing targets for awarding contracts to minority and women-owned disadvantaged firms. And Fort used the numbers as part of his campaign against the regional transportation sales tax.

When the Georgia Dome was built in the early 1990s and opened in 1992, disadvantaged businesses accounted for 20.7 percent of the contracts, valued at $36.8 million. The total value of construction related contracts on the Dome was $177.8 million, according to information provided by the GWCCA. Removing two sole-source contracts from the available construction work increased the disadvantaged business participation to 23.6 percent.

Under the federal definition, white, male-owned businesses can qualify as disadvantaged if they meet certain criteria including personal net worth of the business owner.

Fort said the current term sheet that lays out nonbinding terms approved for the new stadium contains only two lines dealing with minority business participation. He uses this brief mention as a reason to be leery of the state’s promise to carry out minority participation promises.

A simple look at the term sheet shows that Fort’s statement is correct. But the explanation doesn’t stop there. Already City Council members are pushing for specific minority business participation goals, and whatever goals are set are likely to be included in the final contract before any construction work has begun. Because the details are not yet complete, it is impossible to make inferences on what the goals would be.

Fort’s statement is  partially accurate but needs a lot additional information.
We rate his statement Half True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Kenneth Block']","
Block says 9,000 R.I. voters used master lever for Moderate Party -- with no party candidates on ballot
","
Rhode Island was among 14 states in the last election cycle that allowed voters to use the so-called ""master lever,"" enabling them to vote for candidates from one political party with one ballot mark. On Rhode Island ballots, it is the option called Straight Party.

Kenneth Block, founder and chairman of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, has launched a campaign to get rid of the master lever, saying it’s outdated and creates confusion for many voters.

In a recent appearance on the ""State of the State"" television program, Block said that in the November 2012 election, ""More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot.""

Block, a businessman, gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot in 2010 as the Moderate Party’s candidate for governor. He came in last in a four-way race, with 6.5 percent of the votes. But that was enough to win a spot on the 2012 and 2014 ballots for his party.

We wanted to know how Block calculated that 9,000 figure.

By e-mail, Block said that he started with 9,424 -- the number of people he said voted by the master lever for the Moderate Party.  

Then he did some estimating, based in part on the size of the communities and districts with a Moderate candidate on the ballot.

He noted that the Moderate Party had a candidate in just three communities -- Burrillville, East Greenwich and South Kingstown -- and two legislative districts -- House District 65, in East Providence, and Senate District 16, which is all of Central Falls and a piece of Pawtucket.

Block then estimated the number of voters he thought would have cast a straight-party Moderate vote in those communities and districts. He subtracted that estimated total from the total of all Rhode Island voters who selected the Moderate Party with one ballot mark.

He didn’t provide an exact final number -- just ""more than 9,000.""

When we checked Block’s number, we discovered he was close, but not directly on target.

To begin with, both the secretary of state’s office and the Board of Elections said the number of Moderate Party straight-party votes was actually 9,295 -- not the 9,424 Block started with.

Then we obtained exact numbers of master-lever votes for the Moderate Party in the communities and districts with Moderates on the ballot .

Miguel J. Nunez, planning specialist at the Board of Elections, told us there were 208 such votes in Burrillville, where a Moderate candidate was running for School Committee. But that race was non-partisan and the candidates  weren’t identified by party so, technically, it doesn’t fit Block’s definition.

In the other communities and legislative districts with identified Moderate candidates on the ballot, there were a total of 642 master-lever votes cast for the party.

Subtract that number from the 9,295 statewide votes and you get 8,653 -- close to 350 fewer than Block’s ""more than 9,000."" Even if you add the 208 votes from Burrillville, you still don’t get to 9,000.

Our ruling

Kenneth Block said, ""More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single moderate on their ballot.""

He derived that number in part from guesswork. But according to the precise figures from the Board of Elections, he was off by nearly 350 -- roughly 4 percent.

But Block’s underlying point that the master lever confuses many voters is valid. More than 8,000 used it to vote for Moderate Party candidates when there weren’t any on their ballots.

For those reasons, we rule his claim Mostly True.

Gov. John Kasich says expanding Medicaid would help uninsured who use emergency rooms for primary care
","
Gov. John Kasich remains opposed to the Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law known as Obamacare. But Kasich's proposed two-year state budget endorses the expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal health program for certain poor and disabled people, that is one of the legislation's key elements.

He made an impassioned case for the expansion in his State of the State address on Tuesday. He said it will guarantee that Ohio tax dollars return to Ohio to pay for it, and that it will deliver basic primary health care to the poor.The federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost for three years, decreasing to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.

""We don't want 275,000 Ohioans getting their primary care in an emergency room,"" Kasich said in announcing the plan. ""It is not sustainable, it doesn't work, it is not humane and it costs everybody a lot of money -- and more than just the cost of the visit.""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered what supported the statement. We were given background by the Governor’s Office of Health Transformation, which was created by executive order two years ago.

Kasich's figure of 275,000 is based on expanding Medicaid coverage to adults making $15,415 or less per year -- 138 percent of the federal poverty line -- which the U.S. Supreme Court made optional for states in its health care decision last June.

Ohio currently covers adults with dependents at up to 90 percent of the federal poverty level and doesn't cover childless adults.

Ohio Medicaid estimated the net change in enrollment would be an increase of 274,753 -- about 275,000 -- using figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the federal Census Bureau.

As for cost, the governor's office pointed to uncompensated care -- the cost of services provided to the uninsured that the uninsured do not pay for themselves.

Those services, the health office said, typically are in hospital emergency departments. Those departments are required to provide care, even if an individual lacks the ability to pay, and end up being used as primary care outlets in non-emergency situations, at a higher cost than care from more appropriate providers.

Uncompensated care accounts for 2.8 percent of all health care spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Urban Institute, and it raises private insurance premiums by up to 1.7 percent. Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation reported the same figures.

It’s a matter of opinion how significant the impact of uncompensated care is on the cost of private insurance. Regardless, the impact would be almost certain to increase without an expansion of Medicaid: Hospitals are reimbursed some of the costs of uncompensated care through the federal Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program, a subsidy that will be scaled back starting in 2014.

Where does that leave Kasich’s statement?

He  was correct in stating that according to his administration’s calculations, the Medicaid expansion would cover 275,000 Ohioans whose primary health care might otherwise be provided in emergency rooms, at a higher cost.

Whether that higher expense ""costs everybody a lot of money"" is largely a matter of how ""a lot"" is defined. Since uncompensated care represents a relatively small percentage of health care spending, Kasich could be accused of a bit of exaggeration.

With that clarification, we rate the statement as Mostly True.

Barack Obama says sequester would cut vaccinations, cancer screenings for hundreds of thousands
","
In a recent speech, President Barack Obama said that key health programs will be cut if the sequester -- an across-the-board federal spending cut -- takes effect as scheduled on March 1, 2013.

""Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings,"" Obama said.

We wondered if his dire claim was accurate.

First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.)

The uniform cuts must be applied to any ""program, project or activity"" that isn’t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program.

When we asked about looming cuts to immunization and cancer screening, administration officials pointed us to a report released by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. The report sought to quantify cuts in a variety of programs overseen by the committee. We should note that the report was released by the subcommittee’s Democratic majority, chaired by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is generally an ally of the president.

The report addresses possible cuts to two programs relevant to Obama’s claim. One, the Section 317 immunization program, is a grant program to states and cities, providing vaccines to underinsured children and adults. According to the subcommittee, it would serve 211,958 fewer children if the sequester takes effect.

The other is the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which aids underserved women nationwide. A sequester would leave 33,816 fewer women screened for breast and cervical cancer, according to the subcommittee’s estimate.

So, combined, these two programs by themselves would affect nearly 246,000 people. 
But it's important to note that Obama's language was imprecise enough to suggest that people may lose their access to primary care doctors outright, which would be a much broader hit than cutbacks to flu shots and cancer screenings. There is no indication that Americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester; Medicaid, to cite just one example, is spared from cuts entirely. But Obama's phrasing could leave a different impression.

Meanwhile, a few factors could make the estimate for immunization and cervical screening too high. The subcommittee’s report was issued in July 2012 using an estimated 7.8 percent cut, a bigger reduction than the 5.3 percent cut now envisioned for domestic discretionary programs.

In addition, a CDC spokesman confirmed that the vaccine and cancer-screening programs are counted as individual ""programs,"" meaning that each will each need to be cut by the uniform amount. However, federal managers will have some room for juggling spending priorities within each program -- moves that could decrease the number of people affected. In addition, these two programs are grants to states, and state (or local) officials would have a say in how to spend the money.

Still, the room for either federal, state or local officials to maneuver would likely be pretty limited. And there’s also reason to believe the numbers of people affected could be even higher, since this estimate doesn’t include additional programs at risk of cuts, such as the CDC’s Colorectal Cancer Control Program.

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said he has a problem with all ""doomsday scenarios"" like the one that Obama (and Harkin) are promoting, because they amount to a ""straw man"" that ""fails to point to the simple solution -- to give agencies flexibility but keep the cuts in place."" Still, Ellis said he considers the subcommittee’s calculations reasonable given the information Harkin had available.

Our ruling

Obama said that if the sequester hits, ""hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings.""

Obama's words could have left the impression that primary care services overall will be lost, rather than flu shots or cancer screenings alone. 
Still, we found that one widely cited estimate found that sequester cuts to two programs alone would leave 246,000 people without the types of services Obama mentioned. There’s a lot of uncertainty about these numbers for a variety of reasons, meaning the actual number could be lower or higher. But even at the low end, it’s pretty close to ""hundreds of thousands."" So we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BC8400>],/factchecks/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-would-cut-vaccinations/

Barack Obama says sequestration cuts will be indiscriminate
","
Over the past few years, President Barack Obama and Congress have lurched from one fiscal crisis to another. The latest, known as sequestration, would impose across-the-board cuts on most types of federal spending.

To pressure Congress to prevent sequestration by the March 1, 2013, deadline, Obama gave a speech on Feb. 19 surrounded by law enforcement officers.

""Emergency responders like the ones who are here today -- their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded,"" Obama said. ""Border Patrol agents will see their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go.""

Dire warnings about budget cuts are a popular tactic in the nation's capital sometimes called the ""Washington Monument strategy"" because federal agencies will sometimes threaten to close popular things such as the monument to build opposition.

Separately, we are fact-checking Obama's specific warnings. In this item, we're exploring his broader comment that a sequester ""won’t consider whether we’re cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness, or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day. It doesn’t make those distinctions.""

We checked with experts in federal budgeting law to see whether they thought Obama’s explanation was accurate.

Ways in which the sequester doesn’t make distinctions in federal spending cuts

When the White House and Republicans had a showdown over the debt ceiling in 2011, they set up the sequester as something of a poison pill -- budget cuts that would be so harmful they would force both sides to make a deal. Adapting a process first outlined in a 1985 law, they defined the rules this way:

""Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that account, or for accounts not included in appropriation Acts, as delineated in the most recently submitted President’s Budget).""

That means the cuts are pretty much across-the-board, which means the sequester ""is indeed indiscriminate,"" said Ronald M. Levin, a law professor at Washington University School of Law.

John F. Cooney, a Washington lawyer who led the legal team that implemented a federal sequester under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, concurs.

In a column published in November 2012, he wrote that sequestration requires a ""uniform percentage reduction on all covered programs — good and bad alike — without differentiation. … The President has no discretion in implementing the reductions. He must follow Congressional directives and may not, for example, shift required reductions from Treasury to Agriculture.""

Even the fact that some programs are exempted from the sequester supports Obama’s point.

Certain programs are protected from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. The administration will also be able to shield military personnel from cuts. Meanwhile, Medicare cuts are limited to 2 percent -- well below the 7.9 percent cuts that most types of defense discretionary funding will tentatively face, and the 5.3 percent cuts in store for non-defense discretionary funding.

This list of exemptions ""is the result of tradition and legislative negotiations, rather than a defensible process of prioritizing cuts based on explicit criteria,"" said Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget matters. ""So there has already been some prioritization, but whether it is sensible or not is a separate question.""

So Obama has some justification for saying the sequester doesn't see distinctions between effective and ineffective government programs.

Ways in which the sequester does allow for some flexibility

However, Obama’s statement is somewhat misleading because, within the specific programs targeted for cuts, federal managers have a fair amount of discretion about what to reduce.

""Policymakers like to point out the most awful possible outcomes, but these aren’t necessarily how it will play out,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Under sequestration, uniform cuts must be applied to any ""program, project or activity"" that isn’t otherwise exempted. The Department of Defense alone has more than 2,500 of these programs, projects and activities, and other agencies have thousands more, according to Cooley. The Office of Management and Budget has already outlined how it would apply the cuts to some 1,200 budget accounts.

However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally.

Within a given program, ""the agencies will have great discretion in determining how to allocate the reductions, utilizing the three tools available: cutting public services, furloughing staff, and cutting government contracts,"" Cooley wrote. Because different agencies have different cost breakdowns, the pattern of reductions will vary from agency to agency. Some agencies may see widespread furloughs; others might cut back on contractors, or award fewer grants, or delay or cancel orders for supplies.

In fact, Obama’s deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, wrote a memo on Jan. 14, 2013, offering ""guiding principles"" for federal managers to use as they make cuts. These principles include:

• Using ""any available flexibility to reduce operational risks and minimize impacts on the
agency's core mission.""

• Safeguarding projects that, if cut, would ""potentially have a significant deleterious effect on the agency's mission or otherwise raise life, safety, or health concerns.""

• Using tools such as hiring freezes, releasing temporary employees, not renewing contract hires, and authorizing early buyouts.

Despite these powers of discretion over how to cut, the end result still bolsters Obama’s argument that the cuts won’t take into account the quality of a program. The kinds of cuts Zients urged are based on expediency, Meyers said, ""not on whether a program is more effective or has a higher priority than other programs.""

Our ruling

In explaining the sequester, Obama oversimplified by glossing over the tools federal managers can use their own discretion to make cuts -- tools that his own Office of Management and Budget is encouraging managers to use. However, Obama is right that the sequester does require uniform cuts to thousands of programs, with nothing to focus steeper cuts on ineffective or less important programs.

"['Corrections and Updates', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Poverty', 'Texas', 'Sarah Eckhardt']","
UPDATED: Sarah Eckhardt says unemployment in Travis County lower than nation, but poverty is worse and rising
","
CORRECTION, 2:58 p.m., Feb. 25, 2013: This article has been amended to note statistical weaknesses in comparing estimated Travis County poverty rates of 2011 and 2010. The additional information incorporates comments from Eva DeLuna Castro of the Center for Public Policy Priorities and a related statement by a U.S. Census Bureau expert. Our rating of the claim did not change. 
A Travis County commissioner who may bid in 2014 to succeed Sam Biscoe as county judge suggests conditions are tough locally despite ""present prosperity.""

In a Feb. 18, 2013, email blast, Sarah Eckhardt called for reversing ""our rising poverty,"" after writing: ""Our unemployment rate is below the national average, yet our poverty rate exceeds the national average.""

That’s a three-part claim: Is unemployment below the rest of the nation? Does the county’s poverty rate exceed the national rate--and is local poverty rising?

Unemployment

Eckhardt, a Democrat, told us by email that Travis County’s December 2012 unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, meaning that was the share of adults who did not have a job, had actively looked for work in the prior four weeks and were available for work. That was less than the Texas rate of 6.1 percent, Eckhardt said, and the U.S. rate of 7.8 percent.

Those state and national rates, she cautioned, were adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations such as changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. The county’s rate was not adjusted, Eckhardt noted.

By email, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist advised against comparing seasonally adjusted and unadjusted unemployment rates. Cheryl Abbot also said that the unadjusted December 2012 national unemployment rate was 7.6 percent when the Travis County rate was 4.9 percent.

At our request, Abbot provided a chart showing Travis County’s unemployment rate and the national rate from 2009 through 2012. The county unadjusted unemployment rate consistently was less than the national rate, the chart shows. The county experienced its highest rate, 7.3 percent, in January 2010, the same month the national rate topped out at 10.6 percent.

So, the county’s jobless rate has been lower than the national  one.

 Poverty

In 2011, Eckhardt said, Travis County and Texas had identical 18 percent poverty rates, according to the 2011 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, while the national poverty rate was 16 percent.

As noted in a Dec. 16, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, poverty rates can vary by subgroups. That story says that according to 2011 bureau surveys, 23 percent of Travis County’s school-age children lived in poverty. The story says the 2011 child poverty rate ranged in neighboring counties from 10 percent in Williamson County to 21 percent in Bastrop County. Nationally, 21 percent of children lived in poverty that year, the story says.

Eckhardt provided a chart, which she described as coming from a county presentation drawing on the bureau’s surveys, indicating the county’s poverty rate was as low as 12.5 percent in 2000, but escalated to 15.7 percent in 2005 before dipping to 14.7 percent in 2007 and then increasing for three years to 19.2 percent in 2010. 
We did not find that report. But the county’s December 2012 ""Travis County Snapshot"" report, drawing on the census surveys, says 192,436 county residents lived in poverty in 2011, down from 194,156 residents in poverty in 2010, but more than the 163,690 impoverished residents in 2009.

Next, with help from bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, we confirmed that the county had a greater share of low-income residents than the nation in 2011 when the federal poverty level for a family of four was about $23,000.

For a longer view, we checked annual poverty rates for the county, Texas and the nation from 2000 through 2011 based on the bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, which combine data from administrative records, results from the once-a-decade census and more recent population estimates and the bureau’s household surveys to ""provide consistent and reliable single-year estimates,"" the agency says. 
Estimated Poverty Rates (Percentage of Population) 
Source: Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Feb. 20, 2013) 
The county’s poverty rate was around the same as or less than the national rate from 2000 through 2002, but the county rate exceeded the national rate starting in 2003 when the county rate was 13.9 percent and the national rate was 12.5 percent, according to the estimates.

The county’s rate went up and down over the 11 years, escalating from 9.9 percent in 2000 to 15.5 percent in 2005, then dropping three straight years to 14.4 percent in 2009 before increasing to 18.8 percent in 2010--before dipping to 18.1 percent in 2011, when the national rate was 15.9 percent.

So, the county poverty rate exceeds the national rate, though the county rate decreased from 2010 to 2011, the year of the latest available rate. 
After we posted this fact check, a Texas expert objected, saying that the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates were too close for anyone to conclude poverty went down between years. Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst with the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, also said the drop in the raw estimated number of residents in poverty--as shown in the county’s snapshot report on the 2011 American Community Survey--was likewise too slight to be statistically certain.

By our eyes, the margins of error in the 2011 and 2009-11 survey results mean that about 179,000 to 206,000 residents were in poverty in 2011, compared with 176,000 to 188,000 residents in 2009-11.

Phew.

Castro said that ""when surveys require several years’ worth of data in order to be statistically significant, you can’t isolate year-to-year trends – they all get smoothed out in the averages.  That’s why looking at long-term trends, like over a decade, are more helpful.  They tell you what’s changing (or not changing) in the underlying nature of an area’s economy that really improves or worsens residents’ quality of life.""

Separately, we ran Castro’s point about comparing the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates past the Census Bureau. Wes Basel, chief of its Small Area Estimates Branch, agreed by email that the 2011-2010 difference in the county’s estimated poverty rate is ""not large enough to be statistically significant,"" though he said comparisons of the county’s 2011 estimated rate to estimates for 2005 through 2010 are statistically significant; those estimated rates mostly went up in the intervening years, though there were dips, too.

Eckhardt, standing by her claim, earlier noted the near doubling in the county’s poverty rate since 2000. ""The year-to-year snapshot is not nearly as interesting as the"" longer timeframe, she said.

Our ruling

Eckhardt said the county’s unemployment rate is below the national average, yet its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising.

The local jobless rate has consistently trailed the national rate and the county’s poverty rate has exceeded the national rate since 2003. 
The county’s poverty rate dipped from 2010 to 2011, though that dip was not statistically significant. Also, the 2011 rate of 18.1 percent was nearly double the rate in 2000, so it looks like poverty has risen over the years. Then again, Eckhardt's statement does not acknowledge that the county rate has oscillated year to year, sometimes going down. It's not been a steady rise. 
We rate her claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097808740>],/factchecks/2013/feb/21/sarah-eckhardt/sarah-eckhardt-says-unemployment-travis-county-low/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'Bill Jackson']","
Gun claim goes awry
","
(Update: Those pesky, yet observant, PolitiFact Georgia readers. Several took note of our recent fact-check of state Sen. Bill Jackson. We looked at this precise statement: ""More murders were committed last year with hammers than with shotguns, rifles or AK-47s."" That statement, which appeared in news stories,  is accurate, according to FBI homicide statistics. Trouble is there is a video of Jackson’s statement. And in that video he uses the word ""pistols"" instead of ""rifles."" That changes the entire thrust of his statement. We called the reporter who wrote the initial news story. He checked his notes and agrees he got the quote wrong. Our readers were correct. And we dedicate the following revised fact-check to their keen observation skills.)


Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue.

""There’s more with hammers than with shotguns and pistols and AK-47s,"" said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Jackson’s remarks were accurate, or was he attempting to make a political point with a bogus claim?

We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found:

In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons.

""Facts gun-control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?"" it read.

The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns.

PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728.

A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott.

""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" Abbott said in a Twitter post.

He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011.

PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True.

At first hearing, Jackson’s claim sounds similar. But when you note that he includes pistols, or handguns, in his comparison,  the similarities begin to fade.

Here are the 2011 FBI totals (the most recent year available) for the types of weapons used in homicides: 
Handguns:        6,220 
Rifles:            323 
Shotguns:        356 
Blunt Objects:        496 

As you can see, there’s a big difference between the handgun total and the rifles total and the total for shotguns. Webster's defines a pistol as a handgun. U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republicans, made a similar claim to Jackson, which we rated Pants on Fire.

To sum up, Jackson said there were more people killed with hammers than shotguns and pistols and AK-47s. There were actually 12 times as many people killed with handguns in 2011 than with blunt objects like hammers. Jackson’s claim is way off.

Mark Twain once said the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter - it’s the difference between a lightning bug and the lightning.

And where there’s lightning, things are bound to get hot -- we said that.  

We rate Jackson’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D87D40>],/factchecks/2013/feb/21/bill-jackson/gun-claim-goes-awry/
"['New Jersey', 'Debt', 'Deficit', 'State Budget', 'Jon Bramnick']","
Jon Bramnick claims New Jersey had an $11 billion deficit when Chris Christie became governor
","
It’s the number that keeps on giving.

Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick is the latest public official to get mileage from a claim about an $11 billion albatross that was hanging around Chris Christie’s neck when he became governor in 2010.

Bramnick, a Republican representing parts of Union, Somerset and Morris counties, mentioned the number during a roundtable discussion Feb. 8 for NJTV’s ""On The Record"" with Michael Aron. PolitiFact New Jersey has checked the existence of such a deficit on several occasions when Christie made similar claims.

Why did Bramnick bring up the number?

Bramnick and several other legislators were discussing the concept of the state returning money to municipalities that utilities pay towns for hosting utility poles, facilities and more. That money is paid to the state, which is supposed to then send the money – estimated in the hundreds of millions -- to the municipalities. That hasn’t happened, however, as the state grapples with various economic issues. Bramnick said the theory of returning the money is an idea no one would disagree with, but he questioned where the millions would come from.

""When this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar  -- I call it mismanagement – deficit,"" Bramnick said, adding that Christie has been working to improve the state’s finances.

Bramnick’s right that Christie took office with an $11 billion deficit, but that number is a theoretical figure only.

Let’s explain the deficit.

The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. That budget was put together under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. Christie’s first budget was for fiscal year 2012.

A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all statutory spending obligations were fully funded.

The state, however, does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute.

That means that while a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.

And like his predecessor, that’s basically what Christie did when it was his turn to craft a spending plan. In Christie’s case, he skipped a $3 billion pension payment and didn’t fully fund the school-aid formula or the state’s property tax rebate program.
 
The result? New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit for the fiscal 2012 budget year, but slightly smaller. It was $10.5 billion, according to the OLS.

So there was an approximate $11 billion deficit when Christie took office, but in theory only.

Bramnick acknowledged that the deficit in place when Christie took office was a structural deficit, and said he cited it during the discussion to illustrate the state’s financial woes.

Our ruling

Bramnick said during a roundtable discussion on NJTV’s ""On The Record"" with Michael Aron"" that ""when this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar  -- I call it mismanagement -- deficit.""

The OLS projected a nearly $11 billion structural deficit for the fiscal year 2011 budget created under Corzine, but it’s the type of deficit that measures how much money the state would need to maintain funding for services, if all required spending was fully funded and revenues stayed the same.

Bramnick’s right that a deficit existed when Christie came into office, but it was a theoretical one that resulted because administrations prior to Christie’s didn’t spend all of the money needed to fully fund required expenses -- a move Christie repeated for his first budget as governor. We rate Bramnick's claim Mostly True.

Ted Cruz says Hagel nomination ""publicly celebrated by the Iranian government""
","
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who opposes the confirmation of Chuck Hagel as U.S. Secretary of Defense, rat-a-tatted his qualms in a February opinion column posted by Politico.

The freshman Texas Republican said Hagel, whose nomination was announced by President Barack Obama on Jan. 7, 2013, had lately shifted his positions on cracking down on state sponsors of terrorism, the use of any means to prevent a nuclear Iran and his antagonism to the U.S. alliance with Israel.

Also, Cruz wrote, ""Hagel’s nomination has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government — surely an occurrence without precedent for a nominee for secretary of Defense.""

If there was a Hagel hoedown in Tehran, it didn’t make front-page news here. So, we wanted to know more about Cruz’s charge.

Cruz’s office pointed us to a Jan. 8, 2013, Reuters news account stating that a spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry had responded to a question about Hagel’s views on Israel and U.S. sanctions on Iran. By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier also noted that CBS News headlined its post of the Reuters story: ""Hagel nomination cheers Iran, worries Israel"" and the New York Times headlined the story: ""Iran: Foreign Ministry Voices Optimism in Hagel Nomination in U.S.""

The Reuters story opens: ""Iran's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it hoped the appointment of Chuck Hagel as the next U.S. defense secretary would lead to ‘practical changes’ in Washington's foreign policy.""

""Iran and the U.S., adversaries for more than three decades, are at odds over many issues, including the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme, which Western countries say is aimed at forging a nuclear arms capability,"" the story continues. ""Tehran denies this.""

At a weekly press conference, the story says, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: ""We hope there will be practical changes in American foreign policy and that Washington becomes respectful of the rights of nations.""

The comment was initially reported by Iran's IRIB news website, Reuters said, and the official ""was answering a question about Hagel's views on Israel and U.S. sanctions on Iran.""  The story says, too, that the spokesman did not elaborate.

However, with help from University of Texas professor Jason Brownlee, we found a more detailed account as posted by Iran’s semiofficial news organization, the Fars News Agency.

The Fars account further quotes the spokesman, identified there as Ramin Mehman-Parast, as saying: ""We hope that the U.S. officials will favor peace instead of warmongering and recognize the rights of nations instead of interfering in the countries’ internal affairs. If such a trend is adopted (by the American officials),"" the Fars story quotes the spokesman as saying, ""hatred for the U.S. hostile policies will decrease, although,"" he is quoted as saying, that assessment only ""can be made in action.""

We identified no other news stories on Iran commenting on the nomination and found only one expert who drew substantive meaning from the quoted comments.

Steven Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said by phone that it’s reasonable to conclude the spokesman’s comment reflects Iran’s position that Hagel’s selection could signal fresh U.S. respect. ""That’s sort of their way of saying this guy will treat us correctly as opposed to the way the rest of you have been treating us. I think that’s pretty clear,"" Bucci said. ""That comment shows they hope that Mr. Hagel comes in with a different manner and viewpoint.""

Bucci said, though, that he would not interpret the spokesman’s statements as a government celebration, which he called ""a little bit of an overstatement."" (To our follow-up query, Bucci said by email that the foundation considers Hagel unqualified to be the secretary.)

Other experts said they were unaware of Iran’s government celebrating the nomination.

Scott Bates, president of the Center for National Policy, which says it connects senior policy makers with innovative thinking and research on issues affecting U.S. security, said by phone that the Iranian spokesman hardly represents the top tier of the government and his comment seems ""very thin gruel."" More broadly, Bates said, ""Iran is far from transparent in their dealings with the international community. I’d take with a grain of salt anything to come out of the Iranian regime.""

Syracuse University political scientist Mehrzad Boroujerdi, an Iran expert, emailed that he sees nothing in the Reuters story to signal government celebration. ""There is nothing in that language that conveys enthusiasm for Hagel’s appointment,"" Boroujerdi said. ""Please keep in mind that Obama has been in office for more than 4 years and if there was any optimism it occurred 4 years ago with a new administration and not now with a candidate for Defense Secretary.""

Iran expert Trita Parsi, founder and president of the National Iranian American Council, has saluted Obama’s choice of Hagel. By email, Parsi called the ministry spokesman’s comment a standard phrase from Iran’s government which would have had nothing to do with Hagel. Parsi added that to the best of his knowledge, there has been no welcoming of Hagel by Iran, which would be extremely unusual ""since Iranian officials rarely say anything positive about American politicians."" ""Moreover,"" Parsi wrote, ""the view in Tehran tends to be that individuals in the U.S. system do not matter that much--including the president. Structural factors are too strong for them to have a decisive impact.""

John Limbert, a former ambassador who had Foreign Service tours in Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, where he was among more than 50 American hostages held for 14 months starting in November 1979, similarly said the quoted official’s comment was ""basically restating a longheld Iranian position,"" which is ""the U.S. has to show us more,"" perhaps by easing economic sanctions.

""Celebrating"" as a description, Limbert said, ""is very, very misleading.""

Separately, Alex Vatanka, who focuses on Iran for the Washington-based Middle East Institute, searched Farsi-language news sites at our request. He emailed: ""There is no sign of the Iranian regime officially expressing happiness about the nomination... In fact, there is surprisingly little sign of a coverage of this issue by Iran’s state-run media.""

Our ruling

Cruz said the Hagel nomination ""has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government.""

An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman expressed hope that with Hagel as secretary, Washington would become ""respectful of the rights of nations"" and if so, he said, Iran’s hatred of U.S. policies will decrease.

Experts differ on the significance of those comments. But they concur that the response fell short of a governmental celebration, with most saying it was far from it. Our sense is there has been no Hagel party in Iran, leaving this claim worse than incorrect. It’s ridiculous.

"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Social Security', 'Josh Mandel']","
Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel says entitlement spending expected to consume all federal revenue by 2045
","
Ohio Gov. John Kasich was bound to tick off someone when he announced this month that he wanted to expand Medicaid enrollment, using money from the federal government. From a political angle, it meant the Republican governor was embracing a component of ""Obamacare"" and trying to give about 275,000 more low-income and disabled Ohioans subsidized health care, just as Democrats wanted.

From a fiscal angle, it meant the federal government would cover the state’s costs of providing care for this bigger group. But some conservatives noted the eventual roll-off in federal money, and they said the feds could simply turn off the spigot someday if they wanted, sticking Ohio with unaffordable costs.

Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel raised a related concern that caught our eye: Money for Medicaid might seem like a gift from Washington, but it could help put the entire nation more deeply in a financial hole. Urging the state legislature to reject Medicaid expansion, Mandel on Feb. 11 wrote to state House Speaker William G. Batchelder and Senate President Keith Faber and included this statement:

""The federal government has an approximate $16.4 trillion national debt, and entitlement spending alone is projected to consume all revenue by 2045.""

Mandel’s debt figure was actually a tad low. The national debt, including money owed to investors and foreign governments as well as obligations owed from one federal account to another, was approaching $16.5 trillion -- and has since hit it -- the day he wrote his letter, according to Treasury Department data. But we wondered about Mandel’s claim that, based on projections, entitlement spending by 2045 could consume all the tax money the federal government takes in.

We asked Mandel’s press secretary, Chris Berry, to tell us more about these projections. Berry told us they came from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, and that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, had used them as well. Berry sent us a CBO spreadsheet with long-term budget projections, and offered to arrange a conference call so that he, another Mandel aide and a Heritage analyst could discuss the data with us.

We had the conversation, chiefly with Drew Gonshorowski, a Heritage policy analyst. But we also checked the figures independently, downloading them from the CBOs website, where they appear as a supplement to the CBO’s ""Long Term Budget Outlook."" This is a projection the CBO makes annually, and the latest was in June.

The CBO is a primary source for all manner of budget and spending data, used by Republicans and Democrats alike. But before we get to the CBO figures, it’s important to point out that the CBO projects future revenue and spending using two different sets of assumptions.

The first assumes that whatever is current law will continue into the future unless there is an expiration date. Income tax rates are a good example of this because they pertain directly to government revenue -- partly the subject of Mandel’s claim -- making the concept pertinent and easy to understand..

Many tax rates, including those passed by Congress during the presidency of George W. Bush and continued under President Barack Obama, are imposed for a specific period. When the CBO runs a projection based on the current law, it assumes that tax rates without expiration dates will continue but those that are scheduled to expire will, in fact, expire.

If lower rates expire, you could assume that people will pay more money to the government. There are additional economic variables built into the numbers, but you get the idea: Higher taxes mean, in these projections, more government money.

So back to Mandel’s claim: Using the CBO’s current-law projections, he would be wrong. That is, tax revenue would provide more money. This is not to say that by 2045, the year Mandel cited, entitlements would not consume a greater share of revenue than today, crowding out other priorities as health care costs rise and the retiree ranks swell. But under this projection, entitlements would not consume every revenue dollar.

So was Mandel way off base?

Actually, no. Current-law projections can be very wrong, and the CBO readily acknowledged this in its 109-page budget outlook. As it turned out, most of the income tax rates that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 did not end up expiring, for example. Congress on Jan. 1 extended them in its so-called fiscal-cliff deal. The CBO knew all along that this was fairly likely -- and factored for it in an alternative set of projections.

These alternative projections are what Mandel’s aides and Heritage used to make their case.

The alternative projections were based on a realistic understanding of politics and policy -- and one such understanding was that Congress was almost certain to extend many if not all tax cuts. With a few exceptions, notably higher rates on families earning more than $450,000, that is close to what happened.

So what did the alternative projections show about revenues and entitlements in 2045 -- that is, about Mandel’s claim?

In 2045, federal revenues could equal 18.5 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to this CBO view. That includes all sources of federal revenue, including income taxes and corporate taxes as well as  payroll taxes that are supposed to cover Social Security and a portion of Medicare (but will be insufficient, for reasons we need not get into here).

Against that, Social Security spending could equal 6 percent of GDP, and Medicare 7.6 percent. Medicaid, children’s health insurance and insurance subsidies for the Affordable Care Act could be the equivalent of 4.1 percent of GDP.

Put together, the entitlements would equal 17.7 percent of GDP.

Mandel said that spending on entitlements ""is projected to consume all revenue by 2045."" While 17.7 percent of GDP is not 18.5 percent, it represents nearly 96 percent of the revenue -- extremely close. A 96 percent score in school would get you an A,

As for the merits of using the alternative projections, CBO itself noted on page 3 of its report: ""Many budget analysts believe that the extended alternative fiscal scenario is more representative of the fiscal policies that are now (or have recently been) in effect than is the extended baseline scenario.""

Before we rule, it is important to note that Mandel made his statement in February, eight months after the CBO projections were published. In that time, some events turned out slightly differently than the CBO anticipated. And some groups question even the alternative CBO projections for other reasons.

The CBO assumes, for example, ""that income taxes do not increase as a share of GDP after ten years,""  Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told us in an email. Yet that ignores ""the growth in tax revenues that occurs automatically as real economic growth slowly moves taxpayers into higher tax brackets,"" he said.

The CBO also likely overstates future deficits, he said, by assuming that current Medicare spending controls will not continue after 10 years. These are among the reasons Van de Water concludes that Mandel’s statement is ""likely to be an exaggeration.""

Yet Mandel clearly said these were projections, not absolute certainties. While he would be wrong under one set of projections, he chose the set of projections that, as the CBO noted, are believed by many analysts to be more realistic. That is an important point.

Will they turn out to be an exaggeration? That’s possible. All sides, including Mandel, agree that efforts will be made to raise revenues or reduce the entitlement spending to keep this projected collision from occurring. The CBO cites the need, too. The political parties just disagree on how much of each is needed.

This additional information about the CBO figures is helpful in fully understanding Mandel’s claim. Yet his language was clear: He was citing projections, not certainty. When a claim is accurate but needs additional information to be fully understood, PolitiFact rates it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970098C0>],/factchecks/2013/feb/21/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-says-entitlement-spendi/
"['New Hampshire', 'Debt', 'David Cote']","
Millionaire Honeywell CEO David Cote compares today's U.S. debt to post-World War II
","
One day before President Barack Obama delivered his ""State of the Union"" address, David Cote, president of Honeywell International and a member of the president’s debt commission, shared his own thoughts. And Cote’s outlook wasn’t quite as rosy.

Cote, a New Hampshire native, returned to the Granite State  Monday, Feb. 11, in a forum hosted by ""Fix the Debt,"" a nonpartisan campaign to address the nation’s fiscal challenges.

""The recession created a huge issue for us,"" Cote said during the event, held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester.

""The only time in our history when the debt has been higher than this was the end of World War II,"" he said. ""When you think about it that way, it puts into perspective the difficulty of what we're dealing with.""

Now, PolitiFact has checked a lot of claims about the debt and whether the majority of the debt is Obama’s fault. Those typically land on the false end of the Truth-o-Meter. New Hampshire’s junior Senator Kelly Ayotte compared the amount of debt under Obama to the amount accrued under George Bush and got more favorable results.  

But here, Cote wasn’t lobbing the blame grenade.

In hard dollars, there’s little question that the debt is higher than ever before. On Feb.11, the day of the event, the debt stood at $16.49 trillion-- nearly $10 trillion more than 2002 and almost four times as much as ten years before that, according to Treasury records.

However, economists rarely use hard dollars to measure the size of the debt. Rather, they compare the debt total to the country’s gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. in a year -- to get a better picture of the true scale of the debt.

In his remarks, Cote referenced the debt to GDP ratio several times and it was clear he wasn’t talking about raw dollars.

Currently, the $16 trillion debt makes up about 73 percent of GDP, Cote said, citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to support his claim.

So, does that number rate as the second highest in history? We decided to check the records.

As part of its annual Long-Term Budget Outlook, CBO officials list the debt-to-GDP ratio going back to the 1790, the year after the Constitution took effect.

That year, the nation held a debt of $71 million, which reflected about 30 percent of GDP, according to budget office records.

By way of quick history lesson,""The U.S. was born in debt,"" wrote Matt Phillips, a reporter for the Atlantic, wrote in a November article, ""The Long Story of U.S. Debt, From 1790 to 2011, in 1 Little Chart."".

""Where did that debt come from?"" Phillips asked. ""Well, the Continental Congress, the rough equivalent of the Federal government in revolution-era America, lacked the power to tax. It first tried to pay for stuff by printing money. This currency, known as the Continental, collapsed.""

The debt ratio rose and fell over the coming years, in line with the wars ongoing at the time.

During the Civil War, the ratio rose from 2 percent in 1860, the year before the war began, to 35 percent, a record at the time, in 1865, when the war came to an end.

""The public debt surged from about $65 million in 1860 to $2.76 billion in 1866,"" Phillips wrote, citing CBO figures. ""The debt would never get below $900 million again.""

And, nearly 60 years later, the debt ratio jumped once again during World War I, rising from 3 percent in 1916, the year before the United States entered the war, to 33 percent in 1919, when the war ended.

""Often during wartimes, you see both sides of the equation growing,"" John Harvey, a professor of economics at Texas Christian University, said this week.

""It’s a big increase in spending, without question. But, often, it’s a big increase in revenue, as well,"" said Harvey, who wrote an article, ""Why Our Current National Debt is not the Largest in History,"" last year for Forbes magazine.

The debt ratio began to fall once again in the aftermath of World War I. But, in 1929, the stock market crash launched the Great Depression, which then led to increases in government spending under the New Deal, and the debt ratio rose sharply to 44 percent, a record at the time, in 1940.

From there, World War II led to unprecedented growth, both in national spending and debt accumulation. By the end of the war, the ratio rose to 106 percent in 1945 and 109 percent in 1946.

""American manufacturing made a killing (during the war), but the government debt to pay for everything was huge,"" Ron Haskins, a senior economic fellow with the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email to The Telegraph. ""We paid more than our fair share of war costs as well as post-war costs (like the Marshall Plan).""

The debt ratio remained high in the years following the war -- higher than the current 73 percent ratio. By 1951, it dipped to 67 percent, and despite some peaks and valleys over the coming decades, it did not reach the 70 percent threshold again until 2012.

""This one isn’t really the wars. These two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan) were actually pretty small,"" said Harvey, the TCU economics professor.

""More of it is because of the economy,"" he said. ""When the economy is doing poorly, tax revenues go down because there aren’t as many jobs. At the same time, more people are qualifying for welfare and social assistance, so that drives up costs. … That’s what we’re seeing now.""

Our ruling

In hard dollars, it’s not even close. The current $16.49 trillion debt is far larger than at any other point in U.S. history. But, the debt-to-GDP ratio tells a different story.

The current ratio, 73 percent, is among the nation’s highest. But, as Cote notes, it still has a ways to go to get to the 106 and 109 percent levels reached during and after World War II.

However, Cote was unspecific about comparing today’s debt to the exact end of World War II in August, 1945, or the era following the war. As noted, the debt remained higher for six years after the war than it is today.

Wayne LaPierre says New York mayor refused National Guard help after Sandy 'because Guardsmen carry guns!'
","
Buy more guns, says Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, or you’ll be thrust into the ""hellish world"" of south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy.

LaPierre, in an appeal to gun owners published Feb. 13, 2013, by conservative news site Daily Caller, wrote that ""looters ran wild."" And, he added, the mayor didn’t help:

 ""Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!""

Did Bloomberg, co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, refuse ""to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns""?

We dug into the facts and found that, while Bloomberg did mention guns when he said there wasn’t need for additional help from the National Guard, his main reason was that the New York Police Department was doing fine at keeping the peace.

 What Bloomberg refused

The NRA’s director of public affairs, Andrew Arulanandam, pointed us to the mayor’s Oct. 31, 2012, news conference, two days after Sandy’s storm surge devastated parts of New York City.

When Bloomberg opened up the floor to questions, a reporter jumped in: ""Mr. Mayor, Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz has requested additional National Guard in Brooklyn. Do you agree?""

Markowitz had called on the governor to ""allocate as many troops as possible"" to help the city’s ""brave — but overwhelmed — first responders.""

""There have been unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations,"" said Markowitz’s statement, published the day of Bloomberg’s news conference. ""All of our resources have been stretched to the limit, but in the name of public safety we need to send more National Guard personnel into Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach, Red Hook and any other locations the governor deems appropriate.""

Bloomberg, who could formally request such help from the governor, disagreed. New York City didn’t need the help, he said.

Here’s what he told the reporter who asked about Markowitz’s National Guard request:

 ""No, we appreciate the help. The National Guard has been helpful, but the NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns, and we don't need it. There has been one or two minor outbreakings, disgraceful though they may be, of looting reported in the paper, but the vast bulk of people are doing the right thing. And in Brooklyn people are safe the same way as they are in the rest of the city. We have the resources. The NYPD is 100 percent confident that we can protect the public. We've been doing this for an awful long time. You just have to take a look at the crime rate to understand how good a job this is. And the National Guard has plenty of responsibilities. There are plenty of locations upstate and into surrounding states where they don't have a police department the size of New York, and they can use help from the state, and that's where they should be.""

But even though the full context of his remarks indicates his reason was that the NYPD didn't need the help, the media pounced on his gun reference.

The NRA pointed us to a snippet from the Atlantic Wire, which covered the briefing live: ""3:19 p.m. ‘The NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns,’ Bloomberg says when asked if he asked for National Guard help in Brooklyn.""

The NRA also noted that the next day, the Brooklyn Paper wrote that Bloomberg ""snubbed Borough President Markowitz’s impassioned plea to bring the National Guard to Hurricane Sandy-scarred Brooklyn — arguing that approving the Beep’s request would be a waste of federal manpower and turn the borough into a police state.""

Conservative media picked up the story from there:

• NewsBusters: ""Thursday Report: Bloomberg Wouldn't Let Guard Into Brooklyn Over Their Possession of Guns.""

• Fox Nation: ""Report: Bloomberg Denied National Guard Assistance In Brooklyn Because Of Their Possession Of Guns.""

• Hot Air: ""Bloomberg kept National Guard out of NYC because they had guns?""

• Breitbart: ""BLOOMBERG TO BROOKLYN: NATIONAL GUARD NOT ALLOWED WITH GUNS.""

Did Bloomberg refuse to allow the National Guard into the city? Not exactly.

He requested National Guard support from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and got it.

The day before Bloomberg’s news conference, Cuomo ""mobilized more than 2,300 Soldiers and Airmen"" to help, including in New York City. Several days later, Cuomo’s office announced that more than 3,300 members of the National Guard had been deployed, including 850 from out of state.

The out-of-state reinforcements were housed at Floyd Bennett Field — in southeast Brooklyn.

John McCarthy of Bloomberg’s office told PolitiFact that the National Guard was in the city ""before, during and after the storm.""

 Order and disorder

But LaPierre’s partly right: Bloomberg didn’t ask for National Guard troops ""to restore civil order.""

Law enforcement wasn’t part of their requested mission, said Eric Durr, director of public affairs for the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs.

Local government ran the show, requesting help from the state, he said. And Bloomberg didn’t ask for armed troops.

""Our soldiers were there to assist in storm recovery,"" Durr said. ""They were not carrying weapons.""

And that’s ""incredibly typical,"" said Durr, who joined the New York National Guard in 1988.

 In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, for example, he didn’t carry a weapon.

Bloomberg’s office confirmed the mayor ""did not want security provided by anyone other than NYPD.""

Why?

""Because they are the best police force in the world,"" McCarthy said.

The city’s police force, with about 34,500 in uniform, is more than twice the size of the New York National Guard.

But LaPierre also suggested there was a loss of civil order that required restoration.

Just how much disorder was there?

According to Bloomberg’s office, Brooklyn borough president Markowitz, the New York Police Department and a congressman representing Brooklyn — not so much.

In the week after the storm, crime overall was down. Burglary was up.

The day Markowitz had appealed for more aid, the New York Times and New York Post had reported isolated looting in the evacuated Rockaways and Coney Island, with about two dozen arrests. The Post quoted unnamed sources describing people grabbing shirts from an Ann Taylor display, plus gadgets from a Brookstone store ""before cops arrived to stand guard.""

In response to LaPierre’s Daily Caller article, the Los Angeles Times reported that while crime overall dropped in the city after Sandy, there had been some spikes in burglary — 17 burglaries in a precinct that last year had eight and 14 burglaries in a precinct that last year had three.

But citywide, the Times reported, ""there was a drop of 17% in shootings, 47% in rapes, 22% in robberies, 18% in assaults, 45% in grand larceny, and 22% in stolen cars. The city also went a record eight days without a murder directly after Sandy.""

Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries, a Democrat who represents New York’s Eighth District, wrote a letter to LaPierre, saying his ""suggestion that the residents of southern Brooklyn were in grave danger due to 'looters' that 'ran wild' is baseless.""

""I spent countless hours in the communities of Coney Island and Sea Gate. Nothing about your characterization of lawlessness rings true,"" Jeffries wrote.

And Markowitz, the borough president who had requested the National Guard help, wrote to LaPierre, ""Your assertion that ‘looters ran wild in South Brooklyn,’ proves just how totally ignorant you are of what’s really going on in Brooklyn and what’s really in the best interest of Brooklynites. Your perception of Hurricane Sandy is nothing but fiction.""

(Seemed a little harsh to us from the guy who had pointed out ""unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations."" But that’s certainly more reserved than ""looters ran wild."")

Our ruling

LaPierre described a ""hellish world"" in south Brooklyn after Hurricane Sandy where the mayor ""refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns."" 
He is wrong that Bloomberg refused to allow the National Guard into the city -- troops were already there and more arrived in the days afterward. However, he's right that Bloomberg rejected an armed National Guard, although the full context of the mayor's remarks indicate his primary reason was he felt the NYPD was able to keep the peace without the Guard's help.

Obama too soft on Wall Street? Public worries about Wall Street's influence
","
Skeptical voters questioned President Barack Obama about the sluggish economy at a town hall broadcast on CNBC on Sept. 20, 2010.

One of those voters was a hedge fund manager who felt that Obama was being too mean to the financial community.

""Listen, I represent the Wall Street community,"" the questioner said. ""We have felt like a piñata. Maybe you don't feel like you're whacking us with a stick, but we certainly feel like we've been whacked with a stick. So I certainly think that Main Street and Wall Street are connected, and if we're going to heal the society and make the economy better, how are we going to work towards that, healing Wall Street and Main Street?""

Obama replied that he often discusses the connection between Wall Street and Main Street. ""We need a vibrant, vital financial sector that is investing in businesses, investing in jobs, investing in our people, providing consumers loans so they can buy products -- all that is very important and we want that to thrive. But we've got to do so in a responsible way,"" he said.

""Now, I had been amused over the last couple years -- this sense of somehow me beating up on Wall Street -- I think most folks on Main Street feel like they got beat up on,"" Obama said. ""There's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street,"" he added. That's probably the majority, not the minority."" (We should note that Obama was interrupted by applause during these comments.""

We've noticed that some of Obama's political opponents repeatedly say he is anti-business, so we were intrigued by Obama's comment that ""there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" So we went out in search of data.

Interestingly, we couldn't find a poll that directly and specifically asked the public whether President Obama had been too soft or too tough on Wall Street.

But we did find one poll that was pretty close. A poll conducted in May 2010 by CBS News asked, ""Do you think the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration?""

""Too much,"" said a resounding majority of 59 percent. After that, 21 percent said they were unsure, while 12 percent said the right amount and 5 percent said too little.

We also found that most Americans favor new financial regulations that Obama signed into law in July. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in August showed 61 percent approved of the legislation, the highest of any of Obama's legislative accomplishments.

Finally, it's worth mentioning Gallup's poll from July that asked the public about its confidence in various institutions. Gallup asked which institutions merited ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence. The presidency garnered 36 percent confidence, while banks got 23 percent and ""big business"" got 19 percent. (Congress did the worst, with 11 percent.)

But polls can be contradictory, particularly when questions are asked in a different way. So we looked for data that would undermine Obama's claim.

We found one poll that indicated people might be more conflicted about government being tough on Wall Street. A poll from May asked people which of two scenarios they feared more: ""that the government will go too far in regulating financial institutions and markets, making it harder for the economy to grow, OR, that the government will not go far enough in regulating financial institutions and markets, leaving the country at risk of another financial crisis?""

Respondents split fairly evenly in this poll from Pew Research and the National Journal: 46 percent worried the government would go too far with financial regulation, while 44 percent worried government wouldn't go far enough. Another 11 percent were unsure, and the margin of error was 4 percent.

But even that fits with Obama's statement that ""there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" Obama added, ""That's probably the majority, not the minority,"" but his use of the word probably indicates he's unsure.

Here, we're checking Obama's statement that there's ""a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."" We didn't find a lot of polling data on this question. The question that addresses it most closely was whether ""the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration."" The resounding answer to that was yes, they have too much influence. We rate Obama's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BB1880>],/factchecks/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/obama-too-soft-wall-street-public-worries-about-wa/

Tom Barrett says Milwaukee violent crime at lowest point in 20 years
","
Long before he entered the race for governor, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett trumpeted the work of Police Chief Edward Flynn, who rode into town in January 2008 with the mayor’s strong backing.

Indeed, every quarter seems to bring an announcement that the city’s violent crime rate -- a  precise measure of certain crimes set by the FBI -- has fallen again.

Barrett, a Democrat running against Republican Scott Walker, on his campaign website highlights those crime trends as good news of historic proportions.

""Under Tom Barrett’s leadership, violent crime in Milwaukee has decreased by over 20% -- to its lowest levels in more than 20 years,"" the website reads. ""He has worked with law enforcement, community groups and residents to develop proactive strategies, and empowered the city's police department with strong leadership and the tools it needs to get the job done.""

The claim of a big drop and a 20-year-low caught our attention, so we put it to the test.

And it failed.

When we asked the Barrett campaign to back up the claim, campaign spokesman Phil Walzak cited a Journal Sentinel story from Jan. 21, 2010,  ""Crime in Milwaukee continues to decline."" The article compared 2009 figures to those from 2007.

Of course, Barrett was elected mayor and took office in April 2004, so the clock on his leadership started ticking three years earlier.

So, why start with 2007?

In an e-mail, Walzak said the campaign started there ""because those are the figures that most closely measure the work of Chief Flynn, whose appointment as MPD Chief Tom supported and who Tom has worked closely with to implement new crime-fighting tactics.""

The campaign goes even further back -- all the way to the tenure of Police Chief Robert Ziarnik --  for its claim that violent crime hasn’t been lower in more than 20 years.

For its index of violent crime, the FBI looks at four specific types of crimes: Homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. It is part of the Uniform Crime Reporting program, which includes a separate measure of nonviolent crimes. These are the statistics Flynn and Barrett cite each quarter when they tout the improvement in the city’s violent crime numbers.

Walzak, though, says for the 20-year measure they are looking strictly at homicides.

So, we’re already off on a bad track -- the campaign cherry-picked two years of data, not all the years of Barrett’s tenure. And it used homicides as a stand-in for all violent crime.

To be sure, homicides attract the most attention. But Flynn and Barrett have regularly cited the broader number, with experts saying the murder rate alone can distort the picture. (Of the 6,446 violent crimes reported in 2009, 72 were homicides)

Here’s what we found when we crunched the numbers:

When you compare 2004, the year Barrett took office, with last year, reported violent crime incidents were 36 percent higher in 2009 than 2004.

(Even if you make Barrett’s first full year in office, 2005, the baseline year, violent crime was still 5 percent higher last year.)

If you look strictly at homicides, there was an 18 percent drop from 2004 to 2009.

But the Barrett campaign talks about all violent crimes -- then it morphs the homicide number into the crime rate number and carries the comparison back decades.

Homicides are at their lowest point in at least two decades. But the high-water mark in terms of all violent crime since 1990 actually came during Barrett’s tenure, in 2006.

What’s going on here?

When Barrett came into office on April 20, 2004, violent crime was at its lowest point during the past 20 years, thanks to a seven-year period when the numbers plummeted (see chart with this item).

Barrett’s second full year, 2006, was marked by a surge to the highest point since 1990. Indeed, the city was among the national leaders in a spike in violent crimes.

Since then, violent crime has fallen considerably, but reported incidents were still well above the 2004 level.

National trends factor in. Crime experts have said the decline in violent crime that began in the 1990s was part of a long-term pattern. They cited falling crack cocaine use, a strong economy and other societal factors, with some citing tougher police strategies.

Likewise, the subsequent jump was attributed to many factors.

In 2007, Barrett himself cited a decline in federal funds for the community-oriented policing service program and the need for responsible gun legislation.

Whatever the reasons behind the trends, the Barrett campaign is playing loose with its words and the numbers.

The campaign defines its bragging about what has happened ""under Tom Barrett’s leadership."" But it cherry-picks the best two years to highlight, ignoring the full picture for his time in office.

Then the campaign goes beyond Barrett’s time in office to say violent crime is at a 20-year low. This time it picks the pit out of the cherry, using the homicide rate as a stand-in for all violent crimes. In truth, the 20-year high point for violent crime was in 2006, two years into Barrett’s term.

All that cherry-picking leaves voters with a false impression -- and leaves us with a sour taste. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

DeKalb official says she's no big travel spender
","
DeKalb County school board member Sarah Copelin-Wood offered what she considered a reasonable explanation a couple of months ago when she decided not to take a pay cut, although most of her fellow board members agreed to trim their salaries by 10 percent.

""I have given $30,000 of my unused travel expenses over the years to supplement the school system's general budget,"" Copelin-Wood told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

When the AJC reported that it couldn't independently verify how much money Copelin-Wood said she had given back to the school district, the board member asked DeKalb school officials in an e-mail to provide the newspaper detailed information about her travel budget. Copelin-Wood is in a three-way race to stay on the DeKalb school board. She suggested politics was behind the complaints that she didn't take the pay cut.

In an e-mail, she wrote ""this is a campaign ploy in a vicious, flagrant attempt to 'publicly malign' by 'some - not all,' other DeKalb school board members who 'are not' up for re-election."" She was first elected to the board in 1998.

DeKalb school leaders ordered furloughs on teachers, administrators, secretaries and other employees to cut the budget by $104 million. The nine-member board adopted a budget of slightly more than $1 billion. Some school board members initially proposed a 5 percent pay cut for themselves in a Clintonesque ""I feel your pain"" message of solidarity with other DeKalb school employees.

Zepora Roberts was the only other school board member who didn't take the 10 percent pay cut. Roberts told the AJC she needed the salary. DeKalb school board members are paid $18,000 a year, which is in line with school board member salaries in Cobb and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta.

DeKalb school board members, like most elected officials in the Atlanta region, occasionally travel to work-related conferences and training in other cities and states. The school district budgets $4,000 a year for each of its nine board members for travel-related expenses. The annual travel budget has ranged between $3,500 and $5,000 during the past 10 budget cycles. Board members can spend their own money for travel and get reimbursed by the county.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia filed an open records request with the DeKalb school system to find out if Copelin-Wood's numbers are correct. During the past 10 annual budget cycles, Copelin-Wood could have spent $45,957 on travel, county records show. She spent $12,722, but did not spend $33,235, the records show. Copelin-Wood has not spent any money on travel in the current budget year, which began July 1. The unspent funds are kept by the county.

""Budgeted travel amounts not utilized by each board member shall remain in the general fund and shall be designated for innovative, educational projects for the subsequent fiscal year,"" states the county school board's website.

School board Chairman Tom Bowen said Copelin-Wood would have been better off if she had said she had ""saved"" more than $30,000 for the DeKalb district, instead of saying she had ""given"" those funds back.

""There's nothing for her to give back. It's on a reimbursement basis. She's contributing to savings for the district,"" Bowen said.

Copelin-Wood focused on the amount of money she hasn't spent when we asked about how she characterized her travel spending.

Copelin-Wood was correct regarding the amount of travel funds that she has not spent in recent years. However, we believe her terminology in describing the process would convey the impression that she voluntarily agreed to give those funds to the county. Her statement leaves out important details, and we rate it as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809700C040>],/factchecks/2010/sep/22/sarah-copelin-wood/dekalb-official-says-shes-no-big-travel-spender/

Alex Sink: Florida spends $300 million on remedial pre-K through third grade students
","
With Miami-Dade College and the New World School of the Arts as her backdrop, Alex Sink, Democratic candidate for governor, unveiled her education platform to supporters on Sept. 1, 2010.

Her plans call for creating a statewide data system for tracing students at risk of dropping out and grading schools based on student progress throughout the school year, not solely on the current standard of Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test scores.

""If we don't have a firm education system, I'm not going to be able to take Florida where we need to go,"" Sink said in an interview with the Times/Herald prior to the campaign event.

Sink also proposes creating a uniform pre-K curriculum and ensuring that every pre-K classroom is equipped with a teacher who has earned a bachelor's degree. Improving early education would help eliminate costs associated with students being held back, Sink contends.

""Florida spends more than $300 million a year just on children repeating pre-K through 3rd grade,’’ Sink says on her campaign website.

We decided to look further into Sink’s claim. Is Florida in fact spending $300 million to educate children who had to repeat at least one of those grades?

Sink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings said the $300 million figure was arrived at by multiplying the number that Florida spends per public school student ($7,000) by the approximate number of students from pre-K through third grade who were held back a grade.

The $7,000 in spending is actually $6,871 according to figures provided by the Department of Education.

The campaign referred us to a February 2009 Florida Department of Education report that indicates nearly 43,000 public school students between kindergarten and third grade were held back during the 2007-08 school year. (The exact figure, according to the report was 42,885 students.)

Using the multiplication essentials we learned in third grade, we were able to verify that Sink’s numbers did round up to the figure she cited on her website. (42,855 X $6,871 = $294,456,705)

However, a more recent March 2010 report, provided by the Department of Education, shows a slight decrease in the number of students not promoted a grade level during the 2008-09 school year. Last year, 39,469 students in kindergarten through third grade were held back.

Using the more current figure, the state spent close to $271 million on remediation of those students last school year. (39,469 x $6,871 = $271,191,499).

Why are there so many elementary school students being held back each year? An analysis from the DOE points to ""state laws requiring mandatory retention of third grade students who are not reading at grade level by the end of the school year.""

Still, it’s important to note that the number of students held back a year has started to drop since the 2005-2006 school year and the figures are in the third page of DOE’s report. If that trend continues, the state will continue to spend less on remedial education.

So back to the claim. Does Florida spend $300 million on remedial education for students held back between pre-K through third grade. The report Sink’s campaign cited was not the most recent, therefore their numbers are off by a couple of million. But, with the state spending close to $271 million in education for those children held back, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D04400>],/factchecks/2010/sep/21/alex-sink/alex-sink-florida-spends-300-million-students-held/

Gov. Ted Strickland ties Ohio's job losses to John Kasich’s votes as a congressman
","
Gov. Ted Strickland's re-election campaign hasn't wavered from the message that his Republican opponent, John Kasich, cost Ohio jobs when he was a congressman by supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement and overseas trade deals, especially with China.

A Strickland TV ad, ""Truth,"" sticks to the theme with claims that have been posted on the campaign's website:

""Kasich’s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China.""

The ad says voting for NAFTA, which took effect in 1994 and eliminated most trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States, cost the state 49,000 jobs to Mexico. It says 91,000 Ohio jobs were lost to China because of Kasich’s vote in 2000 to normalize trade relations with China.

We wondered if the effect of the trade deals on jobs was so clear-cut - and if the numbers can be determined so specifically.

Calculating job losses and gains is not a simple matter of counting heads.

The ad's estimate of job losses tied to NAFTA comes from a 2006 study by the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-union think tank that has long been critical of NAFTA. The study did not, however, claim to count actual job losses. Extrapolating from employment, census and trade data, it estimated how many jobs might have been supported by production that the study says was ""displaced"" by growing U.S. trade deficits with Canada and Mexico.

There are other complications.

The nonpartisan General Accounting Office said that job losses were overestimated, because some NAFTA imports displaced imports from other countries instead of production in the U.S.

Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service concluded that factors other than NAFTA caused the widening trade deficit with Mexico. And the Congressional Research Service, evaluating studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the World Bank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the U.S. International Trade Commission, found that none attributed changes in employment levels to NAFTA.

The estimate of jobs lost to China carries virtually identical problems. The figure also comes from EPI, through a study published this year. It also is based on ""displaced production"" resulting from trade imbalance, and not on a tally of actual job losses.

Further clouding the estimate is the effect that other economic policies and forces - including product dumping, price controls and currency manipulation - have on the trade imbalance. The effect of normalized trade relations cannot be isolated.

Kasich did vote for NAFTA in the House of Representatives in 1993 and for normalizing trade relations with China in 2000. Labeling them as ""Kasich’s trade deals,"" as does the ad, is a stretch, though.

The Clinton administration supported NAFTA, and 102 Democrats joined Republicans voting for the agreement, which the House approved 234 to 200. Clinton also fought for the Chinese trade bill, which the House passed with 164 Republican and 73 Democratic votes.

Strickland, who was also in Congress, voted against both measures.

So in the end, here’s what we’re left with:

Michele Bachmann accuses Nancy Pelosi of spending $100,000 on alcohol for flights

Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., delivered one of her signature hard-hitting speeches at the Values Voter Summit, a conference for socially conservative activists on Sept. 17, 2010. At one point, Bachmann took a shot at the woman who leads her chamber, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Pelosi, Bachmann said, ""has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying."" Bachmann was referring to the Air Force jets that Pelosi uses to fly internationally and back to her home in San Francisco. (Her Republican predecessor, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, used them as well, under a program approved under President George W. Bush.)

Bachman's claim drew a rapid counterattack from the Speaker's office, as aides revived arguments they'd used when the allegation first surfaced months earlier. Among other things, Pelosi's office noted that the Speaker ""does not drink alcohol"" and that there ""is no alcohol service on the domestic flights the Air Force operates for travel from Washington to San Francisco for the Speaker.""

Two politicians diverging over the facts? Sounds like a job for PolitiFact.

We tracked down the original source of Bachmann's allegation, which was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues.

In a press release summarizing the findings, Judicial Watch wrote that ""the Speaker’s military travel cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period — $101,429.14 of which was for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol.""

The release gave as an example one Congressional delegation that traveled from Washington through Tel Aviv to Baghdad between May 15, 2008, and May 20, 2008, ""to discuss matters of mutual concern with government leaders."" The purchases included ""Johnny Walker Red scotch, Grey Goose vodka, E&J brandy, Bailey’s Irish Crème, Maker’s Mark whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Bacardi Light rum, Jim Beam whiskey, Beefeater gin, Dewars scotch, Bombay Sapphire gin, Jack Daniels whiskey, Corona beer and several bottles of wine,"" the release said.

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton seized on the party-plane theme. ""Speaker Pelosi has a history of wasting taxpayer funds with her boorish demands for military travel,"" Fitton was quoted as saying in the release. ""And these documents suggest the Speaker’s congressional delegations are more about partying than anything else.""

Other critics of Pelosi piled on soon after the Judicial Watch documents came to light. World Net Daily, a conservative website, led its article by saying that the purchases for the 2008 trip ""reads like a dream order for a wild frat party ... But that single receipt makes up just part of the more than $101,000 taxpayers paid for 'in-flight services' -– including food and liquor -- for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.""

To Pelosi's critics, it must be irresistible to paint a rival as someone who leads debauched lawmakers on cushy overseas trips, only to stick taxpayers with the bill. But Bachmann's version of the facts is way off base.

Bachmann said at the Values Voter Summit that Pelosi ""has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying."" To us, Bachmann is clearly saying that Pelosi has spent $100,000 specifically on alcohol -- but that interpretation doesn't fly with the Judicial Watch summary.

The news release said that the $101,429.14 amount was for ""in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol."" But our friends at the website FactCheck.org determined that the sum spent on alcohol is a small proportion of that amount and that not all of the expenses were in-flight. ""It’s clear that Judicial Watch is counting as 'in-flight expenses' any non-reimbursable Air Force expenditure besides transportation costs,"" FactCheck.org wrote. ""That category actually includes all non-plane costs of the trip, including baggage fees, meeting room rentals and refreshments, and, frequently, good-will lapel pins — as well as meals, ground transportation and lodging in U.S. territory.""

A spokeswoman for Judicial Watch confirmed to PolitiFact that ""the tab amount includes, but is not limited to, alcohol and food.""

Incidentally, the receipt that was the source of the ""frat party"" jab in World Net Daily, and which was also linked to in Judicial Watch's press release, shows a decidedly more modest pricetag for the ""bar tab"" -- namely, $560.28, purchased at what appears to have been a no-frills base exchange at Maryland's Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, D.C.

The full receipt isn't reproduced in the FOIA documents, so we can't be sure what percentage is food and what percentage is alcohol. But even if you use the full amount to extrapolate the total paid for alcohol, it doesn't come close to $100,000 Bachmann says. If Pelosi is to be believed that no alcohol is served on her domestic flights (which account for most of the flights she took as Speaker) and if you agree with FactCheck.org that she took a total of 12 international trips, then the total cost of alcohol would have been something less than $7,000, far lower than Bachmann's $100,000.

It's fair game to argue that buying liquor for lawmaker jaunts is an unjustifiable taxpayer expenditure even if perfectly legal. However, if Bachmann wanted to criticize these outlays, she should have read the Judicial Watch news release more closely. Since Bachmann (or her staff) didn't do so, she ended up citing a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to the much larger number for all non-plane costs of the trip. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4CBC00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/21/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-accuses-nancy-pelosi-spending-100/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Sean Duffy']","
Sean Duffy says Julie Lassa took a pay raise that other legislators gave back
","
Democratic State Sen. Julie Lassa has a $3,000 headache on her hands.

Lassa, seeking the 7th District congressional seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, is on the defensive about a pay raise for legislators that took effect in January 2009.

How lawmakers handled that raise is turning up as a campaign issue in several races this fall. Sean Duffy, the Republican candidate for the northwest Wisconsin seat, calls Lassa a ""Madison insider"" and uses the pay issue to support his position.

An Aug. 25, 2010 Duffy news release noted that some state lawmakers refused their pay raise, given budget constraints, but that Lassa took the annual $2,530 increase -- even as ""the state was hemorrhaging more than 100,000 jobs.""

It went on to quote Duffy campaign manager Matt Seaholm: ""Lassa willingly took a hefty pay raise at a time when people throughout her district and the state were losing their jobs.""

So, is the charge on the money?

We asked Duffy campaign spokeswoman Wendy Riemann for evidence to back up the attack on Lassa. She cited a January 13, 2009 editorial in the Stevens Point Journal, printed shortly after the raises took effect.

Said Riemann: ""All of the legislators got that raise, and many of the legislators said they were going to give it back and she’s on record as saying, ‘I’m keeping that money.’""

Let’s look at how legislators are paid:

Members of the state Assembly and Senate are paid $49,943. They received a $2,530 (5.06 percent) pay raise, which took effect in January of 2009 and lasts for the next two-year legislative term.  Lawmakers also receive $88 for each day they spend in Madison.

In the editorial cited by the Duffy campaign, Lassa defended the raise, saying it was only the second increase for legislators in six years, and less than the rate of inflation.

Legislators don’t vote on their salaries; pay is set by a panel in the state Department of Employment Relations and then voted on by a joint committee of the Legislature. The full bodies don’t vote on their salaries. Lassa is not a member of the committee.

In the latest tally, 31 of 33 state senators are giving back some portion of their raises, using a variety of methods. According to Senate Chief Clerk Robert Marchant, here’s how Lassa is handling her raise: 
So, where does that leave us?

The Duffy campaign is partially right: Lassa took the pay raise -- for about 13 months. But long before they launched the attack and before she announced her congressional campaign, Lassa had already started to give some back. With her approach, she will give 48.41 percent of her raise back, or about half. That’s where we rate Duffy’s statement as well: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CEBC00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/21/sean-duffy/sean-duffy-says-julie-lassa-took-pay-raise-other-l/

TV ads clash on Barnes record
","
Georgians can watch a new version of grumpy old men on their TV sets.

In one version, two gray-haired men are sitting around a table with a red and white checkerboard tablecloth talking about former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes.

""Remember how [Barnes] made Georgia last, dead last, in education?"" one says.

""Yeah,"" the other man replies, shaking his head affirmatively.

""And remember how Georgia led the nation in job losses?"" the first man asks.

""Yeah,"" the other man answers.

The 30-second video premiered last week, paid for by the Republican Governors Association. The GOP governors obviously don't want Barnes, the Democratic Party's nominee for governor, back in the job. The big question for AJC PolitiFact Georgia: Are the claims the two men discuss in the ad correct?

The Barnes camp obviously doesn't think so. It released a 30-second ad Monday that is clearly a response to the RGA. In the Barnes ad, two graybeards are sitting at a table with the same type of tablecloth dishing about Nathan Deal with the same music in the background. This ad contends Barnes ""brought in 235,000 jobs as governor."" (AJC PolitiFact Georgia ruled the claim he ""created"" 235,000 jobs Half True in June.) The men say Barnes reduced classroom sizes in an effort to combat the attack their candidate should get an F in education.

""So this Washington guy Deal is lying?"" one man asks.

""He's slippery as a bag of snakes,"" the other man replies.

They both laugh.

Now that we've addressed the theatrics, let's look at the claims that prompted such a quick reply from the Barnes camp.

Let's start with the first claim, that Georgia was ""dead last in education"" when Barnes was governor. Barnes was governor from January 1999 to January 2003.

RGA communications director Mike Schrimpf said there were two explanations for the first claim. First, he pointed to a Manhattan Institute report published in 2001 that found Georgia had the lowest high school graduation rate of any state. We found the report and, indeed, it found Georgia was last in graduation rates. The report, however, was about students who graduated in 1998, which was the year before Barnes took office. (Note: The study's authors later noted an error in their graduation rate methodology and said it corrected the mistake.)

We decided to look elsewhere for graduation rate data. The National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education, looked at graduation rates in 2001-02, which included Barnes' last full year as governor. That year, Georgia's rate was 61.1 percent, which ranked 47th, ahead of New York (60.5 percent), Tennessee (59.6 percent) and South Carolina (57.9 percent). Schrimpf noted that Georgia and Florida were tied for the lowest graduation rate among students who graduated in 2001, according to Manhattan Institute research.

The RGA's second argument for claiming Georgia was ""dead last"" in education focuses on SAT scores. In 2002, Barnes' last full year as governor, Georgia ranked last among the nation's 50 states in the average SAT score.

Some education scholars said at the time that there are several explanations for Georgia's woeful ranking. Other states had a higher percentage of their best students who took the exam, Gregory Marchant, an educational psychology professor at Indiana's Ball State University, wrote in an op-ed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Marchant and others also noted warnings that state comparisons using SAT data are invalid. The College Board, which administers the SAT, told PolitiFact Georgia as much when we looked at a candidate's claim that Georgia's SAT scores were lower than neighboring Alabama.

""Not all students in a high school, school district or state take the SAT. Since the population of test-takers is self-selected, using aggregate SAT scores to compare or evaluate schools, districts, states or other educational units is not valid, and the College Board strongly discourages such uses,"" the College Board said in a statement.

On the ACT, the other test frequently used as an indicator of college potential, Georgia ranked near the bottom during Barnes' term, which began in 1999 and ended in January 2003. The Peach State was ahead of other Southern states such as Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina in each full year of Barnes' term.

We gave outgoing Attorney General Thurbert Baker a Half True rating in June when he used Georgia's SAT scores to claim they ""are right at the bottom.""

So what about the other claim, that Georgia led the nation in job losses? A front-page article in the AJC on Dec. 22, 2001, had the headline ""Georgia leads nation in job losses."" The story reported that Georgia lost nearly 80,000 jobs during a 12-month stretch, more than any other state, including New York, which suffered through the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The bulk of Georgia job losses were in the service industry and manufacturing.

So are the two men in the RGA commercial right? They were correct about the job losses. The claim about Georgia being ""dead last"" in education is more troubling. The RGA ad needs more context, such as the College Board's warning, to understand the importance of the SAT rankings. The ACT must also be considered when looking at Georgia's education standing. We rate the RGA commercial on Barnes as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F1100>],/factchecks/2010/sep/21/republican-governors-association/tv-ads-clash-barnes-record/
"['Transparency', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","

Rick Perry says Bill White didn't pay taxes while working for feds in 1995
","
Republican Gov. Rick Perry hasn't seen Democratic challenger Bill White's 1995 tax return. Even so, he says White didn't pay taxes that year. 
""Bill White hiding his taxes because he didn't pay them,"" says the headline on a Sept. 7 news release from Perry's campaign. That's followed by this header: ""Liberal trial lawyer didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy (U.S.) secretary of energy."" 
Perry's press release did not say what kind of taxes he meant, though we suspect most observers would conclude that he is referring to White not paying federal income taxes that year. Perry said as much as we wrapped up our research on this topic, telling San Antonio's KTSA-550 AM last week that White ""didn't pay any income tax in 1995."" We believe that dramatic charge is impossible to independently prove or disprove without access to the relevant White tax return. 
Later that day, White told the station: ""I served part of the year in the federal government. I paid income tax; there was withholding. And the other half of the year, when I was out of government, I lost money in my business with a self-employed business and so then I got a refund."" 
Some background: White's tax returns have proved a Perry talking point. While White has released returns from his mayoral tenure (2004-09), Perry said he would not agree to a debate until he made public his tax returns from when he was deputy energy secretary in President Bill Clinton's administration (1993-95) and chairman of the Texas Democratic Party (1995-98). That didn't happen. 
In his Sept. 7 press release, Perry says White's 1995 tax obligation was ""uncovered"" in an Aug. 14 Dallas Morning News article citing information from White's campaign that he reported ""no taxable income for 1995."" 
Katy Bacon, White's campaign spokeswoman, declined to share the candidate's 1995 tax return or grant us an interview with White's accountant. But to counter Perry's charge that White paid no taxes while earning his federal pay in 1995, she sent us figures that she said White's camp gave the Dallas newspaper in August; they showed White's annual taxable income from 1993 through 1995 and his annual tax liability. For 1995, White's taxable income was listed as zero and his tax as $3,482. 
Katinka Podmaniczky, an Energy Department spokeswoman, confirmed that White's annual salary at the agency was $133,600. He resigned from the post in August 1995, according to White's 1995 federal financial disclosure report. 
Bacon told us in an e-mail that White grossed nearly $90,000 for his work at the department that year and that $21,568 in federal income taxes were withheld from his paycheck. He did not have another job in 1995 for which federal taxes were withheld, she said. 
""After he left Department of Energy, while starting a new business, his losses were such that he had no 'taxable income' and a refund of $24,186,"" Bacon said. (His refund was larger than the amount of taxes withheld, she said, because ""he had also paid in estimated taxes and had rolled over an overpayment from 1994 that totalled $6,100."") 
She said the new business was White Acquisitions, which ""pursued investments in oil and gas services and oil and gas."" She told us that the firm was formed in September 1995 and dissolved on the last day of 1997. According to Bacon, White owned the company, there were no other investors and he was the ""sole shareholder."" 
Based solely on information from the White campaign, here's the tax math so far: Counting what he paid through withholding and estimated tax payments, plus his overpayment from 1994, White was credited with paying a total of $27,668 in income tax in 1995. His business losses the same year erased most of his tax liability, so he received a $24,186 refund. That left $3,482, which the federal government kept because he owed ""household employment taxes ... on the income he paid to his employee,"" a housekeeper, Bacon said. 
Separately, we asked a tax policy expert whether it's possible to have no taxable income while still paying federal taxes on earnings. 
Sure, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. He told us that if White's taxable income was zero after all of his investment losses and other adjustments (exemptions, deductions, credits) were taken into account, his federal income tax liability would indeed have been zero. That would have produced a refund of income tax. 
However, Williams said, the vast majority of American workers also pay Medicare and Social Security taxes, commonly known as payroll taxes, which the government doesn't refund. If White paid those, ""they are gone,"" Williams said. 
To address this aspect without handing over White's tax return, his campaign agreed to our suggestion that White ask the Energy Department to release all the taxes that were withheld from his pay in 1995. In an e-mail to the White campaign that was forwarded to us, the agency's payroll department listed $21,568.45 in federal income taxes, $3,794.40 in Social Security and $1,302.55 in Medicare taxes that were withheld from White's pay. 
(According to his 1995 tax return, Perry had $3,794 in Social Security and $1,121 in Medicare taxes withheld from the state salary he received as state agriculture commissioner.) 
Now to the Truth-O-Meter: Perry's press release claimed that White ""didn't pay taxes while earning $133,600 annual salary as deputy secretary of energy."" Later, he said he was referring to income taxes. Regardless of what sort of taxes Perry meant, we confirmed that White was paying taxes — income, Medicare and Social Security — while he was making that salary during the first eight months of 1995. 
White said he got income taxes back after filing his tax return. Why? His business losses later that year largely offset the income taxes he had already paid through withholding, he said, leaving him with no taxable income in 1995. 
Is that the same as White paying no taxes that year while he did his federal job, as Perry says? We think not. 
We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974ABBC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-didnt-pay-taxes-1995/

Medicare 'cuts' in the health care law will hurt seniors, says 60 Plus Association
","
Guess which member of Congress ""betrayed"" seniors by voting in favor of the 2010 health care law, a vote for ""Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare"" and ""hurt the quality of our care.""

Which member is it? Well, lots of them, according to the 60 Plus Association. The advocacy group bills itself as ""a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)"" and supports"" a free-enterprise, less -government, less-taxes approach to seniors issues."" It has created substantially similar ads to run against Democratic members of Congress in districts around the country.

In Florida, the group is targeting Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents the Panhandle area,  and Reps. Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas, both from central Florida. It is also running ads against Wisconsin members Steve Kagen, representing Green Bay and Appleton, and Ron Kind of western Wisconsin.  Another target is John Boccieri of Canton, Ohio. Still other ads target House members from Arizona, New York, Indiana and Pennsylvania.

It's true that all of these members of Congress voted in favor of the new health care law when it came up for a vote on March 21, 2010. But the ad gives a highly misleading impression about funding for Medicare.

Here's the text of the ad running against Boyd, the Florida congressman who represents the northwest Panhandle area:

""Alan Boyd has betrayed Florida's seniors. Instead of voting to protect us, he supported Nancy Pelosi's liberal agenda. Boyd voted for Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care. ... Florida's seniors can send Alan Boyd a message. He betrayed us, and this November, we'll remember.""

Because of our previous fact-checks on the health care law, we knew this ad was leaving out important details on how the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, changed Medicare. 
Medicare, a government-run health insurance program, provides health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans over age 65. It accounts for about 12 percent of the federal budget.

It's important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

Next, we wanted to address how those reductions are expected to affect the quality of care.

""Some (changes) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage,"" said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care.""

Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website, a good non-ideological explanation for people interested in changes to Medicare under health care reform.

Some of the savings are for relatively minor programs, such as $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. The law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.

More significantly, there's also $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

Let's back-up for a minute and explain Medicare Advantage: There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100.

The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use.

The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program.

""How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country,"" Neuman said. ""The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010.""

PolitiFact has waded into this argument about whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut before. Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no.

On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. (More on this in a bit.)

Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants, especially the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage, experts said. But basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same.

Finally, there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient, such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These adjustments are aimed at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies.

The Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services questioned in an April 2010 report whether these levels of savings are realistic, saying that some health care providers would become unprofitable if payments were reduced. (The 60 Plus ad cites this report in its fine print.) The actuary's report suggests that Congress will intervene to change the payment formula to avoid health care providers dropping out of Medicare.

The report also includes this caveat about how difficult it is to project the effects of the health care law: ""The legislation would result in numerous changes in the way that health care insurance is provided and paid for in the U.S., and the scope and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents exist for use in estimation. Consequently, the estimates presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine health care legislation.""

Finally, the 60 Plus ad also fails to mention new benefits for seniors under the health care law, such as a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. (A statement on the 60 Plus website calls the drug rebate ""the senior suckup."") Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close what is often called the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap, a marked improvement to the current program.

Getting back to the Truth-O-Meter, the 60 Plus ad says that the new health care law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care."" The ad loses points for accuracy because the $500 billion aren't actual cuts but reductions to future spending for a program that will still grow significantly in the next 10 years. The ad also says those cuts will ""hurt the quality"" of seniors' care. But we find that to be a highly contentious subject, and the 60 Plus ad doesn't hint at any of the ways that the reductions are ways to make Medicare more efficient. Finally, the ad doesn't mention any of the benefits to seniors, such as improved prescription drug coverage. The ad seems more intent on attacking the health care law than accurately describing this complicated piece of legislation. Because it leaves critical facts out of its description in a way that gives a misleading impression, we rate the statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097541980>],/factchecks/2010/sep/20/60-plus-association/medicare-cuts-health-care-law-will-hurt-seniors-sa/

'Costly Ausley' website takes CFO candidate to task for supposed tax votes
","
The Republican Party of Florida launched a website that it says highlights the liberal tax record of Democratic Chief Financial Officer candidate Loranne Ausley.

""Get to know tax-and-spend liberal Loranne Ausley, and her costly record,"" the site www.costlyausley.com starts.

On Sept. 16, 2010, the GOP used the website to detail six Ausley votes they say taxed the savings of Floridians.

""How Costly is Ausley?"" the RPOF asked. ""Ausley VOTED SIX TIMES to tax your savings. As a liberal state legislator Loranne Ausley has a costly record of supporting higher taxes, bigger government and more wasteful spending. Ausley even voted SIX TIMES to tax your savings. Just like her liberal friends in Washington, Ausley can't get enough of our money.

""Ausley's vote for tax on savings applies to retirement nest eggs -- money you already pay income tax on! So, Ausley is wanting to tax you twice, first on your paycheck and then again on the portion you set aside for retirement. More job-killing policies that hurt our economy and plunge us deeper in debt.""

The claims come tacked to a computerized image of a manila folder that includes six specific votes -- three in 2001, one in 2004 and two in 2006. The launch of the web attack came with a complimentary press release from the RPOF and a quote from party executive director Ronnie Whitaker.

""With a long record of raising taxes, increasing the size of government and stifling Florida's economy, there is much more to reveal about Loranne Ausley,"" Whitaker said. ""Today is just the latest disturbing example of Ausley's job-killing tax hikes for Floridians to know about.""

Let's see about those tax hikes Whitaker is talking about.

The RPOF website references three specific bills -- HB 21 in 2001, HB 791 in 2004 and HB 209 in 2006 -- and lists the corresponding votes for each bill to back up its claim. The bills match with the years Ausley, a lawyer from Tallahassee, served in the Florida House (2001-2008).

The legislation in each case deals with Florida's Annual Intangible Personal Property Tax.

The intangible tax, which was repealed by the Legislature in 2006, was a state tax paid on the value of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds and unsecured notes. Savings accounts, pension funds, certificates of deposit and 401(k)s are not subject to the tax.

The tax is paid mostly by middle- and upper-income Floridians who had those types of investments.

The tax rate was capped at 2 mills ($2 per $1,000 of value) by the state constitution, but the actual rate fluctuated over time. The tax rate increased from 1 mill to 1.5 mills in 1990 and to 2 mills in 1992.

Gov. Jeb Bush began a program to phase out the tax upon taking office in January 1999. Before Ausley took office, the tax rate was lowered from 2 mills to 1.5 mills in 1999, and from 1.5 mills to 1 mill in 2000.

2001 votes

In 2001 -- during Ausley's first year in the House -- Bush and the Republican-led House proposed lowering the tax rate to .5 mills. The cut in the rate was expected to save Floridians, or cut state revenues, $229.2 million in the first year. The House approved a more modest reduction, to .75 mills, but the Senate failed to go along.

In the end, both chambers agreed to raise the amount of holdings exempted from the tax to the first $250,000 in holdings for single filers and $500,000 for married couples (up from $20,000 and $40,000). It also raised the exemption for businesses to $250,000.

Democrats opposed both a rate reduction and an increase to the amount of holdings exempt from the tax because the cuts ""broke a commitment to needier Floridians who depend on state programs,"" the Associated Press reported. Democrats also said it was people with heavy stock portfolios -- likely middle- to upper-class Floridians -- who were the only ones getting the help.

Ausley voted against the original House plan to cut the rate to .75 mills, and she also voted against raising the exemption thresholds to $250,000 and $500,000. Those are the three votes the RPOF is counting from 2001.

She actually cast two votes against the same rate reduction -- the RPOF is counting both votes in its six-vote total.

Ausley, we should note, did vote in favor of a Democratic proposal that would have raised the exemption thresholds to $100,000 and $200,000. But the measure was defeated by the Republican majority.

To summarize: Ausley voted three times to keep the intangible tax rate and thresholds unchanged and voted once to increase the amount of holdings exempt for taxpayers. The three votes all came out of the same bill, HB 21.

(Cuts to the intangible tax had to be delayed to help make up for a $1 billion budget shortfall).

2004 vote

In 2004, Republicans proposed repealing the intangible tax entirely over three years. HB 791 would reduce the tax rate to .66 mills in 2005, .33 mills in 2006, and eliminate it entirely starting in 2007.

That would translate to lost state revenues -- or taxpayer savings -- of $87.9 million in 2005 and $188.8 million in 2006, according to the state.

The bill never came to a vote in the full House. But it did come before the House Appropriations Committee. Ausley, who was a member of the committee, voted against the measure.

Summarizing again: Ausley voted, in committee, against a bill that would have phased out the intangible tax over three years. The bill never made it to the full floor of the House.

2006 votes

The move to repeal the intangible tax resurfaced in 2006 through HB 209.

This time, the measure passed -- 100-20 in the House and 30-9 in the Senate. The tax was eliminated starting Jan. 1, 2007. The state estimated that the repeal saved people who paid the tax (or cost the state) $130.6 million in 2007.

Ausley voted against the measure both when it came before the House Fiscal Council and then again when it came to a full floor vote.

To recap: The 2006 bill repealed the intangible tax. Ausley voted twice against the bill, once in committee and once on the House floor.

Our ruling

The statement we're checking in this item is that Ausley ""voted six times to tax your savings."" Ronnie Whitaker, party executive director, called them ""job-killing tax hikes.""

First, saying ""savings"" is a bit broad. The tax didn't touch pensions, CDs, savings accounts and 401(k) plans; it applied to investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds.

Second, the votes in question weren't for tax hikes. They were against cutting the state's intangible tax.

And there weren't really six of them. The RPOF actually is talking about three bills, and really, four votes -- a vote to lower the intangible tax rate from 1 mill to .75 mill, a vote to raise the exemption amounts, and then two votes to repeal the tax entirely. In each of those cases, Ausley voted ""No.""

Maybe we're sticklers for words -- no maybe about it, we are -- but if we use the RPOF logic that Ausley ""voted six times to tax your savings,"" we could say quite convincingly that Republican U.S. Senate nominee Marco Rubio voted four times to tax your savings -- in one year. Yep, back in 2001, Rubio voted against an amendment offered by Democrats that would have increased the amount that could be exempted from the tax (but not as much as Republicans wanted). That same year he cast three other votes in favor of proposals that would have cut the intangible tax in some form or another, but not eliminate it altogether.

By the RPOF logic, because the tax remained in place, Rubio cast four votes to tax your savings.

Would we criticize Democrats or independent Charlie Crist if they tried to make that claim? Absolutely.

Are we criticizing the Republicans in this case? You betcha. We rate their claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C10AEC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/20/republican-party-florida/costly-ausley-website-takes-cfo-candidate-task-su/

Betty Sutton campaign claims Tom Ganley wants to ""cut the dickens"" out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits
","
Tom Ganley is the first serious challenger that Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton has faced since she was first elected to Congress in 2006. The wealthy auto dealer from Brecksville won the GOP nod to run against her and funneled more than $2 million of his personal fortune into his campaign.

In an effort to fill her own campaign coffers, Sutton has sent fundraising missives to supporters. A fundraising email in early September from her campaign began:

""Dishonest used car dealer Tom Ganley is at it again, and this time he’s going after seniors and veterans. Recently, Ganley said that if elected, he wants to ‘cut the dickens’ out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits.""

Does Ganley want to play Scrooge with popular entitlement programs?

AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka repeated the claim at the Lorain Labor Day Festival, where he and Sutton appeared together.

""And how about Republican candidate Tom Ganley of Akron, who wants Betty Sutton’s job?"" Trumka asked the crowd. ""He’s the guy with the Mercedes dealership who promises to – and I quote – ‘cut the Dickens’ out of Medicare, Social Security and Veterans’ benefits for average working people.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look, and contacted Ganley campaign spokesperson, Meghan Snyder, who says it ain’t so. Ganley believes programs like Social Security should be protected  and  Democrats are twisting his words from an Aug. 29 interview with the conservative news site ""Human Events,"" she says.

In that interview, Ganley said he wants to freeze all federal spending for at least a year ""and then surgically attack it. National defense should be left alone, but everything else should be on the table and studied carefully. So much of the budget is now mandated, that we have to re-open entitlements. All domestic discretionary spending should have the dickens cut out of it.""

According to the federal budgeting experts at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Medicare, Social Security and Veterans’ benefits are not considered discretionary spending under the federal budget. They are entitlement programs. Unlike discretionary programs, entitlements are not controlled by yearly appropriations from Congress. About a third of the federal budget is considered discretionary, including areas like education, health research and housing. Discretionary areas like those are where Ganley said ""the dickens"" should be cut. 
We talked to AFL-CIO spokesman Josh Goldstein, who defended Trumka’s assertion. Ganley’s words to Human Events clearly state ""he wants to cut everything but defense and then tags the dickens line to ‘discretionary,’ "" Goldstein said. He noted that the distorted version of Ganley’s quote was also picked up by the liberal ""Buckeyestateblog,"" and was cited in a Lorain Morning Journal ""Letter to the Editor.""

""I do think the quote there clearly states his intentions,"" Goldstein said in an email. ""You are right to point out the unintended mistake in directly quoting, but there’s no question that the point is completely accurate.""

Sutton campaign manager Julie Sweet sent an email that gave her rationale for claiming Ganley wants to cut ""the dickens"" out of particular entitlement programs, when he actually said ""the dickens"" should be cut from discretionary programs.
　
""Tom Ganley’s statement to Human Events couldn’t be any clearer: Entitlements – which his spokesperson says include Social Security, Medicare, and programs designed to benefit older Americans – should be re-opened and therefore not protected as mandatory spending. And if he doesn’t want them to be mandatory spending, he wants them to be discretionary, and he wants to cut the dickens out of discretionary spending.""

We think Ganley’s statement is clear, and it doesn’t say what the campaign claims it says. Sutton could justifiably question the meaning of his assertion that entitlements should be reopened. But she’s also a veteran member of Congress who knows that’s not done easily.

And the claim that Ganley wants to ""cut the dickens"" out of Medicare, Social Security and Veterans programs is a leap. Ganley never told Human Events he wants to cut ""the dickens"" out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits.

That’s why we rate this as a Pants on Fire claim.

Russ Feingold says he’s been outspent by opponents in every U.S. Senate election
","
Russ Feingold has spent 18 years in the U.S. Senate, 28 years in elective office. The Democrat has never lost an election. Yet, in his bid for a fourth Senate term, against first-time candidate Republican Ron Johnson, Feingold is positioning himself as the underdog. 
To be sure, the latest Federal Election Commission reports -- for spending from Jan. 1 through Aug. 25 -- show Johnson outspent Feingold $4.55 million to $4.28 million. Feingold says Johnson, a multi-millionaire Oshkosh businessman, may wind up running the most expensive campaign in state history. 
We won’t be able to tally that up until after the election. 
But what about this claim by Feingold: ""I've been outspent by my opponents every time I've run for U.S. Senate."" 
Feingold has made the statement, or a variation of it, many times: In TV interviews on the night of the Sept. 14 primary, in a magazine interview, in an e-mail solicitation to supporters, in a blog post on his campaign website and on ""The Ed Show"" on MSNBC. 
So, is it true? 
The claim seems pretty straightforward, one candidate versus another candidate in each of Feingold’s three previous Senate campaigns. Indeed, when we asked the campaign to support Feingold’s statement, senior adviser John Kraus pointed to spending by Feingold and his various opponents -- not spending by outside groups, which would complicate matters. 
But here is the twist: Kraus said Feingold compares his campaign spending to the spending by all of the candidates in an election -- the Republican he faced head-to-head in each November contest, as well as major party candidates eliminated in the primary. 
Call it me-against-them math. 
For instance, in Feingold’s last election, he outspent GOP nominee Tim Michels by nearly $3.7  million in the two-year period before the general election, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. 
But Feingold tosses in what was spent by unsuccessful GOP primary candidates Russ Darrow and Robert Welch. By that measure, all of the GOP candidates spent $11.6 million -- more than the $9.24 million spent by Feingold alone. 
It’s a convenient argument, especially when you are using the ""outspent every time"" line in fund-raising appeals. 
But it also confounds logic. 
Michels, Darrow and Welch all sought the Republican nomination in 2004 -- just as Feingold was part of a three-way battle when he won the seat in 1992. 
In the 1992 race, FEC records show Feingold spent $1,979,488 -- the least among the other major candidates. In the Democratic primary, Feingold defeated Jim Moody who spent $2,828,211 and Joseph Checota, who spent $4,022,344. 
Feingold then defeated Bob Kasten, the Republican incumbent, who spent $5,427,163. 
Using Feingold’s me-vs-them math, everyone could say they were outspent. So is it possible that everyone spent the least and no one spent the most? 
Of course not. 
Mike McCabe, head of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending and lobbies for public funding of campaigns, said the average voter would think of the opponent as the head-to-head matchup. 
So let’s line the general election candidates that way, with their spending in the two-year period before the election. 
  
1992: 
Kasten: $5,427,163 
Feingold: $1,979,488 
  
1998: 
Republican nominee Mark Neumann: $4,373,953 
Feingold: $3,846,089 
2004: 
Feingold: $9,239,908 
Michels: $5,542,087 
  
So Feingold was outspent twice, and in the third race spent nearly $3.7 million -- or about 67 percent -- more than his opponent. That’s not close by anyone’s math. 
(A footnote: While Johnson can tap his own wallet during the fall campaign, Feingold isn’t cash-poor. The latest FEC reports show Feingold had $4.3 million on hand, more than four times the $940,642 listed for Johnson.) 
So where does that leave us? 
In positioning himself as an underdog, and seeking campaign money from donors, Feingold says he has always been outspent by his opponents. Though that is true in two races, he uses some twisted logic -- and math -- to get there on the third, tallying up spending by Republican primary candidates he never faced to obscure that he vastly outspent the one he did. 
On Election Day, one Democrat faces one Republican. That’s the choice for voters. And that’s the approach we use. Tossing in the kitchen sink leads us to throw in a match. We rate Feingold’s statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809C110700>],/factchecks/2010/sep/20/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-hes-been-outspent-opponents-eve/

Republicans accuse Roy Barnes of campaigning against the Hope Scholarship in 1990
","
There are some things you just don’t do. Ever.

You know -- pull on Superman’s cape, spit into the wind. Oh yeah, and if you are a politician in Georgia, you can put dissing the HOPE Scholarship on that short list.

That’s exactly what state Republicans have accused former Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes of doing. Barnes is running against Republican Nathan Deal and Libertarian John Monds in November to become the state’s next governor.

But in 1990, Barnes was in a furious Democratic primary that included then-Lt. Gov Zell Miller and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for the party’s nomination for governor. Barnes lost, and Miller defeated Young in a runoff. Barnes ran for governor again in 1998 and won, but he lost his bid for a second term to Republican Sonny Perdue four years later.

""Barnes opposed the creation of the HOPE Scholarship and campaigned against Zell Miller on the issue,"" the GOP said in a Sept. 7 news release. It was among a number of charges the GOP leveled against Barnes.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether that was possible. How could someone run for statewide office in Georgia and oppose HOPE?

HOPE provides full tuition and some book and fee money to college students who maintain at least a 3.0 grade-point average. The scholarship and the state's free pre-kindergarten classes are funded through lottery proceeds. The merit-based award is used by more than 200,000 Georgians a year.

Barnes spokesman Emil Runge said Barnes has always supported the HOPE program, even though he opposed the lottery.

""Over 20 years ago in a primary election, Roy Barnes said he was against the lottery, but in that same election he introduced a merit-based college scholarship program for Georgia’s college students that paid for tuition and other fees,"" Runge said. ""As governor, Roy strengthened and protected HOPE, and expanded HOPE to students and teachers and made HOPE available for accredited home schoolers, students at technical colleges and paraprofessionals.""

So what's going on here? To get the answer, you have to travel back to another era of Georgia politics, back when Democrats ruled, as they had since the Reconstruction. Back then, in 1990, if a candidate won the Democratic primary, that person was likely to become Georgia's next governor. The Georgia Republican Party had yet to truly flex its muscle.

The Democratic primary was, in fact, THE election in most statewide races those days. And the primary was a bruising, take-no-prisoners intraparty battle. Such was the case when Miller and Barnes squared off. Democratic operative James Carville, who would later become a well-known political brawler, was Miller's campaign manager.

Newspaper articles from that era reveal just how intense and divisive the battle of the lottery had become. They detail Miller going from desk to desk on the state Senate, twisting arms to rally support for a state lottery to aid education. Then-Sen. Barnes, the articles state, was fighting just as hard against the proposal. Barnes at the time was the state Senate floor leader for Gov. Joe Frank Harris.

""On the other side, Sen. Roy Barnes (D-Mableton) ... had hired a camera crew to capture for future campaign advertising the anti-lottery speech he delivered forcefully from the well of the Senate,"" noted one 1989 article published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The article reported that on the Senate floor, ""Mr. Barnes said the lottery has not raised education spending dramatically in other states and misleads people into thinking they can get rich quick.""

""If you think it’s going to raise a bunch of money for education, you’re wrong,"" Barnes said, according to the article.

Barnes was holding firm on his anti-lottery position in June 1990, according to an AJC article about a school board convention in Savannah.

""Mr. Barnes praised the group for 'standing up against this politically popular but totally irresponsible campaign gimmick,' "" the article states.

Miller was elected governor in 1990. The lottery passed the Legislature in 1991, with the stipulation that all profits be used for education. Voters narrowly approved it in 1992. HOPE began the next year.

Georgians today take the lottery, and HOPE, for granted. But in the run-up to the 1990 governor's race the proposal was dicey political terrain to trod, said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. By the time Barnes was publicly opposing it in 1989, it had already failed nine straight times before the Legislature.

""When Zell Miller came out in favor of the lottery it was a risky move,"" Bullock said. ""You were alienating major parts of Georgia's religious community.""

Barnes, in a recent Associated Press news story, talked about his initial opposition.

""Originally, I had problems with the lottery,"" the former governor said in the interview. ""I thought that it was the state taking advantage of its own people. But it's here.""

So was Barnes opposing the HOPE Scholarship when he opposed the lottery? Bullock said there is a distinction.

""If you opposed Miller’s lottery program, you knew you were opposing some plans for education,"" Bullock said. ""It was clear Miller was talking about new funding for education, but not specifically HOPE at that time.""

But the GOP release said Barnes specifically opposed HOPE.

Barnes, ironically, used the same attack against Gov. Sonny Perdue eight years ago. An AJC article the month before the 2002 election details how Barnes had released an attack ad accusing Perdue of opposing HOPE because he had opposed the lottery in the Senate years earlier.

Barnes was toying with the truth in the 2002 TV ad. And the state GOP is using the same tactic against Barnes this year.

Barnes did oppose a state lottery. That much is clear. If Barnes had been elected in 1990, it is highly doubtful the state lottery would have passed during his tenure. And without the lottery, HOPE would not exist. The lottery eventually became the funding mechanism for the popular scholarship program.

However, Barnes never specifically opposed HOPE, and he even backed expanding the scholarship program on his watch. The GOP statement about Barnes contains some element of truth. But it also ignores critical facts that would give a reasonable person a different impression. We rate the GOP claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C100FC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/20/GaGOP/republican/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Texas', 'Steve Munisteri']","
Steve Munisteri, Republican Party of Texas chair, says Austin's League of Women Voters has no Republicans among elected officers oron debate committee
","
Urging two GOP candidates for the State Board of Education not to join a televised debate being organized by the Austin area's chapter of the League of Women Voters, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas said Aug. 31 that the group's officers and debate committee members had voted in multiple Democratic primaries. ""How can the Austin chapter of the LWV claim to be non-partisan when there are no Republicans among their elected officers or on their debate committee?"" Chairman Steve Munisteri said.

In this article, we aren't testing the GOP's contention the Austin chapter can't be considered non-partisan because of its leaders' personal voting histories. Dem are fighting words and the fight's not here.

But we wondered if Munisteri accurately tweaked an absence of Republicans among the leaguers whose chapter is affiliated with the long-established national group that trumpets a non-partisan interest in encouraging voter education and participation.

Notably, this isn't our first foray into checking personal voting histories to gauge individuals' partisan leans. In May, we found False a claim that out of 50 registered voters in the history department at the University of Texas, one is a Republican. By our count, of 48 history department faculty members registered to vote in Travis County, five had participated in Republican primaries, four of them voting in this year's GOP primary.

Also of significance: Voting in a Republican or Democratic primary doesn't always mean a person sees himself as belonging to that party — never mind the bulk of voters who abstain from primaries and whose political affiliations, if any, aren't reflected in voting records. Unlike in some other states, Texas voters don't register their party affiliation. Any registered voter can vote in any primary (though they can't switch to the other party's runoffs). 
Per the Texas GOP's claim about the Austin chapter of the League of Women Voters, the party's supporting press release provides primary voting histories for 13 league activists. From 2004 through 2010, the party says, these individuals voted 45 out of 52 times in Democratic primaries; in seven instances, the selected members did not vote in a primary. And among the 13, the party says, there was no instance of anyone voting in a Republican primary.

We asked the GOP for its research and learned that it checked Travis County records for the voting histories of 24 chapter activists. According to the GOP's summary of that research, the 24 activists (counting the 13 highlighted by Munisteri) voted 66 times in Democratic primaries from 2004 through 2010 and four times in Republican primaries. More than 20 times, the GOP says, the activists did not vote in any primary.

Munisteri agreed in an interview with us that primary participation doesn't always prove party affiliation. That said, Munisteri said, ""if somebody has never voted in the Republican primary and in the last four Democratic primaries they have voted in all four Democratic primaries, they are a Democrat.""

With help from Frances McIntyre, the chapter's president, we realized that Munisteri's statement--that no elected board members or debate committee members are Republicans--centers on 11 individuals, six identified as ""elected officers"" on the chapter's website and five McIntyre confirmed to us as its debate committee members; she said a sixth committee member was overlooked. Among the 11, the GOP summary says, six voted in all four Democratic primaries since 2004, four voted in three out of four Democratic primaries, one voted in two of the party's primaries--and none voted in a Republican primary.

We asked Munisteri if it's possible that some Republican-leaning voters participate in Travis County's Democratic primaries to have sway over who fills local elected posts, which are most often won by Democrats. Munisteri replied: ""I don’t believe that any committed Republican votes four out of the last four times in the Democratic primary.""

He added that none of the league activists singled out in the GOP's sally ""has denied they are Democrats.""

Powerful case? So it seems, especially after Abbie Tobias, a Travis County superviser of voter registration, confirmed the voting histories of 17 of 24 individuals in the GOP's review, except that two of the 17 (including a debate committee member) voted in the 2008 Democratic primary (the GOP had said both did not vote in that year's primaries). One person the party says voted in the 2010 Republican primary has no record of voting in the past four primaries, Tobias determined. She wasn't able to gauge the voting histories for the other voters because their names were too common in the database or were missing altogether.

For her part, McIntyre told us she's always been a Democrat. However, she said, ""a lot of my friends have voted in various primaries, or in the general election they vote with the Libertarians."" Regardless of personal primary histories, she said, the league is resolutely non-partisan; she passed along the chapter's nonpartisan ""policy statement,"" which says board members ""shall refrain from conspicuous partisan political activities."" She said the chapter has 285 members.

After we informed McIntyre that the GOP's original research covered 13 additional league activists, she noted that six of those 13 are elected board members--equivalent in status to elected officers except they serve one-year rather than two-year terms.

A wrinkle: The GOP's research says two of the six board members voted in this year's GOP primary and one of the pair, Lenora DuBose, also voted in the 2004 Republican primary.

We called DuBose, who oversees the league's voter guide. She confirmed her voting history and said she considers herself a Republican. Separately, our search of campaign finance filings at the Texas Ethics Commission indicated that DuBose has made donations to the campaigns of Victor Carrillo, a Republican on the Texas Railroad Commission. (The other board member the GOP found to have voted in the 2010 Republican primary declined to comment.)

Next, we asked the Republican Party why Munisteri disregarded DuBose's vote history. Spokesman Chris Elam noted via e-mail that the chapter's website separates out its ""elected officers"" whose voting histories support Munisteri's statement. Other board members are listed as ""directors."" McIntyre conceded in an e-mail that a visitor to the site could be confused about which individuals were elected to the board, but she said who gets elected to what is clear in a ""workbook"" sent to members before the chapter's board elections.

All in all, Elam said, the Austin chapter has no Republicans among its elected officers while among their directors, they have one.

How does Munisteri's statement come out?

His claim--""there are no Republicans among their elected officers or on their debate committee""--is staked to the not-always-so premise that primary voting patterns prove one's partisan lean. Still, the verifiable vote histories of the 11 people cherry-picked in the statement seem to demonstrate common Democratic inclinations.

That said, it appears that two elected board members voted in this year's Republican primary including DuBose, who told us she considers herself a Republican. Her voting history alone--which the party had in hand before Munisteri made his statement--weakens the claim that no Republicans guide the chapter.

We rate Munisteri's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2B7880>],/factchecks/2010/sep/20/steve-munisteri/steve-munisteri-republican-party-chair-says-austin/
"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation
","
In an effort to link taxes to the lack of job creation in Wisconsin, Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker is highlighting complaints that Wisconsin’s taxes are too high.

""Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation, and it is no coincidence that our jobs are disappearing,"" Walker’s campaign website says. ""Runaway government spending, paid for with high taxes, has led to the worst state unemployment rate in a generation.  In the last year, Wisconsin lost a record-setting 130,000 jobs, and employers continue to lay off workers by the thousands.

""From Harley-Davidson laying off hundreds of workers to Thomas Industries closing its doors in Sheboygan, one thing is clear: Wisconsin is not competitive. Other states are taking our jobs, and this must change.""

The question of the impact of taxes on job creation is a complicated one, and one hotly debated by candidates and economists alike. The question of where Wisconsin ranks is a bit easier to sort out.

So is Walker correct? Are we ""one of the highest taxed states in the nation""?

The Journal Sentinel spent months examining tax burden rankings earlier this year and documented how far Wisconsin had fallen from its top-5 rating in recent years.

The trend had received little attention up to that point, and in case you missed the April article,  here’s a recap. (Some of the rankings are updated based on new Census Bureau data released this summer.)

Under the latest figures, Wisconsin ranks 13th among the states for total tax burden. It was 14th the previous year -- the focus of the Journal Sentinel article. Those rankings measure total state and local taxes as a percentage of personal income. Wisconsin’s taxes are about 5 percent more than the national average.

By another measure, taxation per person, the state was 18th in the latest rankings and its average burden was 1 percent below the national average. The year before it was 20th. The per-person measure is widely used but not as commonly as the income-based rank.

The tax burden rank includes sales, property, income, fuel, alcohol and cigarette taxes, among others. The state ranks 12th on individual income tax burden, 8th on property taxes, 23rd on corporate income tax burden and 33rd on sales tax burden.

Now, let’s look at the spending side of the ledger.

Wisconsin is 25th of 50 in spending, with its governmental units consuming about 20 cents of every dollar of total personal income. That’s 1.5 percent above the national average. Wisconsin’s tax rank is higher than its spending rank because spending is also paid for by fees and federal revenues -- two sources Wisconsin relies less on than other states.

Jill Bader, the Walker campaign’s spokeswoman, said the claim of ""one of the highest in the nation"" is based on three things.

First, by the campaign’s accounting, Wisconsin’s total tax burden on income is right on the cusp of the top 10 because several states are bunched closely around the 11th spot. If you round up the tax burden percentage it’s a tie at that spot, instead of a 13th ranking, Bader said.

The campaign also cites an informal prediction made in 2009 by Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. Berry speculated that the big state tax increases enacted by Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature for 2010 and 2011 might eventually push the state back into the top 10, even as high as 6th. Because there is a two-year lag in Census Bureau tax data, those tax increases are not yet reflected in the rankings -- and won’t be until 2012.

Finally, the campaign cites a national study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, that ranks Wisconsin in the bottom 10 of states on ""business tax climate."" Wisconsin was rated 42nd.

So let’s take a look at the evidence and the Walker claim.

Overall tax rank
It may seem to be splitting hairs to distinguish between states when some are bunched up fairly tight. But that’s the way the tax rank game has always been played -- by researchers, politicians and the media -- so it’s not fair to change the rules now. We don’t remember hearing anybody rounding Wisconsin down to nearby states when we were top 5.

When Wisconsin was ranked in the top 5 tax states, few would have disputed the state was among the highest.

Now that Wisconsin has fallen to 13th in the latest rankings, on one measure, and 18th by another, we think the ""one of the highest"" claim misses the mark. When you factor in fees, which some consider taxes by another name, the state’s rank is 17th.

Predicting the future
Todd Berry’s prediction that the state will rise into the top 10 again is, he acknowledged in an interview, based on informed speculation.

Only six states enacted bigger tax increases in 2009, so that’s a point in favor of Berry’s prognostication. But predicting future ranks is an imprecise science, at best, and his crystal ball doesn’t provide solid evidence of Walker’s claim, which is based on current rankings.

Business taxes
It strikes us as legitimate for Walker to base his claim in part on narrow business tax rankings. After all, he makes the statement in the context of businesses making hiring decisions.

But he cherry-picks one study from the Tax Foundation, which criticizes states like Wisconsin that have progressive income taxation, under which high-income individuals pay at higher rates.

If you look at that study, Wisconsin ranks at or near the middle of the pack on most of the taxes examined. The corporate income tax, for example, is in the bottom half of states in the study. Census figures put it just into the top half, but well below the national average.

But the Tax Foundation penalizes Wisconsin overall because its individual income tax burden is 8th-highest. The foundation downgrades states that have a particularly high tax of one kind or another.

Other studies by business-oriented groups portray Wisconsin’s business taxes in a much different light than the Tax Foundation’s study.

Business taxes in Wisconsin are in the lower half of states based on how much those taxes consume of a state’s private sector economic production, according to a 2009 study prepared for the Council On State Taxation, a group of big corporations.

So, to sum up:

Walker claims that Wisconsin is ""one of the highest taxed states."" His campaign rounds the numbers up to put the state closer to the top 10 and it relies on a researcher’s prediction that is informed but speculative. The campaign also cherry-picks a study by a conservative group that finds business taxes are high, but it does not account for other data that show Wisconsin’s business taxes are middle or low.

Overall, we found the state ranked 13th for total tax burden in rankings released this year and 14th in last year’s. There is some room for argument over what ""one of the highest"" means.
But when you look at all state and local taxes combined, we think it’s a stretch to put Wisconsin’s current ranking up on that pedestal.

We find Walker’s claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971E3F40>],/factchecks/2010/sep/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-one-highest-taxed-stat/

Email claims Bill White let government pay rent for Katrina evacuees on welfare
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White received national praise for welcoming Hurricane Katrina evacuees to Houston as the city's mayor, after the violent storm displaced hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents in 2005. But a chain e-mail a reader forwarded us on July 25 and that we also saw posted on Internet message boards casts White's response to the disaster as a negative. ""In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina a few years ago, Dallas and San Antonio took in 5-10 thousand refugees each, but White brought in 250,000 and put them up in his 'buddies' empty apartment buildings and let the federal government pay their rents for over two years,"" the e-mail states. ""They did not return to New Orleans, most of them are on welfare."" Anonymous chain e-mails are notorious for missing facts. For instance, the e-mail we're reviewing also says ""White turned Houston into the biggest sanctuary city east of Los Angeles by refusing to let the Houston Police or ICE ask a criminal or even a suspect if they were in this country legally."" In March, we rated False a claim that as mayor, White offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants. So we wondered about White's record following the Katrina hegira. Let's start with how many evacuees that each city mentioned in the chain e-mail took in. Dallas: Frank Librio, a city spokesman, told us the Dallas-Fort Worth area took in about 20,000 refugees, while the city alone absorbed approximately 3,000. That number doesn't include those who stayed with families or in hotels on their own, said Librio, who estimated several thousand more took refuge in Dallas. San Antonio: James Mendoza, assistant emergency management coordinator for San Antonio's Office of Emergency Management, told us via a spokeswoman that an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 evacuees stayed there. Houston: The City of Houston didn't respond to our queries, but news reports from the months following the hurricane say that between 100,000 and 150,000 evacuees took shelter in Houston. A September 2006 report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security states that ""over 400,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees initially sought refuge in Texas and up to 150,000 arrived in the Houston area seeking food, shelter and medical care."" In August 2006, NPR reported that more than 111,000 evacuees from New Orleans were still in Houston, with 250,000 living in all of Texas. Upshot: The chain e-mail is about 100,000 off in its estimate of how many evacuees White welcomed to Houston, and at least 15,000 off in its San Antonio estimate. It's in the ballpark for how many evacuees stayed in the city of Dallas. Next, we looked at whether White funneled evacuees to his ""buddies'"" empty apartment buildings while the government paid the rent. According to a December 2005 Houston Chronicle article, ""White worked out an unprecedented plan in concert with FEMA officials: Any family affected by the storm could receive a voucher from the city good for 12 months of rent and utilities at decent but not extravagant apartments that participated in the program. The city paid the landlords directly, and then received reimbursement from FEMA."" Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, told us via e-mail that White ""called on local hotel owners and apartment complex owners for their assistance in housing the hundreds of thousands of evacuees."" Jeff Hall, executive vice president of the Houston Apartment Association, told us that in response to White's administration, 250 association members — apartment owners and managers — attended an emergency meeting at Houston's city hall on Sept. 6, 2005, eight days after the storm made landfall, that resulted in 201 owners and companies signing letters of intent to set aside more than 10,000 rental units for evacuees. ""In the end, more than 37,000 units were rented,"" he said. Hall said that apartment buildings were not vacant, as the chain e-mail says. Nor was the emergency housing program a windfall for apartment owners, he said. ""Many were paid rents below market value,"" he said. ""In many cases, payments for rent were delayed for months, causing financial concerns for owners."" Hall said the effort was originally funded through the city, then through FEMA, and then by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through local housing authorities. ""Though some evacuees have returned to their pre-hurricane hometowns, many continue to reside in Houston,"" Hall said. Michael Gerber, executive director of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, told us his department worked closely with the city, White, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels and the apartment association, among others, to ""identify vacant units"" for evacuees so that families wouldn't be stuck in the AstroDome. Gerber said it was ""all hands on deck."" He said he didn't witness any impropriety involving White. Donald Sampley, who served as White's assistant director of Housing and Community Development starting in 2006, said White never interfered with the local housing authorities. He ""never directed me, or to my knowledge, my boss, about who would receive money and who wouldn't receive money,"" Sampley said. As for whether White ""let"" the federal government pay rent on evacuees' apartments, FEMA spokesman Earl Armstrong told us that city mayors had no say in whether or not hurricane evacuees could receive federal aid. Donna White, a HUD spokesman, told us that 5,300 families received help paying their rent through a disaster assistance program that picked up where FEMA aid left off in November 2007. The program ended in October 2009. Nationally, 37,000 families were enrolled in the disaster housing program, and 12,000 eventually transitioned into HUD's non-emergeny housing assistance program. What about the chain e-mail's lament that Katrina evacuees never returned to New Orleans and that ""most of them are on welfare?"" According to a 2006 study by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 111,111 evacuees were still living in Houston as of May 2006 and 251,000 were still living in Texas. The study found that most families displaced to Texas didn't have firm plans to leave — 40 percent of all evacuees believed they'd still be in Texas two years later (in 2008), while 22 percent didn't know where they'd be. Some 35 percent of evacuees living in Houston thought they'd still be there in two years, and 21 percent didn't know where they'd be. Finally, we tried to weigh what the chain e-mail means by ""welfare,"" a that term hasn't had a clear-cut definition since Congress overhauled the benefits offered to low-income Americans in the 1990s. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman a HHSC, told us that the state doesn't use that term. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director at the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities (CPPP), told us the center assumes people are talking about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides cash to families in dire need. According to the HHSC's 2006 study, 5 percent of Hurricane Katrina evacuees were receiving TANF benefits. As of the end of July 2010, 111,920 Texans, including 7,929 Harris County residents, were receiving TANF benefits — $167 per month on average — according to HHSC. More than three million Texans receive food stamps and Medicaid, which some people see as a form of welfare, according to Celia Hagert, a policy analyst at CPPP. According to the HHSC's 2006 study of Katrina evacuees, 33 percent of all respondents said someone in their family received Medicaid and 11 percent said someone in their family received health care through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In Houston, those numbers were 32 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Also in Houston, 36 percent of evacuees received food stamps. Bottom line? The chain e-mail's count of evacuees who settled in Dallas is about right, but it understates the evacuees who landed in San Antonio and overstates by 100,000, or 67 percent, the evacuees who took up residence in Houston. It's true that evacuees could get assistance to pay for housing for more than two years, as the e-mail says, but the 2006 state study found that more than half of surveyed evacuees did not expect to stay in Texas — meaning, it seems to us, that an undetermined share might have planned to return to New Orleans, contrary to the chain e-mail's claim that no one has returned. We are hampered here by a lack of research. The state study also found that the share of evacuees who said they were benefiting from cash assistance, what we're assuming the chain e-mail scribe means by welfare, was only 5 percent. Significantly, we found no evidence to support the e-mail's claim that White put up evacuees in apartments owned by his pals. So some details of the e-mail are right, but its most explosive — and damaging — claims aren't backed up by facts. We rate the e-mail False. This story was updated to correct the number of Texans receiving TANF benefits to 111,920, including 7,929 Harris County residents.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D12EC0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-bill-white-let-federal-governm/
