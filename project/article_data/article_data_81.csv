Americans for Prosperity calls NH Gov. Maggie Hassan's budget proposal a tax increase
","What’s a tax increase? In examining the big claims about New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposals made by the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity, that’s the question that keeps coming up.  An ad released earlier this month by the Koch Brothers-backed AFP says Hassan’s budget proposal ""raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million."" We decided to take a closer look at the claim. In doing so, we had to consider what is and isn’t a tax increase.  Is a tax increase simply increasing the rate of a tax that someone pays? Or can it also mean changing the law to make a tax apply more broadly, so that more people pay? Can it mean giving the state greater powers to collect taxes already owed? We’ll come back to those questions in a second. We decided to examine this claim in two parts and reached out to the New Hampshire’s state director of Americans for Prosperity and the governor’s office.  The first claim is that Hassan’s new budget ""raises taxes on small businesses."" The ad cites as its source an op-ed that ran in the New Hampshire Business review in 2011 -- before Hassan was elected governor -- talking about an obscure provision of state tax law. The details are complex, but can be simply sketched. New Hampshire taxes profits but not personal income, which can lead to questions from the state Department of Revenue if a business pays out most the money it makes to its owner as tax-deductible salary. Small businesses, as noted by the New Hampshire Business Review in a later article, are sensitive to such regulations because of the record-keeping required. When Republican Bill O’Brien ran the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013, the party altered these ""reasonable compensation"" rules, putting more of a burden on the state to justify audits. The GOP didn’t call the change a tax cut outright, but it came close. ""This bill will provide real world protections against government’s excessive regulation and whimsical taxation levels on people’s personal income as small business owners,"" said state Sen. Andy Sanborn in a 2011 House Republican press release. Hassan proposed reverting to the earlier rules, as well as other code revisions, to ""restore business revenues to what they were,"" as summarized by the Concord Monitor’s Allie Morris in February. The amount of money these changes would raise depends on the proposal you’re looking at. The governor’s initial February budget said they would raise $59 million in total. Her compromise proposal in July said that would raise some $20 million. Regardless, AFP cited this change as a tax increase. Greg Moore, the state director of Americans for Prosperity -- and former chief of staff under O’Brien in the House -- puts it this way: ""The governor’s proposal would seek to reverse this legislation and flip the burden of proof back to small businesses, with the stated goal of increasing tax revenue."" That 2011 bill, he says, ""represented a reduction in taxation for small businesses in New Hampshire. Reversing this law would, therefore, represent an increase in taxation for small businesses in New Hampshire."" Needless to say, Hassan’s office disagrees vehemently with this characterization. Pamela Walsh, the governor’s chief of staff, explained her position as a matter of fairness. If you claim tax credits, she wrote, ""you have to be prepared to show that you actually earned those credits if the IRS asks."" Such rules protect taxpayers, she said, and the governor’s budget is merely asking businesses to do the same. It boils down to this, Walsh says. ""None of these proposals – nor the existing law – change what people owe in taxes (except to lower their obligation). It just allows DRA – as it can for all other taxes – to request fair documentation to protect all taxpayers."" Walsh also noted that the governor’s compromise budget proposal exempted 5,500 small business from paying the business enterprise tax. Such an exemption could, for these companies at least, be seen as a cut.  At a certain point, the spin from both sides has to be discounted here, and the facts have to be looked at. The facts are these: It may well be, as Walsh suggests, that this clamping down is merely making businesses pay what they owe already. But the changes Hassan proposes are substantive and have been debated -- and changed -- by the Legislature before. AFP’s citation in the ad was confusing and relied on viewers to have an understanding of the state budget that few outside of the government or news media possess. But the basic statement seems to stand on its own.  If you told someone on the street that the state was proposing legal changes to bring in $20 million to $59 million more from businesses in taxes, that person would likely characterize that change as a tax increase. It’s a defensible interpretation of the facts, if not one shared by the governor’s office. Increases taxes and fees? The second part of the ad we’re checking is AFP’s claim that Hassan proposed increasing taxes and fees by $100 million dollars.  The ad cites an Associated Press story from July, but the figure is nowhere to be found in Kathleen Ronayne’s reporting. It is instead taken from this quote from state Senate President Chuck Morse: ""Proposing $100 million in new taxes and revenues is not going to work for the Senate."" Here, the issue is relatively clear. In her original and compromise budgets, Hassan listed three sources of significant new revenue.  1. A 21-cent increase in the cigarette tax. Her budget proposal from February says this would raise $39.2 million, while her July revision predicts an extra $32.6 million. (Moore suggests these numbers are optimistic, given that the extra taxes could reduce tobacco consumption.) 2. A $5 increase to register vehicles, as well as a hike in title fees. This money would go to cover highway-related costs. It totals about $29.4 million. 3. The changes to tax rules and closing of loopholes mentioned in the first section of this fact check. As stated earlier, this number differs dramatically from February ($55.4 million) to July ($20 million.) The numbers from Hassan’s proposals can be added up in two different ways. One of them includes all the new revenue sources outlined in February ($39.2 million + $29.4 million + $55.4 million), and totals $124 million. The other would include her July proposals ($32.6 million + $29.4 million + $20 million, and would total about $82 million. But are those increases? For the governor’s part, Walsh says that  ""AFP’s decision to count updated revenue estimates and fair documentation changes – which don’t change what people owe in taxes – as ‘tax and fee increases’ is completely dishonest."" Moore maintains simply that changes to state law that lead to more revenue equals a tax or fee increase. While there’s no easy resolution to that standoff, it make sense to say whether the ad is defensible on its own terms. Given the revenue numbers that Hassan cited in her February budget -- regardless of any quotes or citations applied to the ad -- the $100 million number can be defended as long as both taxes and fees are included. The text onscreen in the ad says that ""Hassan proposes raising taxes by $100 million,"" which is incorrect because tax changes alone don’t equal that much. Our ruling The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity says that Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposal ""raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million."" Hassan indeed proposes changes that would result in more tax money being paid by businesses in the state. Yes, some small businesses would receive a tax break under the governor’s compromise plan, but the other changes still apply. And looking at a list of tax and fee changes the governor put together in February -- including the tweaks to the tax code -- easily adds up to $100 million. Overall, we find the statement to be accurate, but it could use additional clarification and documentation. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973C7180>],/factchecks/2015/aug/27/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-calls-nh-gov-maggie-hassans-b/

More Americans killed by guns since 1968 than in all U.S. wars, columnist Nicholas Kristof writes
","In a column published shortly after the on-air slayings of two TV journalists in southwestern Virginia, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof offered some ""data points"" about the pervasiveness of gun violence in the United States. One of them was: ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history."" That sounded familiar. Really familiar. As it turns out, the web version of Kristof’s column sourced a PolitiFact article from Jan. 18, 2013, that fact-checked commentator Mark Shields’ claim that since 1968, ""more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history."" (Shields used the year 1968 because it was the year presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated by gunman Sirhan Sirhan.) We rated the claim True. Two and a half years later, we wondered whether the statistic still held up, so we took a new look at the data. Deaths from warfare We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for up-to-date deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of ""death"" — that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat. The one change we’ve made since our initial fact-check is to revise upward the number of Civil War deaths. As several readers pointed out after we published our earlier fact-check, the CRS report cited 525,000 Union and Confederate dead, but a subsequent study revised that estimate upward to 750,000. The study’s author acknowledged a great deal of uncertainty about the proper figure, and some experts later questioned whether it’s wise to include so many deaths from disease — perhaps two-thirds of the 750,000 figure — since disease in an era of relatively primitive medicine was so widespread that it’s unclear what share of fatal disease during that period was really a result of the war. Still, we’ll err on the side of the higher estimate and use the 750,000 figure this time. Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict: War Deaths Revolutionary War 4,435 War of 1812 2,260 Mexican War 13,283 Civil War (Union and Confederate, estimate) 750,000 Spanish-American War 2,446 World War I 116,516 World War II 405,399 Korean War 36,574 Vietnam War 58,220 Persian Gulf War 383 Afghanistan War 2,363 Iraq War 4,492 Other wars (includes Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti) 362 TOTAL 1,396,733 Gunfire deaths As we did in our previous fact-check, we used a conservative estimate of data from a 1994 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to count gun-related deaths from 1968 to 1980. For 1981 through 2013, we used annual data sets from CDC. Finally, for 2014 and the first eight months of 2015, we estimated that the number of gun-related deaths were equal to the rate during the previous three full years for which we have data — 2011 to 2013. Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms:   Years Firearm-related deaths 1968 to 1980 377,000 1981 to 1998 620,525 1999 to 2013 464,033 2014 (estimated based on rate from 2011-2013) 33,183 2015 (estimated based on rate from 2011-2013) 22,122 TOTAL, 1968-2015 1,516,863 So the statistic still holds up: There have been 1,516,863 gun-related deaths since 1968, compared to 1,396,733 cumulative war deaths since the American Revolution. That’s 120,130 more gun deaths than war deaths -- about 9 percent more, or nearly four typical years worth of gun deaths. And that’s using the most generous scholarly estimate of Civil War deaths, the biggest component of American war deaths. We’ll offer some added thoughts for context. These figures refer to all gunfire-related deaths, not just homicides. In fact, homicides represent a minority of gun deaths, with suicides comprising the biggest share. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun-related deaths were from suicides, 33 percent were from homicides, and roughly 1 percent each were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. There’s a risk in using a statistic like this to decry mass homicides carried out with guns. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone. However, in our view, Kristof framed this comparison with care. He mentioned suicides not once but three times in his column, and he referred broadly to the ""unrelenting toll of gun violence,"" not specifically to the toll of gun homicides. Indeed, at one point, Kristof specifically referenced the impact that stricter gun laws can have on gun suicides, writing that in 1996, after a mass shooting in Australia, lawmakers tightened gun laws. ""The firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved,"" according to data published in the Journal of Public Health Policy, Kristof wrote. Finally, we’ll note that Kristof’s wording differed ever so slightly from the claim by Shields that we checked previously. While Shields said that ""more Americans have died from gunfire,"" Kristof wrote that ""more Americans have died from guns."" Some may argue that guns don’t kill people, people do. However, that’s a philosophical judgment and beyond our ability to fact-check. Here, we’ll stick to the numbers, and we find they’re on Kristof’s side. Our ruling Kristof wrote, ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history."" Even using a significantly higher estimate for Civil War deaths than we did the last time we fact-checked this claim, the comparison still holds up. The number of gun deaths since 1968 — including, as Kristof was careful to note, both homicides and suicides — was higher than war fatalities by roughly 120,000 deaths, or almost four years’ worth of gun deaths in the United States. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B52D80>],/factchecks/2015/aug/27/nicholas-kristof/more-americans-killed-guns-1968-all-wars-says-colu/

Trump says U.S. companies 'moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now'
","Among Donald Trump’s most talked-about immigration policies is his proposal to make Mexico pay for a border wall. Trump laid out the rationale for why Mexico would agree in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo. ""You know what, because they make a fortune with us,"" Trump explained on Aug. 19. ""Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now. We are losing our industry. We're losing our business to Mexico."" We were curious about Trump’s claim that more U.S. companies are relocating south than almost any other place in the world. (China, anyone?) His campaign didn’t get back to us, but given the context of Trump’s claims, we’ll assume he’s talking about outsourcing production overseas, rather than companies packing up their headquarters and moving abroad for good (a practice known as corporate inversion, which often takes place in the Bahamas). Experts told us there’s no official tally of the number of companies closing plants in the United States and moving production abroad. ""Outsourcing is hard to measure,"" explained Gene Grossman, a professor of international economics at Princeton University. ""Only rarely can we see a firm close a plant in one place and open a new one someplace else doing the same thing. So, we use proxies."" We’ll look at three different proxies: the amount of imports from other countries, the number of U.S. companies operating in different countries, and the amount of money U.S. companies are investing in firms abroad (known as foreign direct investment). Our southern neighbor doesn’t top the list by any of these metrics, but Trump has a point when he says Mexico is near the top. It’s No. 3 in import value, No. 7 in number of U.S. firms (out of 189 countries), and No. 15 (out of 171 countries) in foreign direct investment. If Trump really wanted to name a country as the top outsourcing destination, experts agreed that it would be China, not Mexico. It’s No. 1 in import value and No. 6 in number of U.S. companies. (Europe dominates foreign direct investment.) ""He’s mistaken. More companies are moving to China than Mexico,"" said Robert Scott, who studies trade at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ""China, in particular, has been a favorite location for many U.S. businesses, often due to the lure of the vast and growing Chinese market,"" added James Jackson, an international trade analyst for the Congressional Research Service. Much of outsourcing to China is indirect, according to Scott. He pointed to Apple Inc. as a prime example of a U.S. company letting someone else do the manufacturing (their most notable contractor is the controversial company Foxconn). Mexico, however, is certainly competitive and will remain an important outsourcing destination -- thanks to its proximity to the United States and particularly when it comes to making cars and car parts, experts said. While there’s no official tracking, there are plenty of anecdotes of automakers moving south, cited by Trump himself. Yet some experts contend that while his claim has some truth to it, these relocations and outsourcing are not signs of the U.S. ""losing"" businesses or jobs to Mexico. Rather, these developments are typical of a dynamic economy. ""Moving jobs to Mexico has not been the major reason for the decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S.,"" said Martin Baily, a senior economics fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Manufacturing jobs as a share of total jobs have been declining in the U.S. for over 50 years, same is true in all other advanced economies."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now."" There’s no direct measure of how many companies are moving plants from the United States to Mexico. When we look at outsourcing through official metrics (imports, foreign direct investment, and the number of U.S. business housed in a certain country), Mexico places near the top but not at the top. Experts said China was the top outsourcing destination. Trump used the qualifier ""almost,"" which makes his statement partially accurate, but it still needs additional context and information. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CF25C0>],/factchecks/2015/aug/27/donald-trump/trump-says-us-companies-moving-mexico-more-almost-/

Liberal group blames Bush for raising deficits, credits Obama for lowering them
","During the last four presidencies, deficits disappeared under one Democrat (Bill Clinton), went up under two Republicans (George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and traveled both up and down under one Democrat (Barack Obama). It’s actually a pretty complicated story, but the liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats boiled it down into one graphic on Facebook with five short lines. ""Bush Sr. handed Clinton a $269 billion budget deficit. Clinton handed Bush Jr. a $127.3 billion surplus. Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit. Obama has reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion. But tell me again which is the party of fiscal responsibility."" Facebook users shared this post over 145,000 times, so we thought we’d take a closer look. We asked the group’s founder and editor-in-chief Omar Rivero to explain his numbers, and he offered a small correction. Rivero said the number for the first President Bush should be a deficit of $255 billion, or $14 billion less than stated. ""A tiny error, really,"" Rivero said. ""We stand firmly by our meme and its implication that Democrats are better stewards of the debt."" We’ll set aside the bigger point and just focus on the numbers and the challenge of awarding credit or placing blame on the person in the Oval Office. In particular, we zero in on the claim that ""Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit"" and Obama ""reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion."" Rivero said he picked the first year of a new president’s first term and relied on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. We used figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which runs an interactive database for this figure for the Federal Reserve, but the two were largely the same. We color coded the four presidencies and marked the years Rivero picked in red.  Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis For the framework Rivero used, and making allowances for his correction, his numbers are fine. In fact, in terms of reducing the deficit, Obama did a little better than the meme said. We should mention the timing of budgets and administrations. The federal fiscal year begins in October. A new president takes office in January and for the most part, typically operates under the budget he inherited. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said for that reason, it’s ""reasonable"" to use the years that Rivero picked. But there’s a lot more to be said. 2009: Not your typical year The Great Recession hit hard in 2008 and grew worse in 2009. In that period, the unemployment rate doubled from about 5 percent to 10 percent. With Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress and the White House, Washington passed a stimulus package that cost nearly $190 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That included over $100 billion in new spending and a somewhat smaller amount in tax cuts, about $79 billion in fiscal year 2009. George W. Bush was not in office when those measures passed. So a more accurate number for the deficit he passed on might be closer to $1.2 trillion. But Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group concerned by rising deficits, told PunditFact that the budget numbers don’t tell you much. It’s very difficult to untangle responsibility during those years, he said. ""In FY2009 you didn’t just have the stimulus,"" Ellis said. ""Many of the fiscal decisions at the end of the Bush presidency were done in consultation with the president-elect, like the Detroit auto bailout. Even with TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) both campaigns were consulted."" Ellis is wary of what he calls snapshot comparisons because he doesn’t think they are fair to either the president stepping down or the one taking over. They ignore too much context. Ellis noted that before deficits plummeted under Obama, they remained quite high. The Occupy Democrats post brushed past that fiscal reality. ""The debt has increased more under President Obama so far than it did in the entirety of President Bush’s eight years,"" Ellis said. ""I don’t think that’s an accurate measure either, but it tells a different tale."" Sinclair, along with Ellis, emphasized a simple fact of budgeting that should be factored in: the role of Congress. ""Since Congress is really responsible for the budget, it's always a little strange to blame the president for it,"" Sinclair said. And Ellis noted that about two-thirds of all spending is mandatory, in the form of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. That said, according to the Congressional Budget Office, policy changes under George W. Bush — including tax cuts, the Iraq War, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and agricultural subsidies — greatly increased deficits. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that George W. Bush ""handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit"" and Obama reduced Bush’s ""deficit to just $492 billion."" The post picked certain years to back that up, and for those years, its numbers were accurate. But many factors complicate this simple picture. While it’s true that Bush pushed policies that drove up deficits, the federal response to the Great Recession was to some extent shared by Bush and Obama. In addition, while deficits have fallen under Obama, the claim brushes over that deficits remained above the trillion dollar mark for several years, long after Bush left office. The statement leaves out a lot of important information.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wants no general federal minimum wage law, says challenger Russ Feingold
","During a campaign speech in Milwaukee, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold called for gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15. It is now set at $7.25 an hour. And without mentioning Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson by name, the Democrat attacked Johnson. The two are poised for a rematch in 2016. ""Now, my likely opponent, the incumbent senator, opposes entirely -- get this, opposes entirely -- a federal minimum wage,"" Feingold said Aug. 18, 2015. ""At least for Americans -- apparently he has some openness about guest workers -- disrespecting the hard work and dignity of too many working Wisconsinites."" Johnson has often spoken against raising the minimum wage. But does he oppose there being any general federal minimum wage law? Hot topic -- $10, $12 or $15 Raising the federal minimum wage is a common campaign plank among Democrats. A month before Feingold’s speech, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, introduced legislation for an increase to $15 an hour. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential contender Martin O’Malley also backs $15, while front runner Hillary Clinton, like President Barack Obama, has expressed support for $12. Many Republicans -- including Johnson and one of the leading GOP candidates for president, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- oppose a raise. Walker argued in 2014 that minimum-wage jobs are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the work force, a statement we rated False. We found the best estimates were that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults. But later in the year, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a claim by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would ""destroy"" between 500,000 and 1 million jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had said that ""roughly"" 500,000 workers could lose their jobs, but that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million. What Johnson said To back Feingold’s claim, his campaign cited comments Johnson made more than a year earlier, at a July 2, 2014 WisPolitics luncheon in Milwaukee. A member of the audience asked Johnson: ""What should the federal minimum wage be? Or should there not be a minimum wage?"" Johnson replied: ""Shouldn’t be one. The only area that I would agree with minimum wage is in immigration reform, the guest worker program. I'd be 100 percent supportive of a minimum wage -- kind of industry specific, maybe regionally specific -- for guest workers, so that we're not creating incentives for employers to bring in immigrants to lower the price of labor."" He added: ""In the general economy, you get government involved in making market decisions -- first of all, they're going to get it wrong. For a minimum wage, you will actually reduce the number of jobs available. What you don't want to do -- if you're concerned about poverty, if you're concerned about providing opportunity -- you don't want to rip the bottom rung of the ladder of opportunity away from people. And that’s what you do."" (The federal government has so-called guest worker programs that allow foreign nationals to fill temporary jobs, both agricultural and non-agricultural.) Johnson did not dispute Feingold’s claim. His campaign emailed us a statement that said in part that Johnson worked for minimum wage on his first job and ""knows minimum wage laws are here to stay and we should design them to make sure they don’t hurt the very people they are designed to help."" Johnson opposes a raise to $15, the statement added, but ""does not seek to get rid of the federal minimum wage -- it's here to stay."" Our rating Feingold says Johnson ""opposes entirely a federal minimum wage,"" except perhaps for ""guest workers."" It may not be a position Johnson has stated often, but when asked in July 2014 whether there should be a federal minimum wage, Johnson said there should not be one, other than perhaps one for guest workers. And while he may not be trying to repeal the wage, Johnson didn’t dispute the accuracy of Feingold’s claim -- that he is against having a federal minimum, except perhaps for guest workers coming in from outside the United States. We rate Feingold’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13AFC0>],/factchecks/2015/aug/27/russ-feingold/us-sen-ron-johnson-wants-no-general-federal-minimu/

Mercedes-Benz on target with superlative about Atlanta stadium rights
","German luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz this week signed a multimillion-dollar deal that officials said is aimed at further cementing the company’s relationship with Atlanta, home of its new U.S. headquarters. Mercedes-Benz bought the rights to have its name on the still-under construction $1.4 billion stadium that’s to be home to the National Football League’s Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United. Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz USA, told reporters Monday that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in the company’s history. PolitiFact was intrigued. We decided to dig deeper. It’s not uncommon for teams not to disclose the financial numbers, and, at Monday’s press conference, officials were mum about the cost to Mercedes-Benz for the near-record 27 year naming rights. (The Atlanta Falcons keep all revenue from the naming rights under a stadium agreement they struck with the city of Atlanta and Georgia World Congress Center.) The Falcons said the goal was to land a deal in the upper range of NFL naming-rights agreements. The largest such deals are a reported $17 million-plus per year for both the New York Giants/Jets' MetLife Stadium and the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium and $11 million a year for the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium. We contacted Donna Boland, manager of corporate communications for Mercedes-Benz USA LLC. We asked for evidence supporting Cannon’s statement. ""Since he’s been with the company for 24 years, more or less, you can take him at his word that this is the biggest marketing initiative we’ve undertaken,"" she said. Boland went on to say: ""Unfortunately, as a matter of policy, we don’t disclose marketing/sponsorship costs – for this or for the Saints…."" PolitiFact reached out to three academics who focus on sports economy. Their estimates of the annual value of the naming rights ranged from a low of $8 million to a high of $20 million. Don Muret, who covers sports venues for Sports Business Journal, citing a source who brokers such deals, put the price of the naming rights in Atlanta at $12 million a year, essentially double what has been widely reported as the amount Mercedes-Benz paid in 2011 for the naming rights to the Superdome for 10 years. Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College, valued the naming rights deal ""in the neighborhood of $8 million to $10 million a year,""  or minimally $216 million for 27 years, given that  ""Atlanta is a lesser advertising market and the Falcons are not a team with much cachet."" Joel Maxcy, associate professor in the Department of Sports Management at Drexel University in Philadelphia, had the highest projection: $20 million a year, on par with the Dallas and Giants/Jets deals,  ""given the nature of the stadium and where it is in Atlanta."" Maxcy said it is likely a very good deal for Mercedes-Benz, given the national and regional television exposure from the professional and college football games, and even the visibility that the stadium has to commuters and travelers to Atlanta, he said. ""When you take the gross value -- say $20 million over 27 years for naming rights, that’s why it expands into the biggest deal ever,"" Maxcy said. "" But in 10 years or 12 years, when everybody’s paying double that [for naming rights] that looks really good."" Victor Matheson, professor of economics at College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., said he expects the naming rights went for about $11 million, which is what Levi’s paid for the stadium in San Francisco and is about right ""given the size of Atlanta."" The naming rights deal in Atlanta is one of, but not the longest around, Matheson said. American Airlines has rights to the basketball/hockey area in Dallas for 30 years, he said. Mercedes-Benz has had commercials in past SuperBowls, not a spare-change ticket item. Reports say its naming rights in New Orleans is costing $60 million. On the low end of the estimates we received, the Atlanta naming rights -- 27 years at $8 million -- would total $216 million. (On the high end, 27 years at $20 million, the number jumps to $540 million.) The company also has its names on arenas in Shanghai China and Stuttgart Germany. Sports Business Journal has reported that Mercedes-Benz signed the Shanghi deal in 2009 for 10 years at $6 million a year, $60 million total. We tried to find out about Mercedes-Benz marketing investments, but the closest we could come was figures on what it spends on advertising. The auto maker spends about $340 million a year in the U.S. on advertising across all media, according to the monitoring service Kantar Media. Bradley Johnson, director of data analytics for the trade publication Advertising Age, said the Mercedes-Benz stadium deal in Atlanta will likely account for just a small part of the automaker’s annual marketing budget. Parent company Daimler in 2014 had estimated U.S. ad spending of $561.9 million, primarily for its Mercedes-Benz business, Johnson said, noting that Daimler also markets trucks and buses under brands including Freightliner, Thomas Built Buses, Western Star and Fuso. ""If Mercedes says this is its largest marketing deal ever, then it presumably is Mercedes’ largest marketing deal ever,"" he said. ""But most of Mercedes’ ongoing marketing spending doesn’t relate to a single deal. Over the period of this stadium deal, Mercedes is destined to spend billions of dollars on U.S. marketing."" Our ruling Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, said at a press conference on Monday, that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz history. The cost of those naming rights wasn’t disclosed. The company didn’t provide any evidence to back up his statement when we asked. Experts we talk to said the naming rights probably are costing the luxury car dealer between $8 million and $20 million a year, which over 27 years would be on the low end $216 million. Industry analysts say Mercedes-Benz may spend close to that top dollar figure in a single year, but not on a single marketing deal. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D9240>],/factchecks/2015/aug/27/steve-cannon/mercedes-benz-target-superlative-about-atlanta-sta/

Sid Miller says voters in Mexico must have a tamper-proof photo ID with hologram, thumbprint
","Texan Sid Miller, who's lately gotten attention for an online post about dropping a nuclear bomb in the Middle East, drew our gaze with a closer-to-home meme defending the Texas voter identification law under court challenge that requires voters at the polls to present government-issued photo identification. The meme placed on Miller’s Facebook page Aug. 16, 2015, shows what looks like a voter registration card issued by Mexico under this text: ""To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram."" The meme goes on to say all citizens must enroll and show proof of birth or citizenship and must personally fetch their voting credential. Above the meme, Miller commented: ""The federal government and the courts are fighting to overturn Texas’ voter ID laws saying they are racist. Voter ID laws seem to be working well in Mexico and they worked well in Texas. Our elections should be free from fraud and abuse. The people of Texas deserve no less.""  Sid Miller posted this meme on his Facebook page Aug. 16, 2015. Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, piped up after a federal appeals panel directed a U.S. district judge to reconsider plaintiff claims that the Texas ID mandate, passed into law in 2011, was crafted by the Republican-majority Legislature with a discriminatory purpose. The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also affirmed the district judge’s finding that the law’s discriminatory effects violate a U.S. Voting Rights Act provision barring voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, skin color and ethnicity. The panel directed the judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi, to consider an ""appropriate remedy."" A previous fact check It wasn’t news to us that Mexico’s government issues voter IDs featuring each voter’s photo and personal information. In checking a 2011 claim about birth certificates in Mexico, we noted that then-state Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, brought one of the voter cards from Mexico to an interview on ""Capital Tonight,"" a weeknight news show produced by Time Warner Cable News. Berman said then: ""If you don’t have this card in Mexico, you don’t vote."" The legislator, who died in 2015, added that each card has a  photo, fingerprint and ""your life’s history."" By telephone, Todd Smith, a political consultant to Miller, told us Miller, a former Texas House member, had seen the photo ID brandished by Berman. Government spells out ID requirement We checked information posted online by Mexico's government. To vote in Mexico, according to Mexico’s National Electoral Institute, adult citizens must apply to the ""Electoral Roll"" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There’s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can’t go to the offices. For about two decades, the institute has issued free ""photo-voting cards"" — ""an essential document to exercise the right to vote,"" according to the site. They include the owner’s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number. Mexico experts concur By email, Kenneth Greene, a University of Texas associate professor of government, told us Miller was correct in that ""Mexico has an excellent voter registration system that was created to overcome decades of fraud (i.e., multiple votes, voting by dead people)."" Greene cautioned, though,  it would be a mistake to compare Mexico’s history of fraud with the 31 credible incidents of U.S. voter fraud that could have been headed off with photo ID from 2000 through 2014 — in a period more than 1 billion ballots were cast in primary and general elections. That tally was detailed in August 2014 by Justin Levitt, a Loyola University election-law expert, for The Washington Post’s Wonkblog. Also by email, Eric Olson of the Latin American program at the Washington, D.C.-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said: ""Historically there has been so much electoral fraud in Mexico (not by immigrants but by the long-ruling governing party PRI) that Mexico undertook a major electoral reform in 1996 that included the creation of an electoral ID card that has become a default national ID card."" Olson said the card hasn’t ended voter fraud, ""but it’s much more difficult."" Mindful of Miller’s mention of a hologram and thumbprint on each card, we checked the institute’s website, which says the front of each card has a hologram that changes color depending on the angle of light. The hologram is imprinted with the institute’s name, the agency says, and the agency’s initials, ""INE."" Also there: an element that enables the ID to be verified by a radio frequency, the agency says. We looked at a sample voter card on the website which showed on its back the voter’s signature and what looked to us like a thumbprint:  SOURCE: Web page, ""Modelo Actual de Credencial para Votar,"" Mexico National Electoral Institute (accessed Aug. 24, 2015) Meantime, Olson put us in touch with Carlos Heredia, an associate professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City. By email, Heredia responded with a copy of his voter ID and advised that the card ""does include a thumbprint (back side) and hologram of the voter's picture (front side)."" A six-day delay in 1988 Next, we looked briefly at how the ID cards came to be. Blame Mexico’s disputed 1988 presidential election, which was won by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the nominee of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Against two foes, Salinas drew a record-low 48.8 percent of the vote. But after the results weren’t announced until six days after the election day, a reform push flowered, culminating in the birth of the electoral institute, which was handed the duty of creating a ""fraud-proof"" voter ID card that would show each voter’s photograph, Vikram K. Chand said in his 2001 book, ""Mexico’s Political Awakening."" Chand said the government had  ""lamely ascribed"" the six-day lag ""to computer crashes, heavy voter turnout, and even ‘atmospheric conditions.’"" In 1994, Chand wrote, the institute’s director revealed the government in 1988 had suspended the vote count amid panic about early returns suggesting a non-PRI hopeful, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the National Democratic Front, was ahead. In the end, Cárdenas carried Mexico City and four states, placing second. By phone, Christopher Wilson, a Wilson Center expert on Mexico, told us that through the 1990s, the institute was strengthened to give more legitimacy to national elections. Now ""there are a lot of issues about the legitimacy of the electoral process in Mexico,"" Wilson said. But ""none are focused on the legitimacy of the physical process of voting itself, the identification of the voters, the getting of voters"" or ""the immediate counting of votes."" Our ruling Miller said: ""To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram.""

Jeb Bush: Planned Parenthood isn't involved in women's health
","Planned Parenthood is not involved in women’s health issues, said Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. At a town hall in Englewood, Colo., Aug. 25, an audience member asked Bush about his record on women’s health, as well as what he would do for women’s health, particularly for veterans, as president. ""When I was governor, we expanded those programs through community-based organizations, and that’s something I think the federal government needs to continue to do,"" Bush said. ""I, for one, don’t think Planned Parenthood ought to get a penny, though. And that’s the difference because they’re not actually doing women’s health issues. They're involved in something way different than that."" Bush, who cut off state funding for Planned Parenthood as governor, then pivoted to talk about veterans affairs. Bush’s claim that the organization is not involved in women’s health caught our attention. Setting aside the issue of abortion, Planned Parenthood offers many other medical services -- most of which seem obviously related to women’s health. We reached out to Bush’s campaign, and it directed us to a tweet that Bush posted, after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized his Aug. 25 remarks. Bush’s tweet said, ""PP (Planned Parenthood) treatment of unborn has been horrifying. Let's support quality women's health programs instead."" The National Library of Medicine defines ""women’s health"" as ""the branch of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being."" While ""women’s health"" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood’s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.) In total, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, and it provided nearly 11 million services, according to its most recent annual report. About 12 percent of patients received an abortion, (assuming one procedure per abortion patient), so the remaining 88 percent of patients received other health services. Here’s the section of the report breaking down services provided in 2013:  Our friends at the Washington Post's Fact Checker also looked at Bush's claim and gave it four pinocchios, their lowest rating. Our ruling Bush said, Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues."" It’s hard to reconcile Bush’s statement with the fact that -- setting abortion procedures aside -- Planned Parenthood offered more than 10 million services in 2013. Those services included contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests and STI testing and treatment. Bush is opposed to abortion, but it doesn’t make sense to say that Planned Parenthood isn’t addressing women’s health issues.

Hillary Clinton says no GOP candidate has talked about controlling college costs
","Hillary Clinton is contrasting her plan to overhaul federal assistance for tuition at public colleges with her potential GOP rivals by saying Republicans haven’t even considered the issue. ""Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college,"" said in an Aug. 23, 2015, tweet. ""Disappointing, but not surprising."" What is a little surprising to PolitiFact Florida is that Clinton’s tweet omits at least one candidate who has made college costs a major platform plank — the Sunshine State’s Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio said as much by tweeting back the same day, saying Clinton ""can't lecture me on student loans. I've had student loans & I have a plan to modernize higher ed."" He then linked to a statement on his website excoriating Clinton for planning to put tax dollars into an ""outdated system."" Clinton’s own idea is a 10-year, $350 billion plan called the ""New College Compact."" Clinton proposed in August to allow students to attend public colleges without taking out loans to pay tuition. Families would be required to contribute and federal spending would be expanded, but with controls on spending by colleges and universities. Clinton’s campaign has not offered many details beyond the price tag and told PolitiFact Florida they had nothing to add to her tweet. Rubio has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, when he made a major policy speech about controlling crippling college debt. He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy. His plan includes several specific ideas: Some other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt and federal spending on higher education. In June, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie laid out several ideas for reforming post-secondary education with an eye on reining in costs. Christie suggested itemized tuition bills that detailed what the money was paying for; allowing students to pay just for classes and not facilities or add-ons; and letting students obtain private financing for college with an option to pay it back with a percentage of earnings after graduation. He also floated ideas of providing tax credits for apprenticeship programs and for donating to debt reduction organizations that help students pay for schooling in exchange for community service. Carly Fiorina, the former technology executive, said in a July Q&A on Breitbart.com that student debt was out of control because ""the federal government under Democrats has nationalized the student loan business."" She suggested letting private banks compete for student loans. She also said the accreditation process should allow for more for-profit universities and online courses.   Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in April 2015 he thought college tuition should be tax deductible, although he did not offer specifics of how that plan should work. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush earlier in August sparred with Clinton on Twitter about tuition, while Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, in February wrote a Washington Times editorial suggesting needy people should get jobs if they require help paying for college. Other candidates have been even less vocal on the subject, saying simply that college costs are a problem that have been dealt with, or nothing at all. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college."" While some Republican hopefuls haven’t had much to say on the issue, it’s not accurate to say none of them have. Rubio has made higher education spending a major plank of his campaign, and other candidates like Christie and Fiorina have set forth ideas and positions.

Jeb Bush says, wrongly, Obama administration is not deporting criminals
","Jeb Bush says that the federal government needs to start deporting criminals. ""The federal government right now does not deport criminals,"" he said at a town hall in New Hampshire on Aug. 19. ""I don't believe that we should take people that are here in the shadows and deport them all -- the cost of that would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, it would rip up communities -- it's not appropriate. But criminals should be deported, and right now the Obama administration is not doing that."" Bush was essentially bashing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for his immigration plans, which include deporting millions of illegal immigrants. But is Bush correct that Obama's administration is not deporting criminals? In a word, no. Deportations under Obama The Bush campaign sent us news articles and reports including a fact-check by PolitiFact showing that tens of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants have avoided deportation. This has been a particularly hot topic since a convicted felon who had previously been deported five times murdered a woman in San Francisco this summer. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has written stories about criminals who have avoided deportation. For example, a West African drifter who spent 15 years in state prison for sexually battering a woman walked out of an Atlanta jail and ignored orders to report to federal immigration authorities seeking to deport him and instead disappeared. The newspaper reported in May 2015 that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities based in Atlanta were hunting 8,647 fugitives with criminal convictions ranging from minor drug offenses to murder in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. But while there are cases of criminals who have avoided deportation, there are still tens of thousands of people who have, in fact, been deported. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called ICE, removed 315,943 illegal immigrants in fiscal year 2014. About two-thirds were caught while attempting to cross the border, while one-third were removed from the interior.  About 85 percent of all interior removals were individuals previously convicted of a crime. That means that 86,923 convicted criminals were deported for a crime outside of breaking an immigration law. The ICE removal statistics did not provide details about the types of crimes committed, except to state that about 1 percent were suspected or confirmed gang members. We were not able to get complete data from ICE by our deadline to show what percentage of deported illegal immigrants had been convicted of felonies. However, the New York Times published an analysis in April 2014 based on government data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The newspaper found that since Obama had taken office, ""two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all. Twenty percent — or about 394,000 — of the cases involved people convicted of serious crimes, including drug-related offenses, the records show."" The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University published an analysis in 2014 that looked at deportations during the previous year. It found that 1,172 were deported for homicide, 3,325 for sexual assault, and 47,249 for traffic offenses. The deportation guidelines changed in November 2014, when Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memo saying that the new top priority would include those suspected of terrorism, gang members and convicted felons. The second priority level includes those convicted of serious misdemeanors. The guidelines are more narrow and specific than the ones it replaced from 2010-11. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that 13 percent of illegal immigrants fall into the new priorities compared with 27 percent previously. These policies have come in for criticism by those who would like to see more vigorous enforcement of immigration law. ""It’s true that a large percentage of the people deported have criminal convictions,"" said Jessica Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. ""It’s also true that the Obama administration is choosing not to deport many convicted criminals, and also choosing to release many deportable criminals, while offering them generous due process (which they often abuse) instead of using the most efficient due process that is more likely to result in deportation."" Our ruling Bush said, ""The federal government right now does not deport criminals."" Bush points to reports that many criminal illegal immigrants have been released, and there is evidence that it sometimes happens. But it is an exaggeration to say that none are deported. Last year, ICE deported about 86,000 illegal immigrants convicted of previous crimes. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972F4340>],/factchecks/2015/aug/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-obama-administration-not-deporting-c/

Scott Walker's Obamacare replacement is a 'new entitlement' for every American, says Bobby Jindal
","The day Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his proposal to replace Obamacare, one of his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination jumped all over him. No, it wasn't Donald Trump. The attack came from Bobby Jindal, who has trailed Trump, Walker and other Republicans in presidential preference polls. In a nine-paragraph statement issued Aug. 18, 2015, the Louisiana governor called Walker's proposal an entitlement program -- seven times.    A featured punch line: ""In Governor Walker’s plan, a new entitlement is created for every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare."" So, is Walker proposing what amounts to a new entitlement program -- and for every American human being? Setting the table Let's set out a couple of markers before we dig in. 1. Walker's 14-page proposal is essentially in outline form. It is a political document rather than a formal program. The Christian Science Monitor -- noting that health care expert Avik Roy estimated Walker’s proposal would cost about $1.1 trillion over 10 years -- observed that the plan ""devotes only two sentences to outlining how this might be paid for."" (Obamacare is expected to cost $1.2 trillion, according to a March 2015 estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.) 2. There is some subjectivity in the term entitlement; it doesn't have a legal definition. At the same time, what constitutes an entitlement is well-established at the federal level. Defining entitlement A federal entitlement program gives benefits to everyone who qualifies -- without regard to how much, in total, the benefits will cost the government. That is, for most government programs, spending is limited to the amount that has been appropriated by Congress. But for entitlements, there is no predetermined limit -- the government spends whatever is necessary to provide the promised benefits to every eligible person who claims them. More formally, ""A Glossary of Political Economy Terms"" by Auburn University political scientist Paul Johnson, says an entitlement program ""provides individuals with personal financial benefits to which an indefinite number of potential beneficiaries have a legal right whenever they meet eligibility conditions"" specified by the law that authorizes the program. The glossary lists Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- as well as most Veterans' Administration programs, unemployment compensation and food stamps -- as being among the most important federal entitlements. Obamacare's entitlement Tax credits are one benefit offered under Obamacare. They are an entitlement, Harvard University economist and health care expert David Cutler told us. Anyone with moderate income who isn't eligible for coverage through an employer can get the subsidies, which are used toward the cost of buying insurance from the health insurance marketplace. The amounts vary depending on an individual's or family's income, as well as where they live. Place of residence helps take into account how the cost of coverage can vary by region. Walker's plan Walker’s proposal, called ""The Day One Patient Freedom Plan,"" doesn’t use the word entitlement, of course. But Walker also would provide tax credits to people who do not have employer-based coverage, saying they would make health insurance more affordable and more portable. Those credits are what Jindal highlighted in his statement. Walker's credits differ from Obama's in that the amounts would be based only on age, not income or other factors.   The plan says that, for example, a 35-year-old woman who makes $35,000 per year and has no children now gets nothing in Obamacare subsidies ""because she’s too young and too middle class."" But under Walker’s plan, she would get a $2,100 tax credit ""that she could use to shop for insurance in the open market and put any savings into a health savings account."" Several experts, from across the political spectrum, agreed that Walker's credits are an entitlement.   Roy, in a blog post published in the conservative National Review the day after Walker's plan was released, used that word explicitly. ""The core of Walker’s approach is a new, universal entitlement that every legal U.S. resident would be eligible for, regardless of income or need,"" wrote Roy, who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative New York think tank, and the opinion editor at Forbes. Economist Henry Aaron, a health care expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C., told us that compared to Obamacare, Walker's plan would cost less and provide lesser benefits. But both sets of credits are are entitlements, he said. And Robert Kraig, executive director of the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin, said Walker’s program would be a broader entitlement than Obamacare because the tax credits would be available regardless of income to anyone up to age 65 who does not have employer-based health coverage. Still, Jindal's claim goes too far. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, agreed that Walker's tax credits are an entitlement. But he pointed out that they aren't necessarily new, since they're essentially the same, if smaller, than credits provided by the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, Jindal claims everyone would get Walker’s entitlement, when it would only apply to people who don’t get health insurance from their employer. Walker's campaign initially didn't address Jindal's claim, instead sending us articles in which conservatives praised the plan. But in a follow-up email, campaign spokeswoman Stacy Day said defining an entitlement as a financial benefit that everyone who qualifies for would get, without regard to the total cost of the government, is too broad.  

""Take a deduction approach, as some support,"" she wrote, ""Under the definition you offered, any individual who qualifies for his health insurance deduction would receive the deduction without regard to the total cost to the government -- in this case, a reduction in the government's tax revenues. Moreover, there is no set appropriation for a deduction, the total amount spent would be determined by how many people are eligible for the deduction. Under this unreasonably broad definition of entitlement, all tax preferences would be entitlements. This is just not correct."" That belies the example provided in Walker's own plan, where a person, regardless of income or other factors, would receive $2,100 in tax credits. As well as a consensus among the experts we spoke with that, like the Obamacare tax credits, Walker's credits are an entitlement. Our rating Jindal said Walker's plan to replace Obamacare ""is a new entitlement"" program for ""every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare.""   Walker’s proposal includes tax credits to help people buy coverage in the private market. The credits would be available to everyone up to age 65 -- without regard to income or other requirements -- but only if they don’t get health insurance from their employer. The credits aren't entirely new, however, as they are similar to those provided under Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809739E040>],/factchecks/2015/aug/26/bobby-jindal/scott-walkers-obamacare-replacement-new-entitlemen/

Trump: 'Many' scholars say 'anchor babies' aren't covered by Constitution
","Donald Trump says his plan to roll back birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants will pass constitutional muster because ""many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered."" ""Many of the great scholars"" -- really? That comment caught our attention. In case you need a refresher on birthright citizenship: As it stands now, any person born on U.S. soil is a citizen -- regardless of the parents’ immigration status -- because of the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment. Trump has recently advocated for pulling back citizenship for illegal immigrants’ children. Some, like Trump, refer to these children as ""anchor babies."" ""The parents have to come in legally,"" Trump said, talking to reporters in New Hampshire Aug. 19. ""Now we’re going to have to find out what’s going to happen from a court standpoint. But many people, many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered (by the 14th Amendment). We’re going to have to find out."" Considering that about 300,000 babies are born to illegal immigrants and become citizens every year, we wondered if Trump is right to say that ""many"" scholars think this isn’t necessarily a constitutional right. We won’t dig into who’s a ""great"" scholar, but we will look at how widespread this position is and if ""many"" say the 14th Amendment isn’t an impediment to Trump’s plan. Differing interpretations The 14th Amendment became part of the Constitution in 1868 following the Civil War. The amendment established birthright citizenship and equal protection under the law for all citizens, making newly freed slaves full American citizens. The relevant clause reads: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" Today, this clause is widely understood to mean that the Constitution requires that everyone born on U.S. soil -- regardless of parents’ citizenship -- is automatically an American citizen. We polled a number of experts in immigration law, and each one told us that this is the mainstream view among legal scholars, without question. The matter is not considered 100 percent settled, though. For one, the clause doesn’t directly address illegal immigration. Also, the Supreme Court has never made a specific ruling about a person born to undocumented parents. The most relevant Supreme Court ruling was in an 1898 case, United States vs. Wong Kim Ark. The court decided that a man, Wong Kim Ark, was an American citizen because he was born in America, even though his parents were Chinese immigrants. Because his parents were legal residents, the case does not directly apply to children of undocumented parents. To Trump’s point, there are some scholars who argue the 14th Amendment allows birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants but does not require it. This is a subtle but important point, because if the Constitution does not require birthright citizenship, Congress might be able to change the law without having to pass a Constitutional amendment, an arduous process. In any case, this viewpoint is held by only a handful of legal scholars, not ""many."" ""I believe that Trump’s statement is incorrect,"" said Yale Law School professor Peter Schuck, one of the leading scholars who has endorsed this position. ""I would say that our view on the constitutional issue is decidedly the minority view."" The gist of the argument rests on the fact that the 14th Amendment requires people to be born on U.S. soil and be ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" to receive citizenship at birth, as the amendment says. To understand this point a little better, consider the example of children of foreign diplomats born in the United States. These children are not citizens because their parents have allegiance to a foreign country and not the United States -- meaning they are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Some people interpret the inclusion of ""jurisdiction"" as requiring mutual consent for citizenship: The person and the United States have to agree that this person is eligible for citizenship. If the parent is here illegally, does the United States agree that the child should be eligible for citizenship? Congress could, according to this point of view, decide that the answer to this question is ""no,"" rendering the 14th Amendment inapplicable to these children, without violating the Constitution. We won’t dig into this question further -- there’s a lot of history and judicial precedent to digest on both sides of the argument. (If you want to read more, we recommend this 2010 Congressional Research Report.) The small group of scholars who endorse this idea -- that Congress can decide whether birthright citizenship extends to children of undocumented immigrants -- is not strictly partisan. Schuck is a self-described moderate, and he published the primary book on this topic in the 1980s with University of Pennsylvania professor Rogers Smith, who is liberal. Many of the scholars who have come out in support of this view in the past few weeks have conservative backgrounds, such as Edward Erler and John Eastman, both of the conservative Claremont Institute think tank. But not all conservatives share this point of view, either. Also, at least one federal judge has said publicly that interpreting the 14th Amendment in this way wouldn’t require changing the Constitution: Hon. Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit, appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Still, these legal thinkers ""are in a very small minority,"" said Evelyn Cruz, director of the Immigration Law and Policy Clinic at Arizona State University’s law school. ""Most scholars believe that the Constitution would need to be amended to achieve a reading opposite to Wong Kim Ark."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered"" by the 14th Amendment. There are respected academics who argue that the 14th Amendment allows but does not require children of illegal immigrants to receive citizenship just by virtue of having been born on American soil. However, this is a minority of immigration and constitutional law scholars, far outweighed by those who believe the 14th Amendment requires birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.

Ted Cruz is right that more journalists killed in Mexico than in any other country in 2020
","In a Feb. 16 meeting of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that had been dedicated to U.S.-Colombia relations, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, demanded details on not just the Biden administration's stance on Colombia but on Mexico too. Cruz said he was ""deeply concerned about deepening civil unrest in Mexico and the breakdown there of civil society."" Cruz read off a series of dire statistics and expressed concern for politicians and journalists being killed there. Regarding journalists, Cruz said, ""In 2020, more journalists were killed in Mexico than in any other country in the world."" Cruz isn't alone in his concern. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted similar concern on Feb. 22 for ""the high number of journalists killed in Mexico this year,"" as five Mexican journalists were killed in the first six weeks of the year. We took a look at this statistic. Is Cruz right, and why are there so many press freedom violations in Mexico? Cruz's office pointed to articles by the Guardian and The Associated Press, which reported 2020 data from the Committee to Protect Journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based independent nonprofit, tracks press freedom violations worldwide as part of its mission to defend journalists' right to inform the public. It has three decades of data on journalists and media workers killed worldwide. In 2020, 49 journalists were killed. Independent investigators for the organization work to confirm whether that journalist was targeted for their work, Natalie Southwick — the organization's Latin America and the Caribbean Program Coordinator — told PolitiFact Texas. The ""unconfirmed motive"" category in their data means the case has a potential link to journalism but the Committee is still investigating. There were 32 journalists whose deaths were confirmed to be tied to their jobs. Of the 49 journalists killed worldwide in 2020, nine journalists were in Mexico — more than any other country, according to the organization. Of the 32 journalists killed with a confirmed motive — such as death during a dangerous assignment or murder — Afghanistan and Mexico each saw five journalists killed. Four of these Mexican journalists were murdered and one was on a dangerous assignment. Southwick said there are many reasons why a journalist might be targeted. Generally, the journalists most at risk are in smaller cities and towns who may be reporting on drug cartels or local government corruption. Increasingly, reporters covering environmental issues and immigration also are under threat. ""Not necessarily journalists who work for the big outlets in Mexico City or some of the other capitals, but people in smaller cities and towns where their faces are really well known, where everyone kind of knows each other. People know their schedules. And the mayor that you're reporting on is someone who might live up the street from you,"" Southwick said as example. These smaller city journalists often have access to the fewest resources to protect themselves, Southwick said. Targeting smaller city journalists isn't specific to Mexico; there are similar patterns in Honduras and Brazil, for example. It can be difficult to confirm that their deaths were tied to their work because people are afraid to go on the record to share what they know about these deaths, Southwick said. The New York-based nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch noted in its 2022 World Report that the danger posed to journalists in Mexico is on par with war zones like Syria and Afghanistan for journalists. ""Authorities routinely fail to investigate crimes against journalists adequately, often preemptively ruling out their profession as a motive,"" Human Rights Watch reported. Cruz also said, Mexico ""alone counted for almost a third of the journalists killed"" based on the Guardian article's conclusion from the data. However, a member of the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote that the Guardian had compared all journalists killed in Mexico (whose deaths had both confirmed and unconfirmed motives) to the overall number of journalists who died by a confirmed motive. Only 16% of journalists' killings with a confirmed motive, and 18% of all journalists killed, were in Mexico in 2020.  So Cruz was right that more journalists were slain in Mexico in 2020 than in any other country. And while the statistic Cruz cited was from 2020, press freedom is an ongoing issue for Mexican journalists. ""Looking broadly at the environment for the press, by far it's the deadliest country in this hemisphere and one of the most dangerous countries in the world for the press, and that's been the case for several years running now,"" Southwick said. Cruz said in a Feb. 16 Foreign Relations committee meeting while also noting the deaths of politicians, ""In 2020, more journalists were killed in Mexico than in any other country in the world."" Data from the Committee to Protect Journalists backed this claim. We rate this as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1E33C0>],/factchecks/2022/feb/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-right-more-journalists-killed-mexico-any-/

Donald Trump’s Save America PAC falsely claims Hillary Clinton spied on Trump
","A political action committee affiliated with former president Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, of spying on him during the campaign. A minute-long video from Save America PAC opens with this message on the screen, as Clinton laughs in the background: ""THE SCANDAL BIGGER THAN WATERGATE.""  Then Trump, in a clip from a ""60 Minutes"" interview, says ""the biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign.""  The next message on the screen contains the claim we’re fact-checking: ""HILLARY CLINTON SPIED ON PRESIDENT TRUMP."" Audio that follows is from a news clip that refers to a report from Justice Department Special Counsel John Durham. An unidentified voice in the clip says: ""Clinton campaign lawyers paid a tech company to infiltrate Trump servers to fabricate a connection between Trump and Russia."" Former Trump Attorney General William Barr selected Durham to examine the Justice Department’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation is ongoing. We’ve found no evidence in Durham’s filings, or elsewhere, to support the spying claim. A recent court filing by Durham spurred a flurry of false claims that Clinton spied on Trump, either during the campaign or his presidency. The filing referenced a criminal case against lawyer Michael Sussmann, who is charged with making a false statement to the FBI in 2016.  During the 2016 campaign, Sussmann was working for a firm hired by Clinton’s campaign, and separately for technology executive Robert Joffe. Joffe worked with a team of cybersecurity researchers who had access to internet traffic data under a pending contract with the federal government to monitor for security threats and breaches.  The charge against Sussmann stems from a meeting in which he passed along concerns to the FBI from the researchers, not paid by Clinton, over what they believed was potential evidence of a secret channel of communications between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank.  A February 2022 court filing by Durham also alleges that Sussmann in 2017 shared with the CIA internet traffic data concerning networks associated with Trump. Sussmann met with the CIA early February 2017, after Trump took office, to relay another set of concerns from the researchers. Their concern was that the data showed Russian-made phones were being used from networks serving Trump Tower and the White House, among other locations. Attorneys for Sussmann and attorneys for one of the researchers have said that the data Sussmann shared with the CIA was gathered before Trump was president. Durham has not alleged that Sussmann or Clinton’s campaign spied on Trump’s campaign. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. We’ve also found no evidence the data was obtained illegally, nor did Durham’s filing suggest that it was. The filing also doesn’t say the Clinton campaign directed the effort.  The court filing and the indictment of Sussmann do not allege that Clinton paid hackers to spy on Trump before or during his presidency, or to break into his computers and then fraudulently frame him for colluding with Russia. Trump’s Save America PAC claimed in an ad: ""Hillary Clinton spied on President Trump."" Durham has not made this allegation, and we’ve found no evidence to support the claim.

Fact-checking claims that NATO, US broke agreement against alliance expanding eastward
","Two days before Russia invaded Ukraine with an assault that intelligence officials had warned was coming, conservative commentator Candace Owens insisted that the U.S. was ""at fault."" ""NATO (under direction from the United States) is violating previous agreements and expanding eastward,"" Owens said in the Feb. 22 tweet, which directed her more than 3 million followers to remarks from Russian President Vladimir Putin that she said showed ""what’s actually going on.""  Owens’ comment echoed a grievance claimed by Putin and other Russian leaders regarding the West’s negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Cold War.  The subject of the grievance is whether the U.S. and its Western allies promised the Soviet Union during negotiations over the reunification of Germany that they would not allow NATO to expand its membership east of the Cold War border. The question has fueled decades of debate and disagreement over what was said around those negotiations, what was meant by it all, and whether Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and other leaders received certain assurances regarding NATO’s expansion beyond East Germany.  But even historians who argue that the Soviets were led to believe that NATO would not expand farther to the east told PolitiFact Owens’ statement is more wrong than right. No binding, legal agreement ever codified the terms that Putin’s camp — and Owens — now say were violated.  ""Such an agreement was never made,"" NATO says in a fact page on its website, one of multiple pages that addresses the Russian allegations. ""NATO’s door has been open to new members since it was founded in 1949 — and that has never changed."" After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, a divided Germany and the four powers that had occupied it since World War II were discussing whether the country should be reunified. The treaty they signed in 1990 extended NATO into East Germany, which had been zoned to the Soviet Union. To appease the Soviets, it also granted the territory a ""special military status"" that ruled out the stationing of foreign NATO forces there.  The agreement said nothing about NATO’s ability to expand farther east, a process that began with the admission of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary as members in 1999. Subsequent agreements, like the NATO-Russia Founding Act in 1997, also made no mention of a prohibition on eastward expansion.  ""I know of no agreement signed by the United States, Germany, Britain, France or any NATO member that foreswore NATO enlargement,"" said the Brookings Institution’s Steven Pifer, who was the deputy director of the State Department’s Soviet desk at the time the 1990 deal was struck.  ""This claim (from Owens) is factually incorrect,"" added John Lough, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, who served from 1995 to 1998 as NATO’s first representative based in Moscow. ""NATO never made a commitment to Russia not to enlarge."" The source of controversy, however, is centered around statements made during the negotiations by Western leaders — particularly James Baker, the U.S. secretary of state, and German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher.  U.S. President George H. Bush signs an arms-reduction treaty as Secretary of State James Baker, left, talks with Germany's Hans Dietrich Genscher in Paris on Nov. 19, 1990. (AP) One key statement came during a Feb. 9, 1990, meeting between Baker and Gorbachev.  After explaining why the U.S. wanted the reunited Germany to stay within the framework of NATO, Baker told Gorbachev that ""if we maintain a presence in a Germany that is a part of NATO, there would be no extension of NATO's jurisdiction for forces of NATO 1 inch to the east."" ""I put the following question to (Gorbachev),"" Baker recounted in a letter to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. ""‘Would you prefer to see a united Germany outside of NATO, independent and with no U.S. forces, or would you prefer a unified Germany to be tied to NATO, with assurances that NATO’s jurisdiction would not shift 1 inch eastward from its present position?’""  U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, left, looks on while Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev gestures during their meeting at the Kremlin, on Dec. 16, 1991 in Moscow. (AP) Those comments, along with similar remarks from Baker’s European allies, like Genscher and Kohl, were part of what researchers at George Washington University’s National Security Archive called a ""cascade of assurances"" offered to the Soviets. But Baker and other officials involved in the events have denied that the conversation ever turned on expanding NATO to other countries.  The comments, they say, were made in the context of the German reunification debate. Talk of NATO’s expansion to the rest of Europe never came up, in part because the Soviet Union and its associated Warsaw Pact were still intact. And in any event, those assurances were not baked into the final U.S. position and agreement around ""special military status,"" they say. ""There was a discussion about whether the unified Germany would be a member of NATO, and that was the only discussion we ever had,"" Baker told CNN during a 2009 interview. ""There was never any discussion of anything but (East Germany)."" Other figures have said that assurances were made, including Jack Matlock, the last U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser at the time. Gates said the Soviets ""were led to believe"" NATO would not expand eastward.  Gorbachev has sent mixed messages. On one occasion, he insisted that he was promised NATO would not ""move 1 centimeter further east."" In another interview in 2014, he said the question never came up, though he added that NATO’s eventual expansion was ""a violation of the spirit of the statements and assurances made to us in 1990."" He said: ""The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a single Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either."" Scholars have landed on both sides of the debate. Some, like Lough and Harvard University’s Mark Kramer, who wrote about it in 2009, have argued that the idea of a no-NATO-enlargement promise is a ""myth."" Other interpretations say the question is more complicated. ""At one extreme, there’s a position you sometimes hear from the American side, that none of this ever came up, it’s a total myth, the Russians are psychotic,"" Johns Hopkins University’s Mary Sarotte, the author of a book examining the issue, told the New Yorker. ""On the other end, you have the very adamant Russian position: ‘We were totally betrayed, there’s no doubt about it.’ Unsurprisingly, when you get into the evidence, the truth looks to be somewhere in between."" When Russian President Boris Yeltsin protested NATO’s expansion, President Bill Clinton’s administration asked the German foreign ministry to look into the matter. The ministry reported that Yeltsin’s complaint was formally wrong, but it said it could understand ""why Yeltsin thought that NATO had committed itself not to extend beyond its 1990 limits,"" according to the Guardian.  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on Dec. 20, 1990 in Moscow. (AP) To support her argument, Owens shared via Twitter an 2016 op-ed that Joshua Shifrinson wrote for the Los Angeles Times. Shifrinson, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University, wrote that while no formal agreement restricted NATO’s expansion, Baker and other diplomats had offered the Soviets verbal assurances that NATO would not enlarge to the east. In an interview with PolitiFact, Shifrinson said that he still holds the same view, and that a new document he recently discovered in the British National Archives supports that case. The record, from 1991, quotes a German official as telling British and American policymakers, ""We had made it clear during the 2+4 negotiations that we would not extend NATO beyond the Elbe (a river in Germany). We could not therefore offer membership of NATO to Poland and the others."" But Poland joined NATO in 1999. The reason that was allowed is the same reason why Owens’ statement about NATO ""violating previous agreements"" is misleading: whether or not assurances were made, the West did not tie NATO’s hands with any formal agreement.  ""Candace Owens’ statement is more fiction than not,"" Shifrinson told PolitiFact. ""No. 1, NATO as an organization did not make this commitment. No. 2, it wasn’t an agreement."" ""There is a legitimate point to say that the U.S. offered assurances to the Soviets that NATO would do something, but that is not the same thing as saying NATO offered an agreement,"" Shifrinson continued. ""NATO is not violating, and it never offered an agreement."" None of that justifies Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he added. Marc Trachtenberg, a professor emeritus from the University of California, Los Angeles, has summarized the research on the NATO-enlargement-promise debate. His writing also argued that U.S. officials made assurances to the Soviets that they ultimately reneged on.  But in an email to PolitiFact, he also took issue with Owens’ use of the word ""agreement.""  ""What we had here were purely unilateral statements made by high U.S. and German officials,"" Trachtenberg said. ""Strictly speaking, this does not show there was an ‘agreement’ … I think the term ‘tacit understanding’ is a better way to put it."" Owens said, ""NATO (under direction from the United States) is violating previous agreements and expanding eastward."" There is an ongoing historical debate over comments that Western leaders, including Baker, made during post-Cold War negotiations, and whether what they said amounted to assurances that NATO would refrain from welcoming in countries closer to modern-day Russia.  But NATO as an organization made no such pledge, and the formal agreement signed at the end of those negotiations said nothing about the alliance not expanding eastward.

No evidence that the Build Back Better bill would be financial boon to Chinese companies
","President Joe Biden was attacked in three Facebook ads that claimed his Build Back Better bill would enrich China financially through trade.  The ads were run by Stand Up To China, a Tampa, Florida-based advocacy group.  Taken together, the ads claimed that the legislation ""would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing"" and ""would fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts."" James Andrew Lewis, a senior vice president at the centrist Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the group's claim is ""playing fast and loose with words."" He is a former diplomat who directs the center’s Strategic Technologies Program. ""When you buy an iPhone, most of the money goes to Apple but about 6 cents on the dollar goes to Chinese companies that do assembly or make parts. So does buying an iPhone help China?""  David Dollar, an expert on China’s economy at the centrist Brookings Institution, said that none of the financing in the Build Back Better Act that passed the House goes to China. It is targeted to pre-K education, child care, health care, housing and clean energy, he said. The House approved a version of the Build Back Better Act in November. No action has been taken in the Senate. The House version of the bill would spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.  Provisions include $400 billion to fund child care and preschool, $200 billion for child tax credits and $200 billion for four weeks of paid family and medical leave. Saying that the bill would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing ""is a wild exaggeration,"" said Derek Scissors, an expert on the Chinese economy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""Chinese statistical authorities put the value-added of Chinese manufacturing at $4.9 trillion last year. That is probably inflated, but $4.3 trillion is a reasonable floor,"" he said. ""Any benefits for China from Build Back Better would hardly be noticeable in comparison."" About $555 billion in Build Back Better would fight climate change. More cars in the U.S. made with Chinese-made parts is possible, but far from certain, Scissors said. ""If the U.S. wants to do green car production at the lowest possible cost, Chinese-subsidized parts would go into those cars,"" Scissors said.  ""Of course, since we don't yet know what Build Beck Better actually is,"" he said, noting no final legislation has been adopted, ""we could choose not to focus on cars or we could accept higher costs for the sake of not depending on China for parts."" Stand Up To China did not respond to a phone message we left. The Stand Up To China group claimed that the Build Back Better legislation ""would be a huge payday for Chinese manufacturing"" and ""would fill our streets with cars made with Chinese parts.""

Republican leaders have made clear they don’t think Wisconsin’s electoral votes can be rescinded
","A rift is growing among state Republicans over the handling of former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss in Wisconsin.  State Rep. Tim Ramthun, a Republican from Campbellsport who has pushed election conspiracy theories, jumped in the governor’s race in February 2022 and is angling to revoke Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes for President Joe Biden. (Nonpartisan attorneys for the Legislature say this is impossible, and courts, recounts, reviews and an audit have confirmed Biden won the state.)  In doing so, Ramthun has made enemies of GOP leaders who have rebuffed his efforts.  Ramthun’s latest defeat came Feb. 17, 2022, as an Assembly committee unanimously rejected his proposal to revoke the electoral votes. Democrats on the committee forced a vote in an effort to make Republican lawmakers take a public stand on the issue, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.  A few days later, Assembly Democratic Leader Greta Neubauer of Racine said as much on Twitter.  ""Republican leadership has not been clear about whether they support Rep. Ramthun’s illegal and undemocratic resolution,"" Neubauer tweeted Feb. 21, 2022. ""Now, every Wisconsinite can know where the Assembly’s leaders stand on the integrity of our elections.""  But both of the Assembly’s top dogs — Speaker Robin Vos of Rochester and Majority Leader Jim Steineke of Kaukauna — had already condemned Ramthun’s maneuver prior to the committee vote.  Let’s break it down.  Ramthun first put forth a proposal to pull back Wisconsin’s electoral votes in November 2021. Steineke, who chairs the Assembly’s rules committee, shot it down, saying there wouldn’t be action on the resolution because it didn’t follow the law.  When Ramthun proposed it a second time at the end of January, Steineke again said the committee wouldn’t take it up.  ""Rep. Ramthun just attempted to pass an Assembly resolution to recall WI’s presidential electors. Not only is it illegal, it’s just plain unconstitutional,"" Steineke tweeted. ""As chair of the Rules Committee, there is ZERO chance I will advance this illegal resolution. #EndofStory.""  Vos made waves when he disciplined Ramthun Jan. 20, 2022, stripping the lawmaker of his only staffer after he falsely accused Vos of signing a deal with attorneys for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to authorize ballot drop boxes.  He told reporters at the time that no one agrees with Ramthun’s claim that Wisconsin could revoke its electoral votes.  ""There are some who believe — there’s one who believes — that we somehow have the right (to withdraw electoral votes) even though every lawyer that we have worked with in Wisconsin says we cannot undo the 2020 elections,"" Vos said. ""You know, Rep. Ramthun has that belief. That’s his right. But I think that what we’re focusing on is not the past. We are looking at the past to learn from it.""  In a response to a request for backup or the claim, Neubauer’s communications director Sidney Litke acknowledged Vos has said the resolution was illegal, but argued he hadn’t answered whether he supported it.  She pointed to his oversight of former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman’s review of the 2020 election as evidence that Vos tries to ""walk the line"" between Republicans who believe election conspiracy theories and those who don’t.  But Neubauer’s claim wasn’t about Vos’s broader actions on elections, it was about Ramthun’s resolution in particular. And it would be hard to argue that he’s been unclear on his support of something he told reporters won’t work.  So the two lawmakers whom most people would consider leaders of the Assembly both said previously they did not agree with Ramthun’s resolution.  But so did other members of Assembly leadership.  The day Vos stripped Ramthun of his staffer, Assembly leaders issued a joint statement saying both Ramthun and his staffer were spreading misinformation. ""With the exception of one person, credible attorneys everywhere have come up with the same legal theory: We do not have the authority to decertify the 2020 election,"" the statement said.  Along with Steineke, six other Republican members of Assembly leadership signed on to the statement, including Speaker Pro-Tempore Tyler August of Lake Geneva, Assistant Majority Leader Kevin Peterson of Waupaca, Caucus Chairman Tyler Vorpagel of Plymouth, Caucus Vice-Chair Cindi Duchow of Delafield, Caucus Sergeant at Arms Sam Kerkman of Salem and Caucus Secretary Jesse James of Altoona. Six members of the state’s Joint Finance Committee joined them.  Neubauer’s aide also pointed to a Feb. 20, 2022 appearance from Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg on Capital City Sunday in which the senator said no one can know whether Biden’s win in Wisconsin was legitimate. But he too said what Ramthun is seeking is an impossibility.  Neubauer said Republican leadership hadn’t been clear about whether they supported Ramthun’s impossible quest to pull back Wisconsin’s electoral votes.  While Republican leaders have largely followed the GOP line on other election issues, Vos, Steineke and others have clearly said the Ramthun’s resolution is illegal and can’t work, and every member of the Assembly leadership team signed on to a statement disagreeing with the approach.  We rate this claim False.

Claim that Bill Gates is scheming to block the sun is wrong
","Bill Gates has been falsely accused of many villainous plans, from depopulating the Earth to pushing microchips as part of all medical procedures. Now, a recycled claim says Gates’ aims go even higher — literally. ""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun,"" says the headline on a Feb. 21 article on the Daily Star website. The article was shared on Facebook and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gates did not personally hatch a plan, nor is he — or anyone — scheming to block out the sun. The claim first surfaced in 2021 and has been previously debunked by multiple fact checkers. The falsehood centers on a small-scale experiment that Harvard researchers proposed — called SCoPEx, short for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment — that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at minimizing global warming. It’s called solar radiation management, or solar geoengineering. ""Geoengineering is a blanket term for technologies that try to alter Earth’s physical qualities on the largest scale possible,"" Popular Mechanics reported. ""One example is cloud seeding, where airplanes flush clouds with particulate matter in order to coalesce into rain."" Solar geoengineering involves using technology to try to reflect solar radiation back into space before it can interact with greenhouse gases. The most commonly proposed method is to use aerosols — ""the gaseous clouds formed by particles of many common materials"" — because the physical structure of their particles blocks and scatters light, according to Popular Mechanics. The claim that solar geoengineering is an effort to ""block out the sun"" is inaccurate; the technology is a riff on a naturally occurring process. Already, about 30% of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space by clouds and ice, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit group. But solar geoengineering is controversial, even according to the Harvard researchers who proposed the experiment. For one thing, the methods could have unintended consequences on global weather patterns. The proposed Harvard experiment would use a high-altitude balloon to lift instruments into the atmosphere and release aerosols. The small-scale experiment is ""to test the risks and efficacy"" of solar radiation management, the researchers said, and to gather information that cannot be obtained through computer modeling and lab work. As Popular Mechanics noted, ""(A)ll of the scientists and backers involved are only suggesting doing research—not taking large-scale action."" Gates’ only connection to the research is through his donation to Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, which is providing part of the funding for the project. Gates, who dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to co-found Microsoft, has provided funding to the university for climate research since 2007. The article shared in the Facebook post also falsely claims that the experiment will ""kick off in June."" The project originally was scheduled to have a test flight in Sweden in June 2021, but a Harvard advisory committee delayed it until at least 2022 in order to study potential impacts. An article headline says, ""Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun."" Gates did not create such a plan.

Old photo of Empire State Building unrelated to Ukraine despite claims on social media
","UPDATE (Feb. 25, 2022, 8:45 p.m. ET): Following publication of this fact-check, the Empire State Building announced it would be shining its lights in the colors of the Ukrainian flag on the evening of Feb. 25. We have updated the fact-check to reflect that. The rating about this photo claim is unchanged.  An image of the Empire State Building against a dark sky, lit in the yellow and blue colors of the Ukrainian flag, is being shared on social media to illustrate New York City’s solidarity with the Eastern European country under attack from Russia.  ""The Empire State Building tonight. Now. #NYC stands with Ukraine 🇺🇦,"" on Feb. 23 Twitter post said.  ""Empire State Building and USA in solidarity with Ukraine,"" another from Feb. 24 said.  But this image isn’t from February, or even 2022.  The Empire State Building’s verified Twitter account shared the image on the evening of March 21, 2015.  ""In honor of World Down Syndrome Day … our tower will beam yellow & blue lights over #NYC this evening,"" the tweet said.  On Feb. 23, according to a website that tracks the tower’s lights, they were navy blue, white and orange in what’s described as a ""private lighting."" On Feb. 24, the lights were their typical ""signature white,"" according to the site.  And on the evening of Feb. 25, the tower — which had been scheduled to show black, red and green lights in honor of Black History Month — announced on Twitter it would ""shine its tower lights in the colors of the Ukrainian flag"" that night instead.  The tower has nodded to Ukraine before.  In August 2012, the south side of the Empire State Building lit up yellow and blue for Ukraine, which was competing in the Olympics in London. The other sides of the building were lit up for other countries also competing.  A website dedicated to news about Ukraine also posted in August 2005 that ""for the second year in a row,"" the tower displayed ""blue and gold"" to commemorate the country’s Independence Day on Aug. 24.  We reached out to the Empire State Building to confirm but did not immediately hear back.  We rate claims that this image being shared on social media shows the tower lit up for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion there False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F1100>],/factchecks/2022/feb/25/tweets/old-photo-empire-state-building-unrelated-ukraine-/

Photos of Ukrainians praying “in this phase of war danger” are actually from years ago
","As Russia prepared to invade Ukraine earlier this week and Americans tried to find ways to show support for Ukrainians on social media, two photos of people kneeling in prayer in a square went viral on Facebook.

It said that the prayer was happening ""in this phase of war danger."" ""Ukrainian Christians gather to pray outside,"" read the caption on a separate post from Feb. 20. In this one, people could be seen kneeling in a paved area. The caption said that the Ukrainians pictured had declared ""today"" a day of prayer and fasting for their country.

There are no US-run biolabs in Ukraine, contrary to social media posts
","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought false claims on social media that Russian President Vladimir Putin is targeting U.S.-run biological weapons labs in his neighboring country. False claims from Russia alleging bioweapon use by the U.S. aren’t new, and allegations of a network of such labs along Russia’s border were shared in state-run media in the weeks before the invasion. A Twitter user by the handle @WarClandestine spread a story on Feb. 24 that Russia was targeting the sites of U.S.-run biolabs when it began invading Ukraine. That account was quickly suspended by Twitter, but others shared the post and began using the hashtag #USbiolabs to spread the false claim. There are no U.S. military-run labs in Ukraine, said Andy Weber, a member of the Arms Control Association Board of Directors and a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs. ""Rather, the U.S. Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has provided technical support to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health since 2005 to improve public health laboratories, whose mission is analogous to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" Weber told PolitiFact.  ""These laboratories have recently played an important role in stopping the spread of COVID-19,"" he added.  The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program began after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 to reduce the threat of existing weapons of mass destruction. It is also known as the Nunn-Lugar Program (named after the senators who passed the Soviet Threat Reduction Act) and is housed within the Defense Department’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation. False allegations about biolabs, though, are so prevalent that the Defense Threat Reduction Agency released a video on Jan. 11 to counter them and explain what the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program does. In it, Chris Park, a State Department official, spoke at the United Nations to respond to allegations from China and Russia about ""suspicious activity"" at laboratories in the region. He called the claims ""pure disinformation."" Park said the program ""works to build capacity around the world to detect, prevent and mitigate infectious disease."" The Biological Threat Reduction Program, according to the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, ""works with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (intentional, accidental or natural) of the world's most dangerous infectious diseases."" According to the Atlantic Council, a think tank, Russian propagandists have long spread propaganda in Ukraine, including claims that these labs are experimenting on unsuspecting citizens.  Snopes fact-checkers reported that this most recent claim is false. Similar claims were made against Georgia’s Lugar Center for Public Health Research in 2018, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Last year, Russia and China began spreading the false claim that the U.S. has biolabs along each of their borders, insinuating that America is responsible for unleashing COVID-19, the Daily Beast reported. ""There has been a Soviet-style disinformation campaign promoting such lies for over a decade,"" Weber said. ""It harkens back to the Soviet KGB ‘Operation Infection’ disinformation campaign to spread the total fabrication that HIV/AIDS originated in a U.S. military lab.""  A social media user tweeted that Russia was targeting U.S.-run biolabs in its invasion of Ukraine. That account was soon suspended by Twitter. There are no U.S.-run biolabs in Ukraine. The country is one of many former Soviet Union republics, and other countries, partnering with the Defense Department as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. It’s the latest claim in a series of disinformation efforts by the Russians, an expert told PolitiFact. While the U.S. may provide funding to upgrade or build labs in other countries, the labs are run by the partnering nations and the program’s goal is to prevent biological threats, not create them. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096950B00>],/factchecks/2022/feb/25/tweets/there-are-no-us-run-biolabs-ukraine-contrary-socia/

Vladimir Putin repeats false claim of genocide in Ukraine
","Russia has given several reasons for launching a war against Ukraine. In a televised address announcing the military assault, President Vladimir Putin said the spread of NATO was a life or death matter. He blamed NATO for fostering governments along Russia’s border — in a region he called Russia’s ""historical land"" — that don’t like Russia. But Putin also called Russia’s air and ground attacks across Ukraine a rescue mission ""to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime."" ""To this end,"" he said Feb. 24, ""we will seek to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine."" Putin has long said genocide was happening in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. When gas supplies were interrupted in 2015, Putin said it ""smells of genocide."" In 2019, he predicted a mass slaughter of ethnic Russians there on the scale of Srebrenica, a massacre in the former Yugoslavia’s civil war, when Serbs slaughtered over 7,000 Muslim men and boys. In 2021, he said the conflict in Donbas ""looks like genocide."" There is no evidence for claims of genocide. But invoking it gives Putin a pretext for the invasion.  If genocide were taking place, civilian deaths in Eastern Ukraine would be going up. According to the UN Commission on Human Rights, they have plummeted. The count of victims went from 2,084 in 2014 to 18 in 2021. This isn’t a perfect measure. It includes all civilian deaths on both sides of the dividing line in the conflict zone. But deaths in the most recent period are more than 100 times less that at the start of the fighting in Eastern Ukraine. It would be hard to hide a widespread program of violent ethnic repression. There are many observers on the ground. In addition to journalists and ordinary citizens with social media accounts, the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe conducts special monitoring in Eastern Ukraine. The group represents 57 nations, including Russia. It produces daily reports of casualties, many of them due to landmines placed by both government and separatist forces. None of its reports show anything resembling genocide. There are more injuries and deaths due to mines in non-government controlled areas, but that could be due to mines placed by separatist forces. In a Facebook post, Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov defended the use of the term genocide, citing Ukrainian forces shelling residential neighborhoods and ""mass burials of almost 300 civilians near Luhansk, who died just because they thought Russian was their native language."" Ukrainian shells have killed civilians, but so have munitions fired by Russian separatists. As noted above, the death toll has declined greatly, and in many cases, it is difficult to know who fired a specific artillery round.  Antonov’s reference to mass burials in Luhansk is particularly misleading. That city was the center of some of the most intense fighting in 2014, the first year of the war, before any sort of ceasefire was negotiated. Both Ukrainian and Russian speaking people died.  A man walks outside a house damaged by shelling in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, as fighting flared between separatists and government troops (AP/2014 file photo) By the time a tenuous truce took hold, over 500 people had been killed. The coffins accumulated so quickly that they were placed in a long trench. They were deaths of war, not the victims of an organized massacre, as Antonov’s words might suggest. By no stretch of the imagination does anything in Ukrainian law or practice meet the international definition of genocide. The convention on genocide forbids five acts:  Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Ukraine’s language and education laws have drawn criticism because they favor Ukrainian, but they fall well short of crossing the line into genocide.  Russian speakers can attend Russian language schools through the fourth grade. After that, courses must be taught in Ukrainian, except if they are about Russian literature or culture, in which case, they can be taught in Russian. The rules governing language are not as favorable to Russian speakers. Ukrainian is the sole official language. Recently, the government began to enforce a rule that all books must include a Ukrainian language version. There’s no ban on publishing in Russian, but a companion Ukrainian version is also required, placing an additional cost on publishers. Putin isn’t the first leader in the region to invoke genocide. It is a term that politicians have deployed loosely for rhetorical effect. Putin’s use now gives him — at least in theory — a two-for-one benefit. The rhetoric doesn’t just tie Ukraine to an act of extreme evil, it ties it to Nazism. And that, as Thomas de Waal at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace wrote in 2014, carries a special meaning in Russia. ""Antifascism has increasingly become a central idea in Putin’s Russia, reinforcing a growing tendency to identify the modern country with the Soviet Union,"" de Waal wrote. ""The Red Army’s victory over Nazism is increasingly reframed as a victory of the Russian nation rather than of the multiethnic Soviet people.""  Through the lens of genocide, Putin can tap into Russian patriotism, and argue that this attack is just and noble. Regardless of what the facts on the ground might be. Putin said ethnic Russians in Ukraine face genocide. His ambassador provided misleading evidence, and international observers found no activities to support the claim. Civilian deaths have plummeted to less than 1% of what they were in 2014. We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809696EE80>],/factchecks/2022/feb/25/vladimir-putin/putin-repeats-long-running-claim-genocide-ukraine/

Senate Republicans mostly right on amount of ARPA, CARES money Evers has gotten out the door
","Billions of dollars in federal funding has been flowing into Wisconsin since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The first round of funding arrived in April 2020 courtesy of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (better known as CARES), which dealt nearly $2 billion to the state, to be spent largely at the discretion of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.  The state received another batch in May 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act: About $1.5 billion, with a second payment set to arrive sometime this spring.  So far, Evers has directed the money to pandemic-related initiatives such as testing and contact tracing, as well as to broader issues such as infrastructure, tourism recovery and support of small businesses, according to an end-of-year report on the ARPA funds from the state Department of Administration.  All of this has given Evers a rare opportunity to dole out money without the approval of the Republican-controlled state Legislature — and those lawmakers aren’t happy about it. They’ve pushed unsuccessfully to gain control over how the state should spend the relief money.  Now, they’re turning their attention to how fast the governor is getting those dollars out the door. On Feb. 2, 2022, the Senate Republicans made this statement on Twitter: ""The truth is, Gov. Evers has not ‘acted quickly.’ He has only gotten one-third of the money meant for COVID relief out the door. He is sitting on $930 million in ARPA funds left unspent. In fact, he still has CARES Act money from two years ago. What is he waiting for?""  The statement was in response to a tweet from a Democratic state senator, who had praised Evers for acting quickly with the money.  There are many things embedded in the Senate Republicans’ tweet, but we’re looking here at how much ARPA and CARES Act money has been distributed and how much is still sitting in the state’s coffers.  Let’s dig in.  When asked to back up the claims, Adam Gibbs, communications director for Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, sent a Jan. 9, 2022 document from the Legislative Audit Bureau showing that of the nearly $1.5 billion the state had received so far as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, the state had spent about $541 million of it.  That would be about a third of that chunk of money — and leave about $930 million left over.  The same document showed Wisconsin has spent about $1.9 billion of the nearly $2 billion in funds from the CARES Act, leaving about $85 million still in Evers’ hands.  On its face, that would make the claim accurate.  But there’s also a wrinkle.  Evers’ team noted that in addition to the money that’s already been spent, there is money that hasn’t been spent but has been earmarked for a specific purpose — in budgetary parlance, this is described as ""obligated.""  ""Any small business owner knows that any accrued expenses should be considered ‘spent,’"" Evers communications director Britt Cudaback wrote in an email.  Many pandemic relief programs don’t provide funding at the time the award is given, Cudaback said. For example, funds from the state’s Workforce Innovation grant program are given to grantees periodically as they show progress toward their goals.  When looking at how much funding from ARPA was expended or obligated, Cudaback said that’s nearly $750 million through Dec. 31, 2021, which doesn’t include programs that have been announced since the start of this year — such as grants for investment in tourism and employee development in the meat-processing industry, among others.  Deadlines for allocating and spending the ARPA money also won’t approach for years, Cudaback added. Wisconsin must allocate the money by the end of 2024 and spend it by the end of 2026.  ""We’d contend that having nearly $750 million of funds expended or obligated in less than a year’s time with funds that effectively have a five-year runway meets the definition of acting quickly,"" she wrote.  Similarly, Cudaback said, all $2 billion in CARES Act funding has been allocated, with just about 1% left to be spent. Still, while that provides context on why more money hasn’t headed out the door, it doesn’t dispute what Senate Republicans claimed. Evers does still have ARPA and CARES Act funding to dole out, even if some of it is earmarked.  Senate Republicans claimed that Evers had only gotten a third of COVID relief money out the door, still sitting on about $930 million in ARPA funds, as well as some CARES Act funding.  According to the Legislative Audit Bureau, those numbers are right — but they don’t take into account the fact that some of those funds are already set aside, or ""obligated,"" to specific purposes.  Our definition of Mostly True is that the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.  That fits here. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096950C40>],/factchecks/2022/feb/25/wisconsin-senate-republicans/senate-republicans-mostly-right-amount-arpa-cares-/

Fentanyl seizures are not evidence of an ‘open border’
","The Republican National Committee blamed what it called President Joe Biden’s ""open border"" for a rise in illicit drugs being smuggled into the United States through the southern border. ""Illicit drugs are flowing into the country at an alarming rate because of Biden’s open border,"" reads a Feb. 20 tweet from the RNC. ""839 pounds of deadly fentanyl was seized at the southern border in January alone."" When we reached out to the RNC, a spokesperson cited drug seizure data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which does show that 839 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southwest border in January. That’s up from 461 pounds in December 2021.  But one month’s data doesn’t tell the whole story. Statistics from that same dataset reveal a more complete picture and experts we spoke with said smugglers will search until they find a way to get their drugs across the border. It’s false that there is ""an open border,"" between the U.S. and Mexico. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that can be deadly even in tiny amounts. It has been marketed for end-stage cancer but the U.S. Justice Department notes on its website that ""illicit fentanyl now appears in powder form, and is often visually indistinguishable by law enforcement"" from that which is commercially marketed.  The drug is ""primarily responsible for fueling the ongoing opioid crisis,"" the Drug Enforcement Agency said in its 2020 Drug Threat Assessment. The agency sent out a public safety alert in September 2021 linking U.S. fentanyl-related overdose deaths and criminal drug networks in Mexico. The drug has taken a toll on Americans, but it’s a problem that predates Biden’s presidency. Texas Sen. John Cornyn correctly pointed out recently that there were 100,000 fatal overdoses from drugs, including fentanyl, over a one-year period. He, too, blamed Biden for ""letting drugs like fentanyl pour into our communities."" PolitiFact Texas found, however, the statistics that Cornyn cited covered the period from April 2020, during the Trump administration, to April 2021, a little more than three months after Biden took office. More recent data from the CDC shows 104,288 Americans died from drug overdoses from September 2020 to September 2021. Of the 839 pounds seized at the southwest border in January, 773 were seized by agents at the Office of Field Operations, which handles legal ports of entry into the U.S. The remaining 66 pounds were seized by the Border Patrol, which handles all areas in between those ports. The amount of fentanyl seized in December 2020, during Trump’s final full month in office, was higher than during January 2022. And it appears to be part of an overall trend of higher monthly seizures that started in June 2020. The DEA said in its 2020 threat assessment that annual fentanyl seizures at the southwest border have been steadily increasing since at least fiscal year 2016. Drugs of all kinds being seized at the southwest border are not a new phenomenon.  ""Drugs have poured over the border since the 1980s, including intensely during the Trump administration. The wall did not make any difference,"" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow in the Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution. Some Twitter users replied to the RNC tweet to make the case that the fact that the drugs were seized disproves the statement that drugs are flowing in through the border. But experts we spoke with said seizures are a ""problematic"" way to judge success at border protection. ""Traffickers are constantly modulating tactics, so it's impossible to say how much is getting through via tunnels, boats, subs, ultralights, catapults, air cannons, or simply passing packages through the wall itself,"" said Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and director of its Drug Policy Project. Tree told PolitiFact that seizures at legal ports of entry, where most drugs are captured, have been skewed during the pandemic with fewer vehicles coming through, giving border agents more time to search them. ""Because fentanyl is so compact and easy to smuggle, we simply can't tell from seizures at (ports of entry) how that affects the national situation,"" Tree added. ""Suffice it to say, (overdose) rates are still extremely high, and fentanyl is contaminating many different drugs.""  Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug Policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, agrees. ""I think most people would agree there are more drugs not seized than seized,"" she said. ""And if you look at seizures in the context of the overdose epidemic, then they have been a pretty ineffective intervention, as seizures and overdoses have risen together."" Are increased drug seizures at the border evidence of an ""open border,"" as many Republicans allege? No. ""The term ‘open border’ seems created to deceive and mislead,"" said Neill Harris. ""Whatever its official or original meaning was, I think when the public hears it they imagine that people are being allowed to cross into the country the way they can cross state lines. That is just not true.""  There has been a significant increase in Border Patrol encounters with immigrants since Biden took office, for a variety of reasons. In fiscal year 2021, which began in October 2020 and ended in September, there were a record 1.7 million encounters at the southwest border, numbers not seen in more than 20 years.  More than a million of those immigrants were expelled under a public health order, which President Donald Trump began using in March 2020 due to COVID-19. The Biden administration has continued that policy, defending it in federal court this January. Biden has, however, exempted children who arrive alone, as well as some families. Still, because border agents are dealing with families and unaccompanied minors at the border, many immigrants are able to sneak across the border undetected, the Washington Post reported in April. A tweet by the RNC claimed that drugs are flowing into the U.S. at an alarming rate because of Biden’s ""open border."" It cited stats that show 839 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern border in January. While that figure is accurate, the tweet leaves out the context that seizures of fentanyl at the southwest border spiked when Trump was president. The DEA said such seizures have risen steadily since 2016. The notion of an ""open border"" under Biden is inaccurate. While there has been a record surge of migrants at the border since Biden took office, the majority of those encountered by border agents are expelled, including by the continued use of a public health order put into place by Trump.

In primary for Texas governor, a misleading claim about Greg Abbott and investing tax money in China
","GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has called China a hostile nation. He’s accused it of ""causing the disaster"" of the COVID-19 pandemic. Is Abbott also investing state tax money in Chinese companies? That’s the claim from Don Huffines, one of the Republican gubernatorial candidates challenging Abbott in the state’s March 1 primary. ""Under Greg Abbott’s leadership, Texas is putting taxpayer dollars into Chinese companies,"" Huffines declared in an ad on Facebook and Instagram. Abbott is not directly investing tax money in Chinese companies.  Huffines’ claim alludes to investments in Chinese companies made by the state’s public pension systems. Those systems are funded in part with tax dollars, but their investments are not directly managed by the governor or his appointees. Huffines is a Dallas businessman and former Texas state lawmaker. Abbott is seeking his third four-year term as governor.  The Democratic primary, whose candidates include former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, is also contested. Overall, the race has been sized up by campaign watchers as likely or solid Republican. Huffines’ ad links to a February 2022 story from the San Antonio Express-News. The story reported that $9.12 billion is invested in companies in China through Texas’ seven public pension funds. The story indicated that the responsibility for investment choices is not primarily Abbott’s.  It said that generally, ""there’s a dividing line between decisions made by politicians and those made by the pension money managers,"" though the Texas Legislature has ordered pension funds to divest from companies that boycott Israel, from Sudanese and Iranian companies, and from those of other nations believed to sponsor terrorism. ""The Texas governor has absolutely no direct impact on the specific investment choices of any of the pension funds,"" said John Diamond, director of the Center for Public Finance at Rice’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. The role is limited to oversight. With the advice and consent of the state Senate, the governor appoints the members of the Texas State Pension Review Board, which oversees all Texas public retirement systems. The governor also appoints nearly all board members of the pension systems. There are, in turn, a number of layers between the governor and the people who make the investment decisions for the seven systems. For example, the Texas County & District Retirement System has a board appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the state Senate, that sets investment policy. But an executive director and staff run the day-to-day operations; and the system hires private consultants who in turn advise on selecting professional managers, such as JP Morgan, to manage various investment portfolios within the system.  The investment funds come from contributions made by government employees and the employers, such as individual county governments. For example, the Teacher Retirement System is funded by 8% employee contributions and 8.87% employer contributions, which are from taxpayer funds.  In March 2021, the Pensions & Investments trade publication reported that the Texas County & District Retirement System committed $40 million to a Beijing-based manager to be split between two China-focused private equity/venture capital funds. The two funds focus on early-stage and growth-stage Chinese technology companies. ""It seems extremely unlikely that Governor Abbott is personally directing any of the investment choices of the various Texas state and local pension funds. Extremely unlikely,"" said economics professor Dennis Jansen, director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University. Anyone investing in a passive world index fund, such as Vanguard’s Total International Stock fund, is investing partly in China, or in many international funds, Jansen added.  ""It is not as if China is a small part of the global economy. Having appropriate diversification across industries and countries is well-established investment advice,"" he said. The Huffines and Abbott campaigns did not respond to our requests for comment. Huffines said in an ad: ""Under Greg Abbott’s leadership, Texas is putting taxpayer dollars into Chinese companies."" Texas public pension funds, which include taxpayer money, have invested in Chinese companies. But Huffines' use of the word ""leadership"" suggests Abbott is directly leading the investment decisions. He is not doing that, Abbott’s role is limited. The governor appoints the boards that oversee the public pension systems, and the day-to-day investment decisions are made by the systems, not Abbott.  Huffines’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809676ED40>],/factchecks/2022/feb/24/don-huffines/primary-texas-governor-misleading-claim-about-greg/
