Gov. Scott Walker says average property tax payer will save $700 under 2011-’13 state budget
","
Trying to put the divisive fight over collective bargaining behind him, Gov. Scott Walker is framing his budget battle as a victory for Wisconsin’s property tax payers.

In a July 7, 2011 news release and column, Walker said a 60-year-old custodian told him a $500 property tax increase he experienced in 2010 will mess up his coming retirement.

Walker said the man, who was not identified, told him, ""I will have to find a part-time job just to live normally.""

The governor continued: ""Under our budget, the average property taxpayer will save $700. It is my hope that savings like this will help keep more people like that custodian safely in their homes.""

That claim of $700 savings caught our eye.

Walker’s budget featured tight property tax caps -- caps that fulfilled a campaign promise, and would rein in growth. But there was no talk of a big reduction in property taxes.

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said Walker did not mean to suggest people would see a real-dollar tax cut of $700 over their previous bill.

Rather, Werwie said, Walker means they would pay $700 less over the two-year (2011-’13) budget compared with what they would have without Walker’s moves.

At best, that’s highly confusing.

Especially since Walker juxtaposes the ""$700 savings"" claim with the story of one person’s bill going up $500 the year before. In other spots where we found Walker using the $700 figure we found a similar lack of context.

But under either approach, there are problems with Walker’s claim.

A bit of background first.

For years, the state has imposed property tax limits on local governments and school districts, resulting in a slowing of tax growth that somewhat reduced Wisconsin’s high national ranking on property tax burden.

Ultimately, in the two-year budget signed in June, Walker won support for much tighter property-tax controls -- even a virtual freeze on municipal levies.

The tight levy limits were important to lead to property tax relief. Walker’s budget included large aid cuts to school districts and local units of government. If those officials didn’t -- or couldn’t based on in-place union contracts -- use tools to make employees pay more for pensions and health care, they could have raised property taxes to cover the difference.

To back up the governor’s statement, Werwie pointed us to one page in a Department of Administration budget document from March 2011. It was part of Walker’s budget proposal.

The page shows a chart estimating the property taxes on a median-valued home for the next two years under Walker’s budget, compared to what they might have been under a different scenario.

""The typical taxpayer will save a total of $736 over the biennium,"" the chart notes.

So that’s where the governor gets the $700 figure.

Let’s take a closer look at the two scenarios Walker is comparing in order to make his savings claim.

The department, which constructs the state budget, provided us the assumptions behind the chart.

The problem was immediately obvious -- the chart, while useful in one respect, doesn’t offer a clean ""old way"" vs. ""new way"" comparison that Walker would have needed to make the claim he did.

To get that, you could compare what property taxes might have been under the old aid levels and a continuation of the Doyle-era tax limits -- vs. the estimated taxes under Walker-proposed limits and aid cuts.

That’s old vs. new.

Instead, on the ""old"" (pre-Walker) side of the equation, the chart inserts one of Walker’s own key proposals -- the big aid cut to local governments and schools.

That has the effect of pushing up the property tax hike that ""might have been"" -- in part because it assumed that schools and local governments would almost tax to the maximum allowed to replace the lost aid.

That makes the ""savings"" projection bigger.

The chart is not wrong. It’s a useful cautionary illustration for lawmakers deciding how strong the levy limits needed to be to avoid big property tax increases in light of Walker’s school aid cut plans.

But its conclusion can’t be used to make the kind of claim Walker makes.

No such analysis has been published yet, based on what we heard from tax experts.

To sum up, Walker claimed the 2011-’13 state budget will ""save"" the average homeowner $700 over two years.

If he meant a $700 tax cut compared to the past bills, that’s not in the cards at all. The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projects the typical homeowner would see a $55 increase in two years compared with 2010.

And even if he meant $700 less of an increase, his assertion is not based on an apples-to-apples comparison of his budget vs. the old law. The real figure is not yet known, but we do know that the approach Walker cited was designed in a way that puffs up the ""savings.""

The claim, with its shorthand presentation, rates as False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-average-property-tax-payer-w/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says 90 percent of Virginia's job growth has been in private sector
","
In a recent television interview, Gov. Bob McDonnell was asked whether Virginia’s strong employment numbers should be at least partially credited to the state’s proximity to Washington.

""How much of a wind is at your back just from being next to the center of government?"" asked Joe Kerne, the host of CNBC’s Squawk Box.

McDonnell downplayed the effect of the federal government on Virginia’s job picture.

""The fact that we’ve got proximity to Washington, D.C., is certainly somewhat helpful, but I will say that most of the job growth (in Virginia), in fact 90 percent of it, has been in the private sector,"" McDonnell said.

We wondered if the governor’s statistic is correct.

Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for McDonnell, backed up his boss by giving us a spreadsheet culled from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It detailed how many jobs have been created in government and the private sector since February 2010, the first full month of McDonnell’s administration.

We checked the underlying data on the BLS website to see if the numbers supported the governor’s statement.

In February 2010, there were 3,595,600 total jobs in Virginia. By May 2011, the latest month for which data was available, that rose to 3,663,000. That’s a net increase of 67,400 jobs.

The BLS numbers break out how many of those positions were attributed to federal, state and local government jobs, as well as how many were in the private sector.

In February 2010, there were 2,896,000 private-sector jobs, rising in May 2011 to 2,959,400. That’s an increase of 63,400 private sector positions, which is 94 percent of the Virginia’s net job growth during McDonnell’s term.

Of course, many private sector jobs in Virginia are indirectly funded by the federal government. Gary Steinberg, a BLS spokesman, said his agency doesn’t tally how many private jobs are attributable government contracts. But government contracts certainly provide a boost to Virginia’s economy.

Companies in Fairfax County alone received $22.6 billion in federal contracts in fiscal year 2009, according to U.S. Census Bureu statistics cited by Alan A. Fogg, a spokesman for the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.

Fogg noted in an e-mail that 26 companies listed in Washington Technology magazine’s 2011 list of the 100 largest government contractors are based in Fairfax or have their U.S. headquarters there.

A report by Stephen S. Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, found that in fiscal 2008, Department of Defense spending funded an estimated 268,200 full-time equivalent employees of federal contractors in Virginia.

Let’s review:

Asked about how much the federal government is boosting Virginia’s jobs picture, McDonnell countered that it’s the private sector that’s been driving the commonwealth’s job growth.

The governor said the private sector has accounted for about 90 percent of the state’s job growth and figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his claim. Although many private sector jobs in Virginia are created through federal government contracts, there are no definitive statistics detailing the number.

"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Jack Murphy']","
Does Georgia's immigration bill ""simply follow existing federal law""?
","
Just hours after a federal judge ordered a preliminary injunction of Georgia’s legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, a state senator who pushed to get the bill passed laid out what he considered the positives about the ruling.

Sen. Jack Murphy, a Republican from Cumming, noted the judge struck down several arguments by the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit against the legislation.

But it was the final words of Murphy’s press release that made us reach for the law books.

""This law simply follows existing federal law,"" the release said.

We wondered about the senator’s claim since supporters of the Georgia legislation, House Bill 87, pushed for the bill largely because they felt the federal government has done a poor job enforcing its immigration laws and keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. Before Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 87, its supporters also argued the legislation would survive legal challenges.

The bill requires all Georgia companies with more than 10 employees to verify the immigration status of all new employees, using the federal government’s E-Verify program. It says businesses that do contract work for the state, their subcontractors and their sub-subcontractors must participate in E-Verify. It gives law enforcement authority to check the immigration status of someone detained on probable cause of committing a crime.

Judge Thomas Thrash was concerned about Section 8 of the legislation, which he wrote ""will convert many routine encounters with law enforcement into lengthy and intrusive immigration status investigations. Thus, the individual plaintiffs have shown a realistic threat of injury as a result of HB 87."" Murphy and others expect the legislation to be appealed to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and possibly heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Murphy sent us a statement to back up the claim in his press release. Much of it focused on a section of federal code on immigration about hiring and harboring illegal immigrants and the penalties for document fraud.

The general themes of the federal law and Georgia’s legislation, HB 87, are similar. They both say it’s bad to hire or harbor illegal immigrants, and impose fines and possible prison time for anyone who aids in either process. They both have fines and prison sentences for anyone who commits document fraud. Georgia’s legislation makes several references to following the guidelines of federal law.

Thrash, however, said there are big differences between the state legislation and federal law.

""Despite superficial similarities, however, Section 7 [of HB 87] is not identical to 1324 [in the federal code],"" Thrash wrote in his ruling.

""For example,"" he wrote, ""O.C.G.A. 16-11-202 prohibits knowingly inducing, enticing or assisting illegal aliens to enter Georgia. Section 1324’s corresponding ‘inducement’ provision prohibits inducing an alien to ‘come to, enter, or reside in the United States.’ Once in the United States, it is not a federal crime to induce an illegal alien to enter Georgia from another state.""

Thrash also wrote that the ""defendants wildly exaggerate the scope of the federal crime of harboring under 1324 when they claim that the plaintiffs are violating federal immigration law by giving rides to their friends and neighbors who are illegal aliens.""

Muzaffar Chishti, an official with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said ""the [Georgia bill] prohibits knowingly inducing, enticing or assisting undocumented immigrants to enter Georgia, whereas it is not a federal crime to induce an undocumented immigrant to enter Georgia from another state.""

He added that the language in the Georgia bill that creates fines and sentences for violators ""allows the state to use prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation differently than the federal system."" Chishti noted that Thrash had those same concerns, pointing to a portion of a federal court ruling concerning Arizona’s illegal-immigration legislation.

""[A]lthough Section 7 appears superficially similar to 1324, state prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation will undermine federal authority ‘to establish immigration enforcement priorities and strategies,’ "" Thrash wrote, quoting the Arizona ruling.

Murphy told us he respectfully disagrees with some portions of Thrash’s ruling and that the judge’s interpretation of the federal law is incorrect. Murphy questioned our pursuit of this fact-check, saying, in part, that we could find 100 experts who would agree with Thrash while he could find 100 experts who would agree with him.

Still, we pressed on in search of more nonpartisan experts. One was Victor Cerda, former general counsel for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. He argues Georgia’s E-Verify guidelines go beyond federal guidelines. For example, he noted that Georgia requires affidavits from contractors, subcontractors and sub-subcontractors of the immigration status of their workers. The federal government does not require an affidavit from contractors, an official said. Instead, contractors must sign a memorandum of understanding that they will use E-Verify within its guidelines.

""Georgia has a lot more definition,"" said Cerda, now a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Jackson Lewis, which specializes in workplace law.

So let’s go back to Murphy’s argument that HB 87 ""simply follows existing federal law."" In the area of penalties, which are easier to measure, Georgia’s bill is less in some areas and potentially greater in other areas. The legislation addresses the same issues as federal law, but there are some differences where Georgia does more than simply follow federal law, such as Cerda’s point on affidavits and the language in Georgia’s bill concerning ""inducing"" illegal immigration here from another state. Since Murphy’s statement does not consider those distinctions, we rate his claim as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/18/jack-murphy/does-georgias-immigration-bill-simply-follow-exiti/
"['Ohio', 'Josh Mandel']","
Josh Mandel says Sen. Sherrod Brown rates as the most liberal in the United States
","
When a Republican calls someone a liberal, it’s not meant as a compliment. Add the modifier ""most liberal member of the U.S. Senate,"" and you’ve got red meat, especially in a middle-of-the-road state like Ohio.

You’ve also got, as you may have guessed, the rap against Sherrod Brown.

Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer who’s been raising money to run as the Republican nominee against Brown, laid out that accusation in an interview with syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt on June 24.

""I don’t know if you know this, but Sherrod Brown was just voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America. Now that’s saying a lot when Bernie Sanders, who’s a socialist, is to the right of you.""

The National Republican Senatorial Committee made a similar characterization in news release July 6, saying Brown was ""rated the most liberal member of the Senate.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Brown, a freshman Ohio Democrat facing reelection next year, supports the federal government playing an active rule in regulating industry, banking, health care and other marketplaces he believes are pocked with abuse.

To check our assessment of whether he is, in fact, a liberal, we asked three Ohio political scientists -- Alexander Lamis of Case Western Reserve University, Daniel Coffey of the University of Akron and Eric Rademacher of the University of Cincinnati -- to characterize Brown as either a conservative, moderate or liberal.

All three said liberal.

Both a Mandel representative and the NRSC cited annual lawmaker ratings by National Journal, a nonpartisan, highly regarded magazine that covers public policy in Washington.  National Journal’s ratings are popular with the political press. Cleveland.com, the website of The Plain Dealer, reported Brown’s most recent National Journal rankingwhen it came out in February. The ranking covered 2010.

But as National Journal and others noted, Brown was actually in a nine-way tie for the title of most liberal. The other eight were Sanders, the Vermont independent who considers himself a socialist (in the tradition of social democracies like Sweden, Norway and Finland); Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid; and Democrats Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.

Mathematically, this intrigued us. Consider the number of ""most liberal,"" nine. Now count all the Senate Democrats in last year’s Congress: 57, plus Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. Nine out of 58 represents 15.51 percent -- meaning that, with rounding, 16 percent of the entire Senate Democratic caucus came in first place for the most liberal.

This surely wouldn’t work in a beauty contest. Even as a criticism of lawmakers, it’s a bit of a Lake Wobegon standard, to use a public radio analogy -- a U.S. Senate where all liberals are above average.

But how, exactly, do you define ""most liberal?""

National Journal did so by reviewing the actions of every senator on 96 roll-call votesand weighing each one on a liberal-to-conservative scale. A number of the measures concerned corporate subsidies or tax breaks that Democrats wanted to end; provisions of the new health care law that Republicans wanted to scrap, and financial reform measures that Democrats said would prevent future banking scandals but Republicans considered too sweeping.

Yet not every vote used in the rankings was an obvious liberal or conservative measure. For instance, National Journal included a bill to continue business tax credits while also extending jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. The same bill also made sure doctors didn’t get a Medicare fee cut. Business groups liked the tax provisions. Then-Sen. George Voinovich, a Republican, voted yes, saying jobless workers needed help. So did Brown.

But a majority of Republicans voted no, saying the bill would weigh too heavy on the budget deficit. The partisan split made it a fair measure of the Senate’s Democrat-Republican divide, but Brown’s office questions whether this was really the mark of a liberal position.

The same goes for several other votes, such as one confirming a northern Ohio judicial nominee, Benita Pearson. It wasn’t as if Pearson had baggage. Rather, this was one more vote in a tit-for-tat standoff between Republicans and Democrats over confirmations and hardball politics. Like Brown, Voinovich voted yes, but he was the only Republican to do so.

Brown has been a senator since 2007, and since lawmakers are often judged on their entire records, we wanted to see how he ranked in the other years. According to National Journal, he was tied for ""Most Liberal"" again in 2009, this time with four others: Cardin, Whitehouse, Roland Burris of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Sanders came in at 38th. This is where Mandel gets the claim that ""Bernie Sanders, who’s a socialist, is to the right"" of Brown.

But going back earlier, Brown was the Senate’s 28th most liberal member in National Journal’s 2008 analysis, and 27th most liberal in 2007.

National Journal isn’t the only player  in the ratings game. Others include Americans for Democratic Action, which calls itself ""a forthright liberal voice for the nation.""  The ADA gave Brown a rating of 95 percent for 2010. Five other senators got ""perfect"" scores of 100 percent.

The American Civil Liberties Union gave Brown a score of 93, consistent with many other Senate Democrats. But four Democrats got perfect scores of 100. The League of Conservation Voters, tracking environmental issues, gave Brown a 100 percent score. But 23 other senators shared that perfect score. .

And then there’s Voteview.com, a more comprehensive and mathematically driven evaluation compiled by political scientists across the country. Voteview examines votes on every contested bill in Congress, and since Congress works over a two-year term, Voteview ratings only come out every other years.

Brown was the 11th most liberal Democrat in the two-year congressional cycle ending in 2010,  based on Vote View’s assessment. Sanders came in at No. 6.

Brown was the fifth most liberal in the previous Congress, representing his first two years in the Senate, while Sanders was No. 2 during that 2007-2008 period, according to Voteview.

So we return to Mandel’s claim that Brown was ""voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America."" and that he is more liberal than Bernie Sanders.

Brown tied for first place in both of those years in the National Journal ratings. The tie in the most recent year included 16 percent of the Democratic caucus. To say that Brown was voted ""the most liberal senator"" misses the broad sweep of lawmakers in that category.

As for the claim that Brown was to the left of Sanders, the Senate’s self-described socialist, it only survives if you include one year and one set of rankings, namely, again, National Journal’s.

Neither Mandel nor the NRSC said they were basing their claim on exhaustive research or an array of possible ratings. And both were careful to say that Brown was ""rated"" or ""judged"" the most liberal, attributing the claim as opposed to making it themselves.  Yet there is so much more information available, and so many more details -- the nine-way tie in 2010, the Sanders position in only one of the years (and not the most recent), the other ratings in which Brown was not first.  

A casual  listener or reader would miss out on important context if he or she only heard their claim and didn’t see the fuller picture. A statement that is accurate but leaves out important details like these gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Michael Doherty']","
Sen. Michael Doherty claims Planned Parenthood only provides 140 visits for prenatal care in each state
","
When Democrats and Republicans met on the floor of the New Jersey Senate on July 11 to discuss overriding vetoes handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, the debate ultimately turned to whether $7.5 million for family planning services should be reinstated -- some of which would go to Planned Parenthood centers.

Democrats touted the importance of that funding for New Jersey families. Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) said of the clients served: ""They are women who come for prenatal and postnatal health services so that they do have healthy families.""

But Republican Sen. Michael Doherty argued that the organization doesn’t provide much prenatal care.

""There's a lot of talk about prenatal care and the fact is that Planned Parenthood just does not provide many prenatal visits. It's about 140 visits for each state in the entire country,"" said Doherty, who represents Warren County and parts of Hunterdon County. ""So we’re talking (about) an organization we’re supposed to be sending people we care about to get top-notch care for prenatal visits and it turns out that they don’t really see a lot of patients.""

A resolution to override that veto failed in a 25-14 vote.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Doherty, a conservative, was right about prenatal care representing a small part of the services offered by Planned Parenthood, but he is wrong about there being about 140 visits in each state.

Using the senator’s own reasoning, the number would actually be around 800 visits per state.

First, let’s explain where Doherty received his information.

Doherty referred us to a fact sheet prepared by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., showing that 7,021 prenatal clients were served nationwide in 2009. Based on that figure, Doherty determined there were, on average, about 140 prenatal patients per state.

Here’s the problem: the fact sheet said ""clients,"" but Doherty referred to ""visits"" on the Senate floor. 
Clients refers to people. Visits refers to the numbers of times a client goes to Planned Parenthood. 
When we checked with Michele Jaker, executive director of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of New Jersey, she said Planned Parenthood centers provided a total of 40,489 prenatal visits across the country in 2009, which is the latest data available.

Using the same formula that Doherty did, that number equates to about 809 visits per state.

Jaker could not provide the number of visits in New Jersey, but said 581 prenatal clients were served in the Garden State in 2009.

""His number right off the bat is wrong,"" said Jaker, referring to Doherty.

Jaker added in an email that Doherty’s approach -- dividing the number of prenatal patients by 50 states -- was not an accurate assessment, because several states ""only have one health center and don't have the facilities to provide prenatal care.""

Told about our findings, Doherty said: ""I think you’re splitting hairs.""

But for his overall argument that Planned Parenthood sees few prenatal patients, Doherty is right.

According to the same fact sheet, ""other women’s health services,"" which includes prenatal care, only accounted for 10 percent of all services provided by Planned Parenthood nationwide in 2009.

According to figures provided by Jaker, prenatal clients represented about 0.6 percent of the 91,617 patients served by New Jersey centers in 2009.

Jaker said the number of prenatal clients served by Planned Parenthood is due to limited funding and the needs of the community. If a center cannot provide prenatal care to a woman, it will refer her to another resource in the community, she said.

""If there are enough providers who do prenatal care for low income women, it may not be a service we need to provide,"" Jaker wrote in an email. ""We could cover the needs of our patients through referrals.""

Pointing out how many pregnancies may go unnoticed, Dr. Donald Chervenak, president-elect of the New Jersey Obstetrical and Gynecological Society, noted how Planned Parenthood is helpful in providing pregnancy testing. Through earlier prenatal treatment, other medical problems can be addressed sooner, Chervenak said.

Back to Doherty’s statement:

The senator said Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide many prenatal visits, saying the figure was ""about 140 visits for each state in the entire country."" That figure is way off, because Doherty was using the number of clients. The actual number would be more like 800 visits per state.

Figures provided by Planned Parenthood confirm that prenatal care represents a small part of the services offered, but since the senator’s figures were inaccurate to such a large degree, we rate the statement False.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Donna Seidel']","
Wisconsin Rep. Donna Seidel says the $290 million structural surplus in the state budget is not real
","
Wisconsin Republicans have made much of the fact that their 2011-’13 budget eliminates the state’s long-standing structural deficit.

Indeed, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says the budget would result in a surplus of $292 million. It’s the first time the fiscal bureau has determined that a budget would result in such a surplus since the agency began the calculations for the 1997-’99 budget.

Republican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers argued that previous administrations used one-time fixes, such as tapping special funds and the state’s settlement in lawsuits against tobacco companies, to balance the budget.

Now, Democrats say the Republicans are making a big assumption -- that their counterparts in Washington will allow a tax increase -- to make the budget picture look better than it really is.

And therefore, that the claim of the structural surplus is bogus.

At issue is how the fiscal bureau handled one piece of its projection: The future reinstatement of the federal estate tax, which -- based on a formula -- brings some additional money to state coffers. Under current law, the estate tax is to kick in again in 2013.

If that happens, the fiscal bureau estimates it would mean $219 million more for the state over the course of the two-year budget.

Assistant Minority Leader Donna Seidel, D-Wausau, argues the ""$219 million is contingent on Congress reinstating the estate tax, which clearly is a top platform point for the Republicans and is not going to happen.""

""So clearly that’s another piece of misinformation,"" Seidel told the Journal Sentinel editorial board July 5, 2011, arguing the structural surplus is closer to $75 million.

We’ve tackled several recent statements on the structural deficit.

The first thing to remember is this: The two-year budget itself -- by law -- must be balanced when passed. The structural deficit measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. So you can have a balanced budget, but one built upon assumptions that are projected to result in a deficit later on.

That’s part of what happened in the past, leading to structural deficits reaching as high as $2.8 billion for the 2003-’05 budget.

We rated a statement by Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, that the budget eliminated the structural deficit for the ""first time in decades"" as Mostly True. A statement on national TV by Walker that the worst structural deficit was two years ago was False.

The Fiscal Bureau bases its estimate on factors including expected costs (the spending side), projections of how much the state will collect in sales and income taxes (the revenue side) and other sources of money.

In this case, that includes what federal law says about the estate tax.

It’s true that Republicans will push to keep the tax cuts in place -- they already won one extension of the Bush-era tax cuts under President Barack Obama in December of 2010. But Seidel argues it was wrong to include the return of them in the Fiscal Bureau’s calculation.

Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, who was with Seidel during the Journal Sentinel visit, agreed with the argument that the surplus isn’t real.

""There is no surplus,"" he said.

Indeed, as Seidel criticizes the inclusion as an assumption improperly made by the bureau, she is making her own assumption: That the extension of the tax cuts will continue.

How does the process work?

As a rule, the fiscal bureau does its calculations based on current law, according to Rob Reinhardt, a program supervisor with the agency. The report on the structural surplus did note the assumption as a footnote.

Indeed, a similar estate tax assumption was used when the fiscal bureau calculated the structural deficit for the 2009-’11 budget prepared by Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle. The bureau’s analysis put that budget’s structural deficit at $2.511 billion.

Applying Seidel’s logic to that budget, estate tax revenue should have been subtracted -- and the deficit would have been even larger.

Indeed, even if the federal estate tax return was removed from the state’s 2011-’13 budget, there still would be a surplus, just a smaller one. Seidel noted this herself.

So where does this leave us?

As the GOP touts passage of a budget that doesn’t include a structural deficit, Seidel claims the number is bogus because it is puffed up by $219 million -- based on current law that calls for the estate tax to go back into effect in 2010.

But the Legislative Fiscal Bureau calculated the budget the way it always has. They even footnoted the issue for clarity. The bureau’s calculations are a picture in time -- where the budget stands today. With her own assumption, Seidel wants to jump to the future to undermine the nonpartisan calculation. We rate Seidel’s claim False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/17/donna-seidel/wisconsin-rep-donna-seidel-says-290-million-struct/
"['Medicare', 'Texas', 'Lois Kolkhorst']","
Lois Kolkhorst says $500 billion in Medicare cuts are coming
","
Defending her own health care measure, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst answered a colleague’s query about preserving insurance for the elderly of Texas by warning that national cuts loom.

The Brenham Republican, who chairs the House Public Health Committee, said during June 15 floor debate: ""We know they are reducing the entitlement to Medicare."" She added: ""We know that we have these cuts coming our way of over half a trillion to Medicare.""

We do?

Some background: PolitiFact teams in Washington and other states have pointed out that it’s incorrect to deem reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, written into the federal health care overhaul signed into law last year by President Barack Obama, as cuts. These reductions are being counted as projected savings compared to what would have happened without the change in law. 
The program’s overall costs are projected to increase to $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in 2009, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
Also, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, tagged Obamacare by critics, doesn’t eliminate benefits. 
Indeed, portions of the law improve benefits and coverage, according to Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health care research organization. Medicare will cover more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and recipients won't face the ""doughnut hole"" gap in prescription coverage imposed under an existing Medicare program. 
Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund other coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, Neuman has said.

To back up Kolkhorst's claim, which was brought to our attention by Democratic activist Phillip Martin, her office passed along a September 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece quoting Richard S. Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, outlining intended cuts in payments to medical providers and hospitals as well as reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients.
   
It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare.
   
The 2010 health care law will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The law also calls for slowing increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. Also, the law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, though the board — the Independent Payment Advisory Board — is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits.

Kolkhorst’s office pointed us to the Medicare actuary’s April 2010 analysis, which includes a chart suggesting that through 2019, the new law will net Medicare ""savings"" of $575.1 billion. It also says that 60.5 million Americans will be covered by Medicare in 2019, the same number that would have been covered without a change in law.

Foster’s memo says the Medicare savings are to be achieved largely through reduced payments to medical providers including hospitals, tied to raised productivity expectations. It warns, though, that those gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis and would also probably prove unworkable and less than projected in some health-care sectors during the law’s roll-out.

Moreover, his memo says, health care providers ""for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)."" It says its own simulations suggest that about 15 percent of providers in the Medicare program specific to inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as hospice care and home health services would become unprofitable by 2019 due to the productivity provisions.

Kolkhorst’s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, suggested the projected reductions in rates are tantamount to cuts in Medicare. He said by email: ""If there is an entitlement for everyone eligible to receive a pizza, and we are cutting the rate paid to pizza kitchens by x percent, then there will be less of that entitlement for pizza.""

Similarly, Kolkhorst told us the changes built into the 2010 law will reduce access to Medicare. ""You’re splitting hairs to say those are savings; they’re cuts,"" she said, adding: ""Things are going to change ... To say that everything is going to remain as it is today, that’s erroneous.""

That last point seems reasonable, but it’s not exactly what she told her House colleagues.

The referenced $500 billion figure depends on a slowing in the pace of Medicare cost increases. That’s not the same as cutting back. Medicare spending will still grow; benefits will expand.

Still, there remains the prospect of some providers quitting Medicare, possibly making it harder for patients to get care. Kolkhorst’s statement has an element of truth, making it Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/17/lois-kolkhorst/lois-kolkhorst-says-obama-administration-cutting-m/

New Jersey Education Law Center director says state’s schools among most segregated in country
","
New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country and certainly one of the most ethnically diverse.

But the state’s school systems aren’t exactly a model of racial diversity, according to David Sciarra, executive director of the New Jersey Education Law Center, based in Newark.

""By any measure, New Jersey has one of the most segregated school systems in the country,"" Sciarra said in a May 19 Bob Braun column in The Star-Ledger. Sciarra made the comment during an event days before the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered that $500 million be pumped into the state’s low-income schools, known as Abbott districts.

New Jersey schools are segregated, Sciarra said, because the state has hundreds of school districts that track municipal boundaries. The cities typically have large concentrations of black and Latino students, while the suburbs are overwhelmingly white. 
Kentucky and other southern, or more rural states, are among the most integrated because those states have countywide or regional school districts that tend to draw a more diverse student population.

Still, segregation is a strong claim to make in 2011 -- and one that might be in the eye of the beholder, since many consider it a forced separation of the races. Some education experts see things differently, however, and agree with Sciarra’s statement.

Segregation isn’t just about about the forced separation of racial groups, according to Sciarra and to Gary Orfield, professor of Education, Law, Political Science and Urban Planning, and co-director of the Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles at the University of California, Los Angeles.

To be clear, New Jersey’s Constitution prohibits racial segregation in public schools and strict constitutional law requires that schools have racial balance, Sciarra said.

""In terms of racial minorities, African-Americans and Latinos, we have a very segregated system,"" Sciarra told us. ""In the United States, we’re (New Jersey) usually third, fourth or fifth.""

For 2001-02, New Jersey ranked in the top 10 of states as being among the most segregated, according to the report ""Brown At 50: King’s Dream or Plessy’s Nightmare?"" The report was authored by Orfield and Chungmei Lee in January 2004, when The Civil Rights Project was based at Harvard University.

The report shows that New Jersey ranked ninth highest in the nation for the percentage of blacks in majority white schools; fifth nationwide for the percentage of blacks attending mostly minority schools; and sixth overall for the number of white students enrolled in majority black schools. 

The state’s rank in each of those categories, but for Latino students, was slightly higher: seventh, fourth and fifth for the respective categories. Ranking that high on the report is indicative of more segregation, while states much lower on the list are indicative of having more integrated schools.

For the 2009-10 school year, data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that 66 percent of either whites or blacks in New Jersey would have to move to another district in order to achieve racial balance in schools. That figure drops to 64 percent for racial balance between Latinos and whites, according to the statistics. The same statistics also show that the average black or Latino student in New Jersey attends a school that is 28 percent white. As a result of those figures, New Jersey ranks in the top 10 of most segregated states when looking at all U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

John Logan, a professor of Sociology at Brown University and director of the US2010 Project, a research program on changes in American society in the recent past, looked at the racial divide for elementary school children in 2000, in major metropolitan areas. He found that in the Newark area, 72 percent of Hispanics or whites would have to move to another district to achieve racial balance in schools. For blacks, it was 82 percent. The figures were even higher for the Bergen-Passaic area.

The Orfield and Lee study looked at a decade of resegregation after the Supreme Court’s 1991 decision in Dowell v. Oklahoma City, which allowed school districts to declare themselves unitary, end desegregation plans and return to neighborhood schools. As part of their study, Orfield and Lee examined enrollment in U.S. schools, patterns of segregation and desegregation of various groups, regions and community types.

Among the study’s findings: a major increase in segregation in many districts where court-ordered desegregation was ended; rural and small town school districts, on average, are the most integrated schools in the nation for blacks and Latinos, but segregation is severe in smaller central cities and in the suburbs of large metropolises; poverty found in the most intensely segregated minority schools can be connected to unequaled educational opportunity.

Some say a legacy of past housing decisions contribute to segregation.

""For decades, U.S. and local housing policy encouraged segregation by race and class through decisions about where public housing would or would not be built and how it would be administered,"" said Ansley T. Erickson, an assistant professor of History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. ""Simultaneously, both mortgage finance policies and local real estate practices produced suburbs that were predominantly white. Thus society did not simply cluster itself. Individuals did make choices about where they would prefer to live or send their children to school, but they did so influenced by incentives, disincentives, and restrictions set out in policy and practice.""

Let’s review.

Sciarra and several other experts say the state’s school system is among the most segregated in the nation, primarily because of a history of housing patterns and other demographic factors. Data from a 2004 report on segregation, as well as 2009-10 statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that New Jersey is in the top 10 of states for having segregated schools. Sciarra said New Jersey typically ranks in the top five for being the most segregated, but our research puts New Jersey more in the top 10. For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Sen. Whitehouse says criminals can hack into home computers and spy on victims through video cameras
","
Alarmed by reports of computers being hacked in the United States, including at major corporations, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse took to the Senate floor in June to call for a heightened campaign against cyber-crime.

The country’s increasing dependence on the Internet, he said, ""allows criminals, terrorists and hostile nations to exploit cyberspace to attack America, to invade our privacy, to loot our intellectual property and to expose America’s core critical infrastructure to cybersabotage.""

Whitehouse, a Democrat,  went on to say, ""Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers and looking out through the video camera attached to the screen.""

We nervously glanced at our webcam, wondering if anyone was watching, and just to be safe covered our mouth when we asked, ""Is that true?""

Then we reached out to several technology experts to ask whether hackers can seize control of our home computers and secretly keep a digital eye on us.

""Yes, it’s absolutely possible to do,"" said David Sherry, chief information security officer for Brown University and former vice president of information security for Citizens Financial Group. ""It’s actually quite easy to do. It’s really nothing new.""

The know-how has been around since 1998, said Sherry, ever since a group of hackers calling itself the Cult of the Dead Cow designed software that, once downloaded, could be used to control a computer remotely. With the proliferation of webcam-equipped laptops, the potential pool of voyeur victims has swelled immensely, he said.

Adam Wosotowsky, a principal engineer at McAfee, a company that sells anti-virus and anti-malware products, agreed. Home computer users can be victimized by hackers who deploy software to exploit unprotected machines, he said.

""So if they have a webcam, then you can take advantage of it,"" said Wosotowsky.

How is it done? Typically, when computer operators click on a file, link or pop-up window created by a hacker, they could inadvertently install malicious software on their hard drives. That opens the door for hackers to control victims’ computers remotely.

Just because something is possible doesn’t mean people are actually doing it. So we searched for examples of webcam wrongdoing.

We learned of several cases.

An Ohio man who was a registered sexual offender reportedly got 25 years in prison in 2007 for charges that included hacking into minors’ webcams and secretly watching and recording them in their homes, according to InformationWeek.

A disturbing case took place in Texas in 2004. While instant messaging with a friend, a 15-year-old girl suddenly realized that her words weren’t her own. They were vulgar and clearly the work of a hacker. It became clear that the hacker was manipulating her webcam too when he sent a message complimenting her shirt. [He apparently was using the microphone too since he sent messages quoting things that had been said aloud in her home.]

The FBI informed us of a 2010 case in California in which a 31-year-old man posed on a social networking site as a friend of teenage girls. By persuading them to download a song, he infected their computers.

Soon, he could stealthily search hard drives of hundreds of computers for explicit photos and videos. When he found such material, he demanded his victims send more explicit material or he would expose them. He also was ""occasionally successful"" controlling webcams to catch his victims in intimate situations.

Eric Strom, unit chief within the FBI’s cyberdivision, said that while the technology exists to manipulate people’s webcams, that’s not what most criminals are interested in. For instance, the same man who victimized the California girl also used a ""keylogger"" program to monitor keystrokes and steal credit card numbers and other personal information, he said.

""They are looking for financial gain,"" said Strom.  

Still, he said he’s noticed in airports more  people ""taping up their webcams."" That’s a simple step experts recommend to prevent webcam spying, as well as placing objects in front of the camera.  If the webcam light comes on when you’re not using it, that’s a telltale sign it’s being operated remotely, they say.

Sherry, at Brown University, recommends updating operating systems, keeping firewalls turned on and maintaining antivirus protection that also fights malware and spyware. If you rely on wireless connections to the Internet, he said, ensure that security settings are at the highest level and, when using unprotected public wireless sites, do not conduct sensitive transactions. Also, avoid clicking on anything suspicious.

""This is something that can easily be prevented,"" he said.

So let’s return to the senator’s claim that hackers are spying on people through their webcams.

The experts say that the technology is readily available for hackers to seize control of home computers, including webcams. And while such cases are seemingly rare, law enforcement officials have arrested people in cases that involved webcam hacking to ""spy on Americans,"" the phrase Whitehouse used.

Before we issue our ruling, rest assured of one thing: No one has ever hacked the Truth-O-Meter. We rate this claim True.

Josh Treviño says polls show Americans believe the federal debt ceiling should not be raised and the debt and deficit should be dealt with mostly by cutting spending
","
Josh Treviño, spokesman for the conservative Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation, suggested in an MSNBC appearance that Americans are aligned with Republicans in Washington in opposing an increase in the federal debt ceiling and wanting to attack the federal deficit with budget cuts.

Treviño, referring to polling by the Gallup organization, told interviewer Al Sharpton July 13 that ""it’s pretty clear that the American people, or at least a plurality of them, are on (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell’s side and on the House GOP’s side as well.

""Yesterday,"" Treviño said, ""we saw Gallup release a poll that had 42 percent of Americans, a plurality, opposed to raising the debt ceiling. And today we had a Gallup poll showing 50 percent versus 11 (percent) on the other side thinking that the debt and the deficit should be dealt with by mostly spending cuts. So the Republicans are on the side of the American people here, and I think that’s pretty clear.""

A reader asked if Treviño accurately replayed the poll results.

As we looked for the relevant results, Gallup spokeswoman Lydia Saad told us there’s only one poll at issue. In the telephone poll of 1,016 adults taken July 7-10, 42 percent of respondents said they wanted their House member to vote against raising the debt ceiling, while 22 percent said they preferred a favorable vote; 33 percent were unsure. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Gallup said respondents who identified themselves as Republicans were more unified in opposition to raising the debt ceiling (60 percent opposed, 11 percent in favor) than Democrats were supportive of raising it (39 percent in favor, 21 percent opposed). Independents tilted against raising the ceiling, 46 percent to 18 percent, with 36 percent having no opinion.

""Despite intense lobbying of Congress by President Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and others in the administration about the economic urgency for raising the nation's debt limit,"" the poll results’ summary says, ""fewer than one in four Americans favor the general idea of raising it.""

Treviño’s other point — that Americans favor mostly budget cuts to deal with the deficit — didn’t poll as neatly as his recap suggests.

Asked how they’d prefer members of Congress to address the deficit, 20 percent said only by cutting spending and another 30 percent said mostly with spending cuts. Four percent favored solely tax increases, while 7 percent said they’d prefer to tackle the deficit mostly by tax hikes.

Still, 32 percent said they’d support a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Put another way, at least 43 percent indicated some support for tax increases — most of them also backing budget cuts.

""Americans' preferences for deficit reduction clearly favor spending cuts to tax increases,"" Gallup sums up, ""but most Americans favor a mix of the two approaches."" Its write-up closes: ""A key question to be answered in the days ahead is whether an agreement to raise the debt ceiling will include any tax increases. This is something many Republican members of Congress oppose, but most Americans do not seem to share this view.""

We rate Treviño’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/16/josh-trevino/josh-trevino-says-polls-show-americans-aligned-rep/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama said a ""clear majority"" of Republican voters think tax revenues should be included as part of a budget deal.
","
As President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress continued their high-stakes stand-off over raising the debt ceiling and other federal budget issues, Obama held a press conference to press his case that he's a reasonable guy. 

One of the main points of contention is whether an agreement should include tax increases of any kind, such as closing tax loopholes or tax increases on the wealthy. Republicans oppose raising taxes.

""My Republican friends have said that they’re not willing to do revenues, and they have repeated that on several occasions,"" Obama said. ""My hope, though, is that they’re listening, not just to lobbyists or special interests here in Washington, but they’re also listening to the American people. Because it turns out poll after poll, many done by your organizations, show that it’s not just Democrats who think we need to take a balanced approach; it’s Republicans as well. The clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues. That’s not just Democrats; that’s the majority of Republicans.""

Obama also said that most polls show the general public thinks a balanced approach is right, and we explored those polls in detail in a separate fact-check. But was he right that a ""clear majority"" of Republicans also agreed? 

We found three recent polls with information on responses by partisan affiliation.

The poll that most supported Obama's statement was a Gallup poll conducted July 7-10, 2011, which posed the question this way: 

""As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?"" 

The answer ""only spending cuts"" got 26 percent from self-identified Republicans. The other answers from Republicans were ""mostly spending cuts,"" 41 percent; ""equal spending cuts and tax increases,"" 24 percent. Another 3 percent favored ""mostly"" or ""only"" tax increases. So here, about 68 percent of Republicans were open to some tax increases.

But a Quinnipiac University poll conducted July 5-11, 2011, found slightly more Republicans favored only spending cuts, contradicting Obama's statement. It asked, ""Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?""

In this case, 48 percent of Republicans favored spending cuts only, while 43 percent favored including tax increases. Another 9 percent were unsure.

In June, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found Republicans essentially split on the question. In that poll, 43 percent of Republicans said cut existing programs, while 44 percent favored including tax increases. That result was within the margin of error. 
In conclusion, we don't find that ""poll after poll"" showed a ""clear majority"" of Republicans supporting tax increases. We found one recent poll that supported Obama's statement and two other polls that showed a much more evenly divided picture. We rate it Barely True. ",/factchecks/2011/jul/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-clear-majority-republican-voters/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama said 80 percent of Americans favor both spending cuts and tax increases to address budget problems.
","
As President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress continued their high-stakes stand-off over raising the debt ceiling and other budget issues, Obama held a press conference to press his case that he's a reasonable guy.  
One of the main points of contention is whether an agreement should include tax increases of any kind, such as closing tax loopholes or tax increases on the wealthy. Republicans oppose raising taxes.

During a press conference on July 15, 2011, Obama was asked if the negotiations would be going better if he had started making his case to the public months ago, pushing a proposal that included tax increases and spending cuts. Obama rejected the premise.  
""You have 80 percent of the American people who support a balanced approach. Eighty percent of the American people support an approach that includes revenues and includes cuts. So the notion that somehow the American people aren't sold is not the problem,"" he said. ""The problem is members of Congress are dug in ideologically into various positions because they boxed themselves in with previous statements."" 
We won't weigh in on Obama's diagnosis of being dug in, but we were interested in the poll numbers on whether the public supports a balanced approach or not.

The most recent poll we found largely supported Obama's statement. A Gallup poll conducted July 7-10, 2011 posed the question this way: 

""As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?"" 

The answer ""only spending cuts"" got 20 percent. The other answers were ""mostly spending cuts,"" 30 percent; ""equal spending cuts and tax increases,"" 32 percent; ""mostly tax increases,"" 7 percent; ""only tax increases,"" 4 percent; unsure/other, 6 percent. 

We'll note that Obama counted in his favor people who favored only tax increases or who weren't sure, so he wasn't completely accurate. If you deduct those groups, only 70 percent support the balanced approach. But the poll did support his overall point. 

Other polls also showed support for Obama's statement, but not quite at an 80-percent level. 

A poll from Quinnipiac University conducted July 5-11, 2011, asked: ""Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?""

In this case, 67 percent favored including tax increases, while 25 percent favored spending cuts only. Another 8 percent were unsure.

In June, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that most people, 46 percent, favored a combination of cuts and tax increases, compared with 26 percent who said cuts alone and 13 percent who said raise taxes. An ABC/Washington Post poll from April found the number was higher, at 59 percent.  
We reviewed polls and consulted experts a few weeks ago for a fact-check on whether people support tax increases or not. Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies polls on taxation, told us polls usually show support for balanced approaches, particularly if people don't have to pay the higher taxes themselves. 
""Generally, combinations of tax hikes and spending cuts are most popular. It seems fair to most people. Spending cuts are favored in the abstract. Tax hikes are favored as long as they don't affect me. Generally, people don't think anybody should have to pay more than a quarter of their income in total taxes,"" she said. 
Finally, a few other cautions on poll numbers.

Pollsters have long noted that when you ask questions with different wording, you get different results. All the polls we looked at phrased the question slightly differently.

A few recent polls also suggested that people find the whole debt ceiling debate confusing, or they aren't following it very closely. A Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll from May asked people how well they felt they understood what would happen if the government does not raise the federal debt limit; 47 percent said ""not too well"" or ""not at all well."" And the July Gallup poll found that 42 percent of respondents were following the issue ""not too closely"" or ""not at all.""  
Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, ""You have 80 percent of the American people who support a balanced approach. Eighty percent of the American people support an approach that includes revenues and includes cuts."" Even the best poll doesn't show support quite that high -- he would more accurately have accounted for the small numbers that support only tax increases or were unsure, putting the number at 70 percent. But his overall point is correct that polls show most Americans support a balanced approach when given a choice between cutting spending or raising taxes. So we rate his statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/jul/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-80-percent-americans-favor-both-/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
GOP Rep. Paul Ryan says U.S. borrows 42 cents of each dollar it spends and half the borrowing is 'from countries like China'
","
As an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline approaches, debate is intensifying over whether Congress should allow the federal government to go deeper in debt. The head of the nation’s central bank went so far as to say the borrowing limit must be raised in order to avert a ""huge financial calamity.""

Seeking cuts in spending, many Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have resisted President Barack Obama’s call to raise the debt limit.

In defending his position, Ryan made a pair of striking statistical claims during a Milwaukee radio interview on July 6, 2011.

""We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today,"" he toldJay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM (1130), ""and about half of that comes from countries like China.""

The first part of the statement has to do with the federal deficit, while the second has to do with the debt.

As the U.S. Treasury Department points out, a deficit occurs when the government spends more money than it takes in (through taxes, fees and other income). When there’s a deficit, the government borrows money to cover the difference by selling treasury securities. Debt, meanwhile, is the net amount of accumulated deficits.

Let’s look at the two halves of the statement.

""We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today""

Conor Sweeney, Ryan’s budget committee spokesman, cited two reports: 
That puts Ryan’s claim of 42 cents smack in the middle.

Our PolitiFact colleagues earlier in 2011 twice evaluated statements nearly identical to Ryan’s, using the same approach Sweeney used. They rated both statements True, even though they were off by 3 cents.  

To check the most recent data, we used the Treasury Department’s May 2011 revenue and spending report, the latest available when Ryan did the radio interview. It indicates that, for the fiscal year to that point in time, the government borrowed 39 cents for every dollar it spends. Ryan is also within 3 cents of that figure, so we’ll judge his first claim as essentially accurate.

Now, to his second claim -- which is more complicated.

""About half of (the borrowing) comes from countries like China""

By saying ""countries like China,"" Ryan meant borrowing the U.S. does from any foreign countries, according to Sweeney. So, for Ryan’s second claim to be accurate, roughly half of the U.S. debt would have to be foreign owned.

There is no real dispute that the nation’s total debt exceeds $14 trillion.

PolitiFact has twice used that figure in evaluating claims about the proportion of U.S. debt owned by China. In recent days, the New York Times cited the current debt as $14.3 trillion and the Los Angeles Times, in a primer on the debt-limit talks, noted that the debt had reached that level in May 2011. Moreover, the The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It, a daily debt tracking done by the Treasury Department, also shows the debt at $14.3 trillion.

Indeed, that figure just about equals the nation’s debt limit -- which explains why there is urgency on the part of those who want to see the limit raised before what the Obama administration says is an Aug. 2, 2011 deadline.

But according to Sweeney, Ryan wasn’t referring to that measure at all.

Rather, he said, Ryan was pointing to a portion of the total debt, the far less known ""debt held by the public.""

Citing a Congressional Budget Office study, Sweeney called that debt measure ""the most significant measure for economic purposes"" because it excludes treasury securities held by Social Security trust funds and other government accounts.

He then pointed to the Treasury Department’s daily debt tracking, which shows total debt at $14.3 trillion, including $9.74 trillion held by the public.

Sweeney also cited a Treasury Department report which said foreign investment accounted for $4.49 trillion of U.S. debt as of April 2011. (China, by the way, was the top foreign debt owner, with $1.15 trillion.)

Using the $4.49 trillion figure would mean that foreign investors own 46 percent of the debt held by the public, which is the proportion Ryan claimed -- but only 31 percent of the total debt, which is debt measure most familiar to most people.

So what’s the bottom line?

In an interview about raising the federal government’s debt limit, Ryan made two claims in one statement: ""We borrow 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends today and about half of that comes from countries like China."" The first claim is essentially on the money.

But we believe Ryan owed his listeners more detail if he expected them to accept his second claim. It has long been widely reported that both the nation’s debt and its debt limit are $14.3 trillion. And that’s what the radio discussion was about. So when Ryan said that half of the nation’s borrowing comes from foreign countries -- singling out China for emphasis -- his listeners would assume he meant half of the $14.3 trillion in total debt, not the much smaller debt measure he now says he was referring to, even if that second measure has strong merit in the debt limit discussion.

We rate Ryan’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/15/paul-ryan/gop-rep-paul-ryan-says-us-borrows-42-cents-each-do/

No, a Facebook post does not show an electric car charging at a diesel-powered station
","A widely circulating Facebook post points to public charging stations as a glaring example of why electric cars are not as environmentally friendly as advertised. The July 11 post includes a picture it identifies as an electric car charging station in Round Rock, Texas. The accompanying text claims electric cars are more inefficient because charging stations use diesel fuel generators to produce electricity. ""That 350kWh generator uses 12 gallons of diesel fuel per hour, and it takes three hours to fully charge a car to get 200 miles,"" the text reads. ""That's 36 gallons for 200 Miles! 5.6 mpg."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The charging station shown in the post is located at an outlet mall in Round Rock, an Austin suburb. However, the description of how it operates is wrong. Electrify America, which operates the charging station, called the claim that it uses electricity derived from a diesel generator ""absolutely false."" ""Our direct-current fast electric-vehicle charging station in Round Rock, Texas, is powered by Oncor Electric Delivery Company, one of the largest utility companies in the U.S.,"" Mike Moran, a spokesperson for the company, said in an email. Oncor distributes electricity across the Texas electric grid but doesn’t generate its own power. An Oncor spokesperson said it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what kind of energy is used to power the Round Rock station — whether it’s derived from coal, nuclear, wind or solar energy. Similar claims linking electric vehicles to diesel generators have circulated before. A July 1 post used much of the same text, but with a different image and without any mention of Texas. It claimed diesel charging stations are ""popping up everywhere."" The picture used in that post is actually of a diesel-powered charging station, but not anything like the public ones that are being installed around the country. This one was created as an experiment in 2018 in Australia to test the viability of using a diesel generator to charge a car in the desert. Jon Edwards, the man who thought of the experiment, told The Driven he wanted to see whether charging with a diesel generator was viable, and how the fuel consumption for the generator compared with driving a similar-size diesel-powered car. The experiment involved using the charger to charge 10 electric cars — most of them Teslas — for one hour each, and measuring how much energy was added to the battery during charging. Edwards used the lifetime averages for each car to convert that energy figure to an estimate of the added distance the car could travel after charging. The experiment found that when charged this way, a BMW i3 was the most fuel-efficient of the electric cars, consuming 4.39 liters of fuel for every 100 kilometers of range added, equivalent to about 54 mpg. One Tesla model consumed around 7 liters of diesel fuel per 100 km of range, equivalent to about 34 mpg.  Edwards’ experiment found that, in most instances, using the generator to charge a car consumed less fuel than a similarly sized diesel car would to travel the same distance. A diesel-fueled VW Touareg SUV, for example, used 7.2 liters of fuel per 100 km. A Facebook post claims an electric car charging station in Texas runs on a diesel generator and that a car has to charge for three hours and use 12 gallons of diesel fuel to travel 200 miles.  The company that owns the charging station pictured in the post says the station is connected to an electrical grid and does not use diesel fuel. Public chargers are generally connected to the local power supply and do not use diesel generators.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/19/facebook-posts/no-facebook-post-does-not-show-electric-car-chargi/

Cuba can trade with other countries. But here’s some context
","Amid news surrounding protests in Cuba, a widely shared Facebook post asserts U.S. sanctions on Cuba restrict the country from trading with other countries, too. ""People are either unaware or being purposely obtuse about the U.S. blockade on Cuba,"" reads the post, a screenshot of a tweet. ""Do you realize it doesn’t just mean they can’t trade with the U.S.? Cuba can’t trade with ANY country or ANY company whatsoever, threatening other people who may want to help."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Experts who spoke to PolitiFact said the claim is wrong, misinterpreting some of the nuances of the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Cuba does trade with multiple countries, but the embargo can make it difficult for any foreign companies to do business in the country. Protests flared in Cuba on July 11, when thousands of citizens went to the streets to call for action over shortages of food and medicine, protesting for freedom against the Cuban government. The Associated Press reported that the protests were the largest since Fidel Castro’s presidency. The number of people detained by the government is not clear, but   Cubalex, an attorney group tracking arrests, estimated that as of July 19, 108 people were in detention, 78 people had been freed and 284 people’s whereabouts were in the process of being verified. President Miguel Díaz-Canel blamed the U.S. government’s sanctions for the country’s economic troubles. Jose Gabilondo, associate dean for accreditation and reporting and professor of law at Florida International University, said that while critics of the U.S. embargo tend to use the word ""blockade"" to describe the program, the official term for the sanctions is ""embargo,"" according to the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Department of the Treasury. That’s because the U.S. is not physically obstructing Cuba to prevent people or goods from leaving — which is what ""blockade"" means. ""There are many people who consider that the U.S.-Cuba sanctions program violates public international law, so they see it as an illegal program,"" Gabilondo said, ""and they see it as illegal because the Cuba sanctions that are imposed by OFAC apply very broadly, not only to U.S. companies but also to foreign companies that are domiciled in other countries. So many people think that the sanctions amount to an illegal blockade."" The U.S. initiated its embargo on trade with Cuba nearly 60 years ago, after Fidel Castro’s regime rose to power, and overthrew the country’s U.S.-backed government. Castro’s government increased foreign relations and trade with the Soviet Union, increased taxes on U.S. imports and nationalized American-owned properties. In response, President John F. Kennedy called for a complete economic embargo in 1962, prohibiting all trade of goods and services between the U.S. and Cuba and imposing strict travel restrictions. Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terror following its support of Marxist movements during the Cold War. The Obama administration lifted the designation in 2015, along with relaxing some restrictions, including on American travel to the country. The change meant Americans could legally bring home Cuban cigars and rum. It also permitted Cuban pharmaceutical companies to do business in the U.S.  The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Cuba and increased financial and banking restrictions on the country. On Jan. 11, 2021, days before Joe Biden’s presidential inauguration, the Trump administration put Cuba back on the list of state sponsors of terror. Cuba is permitted to trade with many other countries Augusto Maxwell, an attorney at Akerman LLP and chair of their Cuba practice, said the first part of the claim isn’t accurate. Cuba can trade with other countries of its choosing — if those countries are willing as well. Some of Cuba’s trading partners include China, Spain, the Netherlands, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Venezuela was one of Cuba’s key trade partners until its ability diminished amid its own economic turmoil. Cuba’s main exports include rolled tobacco, raw sugar, nickel, liquor and zinc. Top imports include poultry meat, wheat, soybean meal, corn and concentrated milk.  It’s worth noting that the OEC also lists the U.S. as one of the countries that exports goods to Cuba. Poultry counts for 90% of American shipments to the country, according to the Federation of American Scientists. ""It’s really to favor U.S. farmers and agricultural interests. (Cuba) was a very important market for U.S. farmers,"" Gabilondo said. ""So even though the sanctions generally prohibit trade, there are some exceptions."" Maxwell said, despite these trade relationships, the U.S. embargo does have an impact on what goods Cuba receives from other countries. For example, if any trading good contains 10% of U.S. created content, it must go through U.S. law in order to be exported into Cuba.  ""When you think of complicated things like airplanes or oil drilling platforms or scientific or medical equipment, sometimes those things are caught up in that 10%,"" Maxwell said. ""And so U.S. law does not allow that to be exported to Cuba even though 90% or 89% was produced in France or Canada, or something like that."" Maxwell further pointed out that foreign companies that are owned or patrolled by the U.S. might be reluctant to engage in business with Cuba. The Helms-Burton Act allows U.S. nationals to sue entities that do business involving property that was confiscated by the Cuban government. The rule didn’t go into effect until 2019, when the Trump administration gave it the green light. ""Every president since (1996), Clinton, Bush and Obama, had suspended the rule. President Trump enacted it,"" Maxwell said. ""And so in the last two years there’s been about 35-40 lawsuits filed from different folks for allegedly trafficking in Cuban properties.""  Lillian Guerra, professor in Cuban and Caribbean history at the University of Florida, called the claim ""patently false."" She said that things began to change for Cuba when the Soviet Union collapsed. ""One by one, as Cuba adopted the reforms of 1991 and the Latin American dictatorships and right wing regimes fell, the ‘unilateral’ nature of the U.S. embargo that kept them in line and froze Cuba out of direct trade with its barrio, collapsed,"" Guerra told PolitiFact.  Guerra further stated that multiple countries have a company in Cuba, including China, Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy and Canada. A Facebook claim stated that the U.S. embargo on Cuba blocks the country from trading with any country or company whatsoever. Embargo is the official term used by the U.S. government to describe the sanctions on Cuba. An expert pointed out that the term blockade is used by someone who believes the sanctions to be illegal due to its broad reach. Experts and evidence shows that Cuba can and has traded with other countries. While the nuances in the U.S. embargo can make it difficult for foreign companies to trade with the country, there is no evidence that they can’t.

Trump claim about Ariz. mail-ballots is based on misunderstanding of early voting
","Persisting in the quest to dispute his loss in the 2020 presidential election, former President Donald Trump claimed that tens of thousands of mail-in ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., were improperly counted without a record of them having been sent to voters. In a statement on July 15, the day the GOP-controlled Arizona Senate held a hearing on an ongoing partisan audit of the county’s election processes, Trump said:  ""While this, according to the Senate, is preliminary, with results being announced at a later date, it seems that 74,243 Mail-In Ballots were counted with ‘no clear record of them being sent.’"" This and other audit findings, he claimed, showed Biden didn’t win Arizona or other battleground states.  Trump’s claim stems from remarks at the hearing made by Doug Logan, head of Cyber Ninjas, a company that was hired by Arizona Senate Republicans to conduct the audit. Logan was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election that culminated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Cyber Ninjas has no prior experience auditing elections. At the hearing, Logan indicated that a clerical error could explain the 74,243 figure. He said: ""We have 74,243 mail-in ballots where there is no clear record of their being sent. ... That could be something where documentation wasn't done right — there was a clerical issue, there's not proper things there — but I think when we've got 74,000, it merits, you know, knocking on a door and validating some of this information."" Knocking on a door is a reference to the auditors’ suggestion that voters be visited door to door as part of the audit. Logan claimed that what are known as EV32 files are ""supposed to give a record of when a mail-in ballot is sent"" and EV33 files are ""supposed to give a record of when the mail-in ballot is received."" In fact, the two documents aren’t just for mailed ballots, and they capture only a limited time period. The EV32 file includes all requests that voters make for early ballots, either by mail or in person, up to 11 days before Election Day, and the EV33 file includes returned early ballots up to the Monday before Election Day, the Associated Press reported. That means there is a 10-day period between the final day of each report, during which thousands of mail-in votes are submitted and thousands of additional voters go to early-voting centers, request ballots in person and submit them. Furthermore, the files don’t include any early ballots that came in on Election Day. Maricopa County responded to Logan’s claim via Twitter, suggesting that the auditor didn’t understand early voting and used the wrong reports to calculate the number of ballots sent out by mail. Because early voting can be done by mail or in-person, where ballots are provided at the location where voters vote, ""it's not unusual that we would have more early votes than mail-in ballots sent,"" the county said. The county said the two files  ""are not the proper files to refer to for a complete accumulating of all early ballots sent and received."" There’s no evidence that any mail-in ballots were improperly counted. Joe Biden won Arizona by about 10,000 votes, flipping the state after Trump’s win in 2016. Findings of the audit, which began in April, will not affect the  election outcome, because the results were already certified by state officials and accepted by Congress. The state is one battleground where Trump and his allies have spread the baseless allegation that the election was stolen by Democrats. Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, has the most registered voters in the state.  We rated False a claim by Trump, citing the audit, that ""the entire database of Maricopa County"" was deleted.

The county also said auditors used the wrong files in trying to calculate how many early ballots were sent and received.

"['Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Is there 'clear legal authority to handcuff' truant Texas Democrats?
","On Tuesday morning, less than 24-hours after Texas Democratic legislators fled their home state to block passage of a GOP voting rights bill, USA Today reporter Savannah Behrmann caught up with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for his thoughts on the errant lawmakers.   It’s nothing but a political stunt that is doomed to fail, he said. And as soon as they return to the state he expects their immediate arrest, echoing a pledge made earlier this week by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.   ""There is clear legal authority to handcuff and put in leg irons legislators that are trying to stop the Legislature from being able to do business,"" Cruz said in a hallway interview. And that ""clear legal authority"" is explicitly expressed in the state constitution, a fact he learned 18 years ago when state Democrats made their last exodus to thwart a GOP-backed congressional redistricting effort.   In 2003, before Cruz became a national household name, he was appointed to serve as the Texas Solicitor General by then-Attorney General Greg Abbott. That same year, Republicans’ redistricting plans were foiled when at least 50 Democratic state House members broke quorum and fled to Ardmore, Okla., forcing Texas Gov. Rick Perry to call a special session. During that special session, the Republican effort was scuttled again when 11 Democratic state senators made their own quorum-breaking getaway by fleeing to Albuquerque, N.M.  At the time, Speaker of the House Tom Craddick asked Abbott what legal authority the House has to arrest its absent Democratic colleagues. According to Cruz, that question was placed in Cruz's hands.   ""Abbott asked me. I researched it. It turns out the Texas Constitution has a provision that explicitly authorizes fleeing House members to be arrested,"" Cruz recalled Tuesday.  But Cruz’s interpretation of the constitution doesn’t appear to be shared by all.  Article III, Sec. 10 of the state constitution provides little guidance for the situation at hand. In one short paragraph, the document states that the House can ""compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each House may provide.""  That language effectively grants authority over the handling of absent members to the Texas House Rules. Under the House rules, the remaining House members can issue a Motion for Call of the House, which directs the House's sergeant-at-arms to dispatch state police to find and return the missing members to secure a quorum.  ""All absentees for whom no sufficient excuse is made may, by order of a majority of those present, be sent for and arrested, wherever they may be found,"" Rule 5, Sec. 8 of the House rulebook states.   While the language uses the word ""arrest,"" there’s uncertainty about how this term is to be interpreted. Because none of these errant members have committed any crime, and the House cannot issue a criminal warrant for their arrest, they can’t be arrested in a criminal sense.  Although Cruz’s interpretation of the law finds that there is ""clear legal authority"" to handcuff Democratic lawmakers and put them ""in leg irons,"" others treat this as a gray area of the law.  The reason why this question lacks clarity is because this hypothetical set of circumstances has no judicial precedent in Texas, said Randall Erben, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas School of Law and former legislative director to Abbott. There has been no judicial interpretation of enforcement of Rule 5, Sec. 8 of the House rulebook, and thus no existing authority on the matter in Texas. ""I'm not going to argue with the junior senator about this, but what I'm saying is there's no precedent anywhere for any of this,"" Erben said. ""He may have found some authority someplace from somewhere, but it's not going to be relevant or on point to the interpretation by a court of competent jurisdiction, which under the Constitution is the only authority that anybody has to do this."" Cruz's office, which responded to questions after this article was first published, argued that the ""clear legal authority"" stems from the U.S. Constitution, which has a similar provision regarding absent lawmakers. Cruz spokesman Steve Guest points to a 1988 case in which an Oregon senator was brought into the senate chamber by police feet-first against his will.  Because there is no material difference between the language used in the U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution regarding absent lawmakers, Cruz's office argues that the 1988 case shows the extent to which officers can use force in returning lawmakers.  ""Pretending that the law doesn’t clearly allow for the arrest and potential physical compulsion of delinquent legislators is patently absurd,"" Guest said. Erben, however, said that the ultimate authority here rests in the Texas courts.   ""We’re in Texas. The only authority that’s relevant as far as a judicial review would be the Texas courts, and Texas courts have never ruled on anything about the enforcement of any House rule provision,"" Erben said.  The only time in Texas history where a lawmaker came close to facing arrest for absenteeism was in 1979. During that legislative session, an alliance of liberal senators known as the Killer Bees broke quorum for several days and evaded police by bunkering in an Austin garage. After several days, one senator, Gene Jones, left the garage to visit his granddaughter in Houston, prompting state police to search for him at his Houston home.   ""Photo in hand, they knocked on his door,"" recalled then-Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby. ""A man who looked a lot like the picture opened the door. The ranger asked him if he was Jones. He said, yes. They arrested him and took him to Austin. He was Jones all right, but not Gene Jones. They had arrested Gene’s brother, Clayton. When the knock came at the door, the senator had jumped over the back fence and stayed lost for another day.""  According to Sandra Thompson, a University of Houston law professor and director of the Criminal Justice Institute, the word ""arrest"" in the context of the House rules doesn’t grant officers an automatic right to use restraints or unreasonable levels of force. The use of restrains could only be used if a lawmaker posed a danger to public safety or to an officer’s safety.  ""In a situation like this, they don't even have a warrant for a criminal arrest,"" Thompson said. ""I think we really need to be thinking about this more in terms of an escort than trying to analogize it as a criminal situation.""  Both Thompson and Erben agree that absent legislators can be ordered to return to the House floor, but it’s not clear what would happen if that legislator refused compliance. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to questions asking for the agency’s interpretation of the law.  ""It's at the extreme edge of parliamentary procedures,"" Thompson said. ""I don't imagine that there would be a situation where a legislator would forcibly resist. That could present a really sticky issue.""  ""Under the authority of the rules of the House, they can be made to come back into the chamber,"" Erben said. ""Now how that happens is up to every individual circumstance, every individual legislature, and every individual law enforcement officer if it comes to that.""  Cruz said that there is ""clear legal authority to handcuff and put in leg irons legislators"" who break quorum. The Texas House Rules states that absent lawmakers can ""be sent for and arrested, wherever they may be found."" But, because absent lawmakers aren’t charged with a crime, it’s unclear how the use of the word ""arrest"" should be interpreted in this context. This is because no Texas court has reviewed how this provision is to be enforced. Thus, there is no legal clarity.  We rate this claim False.

No, UC San Francisco Is Not ‘Harvesting’ The Genitalia Of ‘Murdered Babies’
","Anti-abortion activists in San Francisco protested this week after Live Action, an anti-abortion nonprofit organization, released emails that they claim show researchers at University of California, San Francisco ""harvesting the clitorises, testicles and penises of murdered babies."" The emails were publicized in a Facebook post on the group’s page and an accompanying article on the organization’s website. In the Facebook post, which was published on July 6 and shared more than 500 times, the group wrote that ""it’s time to outlaw abortion and criminally prosecute those who abuse the bodies of children.""  The claims do not accurately represent how UCSF obtains and uses fetal tissue. But that did not stop activists from gathering at the San Francisco Department of Public Health on July 14. The protest was livestreamed on Live Action’s Facebook page, racking up 35,000 views. Holding signs that read ""end live dismemberment"" and ""human rights begin in the womb,"" activists chanted ""do no harm"" and ""UCSF, we know what you do."" Facebook flagged the posts as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we decided to break down the claims. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) The emails Pro-Life San Francisco, an organization affiliated with Live Action, said it obtained emails between UCSF employees through the California Public Records Act, which requires government entities, including public universities, to make certain documents and records available to members of the public upon request. The emails appear to log the collection of fetal tissue, a standard practice in biomedical research. They list what type of fetal tissue was collected and the time and date. Genitalia are among the types of fetal tissue listed in the emails. In one email, a UCSF employee states that they collected tissue from three different fetuses: a ""testis [and] bladder,"" a ""penis [and] bladder"" and a ""clitoris, bladder [and] uterus."" Acquiring fetal tissue UCSF does conduct biomedical research using fetal tissue and has done so for decades — but the claim that they obtain it from murdered babies greatly distorts the truth and is not correct. In a statement to PolitiFact, UCSF officials said the tissue used for research comes from donations, which can happen after a woman miscarries, chooses to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons or chooses to have an elective abortion. The officials asked not to be named because of safety concerns. ""Only tissue that has been donated may be used in research,"" officials said. ""Many women who choose to terminate or experience the loss of a pregnancy specifically ask whether they can make these donations."" When fetal tissue is donated to research as the result of an elective abortion, officials said donations are made with written consent from women after they have ""independently"" decided to terminate their pregnancy. ""The [Live Action] article inaccurately implies throughout, through words such as ‘procure’ and ‘harvest,’ that these abortions are being performed in order to obtain tissue, which is false,"" officials said. Live Actions’ article also claims that ""the labor induction abortion techniques used in these facilities to procure ‘fresh’ parts can result in live births as often as 50% of the time."" To support this claim, the article cites a study published in 2011 on abortion in the second trimester. That study applies only to medical abortions induced with misoprostol, a drug that causes the uterus to cramp and expel a fetus. Medical abortions make up more than a third of all abortions at over 8 weeks gestation in the United States. Typically, women are first given mifepristone, a drug that stops the absorption of progesterone in the womb, which fetuses need to survive. The study states that ""survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50%."" It cites research from 2002 on using misoprostol to facilitate mid-trimester abortions to support the claim. In that study, women were given just misoprostol, without taking mifepristone beforehand.  The scientists behind that research note in the study that ""live birth is a potential complication of any mid-trimester medical induction,"" but that their research is ""limited"" by the study’s sample size, since 47 women participated and just 23 of them were treated with misoprostol. The end of the article encourages further research. UCSF offers medical abortions, among other reproductive health services, at a clinic called the Women’s Options Center. Healthcare workers at the clinic use both mifepristone and misoprostol, and UCSF officials said there has never been a live birth during an abortion procedure. Why collect genitalia? Fetal tissue is used for many different types of research that helps advance scientific understanding of fetal development and can lead to new drugs and cures for a variety of conditions. By examining and conducting research with fetal tissue, researchers at UCSF have been able to further understand how the urinary tract develops in men and women, how genital malformations occur and the impact of fetal environment on the development of male and female reproductive organs. ""Tissues that have been donated to research after a miscarriage or abortion can offer significant insights that researchers would not otherwise be able to learn and translate into treatments for a range of diseases and illnesses,"" officials said. For many years, researchers at UCSF also used fetal tissue to study HIV and test new drugs that could help treat the disease. That research was supported with money from the National Institutes of Health, funding which was halted in 2019 after President Donald Trump’s administration announced new restrictions on government dollars going to research involving human fetal tissue. UCSF officials said research with fetal tissue is conducted ""in full compliance with federal and state law, and within the ethical standards established by preeminent scientific societies and professional research associations."" Our rating Live Action’s posts claimed that UCSF is ""harvesting the clitorises, testicles and penises of murdered babies."" The emails Live Action cites are real and it is true that UCSF conducts biomedical research using human fetal tissue, including fetal tissue from the genitals. However, the social media posts suggest that UCSF is purposefully killing children to obtain this tissue, which is wildly misleading and inaccurate. The tissue used by UCSF scientists is donated by women who have miscarried, have terminated their pregnancies for medical reasons or have elected to have an abortion. In the case of elective abortions, women are only offered the option of donating fetal tissue after they have independently made the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Furthermore, in an article posted to Live Action’s website that accompanied their initial social media post, the group claims that abortion techniques used to obtain fetal tissue often result in live births, suggesting that healthcare workers obtain fetal tissue from live fetuses. Athough the group cites a scientific study to back up their claim, the study pertains only to abortions facilitated solely with misoprostol, a drug that causes the uterus to cramp and expel a fetus. At UCSF’s clinics, medical abortions are conducted using mifepristone, a feticidal drug, before misoprostol is administered to finish the abortion process. UCSF officials said there has never been a live birth during an abortion procedure at any of their clinics. UCSF’s biomedical research and acquisition of fetal tissue is legal and adheres to ethical guidelines. It is clear that Live Action’s posts take the university’s emails out of context and disregard the facts. Therefore, we rate this post False.

","In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 was coursing through the United States and the world, hydroxychloroquine became a household word as President Donald Trump touted the antimalaria drug for coronavirus patients and experts debated its efficacy. By summer, the Food and Drug Administration had revoked its authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients and warned of serious health and safety issues. But interest in hydroxychloroquine persists. A study published in May — on a ""preprint"" website that publishes studies that have not been fully vetted — said hydroxychloroquine boosts survival in coronavirus patients. Trump has since claimed he was right all along about the drug, a claim we found questionable. In a viral Facebook post, social media users claimed that two headlines on stories by the same author show CNN published contradictory reports about hydroxychloroquine in April and June 2020. The post, which juxtaposes images of the two headlines, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The April headline said President Trump was ""wrong in so many ways"" about hydroxychloroquine, while the July headline said a study found that the drug ""helped coronavirus patients survive better."" The conflicting tone, the post author argues in the accompanying caption, represents a ""lie"" by the media meant to impugn Trump. The stories, though, did not contain conflicting information.  The April story addressed four specific claims Trump had made about hydroxychloroquine: when information would be available about whether the drug works against coronavirus; whether a French study of the drug was reputable; whether some people had tried to delay the trials of hydroxychloroquine; and whether the drug was safe for coronavirus patients.  The July story was about a different issue: the findings of a study by the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan about the survival rate for hospitalized patients who had been given hydroxychloroquine.     The only overlap between the two stories was the question of whether the drug is safe for coronavirus patients. The April story said that Trump called it safe, but that doctors said ""the drug can have serious side effects."" The July story said the Henry Ford study showed that hydroxychloroquine improved survival in hospitalized coronavirus patients, but it also detailed other researchers' skepticism about how the study was conducted.   For the July story, early versions of the headline matched the image in the Facebook post and said, ""Study finds hydroxychloroquine helped coronavirus patients survive better,"" according to our analysis of the CNN webpage through the Wayback Machine, an internet archive service. But later versions of the story had a longer headline that more clearly described the limitations of the study findings: ""Study finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts.""  A year after the two CNN stories were published, hydroxychloroquine remains unproven as a treatment for coronavirus. A National Institutes of Health study published in November 2020, based on a randomized controlled trial — the highest standard of evidence — concluded that compared with a placebo, hydroxychloroquine provides no benefit to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Social media users claimed in a Facebook post that the headlines on two stories by the same author show CNN published contradictory reports about hydroxychloroquine in 2020.  The April headline said President Trump was ""wrong in so many ways"" about hydroxychloroquine, while the July headline said a study found that the drug ""helped coronavirus patients survive better.""  But the stories did not contain conflicting information. The April story covered four specific claims by President Trump about hydroxychloroquine, and the July story was a report on study findings about the drug.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/15/facebook-posts/headlines-show-cnn-published-contradictory-reports/

Biden seeking to ‘infiltrate’ private text messages? That’s False
","In a video conversation between two women who call themselves ""Chicks on the Right,"" one claims that under President Joe Biden, the government will intercept and flag private text messages, also known as SMS (short message service). A clip of the video posted on Facebook starts midstream with the woman referring to a ""ridiculous story about how Biden wants to work with SMS companies to try to combat vaccine misinformation in texts. So, in other words, you and I are exchanging texts with one another — private messages between us. Somehow, the government will be infiltrating those.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is a  distortion of a news story that reported on efforts by Biden allies to alert wireless providers to possible misinformation distributed through mass text messages.  Politico published a July 12 story about the Biden administration’s efforts to more aggressively fight what it perceives to be misinformation from Republican lawmakers and conservative activists about the administration’s efforts to promote COVID-19 vaccinations. The story also said this about mobile phone text messages: ""Biden allied groups, including the Democratic National Committee, are also planning to engage fact-checkers more aggressively and work with SMS carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over social media and text messages. The goal is to ensure that people who may have difficulty getting a vaccination because of issues like transportation see those barriers lessened or removed entirely."" The story, which did not elaborate on that point, triggered a number of misleading claims by lawmakers and others. We asked the White House what plans the administration has to work with wireless carriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that is sent over text messages, and whether it supports such efforts by groups like the Democratic National Committee. White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz referred our questions to the DNC. The DNC told PolitiFact it is contacting carriers about texts sent en masse that ""spread scams and disinformation."" DNC spokesman Lucas Acosta said the DNC ""has no ability to access or read people’s private text messages, and we are not working with any government agency, including the White House,  to try to see personal text messages. ""However, when the DNC's counter-disinformation program receives complaints or reports of fraudulent broadcast SMSs that we believe violate the text aggregators’ terms of service, we notify the broadcast text platform,"" Acosta added.  CTIA, a trade group representing the wireless communications industry, said in a statement: ""Wireless carriers do not read or moderate the content of text messages that their customers send to each other, nor are carriers working with third parties to do so."" A video on Facebook claimed that ""the government will be infiltrating"" personal text messages. The Democratic National Committee, not the government, said it is contacting wireless carriers about texts sent en masse that ""spread scams and disinformation.""  There is no evidence that the Biden administration aims to intercept private texts.

Kamala Harris exaggerates food and water laws for voters
","Vice President Kamala Harris said that state lawmakers have proposed hundreds of laws that will suppress or make it difficult for people to vote, and that one way state lawmakers have sought to curtail access to the ballot is to cut off food or water to voters in line. ""They are punishing people for standing in line to vote,"" Harris told Soledad O’Brien during an interview on BET. ""They are saying ‘Well, if you are going to be standing in that line for all those hours, you can’t have any water or any food.’""  A White House spokesperson said Harris was referring to a bill that passed in Georgia earlier this year, a restriction passed a few years ago in Montana and a proposed bill in Florida. We found that Harris’s comments have some basis in fact, but she also exaggerates how restrictive some of the laws are. Nationwide, we found laws that expressly ban distributing food and water to voters are scarce. And of course, voters are always free to bring their own food or water. Giveaways of food and water to voters waiting in line are fairly common where allowed, though. Voting rights advocates have long organized efforts to give away bottles of water or food near polling sites where residents wait in line for hours to vote, especially in Black-majority neighborhoods. Activists call this ""line warming"" and say that it helps voters withstand the wait to cast a ballot, sometimes in hot weather or during lunch or dinner time.  But states also commonly ban bribing voters or ban electioneering within a certain distance of polling places, to prevent undue influence on voters. States routinely set up perimeters at polling sites to allow voters to stand in line to vote without campaign workers handing them literature on behalf of candidates. The most restrictive law we could find about food and water for voters is in Georgia. The state passed a law in 2021 that says, in part, no one shall give ""any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink"" within 25 feet of voters standing in line. Violations of this law are a misdemeanor and punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The bill also states that poll workers can make available ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."" But nothing in the law requires poll workers to make water easily available to voters in line. A previous state law already made it a felony to give gifts ""for the purpose of registering as a voter, voting, or voting for a particular candidate."" That provision doesn’t mention food or water specifically, but in 2020 Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger interpreted it to include food or water.  Laws in Montana, New York and Florida are not as stringent as Georgia Montana’s 2015 law, signed by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock,  bans candidates and individuals working on their behalf from distributing food or drinks to voters at or near a polling place. A Montana court used an earlier statute to remove a sheriff from office following the 1938 election because he handed out ""large quantities of beer, by the bottle and by the keg.""  The White House pointed to a proposed bill in Florida that initially banned giving ""any item"" to voters. But the law that ultimately passed instead expands the pre-existing solicitation ban to include zones around dropboxes and ""engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter."" While that law doesn’t mention food or water, critics of the law fear it could be interpreted that way. We found that New York’s law bans giving ""meat, drink, tobacco, refreshment or provision"" to voters unless it has a value of less than $1 and is given without any identification of the person or group supplying it. The law has been on the books for decades, with the $1 cap being added in 1992. New York’s law would allow someone to buy bottles of water or cheap snacks in bulk and hand them out anonymously to voters. Georgia’s law makes no such exceptions. It is possible for a court to interpret an electioneering ban to include food handouts to voters at the polls, but it doesn’t happen often. Snopes found that the Supreme Court of Kentucky in 1997 ruled that an alderman running for election wrongly handed out food at voting precincts that was intended for poll workers, although the alderman acknowledged that anyone at the sites could take the food. The court ruled that the candidate handing out free boxes of chicken while speaking to voters amounted to electioneering near the building.  Harris said new or proposed state laws on voting mean ""if you are going to be standing in that line for hours, you can’t have any water or any food.""  This is an exaggeration. People voting in line can still eat or drink. In some places, they may have to bring their own food and water.  What Harris is talking about are laws aimed at stopping organized food and water giveaways. Georgia passed a law this year that bans handing out food and water to voters in line. Montana passed a law in 2015 that bans candidates or people on their behalf from distributing food and water to voters in line. A law that passed in Florida this year bans engaging in any activity to influence a voter, but it doesn’t specifically mention handing out food or water. It’s important to note that these laws are rare. And, they don’t literally ban eating or drinking in line; rather, they ban organized giveaways that violate anti-electioneering rules spelled out in state law. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Instagram post misleads on door-to-door COVID-19 vaccination efforts
","With U.S. vaccination rates stalling, President Joe Biden announced a new wave of efforts to reach unvaccinated Americans, including sending people door to door to talk about the vaccine. ""Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,"" Biden said during a July 6 speech at the White House. Though the White House said the push for a door-to-door vaccination campaign has been ongoing since April, Biden’s remarks sparked criticism from some such as Republican Missouri Gov. Henry McMaster, who characterized the effort as ""enticing, coercing, intimidating, mandating, or pressuring"" people to take the vaccine. A similar sentiment appeared on social media: ""The same people that called President Trump a ‘fascist’ are now sending federal agents door-to-door coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs,"" read the text in a July 10 Instagram post that we also found widely shared on Facebook. This is misleading — and these posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, there’s no evidence that the door-to-door effort involves coercion — the use of force or threats to persuade the unwilling — to get people vaccinated. Second, the White House says the program does not involve federal employees or government members.  Third, while COVID-19 vaccines are being used in the U.S. under emergency authorization, calling them ""experimental"" ignores the fact that they have been fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. They have been found to be safe, effective and potentially life-saving, keeping people from getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. We rated a similar claim calling the vaccines ""experimental"" Mostly False. Biden’s Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a press briefing that the people knocking on doors aren’t federal employees or members of the government. ""They are volunteers. They are clergy. They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking."" The door-to-door campaigns have been organized mostly at the local level and are in the vein of other on-the-ground efforts that have been a staple of public health outreach for years. Cities like Detroit, Washington, Milwaukee and Chicago all run programs that send people door to door to help inform unvaccinated people about the COVID-19 vaccines. There is also no evidence that these efforts involve ""coercion."" In Louisiana, for example, where such an effort has been underway for months, health officials say canvassers are given ""motivational interviewing"" training which starts an open dialogue with residents about their thoughts around COVID-19 vaccines. ""The decision to be vaccinated is a personal one, and the canvassers provide educational information,"" said Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for Louisiana’s Department of Health. If a resident is not interested in receiving vaccine information, ""the canvasser offers materials that the resident can review on their own and then moves on to the next house,"" Litten said. In North Carolina’s Mecklenburg County, health officials recently started sending out a health department vehicle staffed by medical professionals who can provide on-site vaccinations if people want them. This ""doses to the door"" program followed weeks of door knocking to sign people up, especially in neighborhoods with lower vaccination rates that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. ""It’s not confrontational,"" said community organizer Robert Dawkins in an interview with WCNC in Charlotte. ""It's not like you've got to get the shot, but it’s our job to dispel those rumors."" Dawkins leads Action NC, one of the organizing groups involved in that canvassing effort. He said the complication with door-to-door outreach has been follow-up, so the addition of the mobile unit is helpful. ""We get people that will say ‘Yes I’ll get the shot,’ but the follow-up has always been the issue. Will they go? How can we get people to go out and go?"" According to Psaki, the Biden administration has funded door-knocking programs like this since April, and this is just one tactic that's been used to increase vaccination rates in June. She said the results have been measurable. ""Alabama: The adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9%; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June,"" Psaki said, with the adult vaccination rate increasing by 4.4% in Florida and 3.5% in Georgia. ""In our view, this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community,"" Psaki said. The term ""experimental"" is often used by vaccine skeptics. But, as we have reported before, the phrase is subjective and ignores the amount of research that is required before the vaccines are authorized for distribution. Researchers have been studying and working with the mRNA technology that is at work in the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech shots dating back to the 1990s. The viral vector platform used in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for use for other health emergencies such as Ebola. The mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines ""are a new type of vaccine, but are not unknown,"" a spokesperson with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The mRNA vaccines work by teaching cells how to make a protein, or just a piece of a protein, which triggers the body to produce antibodies that prevent infection. Viral vector vaccines such as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, were created in the 1970s. They use a modified, but harmless version of a different virus, called a vector, to make the body produce antibodies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for all three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the United States. The vaccines are pending full approval by the FDA, but they have been found safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. Before they were authorized for emergency use, COVID-19 vaccines were subjected to clinical trials conducted with tens of thousands of participants to collect scientific data. After three trial phases with varying levels of complexity, the FDA determined that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccines. An Instagram post claimed that federal agents were going door-to-door ""coercing people to be injected with experimental drugs."" Door-to-door canvassing efforts to get people vaccinated have been underway at the local level for months, as part of a push to increase vaccination rates. But the people involved are not federal employees or government members, according to the White House. They have been community organizers and volunteers. Some communities have augmented the effort with on-site mobile vaccination clinics for those who want the shot. But there is no indication that the door-to-door tactics involve coercion — the use of force or threats to compel someone to do something they are unwilling to do. What’s more, the COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. are not ""experimental drugs."" They were subjected to clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people before being given emergency use authorization.

But skepticism is rampant on social media. Carbon dioxide ""is not a problem,"" reads one post widely shared on Facebook.

The statement is ""flat-out wrong,"" said Ralph Keeling, director of the carbon dioxide monitoring program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. Because of human activities, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have reached record highs. In May 2020, the average was just over 417 parts per million, which was the highest monthly average value ever recorded.  ""The fact that CO2 has built up at all tells us that plants and the oceans can't absorb our fossil-fuel waste fast enough,"" Keeling said.   Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which means it traps heat in the atmosphere. It occurs naturally and also is produced by human activities such as burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. It is ""the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities,"" according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere remained constant for more than 10,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, according to Scripps. Since 1958, though, carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere have closely tracked with increases in burning of fossil fuels.  When fossil fuels are burned, about 50% of the carbon dioxide that’s released remains in the atmosphere; 25% is absorbed by land, plants and trees; and 25% is absorbed by oceans.  Oceans have been absorbing increased amounts of CO2, but not without repercussions. The acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution began more than 200 years ago. The change can affect sea life, including creatures like oysters and corals that need certain chemical conditions to grow tough shells and skeletons. Some studies have also indicated that land ecosystems might be becoming less efficient at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, in part because global warming makes land drier and deprives it of nutrients.  ""CO2 is a problem because it's building up and it impacts climate,"" Keeling said.

North Carolina Lt. Governor wrong about HIPAA
","North Carolina’s lieutenant governor is speaking out against the federal government’s effort to promote COVID-19 vaccines. After Joe Biden’s administration fell short of its goal to vaccinate 70% of Americans by July Fourth, the President announced plans to send advocates ""door-to-door"" in certain communities. Some Republicans are pushing back on the door-knocking idea, with North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson saying it’s an invasion of privacy. ""There have been many reports of officials making door-to-door visits to encourage people to get vaccinated. I still contest that those who wish to be vaccinated should have every opportunity to be,"" Robinson said in a July 9 Facebook post. ""However, showing up at the front doors of people’s houses and violating HIPAA laws by requesting private medical information regarding their vaccination status is unacceptable and illegal. We must allow citizens to make decisions of their own free will, and not coerce them into getting the vaccine,"" he said. Is Robinson right? Is it against the law for officials to ask about someone’s vaccination status? First, it’s worth noting that the people going door-to-door are not federal government employees. ""They are not members of the government. They are not federal government employees. They are volunteers. They are clergy. They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a July 8 press briefing. And no, experts say they would not be breaking HIPAA laws by asking about someone’s vaccination status. HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and critics of masks and vaccinations have argued it protects them from questions about their healthcare decisions. However, multiple experts have told PolitiFact and other fact checkers that those critics misunderstand the law. The law’s ""Privacy Rule"" established a set of national standards to address how health care providers, insurers and other entities use and share people’s health information. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the law is designed to prevent those companies and groups from disclosing a patient’s private health information without that person’s permission. PolitiFact previously reported that HIPAA does not prevent businesses from asking if a customer is vaccinated. PolitiFact North Carolina asked experts if a government volunteer would violate the law if they were ""requesting private medical information,"" as feared by Robinson. They all said no. Jodi Daniel, a partner in Crowell & Moring's Health Care Group in Washington, D.C., helped draft the first iteration of HIPAA. She says the HIPAA privacy rules only apply to certain types of entities.  ""These entities are most healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses,"" Daniel wrote in an email to PolitiFact NC.""HIPAA addresses what an entity that holds individually identifiable health information can and cannot do with that information. There is nothing in HIPAA that prohibits the requesting of health information from an individual."" Kirk Nahra, a partner with WilmerHale in Washington, D.C., and an expert in privacy law, wrote about HIPAA last month for the International Association of Privacy Professionals. He responded to Robinson’s claim in an email to PolitiFact NC. ""If the mayor’s office, or the governor’s office, or the president’s office sends people out to ask, there is no possible HIPAA violation,"" Nahra said. ""The HIPAA rules – even where they would apply – would restrict the doctor from disclosing your medical data, but doesn’t by itself prohibit anyone from asking you for information."" Lawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, also saw no truth to Robinson’s claim. ""First, the person ‘knocking the door’ isn't a health care provider who has access to your records,"" Gostin told PolitiFact NC in an email. ""Second, the individual (who is answering the door) has a choice whether to disclose his or her vaccination status. Thus, it is entirely wrong to suggest any violation of privacy."" We specifically asked: Is there any scenario where a government representative would violate the law by requesting – but not demanding — health information? Thomas Miller, senior fellow studying healthcare at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said no. He noted that the federal government already has ""broader public health protection powers (and emergency powers) that extend beyond the limits of HIPAA on ‘covered entities.’""  ""It further can take reasonable steps to protect the rest of the public from public health risks posed by others. But it cannot make someone answer if they chose not to do so (although there may be some related consequential responses),"" Miller wrote in an email to PolitiFact NC. ""Hypothetically, a federal government agency still ‘could’ do something else incredibly stupid and actionable, but there’s no sign of that happening thus far and no reasonable future likelihood of the imaginary becoming real. We have more serious issues to address well before engaging in that sort of idle speculation.""  We emailed Robinson’s staff about his Facebook post, but never received a response. Robinson said it would be ""illegal"" for government officials to show up at peoples’ doors ""requesting private medical information."" An academic, a privacy law attorney, a former government employee who helped draft HIPAA, and a policy expert at a right-leaning think tank say Robinson’s claim is inaccurate.  It is not a HIPAA violation to ask someone if they’re vaccinated.

The other co-conservator was lawyer Andrew Wallet. 2016: Spears said she wanted the conservatorship ended as soon as possible, saying it had too much control, according to a June 2021 report by the New York Times, citing confidential court papers.  2019: Spears said in court she felt forced by the conservatorship into a stay at a mental health facility and to perform against her will, according to the Times.  August 2020: Spears filed court papers opposing an extension of her father remaining her conservator, but a court approved the extension until at least February 2021. November 2020: A judge appointed the Bessemer Trust wealth management company to co-manage the financial aspects of the conservatorship with Jamie Spears. Feb. 11, 2021: On the same date as the Facebook post, a judge continued the split-powers arrangement, overruling Jamie Spears’ objections to Bessemer Trust being appointed. It was a victory for Britney Spears in that her father did not regain full control of her finances. But the conservatorship remained in place, Jamie Spears still co-manages her finances and he remains in charge of other affairs.  June 2021: Spears told the court the conservatorship was abusive and asked for it to be ended, saying she felt she had been forced to perform, was given no privacy and was made to use birth control, take medication and attend therapy sessions against her will. A judge refused to remove Jamie Spears as conservator. July 14, 2021: An afternoon court hearing is scheduled. A judge is expected to consider Spears’ request to select her own attorney.

Mastriano, a Republican, was inspired by his trip to Maricopa County, Ariz., where the state led a partisan review on the 2020 election in April. Mastriano is exploring whether a privately funded audit is permissible under Pennsylvania law. But not even Mastriano is calling his effort a full audit. On July 7, Mastriano issued letters to Philadelphia, York and Tioga counties requesting a ""forensic investigation"" and threatening to subpoena counties that do not comply with his request by July 31. City officials at Philadelphia and York told PolitiFact they have received his letter but have yet to respond to it.  In a statement July 7, the Pennsylvania Department of State said similar attempts to revisit the election results in Arizona and Fulton County, Pa., ""turned up absolutely no evidence of any fraud or discrepancies."" The statement encouraged Pennsylvania counties to refuse Mastriano’s request. ""Pennsylvania counties, despite a convergence of difficult circumstances, ran a free, fair and accurate election in 2020,"" the department said. The election results were thoroughly reviewed. Pennsylvania conducted ""risk-limiting"" audits in 63 out 67 counties, including the counties that Mastriano contacted. These audits examine a random sample of paper ballots and compare them to the total reported by the vote-counting machine. Back in February, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said these kinds of audits provide ""additional confidence in the accuracy of election outcomes, further strengthen our ability to withstand an attack on our electoral system, and confirm that the outcome of an election is accurate.""  The results show that Biden won Pennsylvania by 81,000 votes, or about 1%. The initial count of in-person, Election Day votes showed Trump with an early lead in the state. However, Biden won more than three-quarters of Pennsylvania’s mail-in ballots, helping him capture the state’s 20 electoral votes.  The Facebook post said that Pennsylvania has started a full audit of the 2020 election results.  This is inaccurate.  A senator made headlines for his so-far unsuccessful efforts to persuade a few counties to conduct forensic investigations of their results. So far, no counties have accepted the challenge, because the election results have been affirmed by audits already.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/14/facebook-posts/social-media-post-falsely-states-pennsylvania-has-/
