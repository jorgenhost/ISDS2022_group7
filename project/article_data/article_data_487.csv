Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder shifts position on Gov. John Kasich’s plan to tax drillers
","
A signature part of Gov. John Kasich's budget proposal is the reduction in the state's income tax that he has long promised. 
To help pay for it, Kasich proposes to increase severance taxes on oil and gas drillers. The proposed changes target larger drilling companies and are meant to allow Ohio to share in the wealth from horizontal drilling in the Utica Shale formation. 
Kasich first proposed the plan in 2012. GOP legislative leaders refused to consider raising taxes on the oil and gas industry, however, which led Kasich to say Republican lawmakers had been influenced by ""special interests"" -- meaning the lobbies associated with the oil and gas industry. 
That was one year ago. At that time, Mike Dittoe, a spokesman for House Speaker William G. Batchelder, said that removing the tax plan from Kasich's midterm budget review did not mean the issue was rejected or dead. Dittoe said GOP members of the House only wanted more time to study the issue. 
By last December -- when Kasich held his annual year-end review at the Statehouse, with Batchelder seated beside him -- it appeared that the issue was near resolution. 
Though Batchelder's chamber had refused to take up the tax proposal in 2012, the Medina Republican predicted it would win approval this year. 
""I don’t think there’s any question we ultimately will support it,"" he said. 
Then came this month’s three-day winter meeting of the powerful Ohio Oil and Gas Association, where Batchelder spoke out against Kasich’s tax plan and called it ""nonsense."" 
""Let me just say to you,"" the Coshocton Tribune reported him saying, ""that, as long as I’m there, we’re not going to be doing the kinds of things to damage an industry that are among the proposals that have been made."" 
Batchelder confirmed to the newspaper after the event ended that he will not support Kasich’s tax plan, calling it ""a big mistake,"" and saying lawmakers would have to find another way to achieve Kasich’s stated goal of slashing income taxes for small-business owners by 50 percent and for all individuals by 20 percent. 
""I don’t know that that’s the only thing that can lead to an income tax cut,"" he said. 
Had Batchelder's position changed? What was it? PolitiFact Ohio asked Mike Dittoe. 
""No, the Speaker’s stance has not changed on the issue of the severance tax,"" the spokesman responded in an email similar to one reported in the publication Columbus Business First. 
""Speaker Batchelder has voiced his reservations about the severance tax for months, dating back to 2011 and 2012 … He has always maintained a commitment publicly and privately to Gov. Kasich to closely examine the severance tax and all other proposed tax reform issues contained within the state budget and beyond. 
""When the Speaker indicated the severance tax would be accomplished in December,"" Dittoe continued, ""he said that in the context, as he has previously, of an overall conversation about tax reform in Ohio. Since early February, the Speaker and members of the House have had some time to review the proposed severance tax language as provided by the Governor – the majority caucus still has reservations on this proposed language … 
""The Speaker has always maintained that the targeting one specific industry for tax revenue is problematic and he wants to work with the business community in the hopes that they will coalesce around an overall tax reform proposal, which would be far more acceptable. The Speaker made a commitment to work with the Governor to accomplish a severance tax proposal last year, but still has concerns on this severance tax language proposed."" 
Dittoe also noted that ""we are very early in the ball game"" -- meaning less than three months into a two-year General Assembly -- and ""final determinations on any component of the budget have not yet been made."" 
Batchelder ""never set a timetable to accomplish the severance tax issue, only voiced concerns about the proposal before us,"" Dittoe said. ""It is certainly possible that other proposed language will be something that the legislature will agree upon in the near future, inside or outside of the budget."" 
PolitiFact agrees it is still early in the 130th General Assembly. Proposals will change, positions will be modified and alliances will shift. 
The effect of Batchelder’s position on Kasich’s oil and gas tax may not have changed over the past year, but his tone and words about it have shifted several times. He may have the matter under judicious consideration, as Dittoe indicated, but the direction in which he is leaning and his level of certainty have changed significantly with his audience and circumstances.

Sean Duffy: Uncle Sam pays for cell phones, pottery classes in Morocco and watermelon queen's travel
","To hear U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., you’d think the former lumberjack and reality TV star might like to take a chainsaw to government spending and, um, bring it into the ""real world.""   Indeed, the one-time county prosecutor came ready with what he considered to be evidence of waste when he appeared on the March 10, 2013, edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee.     Noting U.S. unemployment was edging down, Gousha asked:     ""Don’t you, your party, the president, don’t all of you in Washington feel under pressure to make sure that government doesn’t muck up what appears to be a rebounding economy?""     Duffy acknowledged the improving jobs picture, then said:     ""We’re going in the right direction; that’s positive. But to think that you can’t cut -- we spend $2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes; we pay for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama. There are -- story after story about wasteful spending in government. Let’s cut that.""     (Duffy made the same multi-part claim two weeks earlier in emotional statements to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke during a congressional committee meeting. In that exchange, Duffy also said the government spent $700 billion to see how long shrimps can run on a treadmill. His staff later told a reporter he meant to say $700,000.)     So, federal funds for free cells, pottery classes and a watermelon queen?     Let’s check this out.     For each of the three parts of Duffy’s claim, we’ll look at evidence provided by Duffy’s staff and information we collected ourselves. Duffy relied in part on ""Wastebook 2012,"" which is produced by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.     1. Cell phones     To back his claim that the federal government spent $2.2 billion on ""free cell phones,"" Duffy cited a February 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal and a 2012 Federal Communications Commission report.     The Journal revealed that the government spent $2.2 billion in 2012 on phone subsidies for the poor, but that more than 2 million people served by the Lifeline program hadn’t proved they were eligible.     Lifeline, which is funded by fees paid by all cell and landline customers, is available to low-income people, including those on Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance.     Wireless carriers often offer free phones to Lifeline customers, the FCC report says.     PolitiFact National in 2012 and PolitiFact Texas in 2013 examined similar claims about free cell phones -- although those claims, unlike Duffy’s, tied the program directly to Obama.     Lifeline started in 1985 to subsidize home phone service; cell service was added in 2008 under President George W. Bush. Subsidies for cell service now make up 75 percent of the program.     Lifeline doesn’t actually give away phones, but rather pays an average of $9.25 (the subsidy varies by state) to a user’s phone company toward monthly home or cell service.     However, many people end up with a free phone from a cellular carrier if they sign up for cell service with Lifeline. Assurance Wireless, for example, advertises a variety of Lifeline plans, as well as a free phone. Both the Coburn report and the FCC report also note that, to attract Lifeline customers, many carriers offer free phones.     So, most but not all of the $2.2 billion in the Lifeline program subsidizes cellular bills. And, although the program itself doesn’t give away phones, it’s common for customers to end up with a free phone as a result of Lifeline.     2. Pottery classes   Duffy cited a December 2011 federal audit to support his statement that the United States  spends ""$27 million on Moroccan pottery classes"" (a claim that’s also been made by conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly).     The audit evaluated a $27 million project of the U.S. Agency for International Development that was begun in 2009 ""to provide technical assistance to improve Morocco’s economic enabling environment by improving the business climate, using water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthening workforce development.""     So, the program is broader than what Duffy claimed, although the audit did single out pottery classes. Local residents reported that the classes from a U.S.-based trainer were ineffective, partly because the trainer spoke only English and the trainer’s translator wasn’t fluent in English.     Coburn’s book also highlighted the pottery classes, but noted that only part of the $27 million went toward them.     So, Duffy is wrong on this part of his claim.     3. Watermelon queen     The third part of Duffy’s claim was that the federal government ""pays for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama."" He cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture document on fruit and vegetable projects funded in all 50 states in fiscal 2012.     Alabama got $401,366 for 13 projects, including one to ""partner with the Alabama Watermelon Association to promote the consumption of Alabama’s watermelon through appearances of the Alabama Watermelon Queen at various events and locations.""     The Coburn book said $25,000 in federal money went toward the queen’s travel expenses.     So, Duffy is correct on this part of his claim, although it should be made clear that Uncle Sam picks up only part of the queen’s tab.     Our rating   Duffy said the federal government spends ""$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes"" and pays for ""the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama.""     Overall, Duffy’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFF4700>],/factchecks/2013/mar/24/sean-duffy/uncle-sam-pays-free-cell-phones-pottery-classes-mo/
"['New Jersey', 'Military', 'Patriotism', 'Liberals Are Cool']","
Liberal group claims Mitt Romney, Dick Cheney, Donald Trump, others are draft dodgers
","It’s a Vietnam-era insult that still stings in 2013. Draft dodger – the term conjures up images of Americans unwilling to serve their country and sneaking off to Canada to avoid being drafted for military service. A group called Liberals Are Cool applied that term in an Internet meme - an idea or concept shared via social media - to six well-known Republicans – Mitt Romney, Donald Trump, Dick Cheney, Ted Nugent, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly. ""Q: What do these ‘Patriotic Americans’ have in common? A: They are all Draft Dodgers,"" according to the meme received March 17 by PolitiFact New Jersey. Draft dodging is a serious accusation, but in Liberals Are Cool’s case, theirs lacks any shred of accuracy. Let’s explain how the draft worked during the Vietnam era, which the Selective Service System defines as August 1964 through December 1972. Men who received a draft notice in the mail had about three weeks to return paperwork requesting a hearing for a deferment, Selective Service System spokesman Pat Schuback said. A local draft board then decided whether to grant the waiver. ""For the Vietnam war and World War II, any time there was a draft, there were classifications of deferments,"" Schuback said. ""If you were eligible for it, you were entitled to claim that deferment."" That’s what happened to the men targeted by Liberals are Cool, according to military classification histories that the Selective Service System shared with us, as well as other public records and published reports. The six each applied for and received education deferments because they were students when their names came up for military service.  Romney also received a religious deferment during the time he was doing Mormon missionary work. Romney and Trump also had very high draft numbers, meaning that although they were eligible for military service, their numbers were never called. The first draft lottery for Vietnam occurred on Dec. 1, 1969. Cheney received an additional deferment when he became a father. A federal law at the time exempted a parent from military service for reasons of ""extreme hardship on dependents."" Schuback didn’t have Nugent’s and O’Reilly’s classification histories available but numerous published reports – including ones from Snopes.com and TheSmokingGun.com indicate that both received education deferments. Both websites use public documents for fact-checking. Limbaugh and Nugent were ultimately disqualified from service for medical reasons, according to Snopes.com and TheSmokingGun.com. Education deferments were not unusual, Schuback noted. In fact, millions of Americans received them. During the Vietnam era there were 26,800,000 men in the United States. Of those, 2,215,000 were drafted. The number of deferments during that time was 1,541,000 – more than 50 percent of the population eligible for military service, according to the book ""I Want You! The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force,"" by Bernard D. Rostker that was put out by the RAND Corporation. So what is a ‘draft dodger’? It’s not someone who received a legitimate and legal deferment from military service, Schuback said. ""A draft dodger is someone who got drafted and has then fled, or it also might be a person who made a statement by not registering (for the draft),"" he explained. ""I’m not a draft dodger,"" Schuback added, citing himself as an example. ""I got a deferment because I was pursuing a college degree. Calling that a draft dodger is not correct. They can use it a different way but it’s not correct."" Liberals Are Cool did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling A Liberals Are Cool meme claims ""Q: What do these ‘Patriotic Americans’ have in common? A: They are all Draft Dodgers,"" referring to Romney, Trump, Cheney, Limbaugh, Nugent and O’Reilly. Liberals Are Cool doesn’t acknowledge that the six registered properly for the draft, then applied for and received legal deferments so they could complete their education – an opportunity given more than half the men eligible for the U.S. draft during the Vietnam era. Liberals Are Cool may not like that these men didn’t face combat, but calling them ‘draft dodgers’ is wrong – and ridiculous. As a result, we’re cranking up the heat for this ruling: Pants on Fire!

"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Education', 'Larry Valencia']","
R.I. Rep. Larry Valencia says a third of students who take SAT for second time do worse than first time
","
There’s a vigorous debate going on in Rhode Island over the state’s decision to require high school students to score highly enough on the New England Common Assessment Program test -- commonly called the NECAP --to qualify for a diploma. 
  
Supporters, including state Education Commissioner Deborah Gist, say expecting students to reach at least ""partially proficient"" in math and English will ensure that they’re qualified to graduate and will push schools to raise expectations of students. 
  
But critics say the test, especially the math portion, is too difficult and was never meant to be used to determine whether a student should get a diploma. Showing improvement on the test is one of three graduation requirements, along with completion of coursework and a senior project or portfolio. 
The Providence Student Union, a group of students who object to using the test that way, recently invited 50 adults, including political figures, to take a sample part of the math test. 
Sixty percent of the adults failed. 
  
One test-taker, state Rep. Larry Valencia, D-Richmond, said in a March 19, 2013, radio interview that he had concerns with the test being tied to graduation. The radio discussion then moved more broadly into standardized testing, including the Scholastic Assessment Test, or SAT, that students around the country take to apply to college. 
Valencia said, ""Do you know that, statistically, when you take the SAT a second time, one third of the people that take the SAT, even if they've been studying, will get a lower score than they did the first time around?"" 
His point is relevant to the debate because NECAP supporters point out that students who don’t do well on the test must take it again and show improvement to qualify for graduation. 
So we wondered whether Valencia was right that a third -- roughly 33 percent -- of students who take the SAT fare worse on their second try. 
We asked Valencia for his backup and he e-mailed a link to the College Board web site, which showed these figures about retaking the SAT: 55 percent of juniors improved their scores, 10 percent of juniors got the same scores, and 35 percent -- the key number -- got lower scores. 
We also checked with the College Board, which administers and devises the SAT, to verify that the information on the website was accurate. 
The College Board provided updated figures that varied slightly from those on the web site but not enough to change the picture. Sixty-six percent of students saw scores increase, 4 percent saw no change and 30 percent saw a decrease, according to Leslie Sepuka, director of regional communications at the New York offices of the College Board. 
Both groups of figures are for the 1.66 million SAT takers in the class of 2012. The figures Valencia pointed us to are only for students who specifically took the test in spring of junior year and fall of senior year. 
The data Sepuka provided are from an analysis of all students in the class who took the SAT more than once. 
""The important thing to note is that both analyses reflect similar patterns with the majority of students improving their scores and approximately a third of students experiencing a second test score decline,"" Sepuka said. 
Changes in scores on the second SAT are typically driven by a specific effect: students who score low the first time are more likely to score higher the second; students who have high scores the first time are statistically more likely to see a drop the second time. 
""Interestingly, higher scoring students are more likely to retest than lower scoring students, yet when lower-scoring students retest, they tend to experience a larger score gain,"" Sepuka said. 
Our ruling 
State Rep. Larry Valencia, D-Richmond, said, ""Do you know that, statistically, when you take the SAT a second time, one third of the people that take the SAT, even if they've been studying, will get a lower score than they did the first time around?"" 
Figures from the College Board confirm that. 
We give Valencia the highest score on the Truth-O-Meter test: True. 
(For the record, Valencia reported that he got a 73 percent on the NECAP sample math test portion, which would be a ""3,"" or ""proficient,"" with just 4 of the 50 adults getting a higher score.)

Are Democrats relying more on new taxes than PERS reforms to balance state budget?
","
Earlier this month the two Democratic co-chairs in charge of legislative budgeting released their draft for state spending in 2013-15. Republicans, who are in the minority in both chambers, have criticized repeatedly what they see as the shortcomings of the $16.5 billion general fund budget. 
Basically, they complain that the plan relies too much on new revenue and doesn’t do enough to rein in the Public Employees Retirement System. Roseburg Republican Rep. Bruce Hanna, a  former co-Speaker of the House, had his say on the floor recently. 
""Frustratingly, the Democrats' proposed budget is also balanced by using more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings,"" he said. ""This may represent a priority for some, but certainly not one I can support. Balancing our budget requires hard decisions but it can be done through common-sense solutions."" 
We had one question: Does the proposed budget released by Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, and Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, rely ""more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings?"" The statement didn’t sound quite right to one of our budget watchers, so we decided to check it out. 
People interested in reforming the system, including Gov. John Kitzhaber, say reforms are necessary to curb mounting costs that will eat into public services into the future. People not so interested say the proposed reforms are unfair and probably won’t pass legal muster. 
In any case, the legislative budget draft released by Buckley and Devlin calls for lawmakers to find $275 million in additional revenue by eliminating or reducing tax breaks. So that’s the new revenue part. 
PERS reforms 
The draft budget also calls for three ways to reduce spending on the retirement system, although the dollar amount is harder to suss out. 
One idea would cap the cost-of-living adjustment given to retirees for an estimated savings of $400 million in 2013-15. Another idea would end a tax break for retirees living out-of-state, saving about $55 million. The third idea is to ""collar"" rates -- in other words, spread the projected impact of rate changes into the future -- for an estimated $350 million. 
Those proposals add up to $805 million in ""savings,"" otherwise known as money that government won’t have to spend on the pension system in 2013-15. But not all of the $805 million will help the state general fund budget. Why not? Well, the $805 million will be spread throughout the budgets of not only the state, but of schools, cities and counties, basically any system that participates in PERS. 
So how much money will assist the state budget? The Legislature’s chief fiscal officer Ken Rocco, a non-partisan position, calculates that amount to be closer to $281 million, and this is the number we need to compare with the $275 million figure. We’ll get back to that in the ruling. 
We want to clear up one more thing: What do we mean by ""help""? Without the reforms, the state would have to find an additional $281 million in revenue to pay for the budget the co-chairs have proposed. Or, legislators would have to spend that much more on PERS and give up what they had hoped to buy with the $281 million. 
For example, the draft budget calls for K-12 schools to receive $6.55 billion in 2013-15. But off the balance sheet, school districts will receive an additional $200 million in the form of money officials will no longer have to spend on PERS, giving schools $6.75 billion for the biennium. (In a way, the $16.5 billion turns into $16.78 billion, as far as what agencies are given to spend.) 
This is a confusing issue and we have to share with readers that both sides, when reached by PolitiFact Oregon, were mistaken on the amount that affects the general fund. It took our queries to the Legislative Fiscal Office to get the numbers straightened out. 
The ruling 
Hanna said on the House floor that the proposed budget by Democrats is balanced ""by using more in new tax revenue than in total PERS reform or savings."" That is not accurate. The draft budget relies on $275 million in new tax revenue and $281 million in ""savings"" from PERS reforms. The reforms also reduce pension-related costs for numerous other budgets in Oregon. 
  
Certainly Hanna and others would like to see deeper changes to PERS rather than eliminate some of Oregonians’ tax breaks. That’s a philosophical question for legislators. All we can say is that the state budget as proposed by the Democratic co-chairs contains an approximately equal amount of new tax revenue and PERS cost reductions. 
  
We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDCD140>],/factchecks/2013/mar/23/bruce-hanna/are-democrats-relying-more-new-taxes-pers-reforms-/

Is the federal government funding a study on duck penises?
","
Sequestration is serious business. Jobs are on the line. Day care for poor kids is under the ax. 
Yet even in this budget climate, your federal government still has the money to pay for -- please disregard our blushing -- a study examining duck penises. 
You read that right: duck penises. 
This waterfowl kerfuffle erupted earlier this week, when the conservative website CNSNews.com published a story pulling back the curtain on a $384,949 grant from the National Science Foundation for a Yale University study looking at ducks’ sexual behavior and anatomy and the evolutionary consequences. 
""Many duck penises are corkscrew-shaped and some scientists believe this is because of a form of evolution known as ‘sexual conflict,’"" the story said. 
Twitter quickly took up the cause: 
Can’t cut spending b/c need $ to fund more studies of duck penis length"" @keithcrc, March 20. 
$384,949 Federal stimulus funds to study ""Duck Penis Length"". WH still closed to tours @cincinchili, March 21. 
""His name is Long Duck Dong."" When you're enjoying your furlough, remember that duck penis length matters. @doctrine_man, March 21. 
  
So now PolitiFact is making it our cause. We’ll fact-check the Twitter chatter stating that the federal government is funding a study about duck penises amid the austere cuts of sequestration. 
‘Anti-screw anatomy’ 
Richard Prum is an evolutionary ornithologist at Yale University. We got him on the phone to ask: Duck penises -- really? 
His answer was fascinating, but first here’s a little background. In 2009, Prum applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant for his study titled ""Sexual Conflict, Social Behavior and the Evolution of Waterfowl Genitalia."" (It has since been renamed ""Conflict, Social Behavior and Evolution,"" according to NSF.) The money came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus. 
""The funding was for three years,"" Prum said. ""We managed to expand to a fourth year by basically being frugal."" 
Prum and lead investigator Patricia Brennan have published several papers from their research; several are in review now, and more are forthcoming. 
NSF awards about 11,000 grants a year, and the process is deeply competitive. 
""Funding rates in this area, animal behavior, are less than 10 percent,"" Prum said. ""Getting this money is like into getting into Yale as an undergrad."" 
  
The nearly $400,000 award paid Brennan’s salary, funded the experiments at the waterfowl laboratory, kept the birds healthy and fed and covered other costs such as publication expenses and equipment. 
Here, in Prum’s words, is what he studied and learned: 
""Most birds don’t have a penis. Ducks do. They still have it from the reptilian ancestor that they shared with mammals,"" he said. 
The duck’s penis is stored inside the body, and when it becomes erect, the process of insemination is ""explosive,"" Prum said. The duck’s penis becomes erect within a third of a second, at the same time it enters the female duck’s body. Ejaculation is immediate, and then the penis starts to regress. The length of the duck penis, as mentioned in the tweets, grows to 8 or 9 inches during the summer mating season. In winter, it shrinks to less than an inch. 
In duck ponds, Prum said, a lot of forced copulation occurs. Forced copulation is what it sounds like -- rape in nature. Even gang rape happens among ducks. And Prum found that while 40 to 50 percent of duck sex happens by forced copulation, only 2 to 4 percent of inseminations result from it (meaning times the female duck ends up with a fertilized egg). 
""The question is why does that happen? How does a female prevent fertilization by forced copulation?"" he said. ""The answer has to do with taking advantage of what males have evolved -- this corkscrew shaped penis."" 
Prum said the duck penis is a corkscrew whose direction runs counterclockwise. Female ducks, he said, have evolved a complex vagina also shaped like a corkscrew -- but a clockwise one. 
""This is literally an anti-screw anatomy,"" he said. 
When females choose their own partners -- in other words, solicit copulation -- the muscles in the vagina are dilated and expanded. So the anti-screw effect is negated. 
""The females are enormously, amazingly successful at preventing fertilization by forced copulation,"" he said. 
Now, if this steamy duck sex talk reminds you of a particular Senate candidate’s controversial rape comments in 2012, Prum is right there with you. 
Todd Akin, who ultimately lost his Senate contest in Missouri, angered a lot of people when he claimed, ""If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" 
Said Prum: ""What we demonstrated is that what Senate candidate Akin said about rape is actually true of ducks, and why."" 
""This to me is really about sexual autonomy, and that is why ducks are deeply important,"" he said. ""In the face of persistent sexual violence, females have developed a mechanism to maintain control over sexual choice."" 
If that explanation doesn’t meet your standard for useful science, Prum had this to say in defense of pure scientific research: 
""I have never abandoned my commitment to the notion that the primary commitment of science is to discover new knowledge. You never know when it’s going to be practical. Advanced cultures for all of history have tried to establish new knowledge."" 
What’s this got to do with sequester? 
Prum’s grant began in 2009, funded by a law passed early that year that was meant to jumpstart the sputtering economy. The stimulus spending was meant to get out the door as quickly as possible, with much of spending set for 2009 and 2010. 
Sequestration -- sweeping budget cuts across all federal agencies -- came about from a budget deal in 2011. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans passed sequestration as a means of forcing each other to a broader deal on deficit reduction. The cuts were never meant to be enacted, but since the two sides have not been able to strike a deal, they went into effect March 1. 
Democrats and Obama have decried the effects on average Americans, such as funding cuts to Head Start programs and delayed airline flights. Republicans, who are keen on trimming federal spending, have generally sounded less dire in their sequester warnings, but they’ve cried foul when the Obama administration announces such things as an end to White House tours. 
  
We should point out that in some ways, the sequester and the stimulus are two separate issues. House Republicans tried and failed to cancel unspent stimulus money. Most of the stimulus money is already out the door. The sequester, on the other hand, is intended to reduce government spending in the future. 
Does Prum’s grant have anything to do with the budgetary state we’re in now? 
Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact: ""A lot of times scientific research is pilloried -- and sometimes deservedly so. It has to be taken in context of the need and results as well as the budgetary environment. 
""As far as linking stimulus spending and sequestration, you get to the heart of budgetary issues. Sequestration targets budget authority – the right an agency has to write a check, not outlays – the cash out the door. So the budget authority from the stimulus left the building a long time ago. It is well inside the outlay territory and not subject to sequestration."" 
""All that said,"" he added, ""the federal budget is a zero sum game and it is fair to compare spending on this here to spending or cuts over there. And the goofy is meant to make a point … but the reality can be quite tricky."" 
Our ruling 
Folks in the twitterverse said the federal government is cutting services, furloughing employees and cancelling White House tours, but it still has the money to pay for a study examining duck penises. 
The study is real, and it does indeed explore the unique sexual behaviors and physical characteristics of ducks. It was funded through a National Science Foundation grant that expires this year.

Bloggers say the Air Force wants taxpayers to fund fantasy football league
","
Is the Air Force preparing to spend precious taxpayer funds as it faces sequester-driven budget cuts on a fantasy football league ? 
On blogs and on Twitter on March 20, 2013, people buzzed that it was the case, with a link to back it up. 
""What sequester? Air Force wants taxpayers to fund fantasy football league,"" read a headline at WashingtonExaminer.com. 
""Spared by the Sequester, So Far: Air Force Fantasy Football Program,"" said another at NationalReview.com. 
""Forget Budget Cuts,"" said Wired.com. "" Air Force Is Ready for Some (Fantasy) Football."" 
Some stories credited tips from a co-founder of conservative site RedState.com or a writer there. 
Does the Air Force want ""taxpayers"" to fund a fantasy sports league? Not so fast. 
Not your money 
Bloggers had noticed a March 19 ""request for information"" from an Air Force contracting office ""seeking sources for providing the Air Force installations a Fantasy Football Program."" 
The Air Force’s original request for information included some clues that taxpayers might not be involved. 
It mentioned the personnel center services division, and the Air Force’s ""nonappropriated"" purchasing office. 
The personnel center services division runs recreation and leisure programs for Air Force members and their families around the world, including clubs, bowling, golf, fitness, arts and crafts, and recreational shooting. It also manages the Air Force’s ""nonappropriated funds"" — money that comes from fees and other cash collected from airmen and their families who take part. 
That is to say: Money that doesn’t come from Congress. 
It’s not taxpayer money, and it’s not subject to budget cuts under the sequester. 
But it’s not a small amount of money, with tens of millions of dollars from overseas on-base slot machines alone. 
It even supports a different type of federal employee, not considered federal civil servants because they’re not funded through normal congressional appropriations. Those employees run the activities and programs that also include things like restaurants, youth centers, and auto and wood shops. 
The goal of all these programs, sometimes called ""MWR"" for morale, welfare and recreation, is just what it sounds like: to boost troop morale. 
And, for 17 years, they’ve included an annual program called the ""Football Frenzy,"" said Air Force spokesperson Laurel Tingley. In 2011, for example, airmen who joined the Air Force Services Clubs could win a trip to the Super Bowl. 
This year, the personnel center services division wanted to find out what it would take to add fantasy football to the Frenzy. 
Thus, the request for ""information and pricing on providing product branding, hosting, managing, and delivering all programs and materials related to running a Fantasy Football League,"" that would serve airmen, civilians and family members at ""over 100 installations worldwide."" 
""What we're looking at doing is enhancing a program that airmen have enjoyed for 17 years,"" Tingley said. ""And the entire program is funded through (nonappropriated funds)."" 
Tingley didn’t have details about exactly what the Air Force sought to create, but a fantasy football league wouldn’t have been unplowed ground in the world of military morale — the Navy organized a fantasy football contest with commercial sponsors in 2010 that offered a grand prize of $100,000. 
On March 21, 2013, the Air Force updated its request to say: 
""This RFI is issued by the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO). All requirements, solicitations and subsequent contracts, if any, awarded through AFNAFPO are funded wholly with Nonappropriated funds. These funds are generated through user fees and charges at Air Force morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) programs worldwide.  THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATIONS FROM CONGRESS OR 'TAXPAYER' DOLLARS."" 
By noon on March 22, 2013, it had canceled the request. 
Our ruling 
Headlines across the blogosphere and shared via social media suggested the Air Force wanted taxpayers to a fund fantasy football league — a charged claim as defense budgets face mandatory cuts. 
But the evidence was a ""request for information,"" not a final decision to fund anything. Meanwhile, any money at stake wouldn’t have come from taxpayers, but ""nonappropriated funds"" generated by Air Force clubs and other activities designed to boost morale. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB4C1C0>],/factchecks/2013/mar/22/blog-posting/bloggers-say-air-force-wants-taxpayers-fund-fantas/
"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
 Jeb Bush says immigration determined by family ties, not employment
","
Jeb Bush’s new book Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution has put a spotlight on the former Florida governor and potential 2016 Republican presidential contender. 
In the book, Bush makes the point that our immigration policy prioritizes family reunification -- not the needs of employers. Bush proposed limiting guaranteed admissions to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. 
By 2011, of the one million immigrants granted permanent legal residence, ""nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status."" 
We wanted to check Bush’s numbers: Are almost two-thirds of new legal permanent residents here based on their family status? 
The numbers 
Bush obtained information from a January 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution. The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills. 
West’s number drew from a group known as legal permanent residents, commonly referred to as green card holders. In 2011, about one million people became legal permanent residents, according to the federal government’s yearbook of immigration statistics. Those who entered based on family ties accounted for about 65 percent. 
That included about 235,000 who were family-sponsored preferences and about 453,000 who were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. 
Immediate relatives include spouses, children under the age of 21 or parents of U.S. citizens. If approved, the U.S. government immediately grants those visas for relatives, and there isn’t a quota. 
Family sponsored immigrants includes spouses and children of legal permanent residents as well as other relatives of citizens such as siblings. 
The U.S. government grants up to 226,000 family sponsored visas per year, and 140,000 employment-based visas per year. In addition, there are limits to the percentage of visas that can be allotted to each country. 
  
(Notice that the quota of 226,000 family sponsored visa cap was slightly lower than the 235,000 number of those admitted in 2011. That’s because the quota refers to the number of visas -- valid for six months -- issued in a year, while the immigration statistics yearbook number refers to the actual admissions. So someone can be issued a visa in 2010 but may not travel until 2011.) 
  
There are a few important exceptions within the different categories, though. Jeffrey Passel, at Pew Research Hispanic Center, said in an email that most immigrants come for work even if they came here under a family or relative category. And not all of the employment-visas are for workers, since the ""employment-based"" category also includes visas for spouses and children of the workers. 
The current debate about overhauling the U.S. immigration system pits those who want to protect family reunification against those who say our economy would benefit from a heavier focus on letting in immigrants based on needed job skills. 
In his book, Bush argues the focus on family reunification leads to ""crowding out most others, including immigrants who would contribute greatly to economic growth."" If the U.S. wants to increase work-based immigrants without increasing immigration overall, it will have to narrow the definition of ""family,"" Bush wrote. 
  
Our ruling 
Bush said that by 2011, of the one million immigrants granted permanent legal residence, ""nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status."" 
Bush correctly cites the numbers, and his broader point is correct, too -- our system favors family reunification. 
We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6EA040>],/factchecks/2013/mar/22/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-immigration-determined-family-ties-n/
"['New Hampshire', 'Guns', 'Kelly  Ayotte']","
Most people trying to buy a gun illegally are never prosecuted, U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte says
","
Before Congress enacts any new gun control laws, the nation’s law enforcement officers and courts should better enforce the regulations they have on the books now, according to U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. 
In a meeting with the Telegraph editorial board, New Hampshire’s junior senator took aim last month at the national background check system, which does not go far enough prosecuting those who illegally try to obtain weapons, she said. 
""Of approximately 80,000 in 2012 that were denied (a gun) because of a background check … only 44 people were prosecuted for that,"" Ayotte said during the February 19 meeting. 
""That surprised me,"" she said. ""I want to look further at what we’re doing in terms of enforcement."" 
If Ayotte’s numbers are right, the nation’s .055 prosecution rate doesn’t make for a very good shooting percentage. So, we decided to run the numbers ourselves. 
But first, some background. 
According to federal figures, most applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected because of a prior criminal conviction, restraining order or another past issue. 
In almost every case, these people can be prosecuted. Here’s why: 
Firearms dealers, who provide the federal application form, are instructed to immediately turn away applicants if they acknowledge a past conviction or other prior issue, even before they conduct the FBI check. 
Applications that are submitted to the FBI and later rejected are typically denied because the applicant failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form, which can qualify as a federal crime for providing false information. 
In rare cases, an applicant might initially succeed in obtaining a firearm, despite a criminal record. But once the background check returns showing their past convictions, they could face charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. 
Now, on to the numbers. 
Reached for comment, Ayotte’s staff pointed us in the direction of  U.S. Attorney Timothy Heaphy. 
Earlier this winter, Heaphy, who represents the western district of Virginia, presented those numbers to members of the Senate judiciary committee during a Feb. 12 hearing on gun violence. 
In his testimony, Heaphy cited research published recently by the U.S. Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Regional Justice Information Service, a Missouri-based group that provides research for the justice department, among other public safety and governmental agencies. 
The information service’s research supports Ayotte, and Heaphy’s numbers, showing 80,191 applications denied, along with 44 active prosecutions. 
But, these numbers are based on 2010 data, not 2012, as Ayotte and Heaphy claimed, and reflect only a portion of the total national figures, according to Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the information service.
.
The 80,191 figure, reported in a February study titled ""Background Checks for Firearm Transfers, 2010,"" includes only those applications denied by state and local permitting agencies, Frandsen said. 
Under the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, gun shop owners and other licensed authorities in many states -- 21 to be exact, including New Hampshire -- conduct at least a portion of the background checks themselves through the FBI’s background check system. 
Agencies in these states conducted about 4.37 million checks in 2010, leading to the 80,191 denials, according to Frandsen’s report. 
But, those 29 states that do not conduct the checks themselves defer instead to the FBI to do so. In 2010, the FBI conducted about 6.04 million checks, 72,659 of which were denied, Frandsen noted in the study. 
That places the total number of denied checks conducted in 2010 at 152,850 -- about 1.5 percent of the checks conducted. 
Now on to the prosecutions count. 
A separate report, ""Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010,""  published by Frandsen in August, counts 62 charges filed across the country by U.S. Attorneys in 2010, most for falsifying when buying firearms (22) and possession of firearms by a convicted felon (11). Of those 62 charges, 18 were dropped that year, leaving 44 cases intact, according to Frandsen’s report. 
That number equals Ayotte’s claim. But, once again, it tells only part of the story. 
The 44 charges, 13 of which were still pending at the end of 2011, reflect only those cases brought by federal prosecutors and does not consider charges filed by state or local police agencies, Frandsen noted. 
In his research, Frandsen tracks those local cases reported voluntarily by states. In 2010, four states -- Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- reported 1,520 arrests. That count does not include any arrests made that year in the remaining 17 states that conduct at least some background checks themselves. 
""You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher,"" Frandsen said. ""There’s no question."" 
Our ruling: 
On the numbers, Ayotte is on track. In one year, more than 80,000 background checks were denied at the state and local level and federal authorities pursued 44 charges in court, as the senator claimed. However, the report she cited is based on 2010 numbers, not 2012, but that’s small potatoes. 
More to the point, Ayotte confuses state and federal numbers in her statement, using state rejections (80,000) and federal prosecutions (44). Looking at state enforcement alone, just four states had more than 1,500 arrests. While those are arrests, not prosecutions, it stands to reason the number of state prosecutions is vastly higher than the figure Ayotte cited. 
That ratio is not nearly as dramatic as Ayotte suggested, but her larger point remains valid: the majority of failed background checks do not lead to criminal charges or prosecutions. With this in mind, we rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A5D80>],/factchecks/2013/mar/22/kelly-ayotte/most-people-trying-buy-gun-illegally-us-senator-ke/
"['Elections', 'Population', 'Texas', 'Battleground Texas']","
Battleground Texas says 54 percent of Texas Latinos registered to vote in 2008 and only 35 percent turned out
","
A pro-Democratic group says demographic changes and stepped-up voter turnout in Texas will lead to Democrats winning statewide sooner than later. 
On Comedy Central’s Feb. 26, 2013, ""Colbert Report,"" Jeremy Bird, senior adviser to the newly announced Battleground Texas group, was asked if his mention of demographics was a liberal euphemism for more Hispanic and black residents. 
Bird replied: ""If you look at the state, it’s not just about the demographics, it’s about the turnout. So in 2008, for example, only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out. So what you’re getting is, when only about 50 percent of the population turns out to vote in a place like Texas, you’re getting a government in Texas that’s for half the people and by half the people."" 
We’re not wading in on that logic, nor are we getting into potential strengths or weaknesses of stirring citizens to vote who have historically not voted. 
We wondered instead if 54 percent of Latino Texans registered to vote in 2008, as Bird said, and 35 percent turned out, especially considering that no one marks down their race or ethnicity when they register to vote. 
  
Depending on estimates 
  
Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Los Angeles-based William C. Velasquez Institute, which says it conducts research aimed at improving the level of political and economic participation in Latino and other underrepresented communities, told us by telephone that there is no perfect way to pinpoint the makeup of any electorate. 
But for decades in even-numbered years, he said, the U.S. Census Bureau has followed up general elections by surveying residents about voting habits. He said he respects the surveys’ results, though they include some inflated responses. ""It’s the government asking if you’ve voted or registered to vote,"" Gonzalez said. ""So there’s an (unquantified) exaggeration factor."" 
Alternatively, Gonzalez said, campaigns target Latinos after identifying them by surnames on state voter rolls. There are quirks here too: Voters who go by non-Latino last names tend to be missed and others who marry into Latino families might be miscounted. Also, he said, firms taking this approach depend on surname dictionaries that vary in quality. 
All told, 60 percent of more than 13.5 million Texas voters turned out for the 2008 presidential election, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office. Latinos made up 20 percent of the state’s November vote, according to voter exit polls, with 63 percent favoring Democrat Barack Obama for president and 35 percent backing Republican John McCain, who otherwise carried the state like every GOP presidential nominee since 1980. 
  
How Battleground Texas calculated 
  
When we asked Battleground Texas for backup on Bird’s figures, we heard from several individuals employed by or contracting with 270 to Win, a political consulting firm with offices in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. 
Lynda Tran, a partner at the firm, pointed out the Census Bureau survey taken after the 2008 general election. According to that survey, 54.3 percent of Latino Texas citizens 18 and older--an estimated 2.4 million of its estimated nearly 4.5 million Hispanic citizens in the state--said they registered to vote, with a margin of error of three percentage points. 
Nearly 1.7 million, or about 70 percent, of the Latino registered voters also said they voted, according to the survey, accounting for 37.8 percent of the state’s adult Hispanic citizens as estimated by the survey. This result had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, making Bird’s declared 35 percent in range. 
Andrew Claster, a number-cruncher for the cause, said later by email that Bird drew his reference to 54 percent of Latino citizens registering to vote from the bureau’s post-election survey estimates. 
But he said the conclusion that 35 percent of Latino citizens voted was developed by estimating the number of Latino voters, 1,340,097, a figure reached by applying a ""commercial ethnicity model"" to the state’s 2008 voter file to determine ethnicity based on name and census information. Claster said the voter estimate was then divided by a 2008 bureau estimate of the number of Latino Texas citizens, 3,812,343, which did not come from the post-election survey. 
  
That estimate of voting-age Latino citizens runs some 700,000 less than the estimate of nearly 4.5 million reached via the bureau’s post-election survey. 
  
We asked why the group used one census study for one statistic and relied on another for the second. Claster replied that whichever estimate one chooses for the number of adult Latino Texas citizens, it appears that some 30 percent to 38 percent of those citizens voted, either way reinforcing Bird’s point. 
  
Other looks at Latino registration, turnout 
  
Three other analyses, developed in Texas, enabled us to reach our own statistical speculations. 
Compared to the post-election census survey, the other estimates suggest more Latinos registered to vote, but fewer turned out in November. Each of the calculations was based on identifying Spanish-surnamed voters on the state's 2008 voter roll. 
  
Republican pollster Mike Baselice of Austin and the Texas Tribune, teaming with the El Paso Times, each estimated that there were some 2.9 million Spanish-surnamed Texas registered voters that year. Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin told us by email that his audit of the voter roll, teasing out Latino voters based both on Spanish surnames and maiden names and also removing voters whose names were at least temporarily struck from the roll before the November election, indicates 2,713,681 Hispanic citizens registered to vote. 
Baselice and the Tribune/Times concluded that about 1.3 million Texas Latinos voted that year. That’s 400,000 fewer than indicated by the census survey. In contrast, Smith estimated that 1,382,360 Latinos voted. 
Summing up: The 2008 census survey suggests Texas had some 300,000 to 500,000 fewer Latinos registered to vote than the voter-roll analyses by the Texas outfits. The census survey indicates, too, that there were up to 400,000 more Latinos who voted than estimated by the other analyses. 
Baselice and Smith each said he did not try to gauge the number of Latino citizens who could have registered to vote nor did the Tribune air an estimate. 
Time for a little math of our own. 
  
We used the Texas analyses to stab at the share of voting-age Latino citizens who registered to vote. We did this by dividing each of the other estimates of Latinos who registered to vote by the census bureau’s survey estimate that there were 4,493,000 voting-age Latino citizens in 2008. By our calculations, 60 percent  to 65 percent of voting-age Latinos registered that year, more than the 54 percent suggested by the census survey and echoed by Bird. 
Next, we divided the Texas-devised estimates of Latinos who voted by the census survey’s estimate of 4,493,000 voting-age Latino Texas citizens, a methodology that suggests 29 percent to 31 percent of voting-age Latlnos turned out in November--a bit under the 35 percent figure aired by Bird. 
Footnote: Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us results from the bureau’s 2012 post-election voting surveys were not finalized. 
Our ruling 
  
The Battleground Texas advocate said that in 2008, ""only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out."" 
Research rooted in federal surveys and an analysis starting from the state's 2008 voting roll supports those figures, while our own estimates starting from Texas studies suggest a larger share of voting-age Latino citizens registered and a smaller share of them voted--which, if so, could still be fodder for pushes to improve participation. 
We rate this claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA7B080>],/factchecks/2013/mar/22/battleground-texas/battleground-texas-says-54-percent-texas-latinos-r/

Wisconsin Rep. Evan Goyke says proposed Gogebic mine would be larger than his Assembly district
","The size of the proposed Gogebic iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin dominated debate as a bill to relax state mining laws made it through the Legislature and to Gov. Scott Walker’s desk. Supporters said the new law would maintain the state’s environmental standards while making it easier for the company to open a mine and create thousands of jobs. Opponents argued lawmakers were moving too quickly for a project of its size. During the March 7, 2013 Assembly debate, state Rep. Evan Goyke (D-Milwaukee) noted the vastness of the proposed mine and tried to put it into context. ""The hole in the earth that’s going to be dug is bigger than my entire district,"" Goyke declared. That raised some eyebrows in Madison … and sent us to the plat books and the calculator. How big is this proposed mine? And how big is Goyke’s district? The project is proposed by Gogebic Taconite, a division of Florida-based Cline Resource and Development. The company first proposed the iron ore mine in Ashland and Iron counties in 2011. A bill sought by the company to modify state laws to make mine development easier died in 2012. A similar measure was approved in 2013 and signed by Gov. Scott Walker on March 11, 2013. The new law ""relaxes environmental protections for iron mining -- but not other forms of mining -- and provides more clarity to the state process of reviewing an iron ore mine application,"" according to the Journal Sentinel’s report on the bill signing. We dug into a similar claim once before. In January 2012, we rated Mostly Falsea claim by state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber (D-Appleton), who said ""the central size""  of the mine ""could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago."" Size of the mine When it comes to the size, Gogebic and the state Department of Natural Resources officials have offered slightly different sizes. Gogebic president Bill Williams was quoted byPolitiFact Wisconsinin 2012 as saying that the mine would be about four miles long and a half mile wide. Williams gave a rough estimate and said the mine would need up to 5,000 acres.Williams didn’t respond to a request for a more precise estimate. A state DNR mine expert, Ann Coakley, said the mine might be 1.5 miles wide. At 4 miles long and at that width, the mine would be 6 square miles or 3,840 acres, according to a conversion calculator.  And that’s before you add in access roads, rail lines, processing facilities and other facilities. Size of the district So what about the 18th Assembly District, which Goyke represents? The district lies within the city of Milwaukee, and it contains roughly the same number of people as any other Assembly district -- 57,480. But it’s far smaller, geographically, than most because it’s an urban district. The 18th stretches from Capitol Drive to the north and roughly Interstate 94 to the south. The northern part is 14 blocks wide, between N. 49th and N. 35th streets, and it lies between 60th and 15th streets at the southern base. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, the 18th District is 3,609 acres. Another way of visualizing the mine: It’s about 4.5 miles from Miller Park to the Milwaukee Art Museum. And the Menomonee Valley corridor is roughly a mile to 1.5 miles wide. The mine wouldn’t be a rectangular swath -- plans call for it to wrap down and around a ridge in an area known as the Penokee Range, but you get the idea. Let’s put the mine into the context of the North Woods. The vast 74th Assembly District that includes the mine site is 3.3 million acres. So, the mine represents about a tenth of 1 percent of it. Another yardstick: Iron County alone is 802 square miles, or 513,280 acres. Let’s power down our calculators. Goyke says the proposed Gogebic mine would be larger than his district. Using the smallest size estimates, the mine would cover 3,840 acres, or 231 acres more than the 18th Assembly district. Goyke got his numbers right. But he’s also got an advantage -- geographically, his densely populated district is the second smallest in the state, trailing only the 8th on Milwaukee’s south side. We rate Goyke’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A5EC0>],/factchecks/2013/mar/22/evan-goyke/wisconsin-rep-evan-goyke-says-proposed-gogebic-min/
"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'States', 'Jeff Mullis']","
Lawmaker says Georgia loses out on fireworks revenue
","
The Georgia night sky could -- loudly -- come to life if a piece of legislation becomes state law. 
Senate Resolution 378 would allow revenue from the sale of consumer fireworks to be used to help fund trauma care and firefighter services in Georgia. Currently, nothing with more pop than a sparkler can be sold in this state. The expansion would allow the sale of more high-powered fireworks, such as rockets, firecrackers and Roman candles. The resolution, if approved, would require a statewide voter referendum in November 2014.  
One prominent sponsor of the bill, Sen. Jeff Mullis, said there’s a practical reason for such a law. 

""We lose millions of dollars of revenue because people go out of state to buy fireworks,"" said Mullis, a Republican from Chickamauga, a 10-minute trip from the Tennessee border. 
Mullis claimed in a press release that ""the sales tax on these purchases will raise and [sic] estimated $5 million each year for vital emergency services."" 
Lawmakers propose a 6 percent tax on fireworks sales with the proceeds being evenly split for trauma care and a firefighter safety council. An additional 1 percent tax could be collected by cities and counties. 
  
PolitiFact Georgia received a reader request to figure out if Mullis is correct in his assertion that Georgia loses millions of dollars because people travel to Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee to get their fireworks. We try to stay away from fact-checking revenue projections. 
Mullis, a former firefighter, said via email that his primary concern is Georgia is ""failing to capitalize on a form of commerce that could add millions of dollars to our state's bottom line, as well as jobs which would be created as a result of new industry."" 
Marietta resident Bill Tugwell owns the large Alabama fireworks store on U.S. 431 between Phenix City and Eufaula that many metro Atlantans pass on their way to vacation along the Florida Panhandle beaches. The parking lot is often filled with cars bearing Georgia license plates. 
""I don’t think it’s millions plural,"" Tugwell said regarding how much money Georgia loses to other states. ""I think it’s closer to a million."" 
Some states have interesting purposes for their fireworks laws. Florida allows people to buy an estimated 2,000 forms of fireworks that are listed under the category of sparklers. For anything that explodes or lifts off the ground, you need a permit. Some of the permitted uses for more powerful forms of fireworks include scaring birds away from crops. 
""There shouldn’t be a critter left in Florida,"" quipped Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, a Maryland-based trade group.  
Revenue officials in Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee said they did not have any research showing how much money Georgians spend on fireworks there. Economics academics at colleges and universities in those states said they haven’t seen or conducted such research. 
A Senate spokeswoman sent us a report by the American Pyrotechnics Association that says consumers nationwide spent $649 million on fireworks in 2011, up from $284 million in 1998. The figures were not broken down by states. 
Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, suggested we could come up with an estimate by calculating a per capita breakdown of how much money Georgians would spend on fireworks if the menu of products was expanded. 
Since slightly more than 3 percent of the nation’s population lives in Georgia (9.9 million residents), that would equate to about $20 million being spent by Georgians in 2011. Humphreys advised us that there would be a multiplier effect on top of the direct fiscal impact due to reduced shopping outside Georgia if fireworks were available for purchase inside the state, but he said it would not be large. A 6 percent tax or fee could be worth at least $3 million annually. 
In 2006, Indiana lawmakers imposed a 5 percent safety fee on retail fireworks sales. Indiana collects about $2.5 million a year from the fee, state data shows. Indiana has about 6.5 million residents. Michigan collected $755,262 from a 6 percent fireworks safety fee during the first eight months of its new law to allow more powerful fireworks to be sold, the Detroit News reported. The newspaper reported the revenue collected was far below projections. Michigan’s new fireworks safety fee and guidelines took effect in January 2012. Michigan has 9.8 million residents, nearly the same amount as Georgia. 
Bill Weimer, a top official of a company in Ohio that sells many of the fireworks not currently sold in Georgia, believes Mullis’ claim is accurate. Weimer looked at the amount of fireworks sold in Indiana and believes the same volume of fireworks will be sold in Georgia or more. 
""You can do the math,"" said Weimer, vice president of Phantom Fireworks, which sells fireworks to several national retail chains. 
Phantom Fireworks has been working with Mullis and other lawmakers trying to pass SR 378. 
So where does this leave us? Mullis claimed Georgia’s economy loses millions of dollars in revenue because residents travel outside the state to purchase their fireworks. It’s probable, but there is no specific research to support his argument. We do know some Georgians go outside the state to buy fireworks, and it does seem like people spend millions of dollars on fireworks in other states. 
It would be useful if there were more hard numbers out there to back up Mullis’ claim. 
But based on the specific numbers we have from other states and our own estimates, he seems to be in the ballpark.

Gov. John Kasich says Ohio wages are up by more than $10 billion
","
With budget battles looming for Gov. John Kasich's plans on taxing and spending, Ohio's improving economy remains a bright spot for him. 
Kasich promised during the 2010 gubernatorial race that his pro-business agenda would bring jobs to Ohio, and he has touted his record on job creation since his first year in office. 
On March 15, he tweeted about it with another angle: ""The most recent data shows OH wages have jumped by $10.3 billion. Ohioans are creating jobs and driving our comeback."" 
It linked to a picture with the overlay ""Under Gov. Kasich, Ohio wages have increased by $10.3 billion."" 
PolitiFact Ohio wanted more detail and wondered about the source of the wage figure. 
Kasich's office pointed to data assembled by the Bureau of Labor Market Information of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. 
Specifically citing the figures for total wages of workers employed in Ohio, they compared the combined wages for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011 against the period starting six months after Kasich took office -- the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and the first and second quarters of 2012. 
The first four quarters total $204.2 billion (averaging $51 billion per quarter). The second four quarters total $214.5 billion (averaging $53.6 billion). 
The difference: $10.3 billion. 
We looked further, hoping to make the numbers more meaningful to individuals, and found that per capita income in Ohio increased 4.5 percent in 2011, the most recent figures available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
PolitiFact has always stipulated that the ability of an individual  governor -- or president or any other elected official -- to influence the economy is limited. Determining how credit or blame should be apportioned is seldom clear. 
Kasich took office at a time when Ohio's employment picture already had begun to improve. The wage growth for the time period under the Republican governor could as easily be classified as having happened under President Barack Obama, a Democrat (as Mitt Romney found last fall). 
  
In his tweet, Kasich did not try to apportion responsibility or take personal credit for wage growth in Ohio. In fact, he credited Ohioans with ""creating jobs and driving our comeback."" The link to the photo with the words ""Under Gov. Kasich. . .,"" however, seemed clearly designed to attribute the wage growth to Kasich. 
Still, we have previously found that Kasich can certainly lay claim to having kept some jobs here and attracted new ones. 
The numbers back up his statement. We rate it as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB947540>],/factchecks/2013/mar/21/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-ohio-wages-are-more-10-billio/

No, gun silencers wouldn't have worsened the Las Vegas shooting
","In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, Hillary Clinton suggested gun silencers could have amplified the bloodshed. ""The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get,"" Clinton tweeted. The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. A silencer is the popular name for a suppressor, a canister attached to a gun muzzle that reduces (but doesn’t entirely silence) the sound produced by a gunshot. Some members of Congress have been pushing for legislation that would make it easier for gun owners to use suppressors. The Hearing Protection Act, introduced in the House of Representatives in January, would lower the restrictions on buying suppressors. As it stands, there is an approximately nine-month approval process and a $200 tax stamp. Act proponents want to streamline purchases to match regular firearm purchases. We wondered whether introducing suppressors to the Las Vegas shooting would have indeed increased casualties. Our research shows that a suppressor would not have made a difference in the Las Vegas case, because of the positioning of the weapons and because of the distance of the shooter from the crowd. Clinton’s staff provided no evidence to suggest a different outcome. A shooting weapon produces two sounds. One is the crack of the bullet, which can be heard on most video recordings of the shooting and is produced by the bullet traveling faster than the speed of sound. This is unaffected by suppressors. Suppressors instead work on the muzzle blast, or the sound the gun barrel produces when it fires. A typical gunshot is around 150-160 decibels, a level that can cause hearing damage. Suppressors can reduce that sound by around 20-30 decibels, depending on the gun, ammunition, temperature and even humidity. That’s just below the threshold for instant hearing damage. Experts compared the suppressed sound levels to a jackhammer and a jumbo jet on the tarmac 100 yards away. That’s still fairly loud. It’s important to note that suppressors are intended to lower the sound for the shooter, not the target. Jeremy Mallette, who has researched suppressors for Silencer Shop, estimated the sound of suppressed gunfire would go up 10 to 15 decibels downrange -- making the impact of the suppressor even lower for those on the receiving end. The gunman shot at the crowd out of windows on the 32nd floor of the hotel and positioned the guns so that they shot outwards. If the shooter’s aim was to lower the sound emissions, the room could have better trapped the noise, according to Tom Satterly, the director of development for Asymmetric Solutions, a firearm training firm based in Missouri. ""If you hang your weapon outside of your window the muzzle blast is going outside,"" Satterly said. ""If you back in -- a foot or farther -- a lot of that sound is absorbed into the room. That’s what snipers do when they’re trying to hide their position."" Suppressed or not, Mallette said adjacent hotel rooms would have heard the sound very loudly. Marty Langley, a gun-control advocate and a senior policy analyst at Violence Policy Center, pointed to claims from the silencer industry that if the suppressor masks the sound of the gunshot, then the person being shot at can only hear the ballistic crack after it has whizzed by, causing them to think the fire is coming from the opposite direction. However, Satterly, an Army veteran with combat experience in Somalia, said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever been able to pinpoint the direction the sound originated from -- an effect that is amplified in a loud, urban area like the Las Vegas strip. ""It’s nearly impossible to tell where someone shot you from in an urban environment unless there’s visual cues,"" Satterly said. Which brings us to our next point: Langley also pointed out claims from the industry that silencers make shooters less detectable in the dark. The flash hider that comes with a silencer is designed to minimize the flame the shooter sees coming out of the barrel, which can blind night vision goggles for a couple of seconds. But while it minimizes the flash, it doesn’t eliminate it altogether. What’s more, it’s a function that can be performed by tools that are already on the market without the same barriers to purchase as suppressors -- and that many rifles are already equipped with. Langley also pointed out industry claims that silencers can improve accuracy and enable quicker follow-up shots by reducing recoil. That is, they can decrease the barrel’s rising produced by the pressure and gas of the bullet. Experts agreed a suppressor can slightly improve accuracy, but the effect would have been minimal in the indiscriminate shooting seen in Las Vegas. Hillary Clinton suggested gun silencers would have worsened the Las Vegas attack in a tweet. It’s certainly possible that silencers or suppressors could make some shootings worse than they would be otherwise. But the specifics of the Las Vegas shooting don’t fit that scenario. Experts told us it’s highly unlikely a silencer would have made the Las Vegas shooting even more deadly, because of the distance of the shooter from the crowds and because of the crowded, urban environment where the victims were targeted. Gun silencers can slightly lower the visual and sound impact of a shooter, but experts agreed the impact would have been negligible in the case of Las Vegas. We rate this statement False. Clarification: After this report was published, we added language to clarify that Langley was pointing to industry claims about the characteristics of suppressors. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD2EF00>],/factchecks/2017/oct/04/hillary-clinton/no-gun-silencers-wouldnt-have-worsened-las-vegas-s/

Anti-vote fraud group levels false charge of corrupted voter rolls
","An Indianapolis-based advocacy group issued a news release Sept. 25 with a stunning headline: ""24 states show corrupted voter rolls."" ""Voter fraud begins with corrupted voter rolls,"" said J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. ""Our nation’s voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we aren’t doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt."" The Public Interest Legal Foundation, which aims to keep voter rolls as up-to-date as possible, had sent letters to nearly 250 counties. Bryan County was among them. The group’s letter to county elections supervisor Cindy Reynolds said, ""Based on our research, your jurisdiction is in apparent violation of Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act."" It explained that the letter was the required statutory notice ""prior to the commencement of any lawsuit."" The county’s key problem, according to the foundation, was that it had ""significantly more voters on the registration roles than it has eligible, living citizen voters."" In this fact-check, we looked at whether Bryan County’s voter rolls are corrupted, as the news release charged. The short answer is that the situation in Bryan County is cleaner than the foundation would have us believe. The fact is, maintaining the voter rolls in Georgia is an ongoing process and the foundation counted names on the Bryan County list that were flagged for possible removal. Foundation spokesman Logan Churchwell told us that his group relied on the latest federal survey from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. That spreadsheet showed 20,285 active voters and 5,622 inactive ones in Bryan County on the rolls for the November 2016 election. What are inactive voters? People who haven’t voted in the past two elections, have been sent a letter to confirm their registration and haven’t responded to that letter. The foundation added the two groups and reported a total of 25,907 voters. It then compared that to the number of county residents age 18 and older. Using the latest Census figures, that was 25,643. Not all of them would necessarily be eligible to vote, but ""that gives the county the maximum benefit of the doubt,"" Churchwell said. With 264 more names on the rolls than the total of potentially eligible voters, the foundation included Bryan County on its list of those with corrupted voter rolls. Including the inactive voters is essential to that finding. The problem evaporates based on active voters. Judged against that, there are 5,358 fewer names on the rolls than the total potentially eligible population. Churchwell defended his group’s methods, saying ""all a person on the inactive list needs to do is respond and like that, they are back on the rolls."" The county can’t ""pretend they aren’t there,"" he added. The relationship between voter rolls and residents is constantly in flux. Many people move away and some die, to give the two biggest factors. The same survey used by the foundation gives a glimpse into how election officials try to keep up. Importantly for this fact-check, it also shows what the size of the inactive list can tell us about changes in the active voter rolls. The foundation counted all inactive voters, but there’s good reason to question that. In Georgia, the state maintains the voter rolls, not the counties. Between 2014 and 2016, the state sent 4,323 letters asking people in Bryan County to confirm their voting status. In the same period, the state removed 2,579 names. Put another way, take about 60 percent of the inactive total and you get the number of names that will be dropped. Apply that to the 2,622 on the November 2016 inactive list and you’d expect that 1,542 names would drop from the rolls. That alone would put the number of voters below the number of potentially eligible voters by about 1,200. In fact, Bryan County election supervisor Reynolds said the state cut 2,934 names from the rolls as of September 2017. The state was more aggressive than it had been over the past two years. ""This is a regular process by the Secretary of State provided by Georgia laws to ensure that our rolls are as accurate as possible,"" Reynolds said in a statement. We wondered how often the group’s assertions led to successful lawsuits. Churchwell told us that in 2015, his group targeted 141 counties. Of those, they brought legal action against eight, resulting in one settlement and two consent decrees to improve roll maintenance practices. The Public Interest Legal Foundation said Bryan County had corrupted voter rolls because it had more voters registered than the eligible population in the county. The foundation relied on the number of voters listed as inactive to reach that conclusion. That is a worst-case approach that does not account for the reality of voter roll maintenance in Georgia. Based on all the data, there’s no evidence that the Bryan County rolls are corrupted. The group took a number that reflected an effort to keep the voter rolls current and used it to cast the county in a bad light. The foundation used data selectively and ignored ongoing efforts to clean up the voter rolls to reach an exaggerated conclusion. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF80A00>],/factchecks/2017/oct/04/public-interest-legal-foundation/anti-vote-fraud-group-levels-false-charge-corrupte/

Do black workers earn 73% of what white men make?
","Making the case for his election in a campaign email, gubernatorial hopeful Andy Gronik cited a racial pay gap as one reason Wisconsin needs new leadership. Before laying out his pledge to ""fight for the rights of everyone in Wisconsin,"" Gronik highlighted a gap between the earnings of black and white workers. ""When black Americans still earn less than 73 percent of what white men make in America, we have work to do,"" the Democratic businessman from Fox Point wrote on Aug. 27, 2017. ""It's time to stand up and say that people of color deserve all of the opportunities and privileges that the rest of us have."" In other words, Gronik says the ""wage gap"" is 27 percentage points between the two races. Let’s see if Gronik’s numbers add up. Cited gap doesn’t account for differences When asked for evidence to back up Gronik's claim, a Gronik spokesman pointed to a 2016 Pew Research Center report. But the candidate’s email misstates the comparison. The email compares ""black Americans"" with just white men, while the Pew report is saying black men have 73 percent the hourly earnings of white men. The Pew report uses 2015 data and is based on median hourly earnings for each race. It does not take into account differences between the education levels of white and black workers, their experience, occupation or other factors. (The unadjusted earnings data from Pew showed Asian men earn 117 percent what white men do and Hispanic men earn 69 percent what white men do.) ""From a statistical standpoint you’d want to compare apples v. apples, and those comparisons with unadjusted data would be comparing apples to oranges really,"" said Mark Perry, a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics at the University of Michigan-Flint. ""You’re not controlling for any of the factors that could explain differences in earnings."" The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank, examines these factors each year and put the black-white wage gap at 14.5 percent for 2016. The calculation controls for gender, race, education, experience and geographic division. Their data shows the gap has steadily widened in recent years. The wage gap was around 9 percent in the late 1970s and 10 percent in the 1980s, rising to a record 15.2 percent in 2015 before dropping slightly in 2016. The wage gap varies greatly between men and women. The institute’s detailed 2016 study tabbed the gap as 22 percent between white men and black men and 11.7 percent between white women and black women, when adjusted for education, experience, metro status and region. Differences in factors such as education and experience levels explained only about one-fourth of the black-white wage gap for men and one-third for women, the study said. The study struggled to identify a cause for the rest, saying the gaps are growing due to either discrimination ""or racial differences in skills or worker characteristics that are unobserved or unmeasured in the data."" Segments show larger, smaller gaps More detailed data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the wage gap rises and falls between various educational and occupational groups. Examples from a 2016 comparison of median weekly earnings: ·         Among college graduates, black workers earned 78 percent of what their white counterparts earned. ·         Among those with less than a high school diploma, black workers earned 89 percent of what their white counterparts earned. ·         Black workers in management, professional and related occupations earned 80 percent of what white workers did. ·         Black workers in natural resources, construction and maintenance occupations earned 93 percent of what white workers did. ·         Black men earned 76 percent of what white men did overall. ·         Black women earned 84 percent of what white women did overall. Our rating Gronik said ""black Americans still earn less than 73 percent of what white men make."" His claim runs into problems on several levels. First, he garbled the statistic, comparing all black workers to only white men. He also referred to unadjusted earnings data, which does not account for differences between workers’ experience and backgrounds that explain some of the wage gap. He also used 2015 data, when 2016 data is available from various sources. But his central point — that there is an observable difference between what black workers and white workers make — is supported by the data. Experts vary in their methodologies and definition of a wage gap, and more nuanced calculations show it is notably smaller than the figure Gronik cited. But a gap does exist, both between all workers and between workers who are similarly situated.

Chicago toughest on gun control? A claim shot full of holes
","Facing questions from reporters on Oct. 2 about whether the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history would stir action on gun control, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called up a page straight from the campaign playbook of her boss. ""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there,"" Sanders said. ""So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact."" Sanders’ statement was nearly identical to that of her boss nearly a year ago. During his third debate with Hillary Clinton in October 2016, Donald Trump used Chicago to bolster his belief in the folly of fighting gun crime with stricter gun laws. ""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city,"" Trump said. Trump was correct that Chicago’s gun violence led the nation. But a check by PolitiFact Illinois revealed that he was wrong by a long shot about the city having ""the toughest gun laws in the United States."" Just about anyone who follows crime trends and gun regulations in the U.S. with any degree of seriousness knows by now that the ""Chicago-as-gun-law-Mecca"" charge is a canard that lost its last vestige of credibility more than four years ago, when Illinois became the last state in the nation to allow concealed carry of firearms. Trump, following the rhetoric lead of many other strong gun rights advocates, has over the years frequently pointed to Chicago as ""proof"" that gun ownership restrictions not only fail to reduce crime, but exacerbate it. The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there! Sanders took Trump’s illogical and invalid argument a step further. Now Chicago’s handgun ownership history proves that mass shootings committed with automatic weapons can’t be prevented with legal restrictions. Here’s why Sanders and all of those who continue to repeat her statement on social media and elsewhere are wrong about Chicago’s gun laws. Chicago’s reputation for strict gun laws is rooted in its 1982 ban on handguns. When the U.S. Supreme Court’s District of Columbia vs. Heller  decision in 2008 struck down a similar ban in the District of Columbia, Chicago was the only major city left with a blanket handgun prohibition. The distinction didn’t last long. In 2010, the high court followed up Heller with a ruling in McDonald vs. City of Chicago which nullified Chicago’s ban. At that, the concealed carry of firearms was still outlawed in Chicago as it was throughout all of Illinois. Two years later, however, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Illinois concealed carry ban as unconstitutional and the state soon after became the last in the nation to approve concealed carry. As we noted last year in fact-checking Trump’s Chicago-bashing: With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities. We also noted last year that the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun laws, found Illinois’ firearm laws too lenient in several ways, all of which still apply: Illinois’ gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its ""Smart Gun Laws"" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners’ ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases. But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are. Seven states receive higher grades than Illinois in the latest Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ratings. In last year’s fact-check, we noted that Trump’s statement also could have been interpreted as Chicago having strict gun laws because it imposed strict penalties on those who violate them or use guns in crimes. Even staunch gun rights advocates have argued that this approach can be an effective crime deterrent where restrictions on lawful gun ownership are both unconstitutional and ineffective. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had for several years pushed unsuccessfully for a new state law containing harsher penalties for repeat gun offenders. A 2014 report by the Chicago Sun-Times found that lenient sentencing for gun offenders was a factor in repeat offenses. That was where things stood when Trump made his statement in 2016. That changed on June 23, when Gov. Bruce Rauner signed into law a bill that, among other things, increased the minimum sentence for repeat gun offenders from three to seven years. Thus even the argument that Chicago favors getting tough on lawful gun owners over cracking down on gun criminals no longer applies. Sanders, fielding questions about the impact of the Las Vegas massacre, pointed to chronic  gun violence in Chicago as proof that tough gun laws were ineffective. ""I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country,"" she said. ""That certainly hasn’t helped there,"" There was a brief time between 2008 and 2010 -- the window during which Washington, D.C.’s handgun ban had been invalidated but Chicago’s still stood -- where that might have been true. But federal court rulings effectively undid city and state laws severely restricting gun use and ownership in the Chicago. When it comes to the concealed carry of weapons, Chicago has less authority to impose limitations than do many other large U.S. cities. In the thick of 2016 presidential campaign, we rated a nearly identical statement from then candidate Trump as Mostly False. Since then, similar claims have been uttered frequently by others and repeatedly debunked. Sanders therefore has had ample opportunity to learn her boss had been flat wrong when making the same claim on the campaign trail. Her revival of the claim, made in the midst of the debate raging over the Las Vegas massacre, is at best intellectually lazy and at worst a deliberate attempt to mislead. There’s no mitigating factor or missing context here. Sanders’ statement earns our lowest credibility rating, Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB4AD00>],/factchecks/2017/oct/03/sarah-huckabee-sanders/chicago-toughest-gun-control-claim-shot-full-holes/

Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. Similar headlines appeared on several other links that users questioned. The post claimed that while the ""liberal media"" is attacking President Donald Trump’s response to the humanitarian crisis, the real issue is that ""the Teamsters Union drivers did not show up to work. Only 20 percent of drivers arrived at the ports to distribute the relief supplies,"" The Gateway Pundit said. The other posts all shared the same sentiment, and often included ""proof"" from more social media posts claiming to know all about the problem. But they aren’t right to blame union truckers for the lack of movement. It turns out the blog posts are delivering misinformation about this problem. The Gateway Pundit pointed to another Sept. 30 post from TheConservativeTreehouse.com, which cited a Sept. 29 Huffington Post interview with U.S. Air Force Col. Michael A. Valle. Valle was born in Puerto Rico and was leading Maria relief efforts. The Conservative Treehouse post included a passage from the interview that said supplies are being sent to Puerto Rico, but not being moved across the island. ""It’s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers,"" the website quoted Valle as saying. ""Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20 percent of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government."" Valle did say in the Huffington Post interview that there was a lack of drivers, but he also went on to add the drivers deserved ""zero blame:"" ""They can’t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can’t get fuel themselves, and they can’t call us for help because there’s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family’s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can’t call home."" The Conservative Treehouse also posted a video of CNBC’s Contessa Brewer reporting from San Juan as proof of the problem, but ignored the part where Brewer said transportation problems are not the drivers’ fault. ""You’re looking at truck drivers who can’t be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don’t have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don’t have fuel,"" Brewer said. ""The problem is the supply chain."" She added that Crowley Puerto Rico, a shipping and logistics company, said that getting drivers to the port and back out again was proving to be a challenge. There has been a definite problem moving supplies that have arrived. On Sept. 29, the same day Valle’s interview was published, the Teamsters sent out a press release asking union truck drivers to volunteer to go to Puerto Rico to help transport supplies. The release warned that it wouldn’t be easy, but fellow union workers needed help. ""At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers,"" the release read. ""However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs."" There’s no mention of strike in the press release, and nothing in Valle’s interview about labor unions, so where did the The Conservative Treehouse get that? From an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the Teamsters union. The blog turned to a Spanish-language interview for Lo Sé Todo on Wapa.tv with Victor Rodriguez, identifying as ""the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico trucker’s union called Fente Amplio."" Dozens of subsequent posts online identify Frente Amplio (note the different spelling) as the local Teamsters union, which Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe told us is incorrect. Rodriguez represents the independent Frente Amplio de Camioneros de Puerto Rico (Broad Front of Truck Drivers of Puerto Rico), which is not affiliated with the Teamsters.   TheConservativeTreehouse.com egregiously misrepresented Rodriguez’s interview, translating it to claim that Rodriguez said truck drivers are refusing to work as part of a plan to show up Puerto Rico’s governor. ""Since the country doesn’t care about truckers, the truckers won’t help,"" TheConservativeTreehouse.com quoted Rodriguez. It credits the reporter with getting Rodriguez to admit his defiance. In truth, Rodriguez is saying the opposite, that despite a disagreement over a law signed by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló concerning truck permitting, drivers should help in any way they can. Truckers called off a planned strike because of Hurricane Irma three weeks prior, he said. Rodriguez did take a swipe at Rosselló, saying long lines are partly his fault, and noted that truckers can’t come down when they are in regions with impassable roads. But by and large, Rodriguez said that truckers are working and doing what they need to do to deliver goods. He even cuts off the reporter at one point for suggesting they are refusing to work. In response to all the false stories online blaming Teamster drivers, the union released a statement on Oct. 2 that said their members have been working since Maria passed over the island. The statement blamed ""online, anti-union sources"" for spreading an inaccurate story. ""These viral stories spreading across the internet are nothing but lies perpetrated by anti-union entities to further their destructive agenda,"" Teamsters president Jim Hoffa said in the release. ""The fact that they are attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of citizens in Puerto Rico that are (in) dire need of our help by pushing these false stories, just exposes their true nature."" Bloggers said that ""San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies"" because they went on strike after Hurricane Maria. The widespread accusations trace back to a post that selectively edited and mistranslated interviews to make it look like union truckers were being greedy and lazy. But there’s no strike, and union truck drivers have been trying to move aid shipments across Puerto Rico. There are multiple logistical problems slowing down transport, not the least of which is that some drivers simply can’t get to the port, or drive on impassable roads. Bloggers are misrepresenting a real humanitarian crisis by blaming trade unions. That drives this rating to Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB58540>],/factchecks/2017/oct/03/blog-posting/fake-news-posts-blame-puerto-ricos-truck-drivers-r/

Blog peddles fake story saying security guards ID'd as shooters at Mandalay Bay
","An online website that describes itself as ""free independent news"" is pushing a false story that a Las Vegas shooting victim saw multiple gunmen dressed as security guards at Mandalay Bay. One of the more pervasive conspiracy-minded claims spinning around the Internet is that the Las Vegas shooting was some type of staged attack or that there were multiple gunmen. As of this writing, there is no evidence any of that is true. However, the website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the shooting reported ""multiple gunmen dressed as security guards."" ""As the mainstream media in the US attempts to lock down the ‘crazy lone wolf gunman’ narrative for the devastating shooting attack in Las Vegas, the truth has started to seep through foreign news outlets who don't follow the same political agenda as the American MSM,"" the post, dated Oct. 3, 2017, reads. The post goes on to tell the story of Brian Hodge, an Australian who was reportedly staying on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, the same floor as the shooter. The story talks about an Oct. 2 interview Hodge gave to the Courier Mail, an Australian tabloid. In that article, Hodge said he hid in the bushes outside the casino hotel until police arrived. ""There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us,"" Hodge is quoted as saying. Later, Hodge said: ""My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor."" While there are some reports a security guard was shot, we are unable to confirm if that’s accurate. And while Hodge is quoted as saying shooters plural, there is no evidence he’d have any way of knowing. In fact, Hodge gave an interview to the Sydney Morning Herald in which he more fully describes what he saw. Hodge told that newspaper that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and after hearing the bullets he first went to a casino kitchen before hiding in a bush outside. ""I was just laying on the ground. It was like a scene from a movie. The shooter was up above, we didn't know where they were... I didn't want anyone to know where I was, so I just curled up and hid. It was the most terrifying moment of my life."" Hodge also posted on Facebook, ""There is a live shooter with a gun in my hotel in Vegas right now, but I got outside safely and hiding in bushes."" More importantly for this fact-check, it’s clear to us the Neon Nettle post puts words in Hodge’s mouth. Hodge never said in the Courier Mail article nor in any other article or social media post that the security guard was a shooter. And he also disputed saying shooters. An online blog claims, ""Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards."" The story tracks back to real interviews given by a person who says he was at Mandalay Bay. But beyond that, this story doesn’t hold up. The witness didn’t say what the blog claims. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA7CB80>],/factchecks/2017/oct/03/blog-posting/blog-peddles-fake-story-saying-security-guards-idd/

Do 90% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales?
","In the first hours after the Las Vegas mass shooting, many leading elected officials in Wisconsin issued statements about prayer and condolences, but Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele went further. Abele, a Democrat who holds a nonpartisan office, said in a tweet on Oct. 2, 2017: Americans have overwhelmingly supported common sense gun reform. 90% support universal background checks. Elected officials must act. In 2015, we rated as True a claim that polling showed nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support requiring background checks for all gun sales. The statement was made by Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee. So, what about Abele’s claim about all Americans? The latest polls and our checks with four polling experts indicate support is at 90 percent, give or take a few percentage points. Recent polls Here’s a look at national polls done in 2016 or 2017 on this question. Poll Date Question Percent support/favor Quinnipiac University June 2017 Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers? 94% Washington University American Panel Survey July 2016 Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers, no matter where the gun is purchased? 84% CBS News June 2016 Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers? 89% Morning Consult June 2016 Do you support requiring all sellers to run background checks on anyone who buys a gun? 86%* Public Policy Polling Mar. 2016 Do you support or oppose requiring a criminal background check of every person who wants to buy a firearm? 84% CBS News/New York Times Jan.2016 Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers? 88%   So, the latest poll shows support above 90 percent, while three other recent polls show support between 84 percent and 89 percent. Polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told us that the wording of questions in national surveys can vary and usually do not use the term ""universal."" But well over 80 percent, and sometimes over 90 percent, of respondents favor background checks for all gun sales, he said. Polling experts Kathy Frankovic, a former consultant for CBS News, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute think tank and Charles Franklin at Marquette University Law School agreed that such results have been consistent. It’s worth noting that some other recent polls didn’t ask specifically about a background check for every gun sale, but they asked similar questions and got similar results: Pew Research Center (March 2017): ""Please indicate whether you would strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks."" Favor or strongly favor: 84 percent. CNN/ORC (June 2016): ""Would you generally favor or oppose a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony?"" Favor: 92 percent. We’ll also note that in July 2016, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said: ""Ninety percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales."" PolitiFact National’s rating was True. Our rating Abele says 90 percent of Americans ""support universal background checks"" for gun purchases. ""Universal"" is the term for background checks to be done on every gun sale. We found support for that policy at 94 percent in the latest national poll. Support ranged between 84 percent and 89 percent in the four other most recent polls. Experts say support at or near 90 percent has been consistent for years. For a statement that is accurate and has nothing significant missing, our rating is True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA20F40>],/factchecks/2017/oct/03/chris-abele/do-90-americans-support-background-checks-all-gun-/

Donald Trump says Luther Strange gained many points after endorsement, but evidence is weak
","The defeat of Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., in a Sept. 26 runoff election was a blow for President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Strange over his Republican rival Roy Moore. Strange’s loss even led Trump to delete several of his pro-Strange tweets shortly after the election. But Trump didn’t drop the subject, tweeting a few days later, ""In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!"" In analyzing the Alabama Primary race,FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement! When we took a closer look, we found weak support for Trump’s claim. The White House pointed us to a news release from Emerson College’s polling unit, which conducted several polls of the Alabama contest. The news release announcing the results of the Emerson poll conducted Sept. 21-23 included the following analysis: ""Moore still leads Strange 50 percent to 40 percent, but the gap has narrowed. Strange trailed Moore by 14 points two weeks ago in Emerson’s previous Alabama poll … President Trump’s ardent support of Luther Strange in the recent weeks is the likely cause of the gap closing."" (Trump’s rally in support of Strange was held on the evening of Sept. 22, meaning a portion of the survey occurred after that event.) The lines from the news release don’t provide as much support as Trump seems to think they do. For starters, there’s some question whether a four-point gain merits the label ""MANY"" -- or whether it’s even mathematically significant, given that the poll had a five-point margin of error. There are also questions about the timing. The Sept. 22 rally for Strange wasn’t actually the unveiling of Trump’s endorsement -- it had been public for weeks. Trump officially endorsed Strange on Aug. 8, a point Trump glossed over in his tweet. In other words, voters who had been paying attention during either the Aug. 15 primary (which included three major Republican candidates) and the Sept. 26 runoff (which included just Moore and Strange) would have known that Strange was Trump’s endorsed candidate. Finally, focusing solely on the Emerson poll leaves out a lot of other polling data that showed little movement toward Strange after either Trump’s formal endorsement or his rally. Here’s a rundown of polls from the RealClearPolitics.com archive:   Poll Dates Moore Strange Leader in poll Primary polls WBRC-TV/ Strategy Research 7/24 - 7/24 33 35 Strange +2 RRH/PMI (R) 7/31 - 8/3 31 29 Moore +2 JMC Analytics 8/5 - 8/6 30 22 Moore +8 Trump endorsement 8/8 Trafalgar Group (R) 8/8 - 8/10 35 23 Moore +12 Emerson 8/10 - 8/12 29 32 Strange +3 Trafalgar Group (R) 8/12 - 8/13 38 24 Moore +15 Runoff polls Emerson 9/8 - 9/9 40 26 Moore +14 Gravis 9/21 - 9/22 48 40 Moore +8 Trump rally for Strange in Alabama 9/22 Emerson 9/21 - 9/23 50 40 Moore +10 0ptimus 9/22 - 9/23 55 45 Moore +10 Trafalgar Group (R) 9/23 - 9/24 57 41 Moore +16   These 11 polls show little convincing evidence that Trump’s official endorsement or his rally moved the needle for Strange. One Emerson poll, taken just after Trump’s official endorsement from Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, showed Strange up by three points. That was 11 points better than his eight-point deficit in the last pre-endorsement poll. However, in context, that Emerson poll looks like an outlier. To believe that Strange was really up by three points at that stage of the contest would require dismissing two polls by the Republican firm the Trafalgar Group that bookended the Emerson poll by two days on each side. One had Moore ahead by 12, while the other had Moore ahead by 15. As for polls after the rally, those undertaken at least partially afterward showed high and expanding leads for Moore. Indeed, if you look at the actual ballots cast -- the only vote that really counts -- Moore ended up outpacing Strange by an even wider margin in the runoff. ""Moore’s edge over Strange grew from six points in the first round to nine in the second, so the actual votes suggest that Trump did not help Strange close the gap on Moore,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Kondik also pointed to analysis of data from the polling firm 0ptimus by the Republican firm Firehouse Strategies. The analysis found that even as knowledge of Trump’s endorsement of Strange became better known among the electorate, Moore’s margin grew, from seven points on Sept. 13 to 10 points on Sept. 24, two days before the election. ""We can concretely say that Donald Trump’s endorsement and active campaigning for Sen. Strange had absolutely no impact on the ballot,"" Firehouse Strategies concluded. Trump tweeted that in the recent Alabama Senate runoff, ""the candidate I endorsed (Luther Strange) went up MANY points after endorsement!"" Trump can point to one poll that showed Strange narrowing Moore’s lead by four points after his rally. But other polling data doesn’t back this up, and his tweet glosses over the fact that he had announced his endorsement weeks earlier and that the increase in that one poll is so modest as to be within the margin of error. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDDA2100>],/factchecks/2017/oct/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-luther-strange-gained-many-point/

Paul Krugman wrongly tweets about cholera in Puerto Rico
","In the span of six hours, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted then retracted the claim that cholera had been reported on Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Conservative websites came down hard on Krugman for his error, taking it as a case study of mainstream media spreading fake news. There’s no question that Krugman was wrong. Here’s how the episode played out. At about noon on Sept. 30, Krugman tweeted, ""Cholera. In a US territory. Among US citizens. In the 21st century. Heckuva job, Trumpie."" Cholera is spread by bacteria in dirty water and can bring on severe diarrhea, so severe, it can even be fatal. Within minutes, people peppered Krugman with tweets asking for his source and noting that that were no confirmed cases of cholera. A University of New Hampshire journalism professor wrote, ""UPDATE (please share): Cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico is UNCONFIRMED at this time."" About six hours after the initial tweet, Krugman retracted his claim. ""OK, cholera not confirmed,"" he wrote. ""Conjunctivitis yes; lack of clean water (situation worsening, not improving) makes it a risk. But not certain."" OK, cholera not confirmed. Conjunctivitis yes; lack of clean water (situation worsening, not improving) makes it a risk. But not certain About half an hour before Krugman sent out his correction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tweeted, ""CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria."" CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria. #MariaPR https://t.co/dzSnsaj50u Krugman’s original tweet was shared over 14,000 times. The correction was retweeted 567 times (as of this writing). We were curious about where this rumor came from and asked Krugman. He said he saw it in a tweet from Kurt Eichenwald and ""was far too quick to assume it was validated."" Kurt Eichenwald, a liberal commentator and contributing editor to Vanity Fair, tweeted on Sept. 29, ""Cases of cholera now being reported in Puerto Rico. I can’t believe this is America. We're too incompetent or uncaring to get them water?"" That tweet was retweeted more than 13,000 times. We found no retraction by Eichenwald on Twitter. Warnings for the potential for cholera had been bouncing around the web. A couple of days before Krugman’s tweet, the liberal information and political action website Daily KOS included and then retracted reports of the disease.  The corrected headline for a Sept. 28 blog post said ""SOS Puerto Rico: The suffering continues; Update: Cholera cases possible (not confirmed)."" At the end of the post, was this note: ""An earlier version of this diary included a Tweet saying that cases of cholera had been reported. Given the facts of the ground — including, particularly, the lack of clean drinking water — this is definitely a possibility.  Importantly, though, I have been unable to find confirmation of the information in that Tweet. I should not have posted it as fact, and have updated the title."" The Daily Beast had an article that underscored the potential for an eruption of cholera. Under the headline ""Outbreaks begin in Puerto Rico while Trump tweets ‘amazing job’,"" was the warning ""mayors and a top physician tell The Daily Beast the island faces deadly outbreaks of cholera and hepatitis unless the federal government surges help."" The earliest tweet we found that declared that people had cholera in Puerto Rico came on Sept. 27 from a man in Boston who wrote, without any supporting evidence, that ""Reports of cholera already breaking out."" Conservative websites took Krugman to task. ""NYT’s Paul Krugman falsely blames ‘Trumpie’ for non-existent cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico,"" read the Daily Caller’s headline. TownHall wrote ""No, Mr. Krugman, There is not a cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico."" And the Blaze wrote ""NYT columnist slams Trump after cholera reported in Puerto Rico — except there’s just one problem."" Krugman said that cases of cholera had been reported in Puerto Rico. By his own account, that was incorrect. He assumed someone he trusted had verified the facts and the person hadn't.  Health care professionals raised the concern that massive damage to the water supply system increased the risk of cholera, but that falls well short of an actual outbreak. While references to a cholera outbreak littered the twittersphere, those accounts were being rejected two days before Krugman’s tweet.

Sen. James Lankford's misleading comparison about NFL protests, firing of high school football coach
","What’s the difference between a football coach kneeling in prayer and an NFL player taking a knee in protest? A reader asked us to look into this question after Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., suggested the two were being treated differently under the law at a press conference on Sept. 25, 2017. ""Now the First Amendment’s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can’t say to one football coach, you’re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest at a game, you’re celebrated,"" Lankford said. Is the First Amendment setting a double-standard being set when it comes to kneeling and football games? Not quite. Lankford’s comparison is misleading, as the First Amendment is only applicable to one of these cases. In addition, he doesn’t have all of the facts straight. Lankford said high school coaches have kneeled in silent prayer and have ""been fired."" There’s one case that fits the description, though it’s wrong to say the coach in question was fired. Lankford was referring to Joseph Kennedy, an assistant football coach at Bremerton High School in Bremerton, Wash. Kennedy led students in locker-room prayers before and after most games and prayed on the 50-yard line after games. He also gave motivational speeches on the 50-yard line that he said ""likely constituted prayers,"" according to subsequent court documents. ""Students, coaches, and other attendees from both teams were invited to participate. During the speeches, the participants kneeled around Kennedy, who raised a helmet from each team and delivered a message containing religious content,"" according to court documents. The school only let him pray on the 50-yard line after students and parents had left the field, which he did for awhile, but eventually returned to praying before they departed. When it came time for annual review, ""the athletic director recommended that Kennedy not be rehired because Kennedy ‘failed to follow district policy’ and ‘failed to supervise student-athletes after games due to his interactions with (the) media and (the) community,’"" according to court documents. In the end, Kennedy wasn’t fired. After his contract expired, alongside the five other assistant football coaches’ year-long contracts, the district opened up his position and Kennedy did not reapply. Instead, Kennedy ""sought an injunction ordering the district to ‘cease discriminating against him in violation of the First Amendment.’"" The district court denied the injunction and the 9th Circuit panel upheld that decision. Lankford, co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, drafted a challenge to the school district in 2015 on the issue. Lankford’s office did not provide additional examples that fit the description of his claim. The First Amendment protects the expression of private citizens, which the coach would have exercised if praying in the stands or the sidelines, according to Gene Policinski, chief operating officer of the Newseum’s First Amendment Center. Students (in this case comparable to the NFL players) are free to pray silently, but as public employees, coaches are only allowed to do so under circumstances in which they don’t offer an overt endorsement of their religious views. ""When Kennedy kneeled and prayed on the 50-yard line immediately after games while in view of students and parents, he spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen, and his speech therefore was constitutionally unprotected,"" the 9th Circuit wrote in its opinion denying Kennedy’s injunction claim. The court found that Kennedy ""took advantage of his position to press his particular views upon the impressionable and captive minds before him."" While there may be disagreements with the court’s ruling (like Lankford’s), the key distinction between the coach’s case and NFL players is that restriction of free speech by the First Amendment only applies to the former, as it constitutes government action. The First Amendment doesn’t apply to a privately owned company like the NFL. When kneeling, NFL players are acting as private individuals, so they enjoy the same free speech and free exercise rights that Kennedy’s players would enjoy. However, the First Amendment isn’t enough to protect them against their employers because their employers aren't the government. Only state laws, and in some cases employment contracts, can rein in the limits set by their employer, experts told us. ""It does not violate the First Amendment for a private employer (or for customers/fans) to disapprove of an employee's speech,"" said Richard Garnett, a law professor at Notre Dame University. So while some fans may celebrate players’ kneeling in protest, it’s up to the NFL whether to take action.  Lankford said, ""Now the First Amendment’s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can’t say to one football coach you’re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest to a game, you’re celebrated."" His complaint of the First Amendment’s double standard is misleading because the First Amendment only applies to government action, or the public high school football coach. The First Amendment doesn’t protect NFL players’ speech, which is under the purview of their employer. Additionally, the football coach Lankford discussed wasn’t fired; he failed to reapply once his contract ended. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB5C180>],/factchecks/2017/oct/02/james-lankford/sen-james-lankfords-misleading-comparison-about-nf/

Cook County soda tax should make a dent in consumption
","Is Cook County’s new sweetened drink tax about public health or about money? Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, the architect of the tax, has said she rejects the premise of that question. ""In my view, this isn’t a vote to repeal or keep a revenue source we already approved,"" Preckwinkle told the City Club of Chicago on Sept. 13. ""It’s about whether or not we want Cook County to be healthier, safer and more efficient or if we are willing to go backwards and let Cook County become sicker, less safe and less efficient."" Voting to repeal the tax, as may happen at the Cook County Board’s Oct. 11 meeting, would be voting ""to fire frontline health care providers: doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who help serve our most vulnerable patients,"" Preckwinkle said. In an Aug. 22 interview on ""Chicago Tonight,"" Preckwinkle had offered another defense. ""Our Cook County hospital system spends $200 million a year or more treating sugar consumption related diseases,"" she said, noting also that 87 percent of county government’s budget goes into health care. ""Obesity, heart disease, diabetes, tooth decay. That’s a tremendous burden on our health care system. And we are facing a public health care crisis in this country related to sugar consumption."" As public fury has raged over the penny-an-ounce tax, Preckwinkle has scrupulously avoided discussing the issue on either its health or fiscal aspects alone. Enter Michael Bloomberg. The billionaire former New York mayor and unabashed supporter of measures to limit sweetened drink consumption has become a major defender of the Cook County tax and the county officials who voted for it. He’s spent more than $5 million on ads touting the health benefits of the tax and funded a website, cookcountyhealthykids.org, that makes a claim county officials have avoided. ""The soda tax can make a difference by reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages that contribute to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and other serious medical conditions,"" the site says. Does adding a penny per ounce to the cost of sweetened drinks cause a decrease in their consumption? As debate rages over the soda tax, we decided to check. When Cook County began collecting its tax on Aug. 2, it became only the sixth jurisdiction in the United States to collect an excise tax on sweetened drinks and only the second to include artificially sweetened drinks. Two more cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have soda taxes scheduled to begin Jan. 1, 2018. The first excise tax on sugar-sweetened soft drinks went into effect in Berkeley, Calif., on March 1, 2015. Governments have long levied so-called ""sin taxes"" on certain commodities, products and activities, ostensibly to offset their social costs while also raking in new revenue. Taxes on sweetened drinks are the latest effort by health advocates like Bloomberg to bring them into the ""sin tax"" category for their role in America’s obesity problem. But soft drink consumption is deeply entrenched in American culture, and the soft drink industry and many consumers have yet to accept the ""sin"" label for this tax. Given the recent nature of soda taxes, there’s not a deep reservoir of academic research on their effects. And we should note here that the soft drink industry rejects the basic premise of Bloomberg’s statement -- that any reduction in an individual’s soft drink consumption is a step toward better health. A study published in April by the Oakland Calif.-based Public Health Institute and the University of North Carolina found that sales of taxed beverages dropped 9.6 percent in the first year while sales of untaxed drinks rose 3.5 percent. But the researchers noted that Berkeley is not a typical test market because it consumed only 34 percent of the national average for sugar-sweetened beverages. ""Population-based findings on (sugar-sweetened beverage) consumption were not definitive, and consumption should be further evaluated in more typical communities and with larger samples,"" the authors wrote. A study published in September 2016 in the American Journal of Public Health found that sugar-sweetened drink consumption in Berkeley decreased by 21 percent. That study was limited to low-income neighborhoods. The Public Health Institute study, like studies planned for Cook County and Oakland, Calif., was funded in part by Michael Bloomberg’s Bloomberg Philanthropies. This gets into what has been a thorny issue in the broader debate over the health implications of sweetened drinks, in which researchers have found that studies funded by the soda industry consistently find minimal adverse effects from sweetened drink consumption while independent studies consistently find the opposite. Bloomberg’s involvement in this early research may invite criticism from opponents of the taxes. Mexico, which instituted a 10 percent tax on soda in 2014, saw soda purchases decline steadily through the year, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. Sales declined by 6 percent early in the year and continued to decline to 12 percent by year’s end. That study also was funded partly by Bloomberg. A study published in November 2016 in the journal PLOS Medicine used the Mexican sales declines recorded in the British study and projected reduced soda consumption due to the tax ""will likely prevent approximately 189,300 new cases of type 2 diabetes, 20,400 incident strokes and heart attacks, and 18,900 deaths over 10 years among adults 35–94 years of age."" Researchers used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, which has been used since the 1980s to estimate health benefits in the U.S., to create the report’s 10-year projection. In another modeling study, Harvard researchers projected that a penny-per-ounce nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in the U.S. ""could substantially reduce (obesity) and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy."" Less than two months into the Cook County tax, evidence of its effect on sweetened drink consumption is largely anecdotal but appears to support Bloomberg’s claim. ""We have received reports from retailers in Cook County of lost sales between mid-40 percent near the border and teens near city center. Likewise, there are reports of significant increases in sales in collar counties that are very close to matching,"" Rob Karr, president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association said in an email. ""It is VERY difficult to get retailers to openly share such information as it is highly proprietary. They are scared to death of conclusions that competitors or others may draw with such data given the extraordinarily competitive nature and extremely narrow margins in grocery."" Can the Tax, a group that opposes the tax, said in August that the tax had an immediate effect on sales, especially at stores near the Cook County border. Sales data during the beverage tax’s first weekend provided by three retailers for 21 total Cook County stores is alarming. Every store reported a decline in sales of at least 6 percent and as much as 39 percent,"" said an Aug. 17 press release. ""Further, declines in beverage sales for stores near the Cook County border were among the highest reported amid concerns of mass consumer flight to Indiana and the collar counties as residents try to avoid paying the tax."" For retailers, the decline is bad news. For supporters like Bloomberg, it’s a credible signal of less consumption. Unknown, however, is to what extent sales lost in Cook County are replaced by purchases in either the collar counties or in Indiana. If there’s a case study for Cook County’s sweetened drink tax, it might be Philadelphia. The city council there approved a 1.5-cent-per-ounce sweetened drink tax that went into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, with proceeds earmarked for pre-K education, parks and libraries. In its first six months, the tax generated $39.3 million -- short of both the original $42.6 million projection and a revised estimate of $39.7 million. A study there in August by the Florida marketing firm Catalina said sales had dropped 55 percent since the tax, while sales of carbonated soft drinks outside city limits had increased 38 percent. But city officials say the study is flawed because it looked only at retail sales, which account for less than half of total sales, and because the tax could not have generated $39.3 million if all sales had dropped 55 percent. Bloomberg said Cook County’s sweetened beverage tax can bring health benefits by ""reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages."" Cook County is only the sixth jurisdiction in the U.S. to enact a sweetened drink tax since Berkeley, Calif., enacted the first one in March 2015. That means there’s been very little formal research on their effects, which makes proving or disproving Bloomberg’s claim difficult. Academic research in Berkeley and on Mexico’s soda tax has shown declines in sales, however. Anecdotal evidence from tax opponents in Illinois appears to show the same here, as does a recent marketing report in Philadelphia. Studies using modeling schemes to project health outcomes based on reduced consumption also tilt in Bloomberg’s favor. Cook County’s soda tax may not survive long enough to become part of the extended field study needed to judge the health effects of similar efforts nationwide. But there’s enough evidence out there to rate Bloomberg’s statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD0B900>],/factchecks/2017/oct/02/michael-bloomberg/cook-county-soda-tax-should-make-dent-consumption/

Do some states have more opioid prescriptions than residents?
","New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said prescribers in some states have been so lenient that they have given out more prescriptions than there are residents in those states. With 33,091 opioid-related deaths in 2015 across the country, the ease in getting prescriptions for the painkillers has become an issue attracting attention from state officials. ""Some states hardest hit by the crisis have more opioid prescriptions than residents,"" Schneiderman said at a press conference. Twenty-three states have a higher rate of opioid overdose deaths than New York state. But is Schneiderman right that some of those states have more opioid prescriptions than residents? National numbers Eight states reported more opioid prescriptions than residents in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Alabama recorded the highest rate, with 125 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people in the state. Even so,  Alabama had a lower rate of opioid-related deaths than most other states, according to Centers for Disease Control data analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization.  Two other top prescribing states — West Virginia and Kentucky — had some of the highest rates of opioid related deaths. West Virginia had the highest rate in the country, with 36 opioid deaths for every 100,000 residents. The state reported 111 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents. Kentucky,  ranking sixth with 21 deaths for every 100,000 residents, had 102 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2015. West Virginia’s rate decreased in 2016 to 96 prescriptions for every 100 people. Kentucky’s went down to 97 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people. Alabama remained highest with 121 prescriptions for every 100 people.    New York state numbers New York state had 42 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2016. There were no counties in New York with more opioid prescriptions than residents, according to the state Department of Health. Montgomery County had the highest rate in the state with 82 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents in the county. The county had two opioid deaths for one of the lowest opioid-related death rates in the state. Our ruling Schneiderman said some states hit hardest by the opioid crisis ""have more opioid prescriptions than residents."" West Virginia and Kentucky — two states with the highest rates of opioid deaths in the country — reported more opioid prescriptions than their respective population, according to CDC data. Six other states had more prescriptions than residents, too.

Has Gavin Newsom ‘flip-flopped’ on California’s high-speed rail?
","High-speed rail has wedged itself into the 2018 campaign for California governor, splitting the current top two Democrats in the race. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom — the frontrunner in the race — has essentially flip-flopped in his support for the state’s controversial and costly rail project. Here’s what Villaraigosa told the Sacramento Bee on Sept. 20, 2017: Newsom was ""for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again."" He added that Newsom was revising his positions ""when the winds blow in his direction."" Given the key decisions California’s next governor will need to make on high-speed rail, we wanted to know whether Newsom has really shifted this much in his support for the massive project. We hopped aboard for a fact-check. Background on the bullet train In 2008, California voters approved a nearly $10 billion bond to jump-start the development of a high-speed rail network. Plans called for trains to zip across the state at 200 miles per hour, initially connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles and eventually extending the system to Sacramento and San Diego. Cost estimates for the project, however, have see-sawed from an initial $33 billion to $98 billion to $64 billion. The project has also fallen far behind schedule with construction limited to a small segment in the Central Valley. We asked Villaraigosa’s campaign for evidence of Newsom’s shifting positions. As examples of his initial support, it pointed to news articles showing Newsom backing the 2008 bond measure. The campaign then cited a 2014 radio interview that it says proves Newsom opposed the project. Finally, it cited articles from October 2016 in which the lieutenant governor again pledged his support. ""We absolutely need this,"" Newsom said of high-speed rail in a 2007 Mercury-News article. In February 2014, however, Newsom was asked by conservative radio host Ben Shapiro: ""Are you pro or against the train, especially now that the California public, which approved the train in the first place, has reneged and no longer likes the train?"" Newsom responded: ""I think I’m where the public was and is.""  A poll in September 2013 found 52 percent of Californians wanted the rail project stopped and 51 percent felt it was a waste of money. Newsom went on to tell Shapiro:""We don’t have the federal dollars we were hoping for ... the private sector hasn’t stepped up.""  Shapiro then asked: ""If you had your druthers, Gavin, would you kill the thing?"" Newsom responded: ""I would take the dollars and redirect it to other, more pressing infrastructure needs. … I am not the only Democrat that feels this way. I gotta tell you, I am one of the few that just said it publicly. Most are now saying it privately."" This exchange gave many the impression Newsom had backed away from the project. Newsom did not clarify in the interview what kind of funds should be redirected. In October 2016, Newsom told the Sacramento Press Club that he would ""100 percent"" seek a solid funding source for the train project if he's elected governor in 2018. The Associated Press took that to mean he again supported the project. A March 2017 poll found Californians remain divided over high-speed rail, with 48 percent favoring the project and 46 percent opposed. The survey added that 66 percent say they would favor high-speed rail if it cost less than the current estimate of $64 billion over the next 20 years.  In this Feb. 26, 2016, file photo, the supports for a 1,600-foot-viaduct to carry high-speed rail trains across the Fresno River are seen under construction near Madera, Calif. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)  Newsom’s response Dan Newman, Newsom’s campaign spokesman, described Villaraigosa’s claim about shifting positions this way: ""The statement is extremely misleading at best,"" he said in an email. ""Villaraigosa is simply trying to score political points with a disingenuous cheap shot, by blithely ignoring the fact that the project being discussed today is significantly different than what voters supported in 2008."" The spokesman said Newsom has ""never opposed"" high-speed rail. Instead, Newsom publicly scrutinized the project’s business plan when cost estimates ballooned to nearly $100 billion and questioned Gov. Jerry Brown’s plans to use cap and trade funds for it, the spokesman said. ""Scrutinizing the business plan is very different from opposing (high-speed rail),"" Newman added. He said Newsom’s comment in the 2014 radio interview about redirecting money away from the project was referring to redirecting cap and trade money away from it, not the state bond money passed by voters. He said a statement from Newsom’s office in March 2014 clarifies Newsom’s consistent support even as he questioned the project’s finances: ""The lieutenant governor has long supported high speed rail and still does, but this project in its current form gives him pause,"" Newsom’s spokeswoman Andrea Koskey, told Buzzfeed News for an article on March 27, 2014. He added that Newsom’s statements of support in more recent years are also consistent with previous comments. Experts we spoke with were split on the claim. Sacramento State Political Science Professor Wesley Hussey said Villaraigosa’s claim about Newsom vacillating on the project isn’t right. ""I don't think it's a fair assessment,"" the professor said in an email.""Newsom came out several years ago with serious doubts about the high speed rail, but I don't think he's ever said definitely he would stop the program if he became governor. Maybe he fluctuates from lukewarm to a soft no, but that's not the same as consistently changing his opinion."" Key to our assessment, however, was the 2014 radio interview and Newsom’s own admission that he agreed with the growing public sentiment that opposed the train at that time. We spoke with one more expert. Lou Thompson is chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Group, an independent oversight group that issues reports to the Legislature on the project. He declined to comment about whether he believed Newsom had definitely switched his stance on high speed rail. Thompson said, however, that redirecting cap and trade money away from the project in 2014, as Newsom suggested doing, would have made the project’s future ""a lot more difficult."" Asked whether such a move would have effectively killed the project, Thompson said: ""I don’t know what other source of money they would have found."" He described cap and trade money as the key revenue source for the project both then and now, given the restrictions on other sources, including the bond funds. Our rating Villaraigosa claimed Newsom has essentially flip-flopped in his support for California’s high-speed rail, saying he was ""for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again."" Villaraigosa’s campaign cited articles showing Newsom strongly backed the project a decade ago. It also pointed to a radio interview in 2014 in which Newsom admitted that he shared the public’s growing opposition to high-speed rail. He also suggested redirecting funds away from the project, a move that the head of the project’s oversight panel said would have made building high-speed rail ""a lot more difficult."" A spokesman for Newsom’s campaign defended the candidate’s stance, saying Newsom has scrutinized project costs as they have soared beyond initial estimates. He said, however, that Newsom has never turned his back on high-speed rail. We found Villaraigosa pointed to key evidence, particularly the 2014 radio interview, that shows Newsom’s stance had shifted, at least for that moment in time. In fairness to Newsom, he’s consistently expressed concern that the project no longer represents what voters supported in 2008 and that his main worry was its cost. Villaraigosa’s statement could have used this additional information. We rate his claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Fake photo shows Seattle Seahawks player Michael Bennett burning American flag
","A photograph plastered on a Facebook page that allegedly supports President Donald Trump purported to show an NFL player burning an American flag in the locker room, but it has very clearly been manipulated. An image posted on the ""Vets for Trump"" Facebook page on Sept. 28, 2017, showed Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett shirtless and holding a United States flag that has been set ablaze. Teammates, coaches and staff appear to be cheering Bennett on in the background. ""#Seattleseahawks - no more NFL,"" the caption on the post read. Commenters were outraged by the photo, with one person declaring ""burning the Flag that I shed my blood to honor would be just cause to whack you upside your ignorant disrespectful head."" Another ironically wrote that he ""couldn't even in good conscious photo shop such a picture."" The Vets for Trump Facebook page didn’t accept messages or list phone or email information. It listed as contact information the website VeteransForDonaldTrump.com, a domain registered to someone named Vladimir Lemets.   Trump targeted the NFL after a handful of players had decided to kneel during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, as a protest against racism in America. Trump demanded on Twitter that NFL players ""stop disrespecting our Flag & Country"" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand. More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand the following weekend to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism. Both the Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans chose not to stand on the field for the national anthem during their Sept. 24 game in Nashville (all but one member of the Pittsburgh Steelers chose not stand on the sideline for the song, either). But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day. Looking at the photo more closely, it’s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn’t appear to be giving off smoke. The real proof that the image is fake is that it is actually close to two years old, at least. It appeared in a tweet from the Seahawks on Jan. 3, 2016, and is credited to Rob Mar on the team’s website. What do you do in the victory locker room? You victory dance.#SEAvsAZ pic.twitter.com/qJoVyG6ZM8 For the record, Bennett did speak out on the Trump controversy. He said at a CNN town hall event on Sept. 27 that the protests were ""about treating people like human beings."" ""The changes start with the heart,"" he said. ""This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing. Change the culture."" Trump’s feud has led to other fake claims beyond this one. We previously checked claims that the NFL fined Steelers players $1 million each and that Fox Sports refused to broadcast games ""until players respect the flag."" We rated both Pants On Fire! That’s the only thing burning about this claim, too.

Did taxes go up by 41 percent between 2013 and 2016?
","As Congress prepared to debate a high-stakes tax bill, a reader asked us to check a letter about tax policy emailed by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ""A new report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2016 Americans spent more on taxes than they did on food and clothing combined,"" Smith wrote. ""In fact, taxes were the second-largest expenditure of American families. The average tax bill for Americans in 2016 was a 41 percent increase from 2013."" We zeroed in on the final assertion in that paragraph. Spread over a three-year period, a 41 percent bump in taxes would be significant.  We found that even though Smith's factoid comes from a federal agency, it is a flawed comparison, and it fails to capture accompanying growth in income as well as other statistics that show the tax burden increased by a more modest amount. Smith’s office confirmed that the statistic comes from the most recent annual installment of the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which the BLS released in late August. The specific figure that Smith cited comes from this document. Average taxes paid, according to the survey, were $7,432 in 2013, but they rose to $10,489 in 2016. That’s a 41 percent increase, as Smith wrote. One important bit of context that’s missing: This figure ignores that average income increased over the same three-year period as well. Here’s a chart summarizing income, taxes and taxes as a percentage of income.   As the chart shows, a 17 percent rise in pre-tax income explains some of the increase in taxes paid. Taxes as a percentage of income rose by 20 percent. That’s about half the 41 percent increase Smith cited. In addition, the statistic Smith cited doesn’t communicate the reality that richer taxpayers saw a much bigger increase than taxpayers of more typical means. When broken down into quintiles -- the top one-fifth of earners, the second one-fifth and so on -- the increase from 2013 to 2016 was 29.1 percent for those in the middle quintile, compared to 44.6 percent for the fifth, or highest, income quintile. That said, the survey shows a substantial increase in taxes paid overall -- an increase well beyond the growth of income. There’s an important caveat, however: The BLS told us about a stumbling block in comparing 2013 and 2016 numbers. Basically, the bureau made a methodological change that results in an exaggerated increase in taxes paid during that time period. ""There was definitely an increase, but the magnitude need to be interpreted carefully due to differences in how the (survey) measures taxes and income,"" Steven Henderson, chief of BLS’s division of consumer expenditure surveys, told PolitiFact. BLS changed its methodology in 2013, but the change was undertaken in a way that makes the 2013 figures for taxes paid lower than they were in subsequent years, Henderson said. The 2013 tax data is ""lower and less reliable for comparison to later years,"" he said. ""I interpret this to mean that it is inappropriate to compare calculated Consumer Expenditure Survey estimates of personal taxes in 2013 with the calculations for any later date,"" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, of Henderson's explanation. Is there an alternative way to assess how much taxes rose from 2013 to 2016? As it happens, there are at least two. One source is the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the U.S. Commerce Department. According to this data, taxes rose by 17 percent over the same three-year period, well below the 41 percent in Smith’s letter. And over that same period, income rose by 13 percent. This means that taxes did rise faster than income did, but only modestly. As a result, taxes as a percentage of income increased by only 3 percent between 2013 and 2016 (and the figure even fell slightly between 2015 and 2016). That’s quite a bit smaller than the 20 percent we found in the Consumer Expenditure Survey data. Here’s a summary of the Bureau of Economic Analysis data.   A second data source is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We didn’t see income data in the CBO’s tables, but we did find the total amount of tax revenues generated for 2013 to 2016. And the percentage increase in tax revenues was essentially identical to what the Bureau of Economic Analysis found -- 17 percent -- and less than what Smith had written.   Some of the contradictions in the numbers are explained by the various collection methods. The Consumer Expenditure Survey is based on a survey of a sampling of Americans -- 28,000 interviews per year, along with approximately 7,000 more detailed interactions through voluntary diaries. The Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Congressional Budget Office, by contrast, measure actual, comprehensive data reported by the federal treasury. In addition, the tax data in the Consumer Expenditure Survey is estimated by BLS from the reported income totals rather than being reported directly by the household participating in the survey. This means that the survey data is less solid than the other measures, which count actual dollars received. And the Consumer Expenditure Survey offers an average, ""typical"" case, whereas the other two sources offer total amounts of income and taxes for the country as a whole. The big takeaway? There was an increase in taxes paid in the period Smith identified. But it isn't as big as 41 percent. Smith wrote that ""the average tax bill for Americans in 2016 was a 41 percent increase from 2013."" Smith has accurately cited the results of the federal Consumer Expenditure Survey, even though he’s glossed over the simultaneous increases in income and the fact that increases for richer taxpayers drove that increase. However, the survey’s leadership acknowledged to PolitiFact that, for technical reasons, the 2013-to-2016 comparison is undercut by methodological differences. An alternative measurement using different federal data showed that taxes, after adjusting for income increases over the same period, rose by 3 percent. That’s an increase, but a more modest one. So we rate the statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8798C0>],/factchecks/2017/sep/29/lamar-smith/did-taxes-go-41-percent-between-2013-and-2016/
