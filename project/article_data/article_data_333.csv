Bachmann said Standard & Poor's downgrade proved she was right
","
If you made a list of House Republicans who were the biggest opponents of raising the debt ceiling, Michele Bachmann would be near the top.

Bachmann, R-Minn., and a Republican candidate for president, said consistently that she would not vote for an increase in the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow -- regardless of the terms of the deal.

She repeated her opposition at a Republican debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, when asked if she was concerned about the United States defaulting and not paying its debts. 

""If you had your way, the debt ceiling would not have been raised,"" said Susan Ferrechio, a debate moderator. ""What do you say to analysts who insist that Americans' investments, their 401(k)s, their college funds would have been far worse off today?""

""I think we just heard from Standard & Poor's,"" Bachmann said. ""When they dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. That's what the final word was from them. I was proved right in my position. We should not have raised the debt ceiling. And instead, we should have cut government spending, which was not done. And then we needed to get our spending priorities in order.""

Is that what Standard & Poor's said? And did the report support her position that the debt ceiling should not have been raised? Her statement was a disputed point in the post-debate analysis, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. (We should also note that her claim that the deal did not cut government spending is questionable at best. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that the deal would cut ""at least $2.1 trillion"" between 2012 and 2021.)

A little background: Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. On Aug. 5, it downgraded its credit rating for the United States one notch, from the top-rated AAA to AA+. (The other two ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, did not lower the U.S. rating.)

The Obama administration strongly objected to the ratings downgrade and disputed Standard & Poor's analysis. Others criticized the company for its performance in previous years, when it gave high ratings to mortgage securities that subsequently proved worthless. 

The downgrade didn't seem to have much effect on investors' desire to hold U.S. Treasury bonds and other securities, which are still widely perceived as safe investments. 

Bachmann said that when Standard & Poor's dropped the rating, ""what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt"" and she said it supported her position that the ceiling should not have been raised and that spending should have simply been cut. Bachmann also opposed any type of tax increases, including closing loopholes, which Democrats supported.

To fact-check Bachmann, we read Standard & Poor's original report on why it issued its downgrade. 

To put it in simple terms, Standard & Poor's had two main reasons for the downgrade: First, that the size of the U.S. debt is very large and growing, and second, that politicians seem unable to agree on what steps to take to reduce it. It called the political process ""contentious and fitful,"" and said the firm was ""pessimistic"" that the White House and Congress would be able to agree on measures to significantly reduce the debt anytime soon.

""The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy,"" the report said. 

The report does not say that the debt ceiling should not have been raised. If anything, there's an unstated assumption that increasing the debt ceiling was necessary. ""The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy,"" the report said. 

And in an interview on Fox News, Standard & Poors' managing director John Chambers seemed to express disapproval that it took so long for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. He said President Barack Obama ""characterized the political system as dysfunctional, I think that's a good word. We got to a position where we were within 10 hours of having a major cash flow problem. This is not what happens in other countries,"" Chambers said on Aug. 8.

Another official with Standard & Poor's, director Joydeep Mukherji, told POLITICO that the stability of American political institutions were undermined by the fact that ""people in the political arena were even talking about a potential default."" He didn't mention who those people were. ""That a country even has such voices, albeit a minority, is something notable,"" he added. ""This kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns.""

As to which political party was in the right, the ratings agency did not explicitly tip its hand. The report said it took no position on whether taxes should be raised or spending should be cut. 

In the Fox News interview, Chambers was asked if the tea party movement was responsible for the downgrade as Democrats alleged. He declined to take the bait and assign blame. 

""I think that there's lots of blame to go around, and what we need to come to in the United States is a way of forging consensus, so that we can take the tough choices that lie ahead, because the fiscal situation in the United States is not sustainable,"" he said.

Bachmann said that when Standard & Poor's ""dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. That's what the final word was from them. I was proved right in my position. I was proved right in my position."" 

In fact, because the debt ceiling was raised, the United States is paying its debts. What Standard & Poor's actually said was that politicians in Washington can't agree on long-term solutions for how to reduce the debt -- not that the country is or was unable to pay its debts. The notion that the report supported her position is wishful thinking. For that, we rate her statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2C0480>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-said-standard-poors-downgrade-proved-she-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says government has grown from 27 percent to 37 percent of U.S. economy
","
During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney offered statistics designed to show how much the federal government had grown over the past five decades.

Romney said that ""back in the days of John F. Kennedy, the federal government took up, along with the state and local governments, 27 percent of the economy. Today, government consumes 37 percent of the economy. We're inches away from no longer having a free economy.""

We separately checked the claim that ""we're inches away from no longer having a free economy"" here. So for this item, we’ll focus on his statistical comparison.

We found that the numbers Romney cited were close to correct -- but he also left out some important context. 
The Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the years in question:

Fiscal year 1961: 27.4 percent
Fiscal year 1962: 27.8 percent
Fiscal year 1963: 27.7 percent

Fiscal year 2009: 36.5 percent
Fiscal year 2010: 35.0 percent

Romney’s figures aren’t exact -- he could have said 28 percent under Kennedy rather than 27 percent, and 35 percent today rather than 37 percent, making it a rise of seven percentage points rather than 10. But he’s got the general trend correct.

However, using only the big-picture numbers is only part of the story. Digging deeper into the numbers provides a much fuller sense of what’s going on. For simplicity, we’ll choose the 1963 and 2010 figures for a more detailed analysis. Once again, the listed figures are expressed as a percentage of GDP and are rounded.

1963

Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 9.8 percent
Federal net interest expenditures: 1.5 percent
Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 2.6 percent
Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 2.6 percent
Federal spending in all other categories: 2.3 percent
State and local government: 8.9 percent
Total: 27.7 percent

2010

Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.1 percent
Federal net interest expenditures: 1.4 percent
Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.4 percent
Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.3 percent
Federal spending in all other categories: 1.6 percent
State and local government: 11.1 percent
Total: 35.0 percent

So let’s look at the components of government that expanded and contracted between 1963 and 2010.

Defense spending was cut almost in half as a percentage of GDP, as was ""other spending."" Net interest barely budged, while state and local government increased by about one-fifth.

But the big increases came from two categories: Social Security and Medicare, which more than tripled as a share of GDP, and other federal payments to individuals, which fell slightly short of tripling.

First, we should note that Medicare didn’t exist until 1965, so a big share of the increase Romney pointed to stems from this single program.

More important, there’s something that ties together all of these fast-growing expenditures: They are all payments made by the government to individuals.

Why is this important? It’s a question of control, says Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

These transfer payments, as they are known, ""can be more or less freely spent by private individuals,"" Burtless said. ""Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks.""

Some transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but these still allow some degree of consumer choice.

""This distinction is important for a simple reason,"" Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, ""their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted.""

In addition, he said, many government transfer payments ""are paid for with earmarked taxes – FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we’re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working.""

While these are undoubtedly government expenditures, one could argue that they are actually pass-throughs of payments from the American public to itself. And it’s worth noting that Social Security and Medicare -- the drivers of government growth -- are among the most popular of all government programs.

So how would taking this into account change the equation? If you subtract the share for federal transfer payments from figures above, it turns out that government spending as a percentage of GDP actually declined between 1963 and 2010, from 22.5 percent to 19.3 percent.

And this trend is confirmed if you use a different data set. The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes statistics that break down the components of national GDP. If you take the category ""government consumption expenditures and gross investment"" for all levels of government -- a figure that doesn’t include transfer payments -- and divide it by GDP, government accounted for 22.0 percent of GDP in 1963 and 20.7 percent of GDP in 2010.

So Romney’s numbers are nearly correct, but they don’t tell the whole story. 
Yes, government spending has risen as a share of GDP, but the actual control on spending exerted by government has not risen by anywhere near that amount, because the bulk of the growth has come in transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with). On balance, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972DA800>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-government-has-grown-27-percent-37-per/
"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Kevin DeWine']","
Ohio GOP chairman Kevin DeWine blames Democrats for drop in credit rating
","
Even before financial markets had a chance to react, the blame game started over Standard and Poor's decision to lower the credit rating of the United States government from AAA status to AA-plus.

The Obama administration reacted to the downgrade with indignation, finding flaws in S&P's calculations and analysis. Democrats and Republicans began finger-pointing that was not limited to Washington.

Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine issued a statement blaming Obama for what he called a ""Democrat downgrade.""

""President Obama and Democrats' spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country's AAA credit rating,"" he said.

PolitiFact has repeatedly checked statements in recent months about ""maxing out the U.S. credit card,"" and found significant exaggeration. Although Democrats shoulder a fair amount of blame for the nation's fiscal woes, so do Republicans because they voted for tax cuts and additional spending that also contributed to the large deficits.

What is new in DeWine's statement is what attracted our attention: the label of ""Democrat downgrade"" on S&P's rating.

We asked the Ohio GOP how it backed up the claim, and it cited about two dozen sources.

One was a PolitiFact story that referred to Obama as ""the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents."" (Which, the story went on to say, ""goes to show that statistics can be used -- and misused -- to bolster almost any argument."")

The other sources, mostly commentaries, fault Obama's leadership on the economy, tie Democrats to spending or speculate on the political damage to Obama and Democrats from the downgrade. One citation is a story from Politico saying that Obama ""is now firmly part of the landscape that S&P trashed"" -- after the story says he was ""dragged by Hill Republicans into the endless fiscal and personal nightmare that was the debt ceiling debate.""

We think the best way to determine what's in the S&P report is to read it. It's available to anyone online.

""We lowered our long-term rating on the U.S.,"" the report says, ""because we believe that the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and fitful process.""

In other words -- though S&P says it ""takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures"" that would put the country's finances on more stable footing -- the firm looked for spending to be better contained and for revenues to increase. New revenues might have helped head off a downgrade, but ""the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,"" the report says.

S&P faults ""the political brinksmanship of recent months"" for making America's governance and policymaking ""less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed.""

The firm complains that the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default ""have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy"" and that ""the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge.""


In our reading -- and in the words of the very Politico story that the GOP cites as a source -- ""S&P suggested that the Democrats are just as much a part of the problem as the Republicans.""

We repeat: Just as much.  Democrats and Republicans both. That means the one-sided label of ""Democrat downgrade"" has some element of truth -- but it ignores so much critical information that it gets a Truth-O-Meter rating of Mostly False.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Greater Wisconsin Committee']","
GOP recall candidate Jonathan Steitz ""failed to pay his taxes,"" liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee says
","
The Greater Wisconsin Committee, a liberal group active in Wisconsin politics, has asserted itself in the historic state Senate recall campaigns. In the two remaining races, which will be decided Aug. 16, 2011, it has accused Republican challengers of not paying their taxes.

In a North Woods race, the Madison-based group said tea party leader Kim Simac, who is running against Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Conover, ""was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years."" We rated that claim True.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee made a similar statement against Jonathan Steitz, a lawyer who is trying to oust Sen. Bob Wirch, D-Pleasant Prairie, in a Kenosha-based district in the state’s southeastern corner.

A headline on a flier hat the group mailed to voters Aug. 4, 2011 says:

""Jonathan Steitz failed to pay his taxes.""

The wording on that claim is much less specific than on the one against Simac. But we have been down a similar road before.

In one of the six recall races decided Aug. 9, 2011, Democratic challenger and eventual winner Jessica King said during the campaign that Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, ""didn’t pay"" his state income taxes, in contrast to average voters who declared ""we work hard, we pay our taxes."" We ruled that statement Mostly False because in the years Hopper didn’t pay the taxes, he didn’t owe any.

So, let’s dig into the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim that Steitz, who is making his first run for public office, ""failed to pay his taxes.""

The flier that makes the claim contains a footnote, which cites a Kenosha County court case. Kirk Brown, spokesman for the committee, referred us to an online court summary of the case.

The summary shows the state filed a tax warrant against Steitz in November 2003 for $1,875 plus $853 for interest and a penalty, for a total of more than $2,700. The summary also shows the warrant was paid off two months later.

Brown said that was the only evidence the Greater Wisconsin Committee relied on in claiming that Steitz failed to pay taxes.

Steitz campaign spokesman Dan Hunt said the tax warrant was issued because Steitz failed to make a sales tax payment in September 2002 for a business that he owned that staged events such as concerts. Hunt called it an oversight, saying most of the business’ work was done outside of Wisconsin, so Steitz did not have to regularly pay Wisconsin sales taxes.

Hunt also said Steitz owed -- and paid -- a total of only $260, even though the court summary indicates he owed and paid more than 10 times that amount.

We turned to Diane Hardt, a tax administrator with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. She said she could not discuss a particular taxpayer, but she said tax warrants are issued only after a taxpayer has received more than one notification that a payment is owed and only after the taxpayer is given at least 60 days to pay.

Hardt also said that when the department issues tax warrants, the amount of tax demanded of the taxpayer and reflected in court records is estimated and inflated, sometimes by as much as 10 times what ultimately is determined to be owed. Hardt said the department inflates its estimate of what will actually be owed in hopes of getting the taxpayer to respond quickly.

Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee made a flat statement -- ""Jonathan Steitz failed to pay his taxes."" There is a basis for it in that nine years ago Steitz failed to make one monthly sales tax payment for a business he owned. But the claim leaves out important details -- namely, that he paid up two months later and there is no evidence he failed to pay other taxes.

That fits our definition for Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C132740>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/gop-recall-candidate-jonathan-steitz-failed-pay-hi/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Kim Simac']","
GOP recall challenger Kim Simac says State Sen. Jim Holperin “voted against a property tax freeze” in 2009 and then voted for a “$1.5 billion property tax hike”
","
When Democrats controlled the Wisconsin Legislature in 2009, state Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) joined a one-vote majority in favor of the two-year state budget.

Now that vote is providing fodder for Republican challenger Kim Simac as she tries to knock off Holperin in the Aug. 16, 2011, recall election. Holperin was among the Democrats who faced recalls over their quorum-blocking flight to Illinois to protest Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed changes to collective bargaining.

Simac and conservatives in the other recalls have sought to contrast Walker’s austere increases in taxes and fees ($88 million) with then-Gov. Jim Doyle’s bill two years earlier ($1.9 billion in net tax and fee increases).

Simac put her own twist on it, going beyond those tax and fee increases when she criticized Holperin for raising local property taxes as part of the same budget vote in 2009.

""In 2009, (Holperin) voted against a property tax freeze. That same year he also voted for a $1.5 billion property tax hike,"" Simac said in a July letter on her website. ""The consequences of Jim Holperin’s reckless votes have been devastating to our economy and our seniors.""

Did Holperin really vote to kill a freeze and raise the burden on property taxpayers by that hefty figure?

It’s an interesting claim, because politicians at the state level take credit when they have an impact on holding down local taxes, and they get some blame for increases.

In reality, state lawmakers don’t set local property taxes; they’re voted on at the local level. But state budget decisions -- in part through limits or ""freezes"" on local taxes -- can greatly influence to what extent local schools and governments have to rely on local taxes.

The first blow in the one-two punch from Simac said Holperin opposed a tax freeze.

Her campaign, though, could not provide any evidence of a bill or budget amendment related to a tax freeze. Nor could we turn up any evidence after checking news stories and Senate amendments.

Holperin did, of course, vote against the Walker budget in 2011 that included a property tax freeze.

So that gets her off to a false start.

Now let’s look at the number.

Simac spokesman Matt Capristo pointed us to an April 2009 Legislative Fiscal Bureau report as backup for the $1.5 billion figure.

Every two years after lawmakers pass a budget, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates how much local governments might raise property taxes given the changes lawmakers made to state aid, limits on local taxes and tax credits. Property-value growth and many other variables factor in as well.

But we couldn’t find the $1.5 billion figure in the report. The section cited by the campaign estimates an increase of $478 million for 2010 over 2009 and another $528 million on top of that in 2011 over 2010.

The report offers no sum for the two-year total increase. Adding the two yearly increases means taxes in 2011 would be about $1 billion higher than in 2009.

That’s not $1.5 billion.

Simac argues it’s more accurate to compare each year’s tax total to the base year of 2009. Here’s the math: The first year is a $478 million boost, and the second-year increase is more than $1 billion if you compare taxes in 2011 to what they were two years earlier ($478 million plus $528 million).

Add the $1 billion-plus to the $478 million and that would reach $1.5 billion.

Who’s right? It depends on what question you want to answer.

Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the average taxpayer looks at it year-to-year and would probably say it’s up $1 billion in two years.

But it’s true, he added, that compared to the base year, $1.5 billion more was to be collected.

So in making the claim, Simac picked a way to look at it that generated the highest possible number.

There are other issues to consider -- with either number.

The number from two years ago was a prediction. So we now know how much local governments and schools actually raised property taxes.

The figure, according to the fiscal bureau, is about 40 percent lower than the initial projections. That calculation comes from numbers that were publicly available in June 2011 -- a month before Simac made her statement.

Of course when Holperin voted on the budget, the estimate was much higher. So, we think it’s fair to use the original estimate as a benchmark for what Holperin was willing to support.

Let’s see what we have:

Simac said Holperin voted against a property tax freeze and voted for ""a $1.5 billion property tax hike.""

She offers no evidence there was any vote on a freeze. And we could find none ourselves. On the second part of her claim, Simac cites a report that on its face does not back up the $1.5 billion figure. She uses math that an average taxpayer probably would not, but officials say it’s one way to tally up the impact.

We think it’s somewhat misleading, but not totally out of bounds, to say Holperin ""voted"" for a property tax increase. After all, state actions have a big factor in local tax levies and lawmakers know the estimated impact on local levies when they approve a budget. And Holperin voted for the 2009-11 budget, the one in question.

We rate Simac’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A8CC0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/kim-simac/recall-challenger-kim-simac-says-state-sen-jim-hol/

Jon Huntsman says he enacted a flat tax as Utah governor
","
During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman touted his record on taxes. When he was governor, he said, Utah had ""historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country.""

This isn’t the first time Huntsman has made that claim. Our PolitiFact team in New Hampshire  checked a similar comment Huntsman made at a July 4th, 2011, house party in Belmont, N.H. At that July 4 event, Huntsman said that when he was governor, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that ""cut income taxes by 30 percent.""

Since Huntsman didn’t repeat the claim that this tax changes had ""cut income taxes by 30 percent,"" we will only rate him now on the question of whether his administration ""created a flat tax in the state of Utah.""
   
When we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from this spring and from 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005.
   
""We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states,"" Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005.
   
Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years.
   
When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent.
   
This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts.
   
The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. ""Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.)
   
Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state.
   
This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis.
   
""There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study.
   
Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax.
   
The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some ""minor blemishes""' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.)
   
While we gave Huntsman a Mostly False for his previous statement, most of our downgrade stemmed from our criticism of his claim that his policies ""cut income taxes by 30 percent."" The system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors. But it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax -- a single rate for all income groups. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CD0180>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-he-enacted-flat-tax-utah-governo/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Ken Plum']","
Plum says Virginia is shirking school funding requirements
","
Del. Kenneth R. Plum says Virginia is not paying its required share for public education.

Plum, D-Fairfax, takes issue with Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell’s announcement that the state ended its budget year on June 30 with a $311 million surplus. ""To call it a surplus is misleading,"" Plum wrote in an Aug. 3 newspaper column in the Reston Connection.

Plum, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party, argued that Virginia is still in the hole because of actions it took to balance the budget during the recession, such as skipping more than $600 million in scheduled pension contributions and withdrawing $783 million from the Rainy Day Fund. He also said the state has been short-changing schools.

""How could a state that has a responsibility to fund 55 percent public education costs get by with saying it has a surplus when it is funding just 41 percent?"" Plum wrote.

Is Virginia really shirking its obligations to fund public schools? We thought we’d check.

Public education money comes from the state, localities and the federal government. Plum, a longtime lawmaker who once served on the House Appropriations Committee, told us the state law callls for Virginia to pay for 55 percent of all education costs. That statement is inaccurate and conflates complicated components of education funding.

Virginia is required by law to pay 55 percent of the costs needed to fund minimum state education guidelines called the Standards of Quality. The benchmarks, set every two years by the state Board of Education and the General Assembly, lay out pupil-teacher ratios, cover various benefit costs for educators, and mandate basic curricula.

Based on their wealth, localities are required to contribute between 17 percent and 80 percent of the cost of the standards. Each municipality’s wealthy is determined by a formula takes into account the value of its real estate, the taxable income of its residents, and its taxable retail sales. lA rich city, such as Falls Church, pays 80 percent. A poor municipality, such as Lee County in Southwest Virginia, pays 17 percent.

The amount each community contributes is adjusted so that the state pays a 55 percent overall share of the SOQ costs and localities shell out 45 percent. Because the overall contribution levels for the standards are written into the state budget, they are law. For this fiscal year, which began July 1, the state will pay a total of $6.35 billion towards meeting the SOQ requirements and localities will pay about $5.2 billion.

So the state is footing its legally required share of public education.

But most localities in Virginia are not satisfied with just attaining minimum standards and fund their schools at far greater levels than the state demands.

This is where Plum’s statistics become shaky.

When you take the total spent on public education -- not just the amount to meet minimum standards -- localities do foot most of the bill.

Plum points to a 2010 annual report from the state superintendent of education showing a total of $13.3 billion was spent on public education in fiscal 2010. Local governments paid $6.5 billion, or 49 percent; the state paid $5.3 billion, or 40 percent; and Washington kicked in $1.5 billion, or 11 percent.

A 2006 report by Senate Finance Committee said that between 1996 and 2005, localities paid 50 percent of total education costs and the state contributed 43 percent. But when it came to meeting the Standards of Quality costs, the report said the state did pay its 55 percent share.

Plum said Virginia needs to go beyond funding minimum requirements and his broad point is that the state is not living up to its commitment to fund high-caliber education. ""The Standards of Quality are totally unrealistic,"" he told us.

To sum up:

Plum says  the state is responsible for paying 55 percent of education costs but is only covering 41 percent of the cost.

His statement is based on a faulty premise that Virginia has a responsibility to pay for 55 percent of all education costs. State law merely requires Virginia to provide 55 percent of the money needed to fulfill minimum education standards. The state is meeting that demand.

Most localities are not satisfied with achieving minimum standards and fund their school systems at far greater levels than the state requires. As a result, Virginia only pays 41 percent of total education costs.

Plum mixes apples with oranges to prove the state is not meeting its education obligations. We rate his statement False.

RNC chairman says 2012 GOP convention 'is a Super Bowl times four'
","
Just how big of a deal is it that the Republican National Convention is coming to Tampa next summer?

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried to put it in perspective while speaking to local reporters on a swing through the area this month.

""This is a Super Bowl times four. This is probably the biggest event that the Tampa Bay community has ever put on thus far,"" Priebus said. The line was something of an exclamation point to Priebus' visit, becoming the focus of a local TV story that aired on Fox and a dominant quote in news coverage offered by CNN, the Associated Press and the St. Petersburg Times.

But is it true?

PolitiFact Florida decided to fact-check Priebus' claim about national political conventions to see if they are indeed four times a Super Bowl -- an event Tampa is more familiar with having hosted it several times, as recently as 2009. Where to start was aided by the context Priebus provided to reporters.

""Estimates are that $175 million outside dollars will be spent here during the convention,"" he said at one point. And at another time, he said: ""There's going to be over 45,000 people here at one time. They're going to be here for over a week every day doing different things in the community -- events, parties, gatherings, fundraisers. It's going to be extraordinary.""

A note of caution before we go any further. We're typically wary of economic impact studies because they rely on assumptions to reach their conclusions and are often attempting to predict outcomes. On top of that, they're usually paid for by groups with something to gain by presenting the data in one form or another. So, read any numbers with some skepticism.

That said, comparing the economic impact generated by a Super Bowl and a national political convention is valid and worthwhile, because you can chart the relative size and scope of one event to the other.

The Super Bowl and national political conventions are true mega-events that dramatically impact the local communities where they are held. For a few days, money and people pour into the area.

Some of the economic benefits are obvious. Hotel rooms are filled, and hoteliers can charge more for the rooms they rent. Visitors need places to eat and shop, so money is funneled into that sector of the economy. Some rent cars, others ride the Ybor City streetcar. They go to Busch Gardens, or maybe even (who knows?) the Mons Venus strip club.

Other benefits are less apparent but equally important. Money is pushed into the local economy, through taxpayer subsidies or private sources, to provide security. Some of that money -- and we're talking millions of dollars -- goes to things like barricades, vehicles and riot gear. Other funds pay for the huge overtime bills police departments will bear.

""You try, to the extent possible, to focus on the new spending in a lot of instances,"" said Patty Silverstein, an economic researcher that attempted to estimate the impact of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. ""To be honest, it can become very difficult. You have to make some very grandiose assumptions.""

PricewaterhouseCoopers has been attempting to calculate the economic impact of the Super Bowl since 1998. According to its analysis, direct visitor spending has ranged from a low of around $115 million in 2004 in Detroit, to high of $202 million in Dallas in 2011. The analysis is based on the participating teams, the attributes of the local market, national economic conditions and other factors.

Other figures, calculated either by the National Football League or the host city often peg the impact even higher -- between $300 million to $400 million, depending on the analysis. A study examining the 2009 Super Bowl in Tampa said it resulted in spending totaling $375 million.

Compare that to even Priebus' own figure that $175 million will be spent on the Republican National Convention in Tampa.

That would put the convention on par with Super Bowls according to PricewaterhouseCoopers but below a Super Bowl according to the more boosterish figures being created by the NFL and the local host committees.

Either way, not four times greater.

(A second note of caution about these dollar figures. Boosters describe the millions of dollars spent in the area as ""new"" money for the community. While that's a difficult figure to pinpoint, an even tougher figure to arrive at is how much money is not spent as a result of a mega-event, mainly by members of the local community who alter their spending habits. Many economists argue those losses negate much of the ""new"" spending, while others say that the local spending is not lost but merely reshuffled to a different time.)

Victor Matheson, an economist at the College of the Holy Cross who has studied the economic impacts of both Super Bowls and political conventions, helped us compare the two events in other ways.

More out-of-town visitors come for a Super Bowl, anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 depending on the estimate, compared to around 50,000 for a convention. But convention guests stay longer, Matheson said -- about six days on average compared to about four, according to information provided by the NFL and a study from The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University.

In the end, both events produce roughly the same number of visitor nights (guests multiplied by hotel nights): 300,000.

So, not four times greater.

And, Matheson said, the spending habits of a Super Bowl visitor and a convention visitor are typically around the same, about $400 a day.

Also, not four times greater.

The only measure that comes close when considering Priebus' claim is the number of event days -- the Super Bowl is one night, the convention is four. But even that's misleading. Anyone in Tampa, Jacksonville, Miami or any other city to host a Super Bowl knows that the week preceding the game is filled with related events and parties.

We reached out to a spokesman for the RNC but did not hear back.

Can Priebus claim a political convention is a ""Super Bowl times four""?

""No, he can't,"" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College.

Added Matheson: ""By any reasonable estimate the Super Bowl generates roughly the same amount of outside expenditure, so he is way off.""

We see no reason to disagree. Though you can debate about the overall economic impact of mega-events like the Super Bowl or a national political convention, there's no debate about the relative size of one compared to the other. They're about the same.

We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096716480>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/reince-priebus/rnc-chairman-says-2012-gop-convention-super-bowl-t/

Mitt Romney gets another Pants on Fire for saying we're 'inches away' from not being capitalist any more
","
During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney revived a line he first used in his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H.

Decrying the growth of government as a share of the economy, Romney said in Ames, ""We're inches away from no longer having a free economy.""

We gave Romney a Pants on Fire when he first used the line -- when his exact wording was, ""We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy"" -- and we see no reason to change that ruling. 
Separately we'll be checking the lead-in to this comment that Romney used in Ames -- that ""back in the days of John F. Kennedy, the federal government took up, along with the state and local governments, 27 percent of the economy. Today, government consumes 37 percent of the economy."" But here, we’ll recap our analysis of his claim that ""we’re inches away from no longer having a free economy.""

As we indicated in June, we at PolitiFact tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. So we’re not literally using a ruler to measure distances here. However, we decided that the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze.

Here are some of the statistics to consider:
       
Government spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent.
   
For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited.
       
Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is ""implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent,"" Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit.
   
And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion.
   
""It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom,"" Bartlett said. ""Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about.""
       
Here are a few other statistics to consider.
       
Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011.
  
And as we concluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage.
       
Regulation. ""One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
       
Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.)
       
However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   
Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom.
       
Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded.
       
The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the ""mostly free"" category. The only nations to be considered more ""free"" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark.
       
If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the ""mostly unfree"" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan.
       
We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way.
       
Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age.
       
""We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time,"" Steuerle said. ""The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy.""

So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank.

In June, we found this claim ridiculous. In August, we still do. Once again, we rate Romney's statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0940>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-gets-another-pants-fire-saying-were-in/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Pawlenty says Obamacare is patterned after Romneycare
","
He calls it ""Obamneycare.""

That's the word that candidate Tim Pawlenty uses to express the similarity between the 2010 national health care law signed by President Barack Obama and the 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney.

Pawlenty, a former two-term governor of Minnesota, hesitated to push that attack during a debate in June. But with the race for the Republican nomination tightening up, he made the point forcefully at the Aug. 11, 2011, debate in Ames, Iowa.

""Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts. And for Mitt or anyone else to say that there aren't substantial similarities or they're not essentially the same plan, it just isn't credible. So that's why I called it Obamneycare, and I think that's a fair label, and I'm happy to call it that again tonight,"" Pawlenty said.

So are the national health plan and the Massachusetts plan that similar? In a word, Yes.

We've explored their similarities before in previous fact-checks, when liberals have made similar statements defending the Obama plan against critics who labeled it extreme.

We'll review the two plans' similarities again here.

• Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the federal plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.

• Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The federal law sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill isn't quite a mandate. Instead, employers pay fines only if their workers qualify for tax credits to buy insurance. 

• Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve the use of voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.

• Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

• Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.

• Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. They handle the individual and small-group markets differently. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. 

Still, there are some differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law. Two of the biggest differences:

• Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. 

• Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (""Cadillac"") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things. 
We should note that the plans are so similar, we made a quiz, selecting passages from each plan to see if our readers could tell the difference. (Take the quiz yourself!)

Pawlenty said that ""Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts."" In rating that statement, we noticed that Pawlenty phrased his statement carefully. He didn't say it was the same plan, but instead said that the national law was ""patterned"" after the Massachusetts law, and they had ""substantial similarities."" He's correct that the plans, thought not completely identical, are very similar in structure. They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty; they both leave the current insurance system in place; they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid. Because his statement accurately categorized the plans as similar -- but not exactly the same -- we rate Pawlenty's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE05C0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-says-obamacare-patterned-after-romneycare/
"['Jobs', 'Workers', 'Wisconsin', 'Bob Wirch']","
In Wisconsin recall race, Dem state Sen. Bob Wirch claims he helped attract employer with 800 jobs to his district
","
Bob Wirch, one of the two Democratic state senators in Wisconsin facing a recall election Aug. 16, 2011, tells voters they should keep him in office because of his record on creating jobs in his Kenosha-based district.

But can the former factory worker and 19-year lawmaker, who is being challenged by Republican Jonathan Steitz, fairly claim part of the credit for coaxing an Illinois company to bring hundreds of jobs over the border?  

The claim is made in a flier Wirch’s campaign mailed July 25, 2011 to voters. The flier cites Uline, a national distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials, and includes this headline:

""Bob Wirch helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs.""

So, did he?

Uline describes itself as a family-owned company that employs 2,600 employees across the country. It was founded in 1980 by Dick and Liz Uihlein; Dick Uihlein is the great-grandson of the founder of the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., one of Milwaukee’s famed beer makers.

The company was headquartered in Waukegan, Ill., just south of the Wisconsin border, when it announced n June 2006 that it would expand in Pleasant Prairie, a Kenosha suburb about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. Both Wirch and Steitz, a lawyer who is making his first run for public office, live in the village.

Uline made big news in January 2008, when it announced it would move its headquarters to Pleasant Prairie and build a distribution center there, investing $100 million and employing 1,000 people by 2010. The company also said it would utilize state government incentives that were later calculated to be worth up to $18.6 million over nine years.

The Wirch campaign flier led Dick and Liz Uihlein to issue a statement in response on Aug. 3, 2011.

""We worked with a variety of state and local officials during the relocation process; however, state Sen. Wirch was not one of them,"" the couple said in the statement, noting they do not support Wirch’s campaign.

That’s a strong rebuttal to Wirch’s claim that he aided in the company’s move.

The statement also noted that a bill Wirch sponsored to help Pleasant Prairie with economic development -- which is also mentioned in his campaign flier -- was not introduced until July 2011 -- months after Uline had completed its relocation. The bill was ""by no means a determinative factor in our decision to relocate,"" the company’s statement said.

When Wirch’s bill was signed into law in August 2011, Wirch said it would lead to 800 new jobs in Pleasant Prairie being created through a future expansion at Uline and the launching of a new biotechnology business incubator, according to the Kenosha News.

But those 800 jobs are only projected, not already created, as the headline in Wirch’s campaign flier stated. Only some of the jobs are expected to come from Uline. And, in any case, they have nothing to do with Wirch’s claim that he helped Uline relocate to Wisconsin.

When asked to respond to the statement issued by Uline, Wirch said in an email to the Racine Journal Times that he had toured Uline in 2010 ""and discussed with company leadership the importance of a strong workforce and well-trained workforce.""

But touring Uline after it had relocated hardly equates to helping land the company in the first place.

Also responding to Uline’s statement, Wirch campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Kenosha News that all references to Uline would be omitted from future campaign materials. ""Sen. Wirch is very respectful of Uline’s wishes and he has no intention of misrepresenting them,"" Walzak was quoted as saying.

We asked Gillian Morris, another spokesperson for Wirch’s campaign, for evidence that Wirch helped Uline’s relocation from Illinois. She argued the statement Dick Uihlein issued was ""politically motivated"" since he had contribute to the anti-tax Club for Growth. That’s not even on point.

The statement in question from Wirch is his claim that he ""helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs."" We found there is no evidence to back the boast.

Uline brought roughly that number of jobs to Wirch’s state Senate district by the time it concluded its move from Illinois in 2010. But the company said it didn’t work with Wirch at all on the relocation. And the bill Wirch makes reference to wasn’t signed into law until long after Uline had relocated.

Wirch’s claim of helping land a big new employer is not only false but ridiculous -- or, Pants on Fire. 
Editor’s note: After this item was posted Aug. 12, 2011, Wirch’s campaign provided us additional information -- pointing to a bill other than the one cited in the original flier as evidence Wirch helped bring Uline to the area. That bill, sponsored by Wirch, allowed for business expansion in the area of Pleasant Prairie where Uline moved.

However, the bill was introduced Jan. 25, 2008 -- three weeks after Uline had already announced its relocation Uline’s chief financial officer, Frank Unick, would not comment on whether the bill played a role in the relocation.

Pleasant Prairie Village Administrator Mike Pollocoff said part of the company’s expansion could not have occurred without the bill, which also affected other companies. But by that point, Uline had already committed to the $100 million relocation. So, we feel it’s a stretch to say the bill ""helped bring"" the company to Pleasant Prairie.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC1AC0>],/factchecks/2011/aug/12/bob-wirch/wisconsin-recall-race-dem-state-sen-bob-wirch-clai/

Greater Wisconsin Political Fund says recall candidate Kim Simac was delinquent paying property taxes eight of the last nine years
","
In July 2011, when allies of state Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) hit his recall challenger, Republican Kim Simac, for failing to pay income taxes, Simac punched back -- metaphorically speaking, of course.

Simac accused her foes of believing that struggling small-business owners such as she are ""too poor to run for public office."" She blamed the troubles of her horse-training business, Great Northern Adventure Co., on the poor economy, and said she had no tax liability to pay.

The tax attack on Simac, a party activist and founder of the Northwoods Patriots, continued a few weeks later, when a union-backed group, the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund, launched a TV ad.

That ad says Simac, who has campaigned for a property tax freeze, had no credibility on the topic of taxes given her personal record. In addition to other taxes, the ad focused on property tax payments on the home Simac co-owns on the 22-acre horse ranch, saying she was ""was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years.""

To get to the bottom of the deliquency claim, we first asked the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and the related Greater Wisconsin Committee to provide their basis for the claim.

Greater Wisconsin is funded by labor and Democratic Party groups and wealthy individual donors. The Greater Wisconsin Committee has been running a pro-Holperin ad in the district in northern Wisconsin.

The group referred us to a WAOW-TV online story July 28, 2011 that reported a pattern of delinquencies. The story said Simac ""paid all outstanding property tax bills in June."" After organizing the recall against Holperin, Simac announced her intention to run in early May.

Simac campaign spokesman Matt Capristo told us Simac was never behind on her payments under Wisconsin law.

Let’s take a look.

We turned to the Vilas County treasurer’s office, which has the detail on tax payments on two properties Simac owns: a Town of Lincoln home on the horse ranch, and an undeveloped property in the City of Eagle River.

On the home and ranch -- valued at $242,000 and co-owned with her husband, Arthur -- Simac was delinquent in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010, according to records reviewed for us by Deputy Treasurer Peggy Cleveland. She paid on time in 2008.

The late payments typically involved missing the January 31 deadline. That’s when, under state law, taxes are due in full or the first of two installments must be made. In most cases, Simac paid up later in the same year. The exception was 2002 and 2003, which Simac didn’t pay until May 2004, Cleveland said.

Simac was charged -- and paid -- interest on the delinquent payments.

On the second property, the frequency of delinquent payments was exactly the same. In 2006, she paid taxes that were due in 2004 and 2005.

In Simac’s defense, Capristo said the cash flow of her tourist-related business made it impossible for her to pay in January.

""She pays it when she gets it,"" he said.

As for the timing of her payments, Capristo said property taxes are really not due in full until July 31 -- the legal deadline for the second installment payment. He added that he understood that Simac paid her taxes in time to meet that July 31 date.

But according to Vilas County tax officials, the legal deadline to pay all or at least the first installment is Jan. 31. That point is clearly backed up by state statutes and other treasurer’s offices and is stated on homeowners tax bills.

Here is a typical warning, this from a City of Milwaukee property tax bill: ""WARNING: If the first installment payment is not paid by the due date, the installment option is lost. The total tax becomes delinquent and is subject to interest and penalty charges.""

Beyond that, the records show it’s not nearly the case Simac that made her payments in every instance by July 31 of the given year, as her aide claimed.

On the property containing her home, which is the focus of the TV ad, she was two years late at one point, and made other second installments in August and November, Cleveland said records show. Three times, she made a timely January installment but was late on the second. Five times, she missed January altogether.

Records show Simac is all paid up for 2010, though she missed the January deadline on her main property. She paid in full on June 14, 2011. Her bill was $1,992 in taxes and $99 in interest.

The bottom line?

The Greater Wisconsin Committee went after recall challenger Kim Simac for having delinquent property taxes in eight of the last nine years.

Public records backed that claim. Indeed, Simac’s own understanding of the law, as articulated by her campaign, was off.

Education advocate claims New Jersey officials ""have not started or completed one single school project” in the last two years
","
Public school students are ""trapped"" in unsafe buildings, but state officials have been doing ""nothing"" to address the needed repairs. Even broken-down boilers and collapsing roofs are not being fixed.

David Sciarra, executive director of the Newark-based Education Law Center, made that claim while criticizing the New Jersey Schools Development Authority during his Jan. 5 testimony before the Assembly Budget Committee.

""These kids are trapped in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe schools every day, because (of) the school construction shut down now entering its third year. And even worse, the SDA has now – I have to say this – two years of shut down, the SDA is close to spending $90 million over the last two years on staff and overhead, many high-priced employees sitting down the street, literally doing nothing,"" Sciarra told the legislators.

""Nothing. They have not started or completed one single school project, and I’m not talking about major school renovation,"" Sciarra continued. ""I’m talking about replacing boilers, roofs.""

There’s no doubt that school officials across New Jersey have been frustrated with the SDA over stalled projects, but PolitiFact New Jersey found that Sciarra is still out of line to claim that ""nothing"" has been done to address emergency repairs.

The authority, which manages most projects in the 31 former Abbott districts, substantially completed 27 SDA-managed emergent projects during the past two years, including repairs on roofs, exterior masonry and boilers, according to SDA spokeswoman Andrea Pasquine.

""Mr. Sciarra’s statement is patently untrue,"" Pasquine said in an email.

Kristen MacLean, the authority’s director of communications, said those 27 projects were first identified by districts prior to Gov. Chris Christie taking office in January 2010, but the administration expedited the work.

Sciarra, whose organization represents students in the former Abbott districts, acknowledged in an email that projects started before the Christie administration have been completed. But he said it’s ""a virtual ‘drop in the bucket’ when compared to the hundreds of health and safety emergency projects and the major projects stopped by the Governor's shut down.""

Sciarra accused us of putting a ""political spin"" on his statement and advancing a ""political agenda.""

Now, let’s mention some specific projects in Newark and Camden.

In Newark, construction was substantially completed in 2011 on nine SDA-managed emergent projects, according to Steve Morlino, executive director of facilities management for Newark Public Schools.

Those projects included roofing work at BRICK Avon Academy; Dr. William H. Horton School; and South Street School, according to a list provided by Morlino.

Wendy Kunz, Director of Abbott Facilities Construction for the Camden school district, also pointed to a few emergent projects completed during the past two years, including replacing the roof and Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning units in 2011 at R.C. Molina Elementary School.

But those and other former Abbott districts have not received approval for hundreds of other proposed emergency repairs. Newark school officials proposed work on more than 130 emergent conditions, but they have not been approved yet to go to construction, Morlino said.

Following site visits, state officials are reviewing 300 emergent conditions identified by the former Abbott districts, Pasquine said. The districts identified more than 700 emergent conditions, but 400 of them were preliminarily rejected by the state Department of Education for not meeting the established criteria, she said.

""The results of the site visits are currently under review to identify which conditions warrant advancement as emergent projects,"" Pasquine said in the email. ""Additionally, SDA and DOE are developing a strategy for advancing those emergent conditions that require attention.""

Our ruling

Sciarra claimed authority employees ""have not started or completed one single school project,"" including ""replacing boilers, roofs.""

Hundreds of emergency repairs proposed by school officials have not been approved yet, but the authority has substantially completed other projects during the past two years, including work in Newark and Camden.

Of course, Sciarra and school officials want more done, but claiming ""nothing"" has happened is wrong. We rate the statement False.

"['Ohio', 'Congress', 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee']","
DCCC says Bob Gibbs is vacationing from Congress all but six days in January
","
Working hard, or hardly working?

That question has been asked about Congress since at least the middle of the 20th century, when Congress adopted a three-day work week (making Monday and Friday travel days) and longer sessions.

Congressional leaders keep fiddling with the calendar. Their scheduling practices, as noted by their own Congressional Research Service, have been criticized frequently for leading to ""compressed workweeks, protracted daily sessions, conflicts between floor and committee work, pressure on family life, and inefficient use of time generally.""

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, raised scheduling as an issue in a news release aimed at Rep. Bob Gibbs, a Republican from the 18th District in east-central Ohio.

The release marked the first anniversary of Gibbs' swearing-in. Identical releases targeted at least seven other first-term Republicans.

""With so much work to do to get the economy back on track and Americans back to work,"" it said, ""Gibbs is spending his one year anniversary on vacation — only working 6 days in all of January.""

PolitiFact Ohio is quite familiar with the six-day workweek. The six-day month was something new.

We asked the DCCC for verification. They referred us to the official House calendar released last month by GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It shows the House scheduled to be in session on six days in January: the 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 25th and 31st.

""Our release highlights that the primary role of a member of Congress is to serve in Congress,"" DCCC press secretary Haley Morris said. ""When folks run for office, they run to go to Washington to enact policy and vote. Under GOP majority, the House and Congressman Gibbs are spending most of their time this month on recess.""

We called Gibbs' office and asked how he has been spending his recess time. Spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood made the most of the opportunity.

""Bob has been spending time with constituents to listen to their concerns, meeting with business leaders to find out how we can best turn this economy around, and engaging with public officials to learn more about how the federal government helps or hinders their work locally,"" she said.

""The House of Representatives is often referred to as 'the People's House,' and that only remains true if the people get a voice.

""Bob Gibbs believes that best way to represent his constituents is to hear directly from them, and the best way to do that is to be out and active in the district.""

In fact, ""travel days"" and ""home district periods"" are facts of congressional life, whether the district time is used for constituent services, meetings or fundraising.

Recesses are called ""work breaks"" rather than vacations.

""To be sure, few members will head to the beach,"" The Christian Science Monitor noted last fall. ""Between fundraisers, town-hall meetings, and constituent services, they tend to work at least as hard out of session as they do in it.""  

Committees can meet and hold hearings during a recess.

And Gibbs’ congressional offices in Washington and in his Ohio district remain staffed and open, even if the House is not in session.

Cantor drew criticism for setting a light, 109-day calendar for 2012. But the scheduled 123-day calendar for 2011 became 175 days in session, according to figures the Office of the House Clerk provided. The 104-day calendar that a Democratic majority set for 2008 -- another election year -- became 119 days. House sessions have averaged 135 days since 2000.

PolitiFact won't take sides on the question of whether Congress should meet more or less frequently or has it just right.

But we think the DCCC's claim that House members are on vacation on days when no session is scheduled ignores the realities of what makes up a representative’s job.

Subcommittee meetings and fact-finding hearings? They don’t count. Solving problems raised by constituents? Doesn’t count either. Nor does time spent meeting in the district with the people they are supposed to represent.

And it’s important to remember, too, that the legislative calendar isn’t set by the individual members. The calendar for all is set by Cantor and congressional leadership.

That means that the gauge the DCCC has applied here would support making the same claim about just six working days in January for every Democratic member, too, from minority leader Nancy Pelosi to Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Somehow we doubt they are making those claims.

When a claim is not accurate, it earns a rating of False.

But when the statement also makes a ridiculous claim, as this one does, it’s time to turn up the heat on the Truth-O-Meter: Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D968C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-bob-gibbs-vacationing-congress-all-six-d/

McEachin says McDonnell plan uses education money to fix roads
","
Democrats say Gov. Bob McDonnell wants to take money away from public schools and spend it on roads.

At issue is the Republican governor’s proposal to increase the share of the state’s sales tax that is earmarked for road maintenance from .5 percent of a purchase to .55 percent. McDonnell says it would generate an extra $110 million for highway upkeep over the two-year budget cycle that starts July 1.

That would be the first step of an eight-year plan by the governor to gradually increase the road maintenance share of the sales tax to .75 percent.  

The General Assembly will vote on the measure this winter and Democrats -- who are a minority in the House and, arguably, in the Senate -- are vowing stiff opposition. The governor’s proposal amounts to ""taking money out of our classrooms to pave roads,"" Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said Jan. 11 in the Democratic response to McDonnell’s State of the Commonwealth address.

Is McEachin right? Let’s start with a little background.

The state has a 5 percent sales tax, or five cents on every $1 of purchase. As we’ve noted, a half-penny of that levy goes to highway maintenance. But the lion’s share -- the remaining 4.5 cents, helps support the state’s general fund, which pays for education, health programs and public safety.

The general fund is expected to amass $34.6 billion over the two-year budget cycle starting July 1. McDonnell, in keeping with recent budget standards, has proposed that almost 30 percent of the fund -- $10.3 billion -- be spent in classrooms.

Now, let’s return to McEachin. Our calls to him were referred to the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus. We spoke to two caucus officials: Steve Pazimino, the executive director, and Katie Mulhall, the press secretary. They justified McEachin’s claim with this contention: It is impossible to take an additional portion of the sales tax out of the general fund without impacting education.

McDonnell, over the next two years, would divert $110 million traditionally earmarked for the general fund and spend it on transportation. Schools would lose about a 30 percent share of that money, or $33 million. That comes to about three-tenths of 1 percent of the money the state spends in classrooms.   

And remember, that would be the first step in McDonnell's eight-year plan. There would likely be at least a fivefold increase in the numbers as the portion of the sales tax dedicated to road repairs gradually increased from .5 percent to .75 percent.

Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, told us there are many programs supported by the general fund. The inference is that Democrats are oversimplifying when they say moving money away from the general fund means moving it away from education.

But McDonnell’s proposal does not identify any general fund programs that would be specifically cut to compensate for the loss of sales tax revenue. The governor’s plan does not protect schools -- or any other general fund service -- from the small fallout.

Our Ruling:

McEachin, speaking on behalf of Democrats in the General Assembly, said McDonnell’s proposed budget would take ""money out of our classrooms to pave roads.""

He was referring to an eight-year plan by McDonnell plan to gradually increase the small portion of state sales revenues earmarked for road maintenance. The governor’s proposal would remove $110 million from the state’s general fund during the next two budget years.

About 30 percent of the general fund goes to classroom education, so schools stand to lose $33 million. The biennial school loss would grow to at least $165 million when McDonnell’s plan was fully phased in.

Put in context of the overall state education budget -- McDonnell wants to spend $10.3 billion in classrooms over the next two fiscal years -- the loss does not seem catastrophic. But there is no doubt McDonnell’s would narrow a guaranteed source of revenue to education without opening a new source.

Wisconsin Club for Growth says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett saved $25 million in the city budget thanks to Governor Scott Walker's reforms
","
Those billboards around Milwaukee featuring Mayor Tom Barrett’s mug and a claim he ""saved Milwaukee $25 million"" are clever if you slow down to read the punch line.

If you can do it without driving your car into an embankment, you’ll see they
are sponsored by the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth and give credit to Barrett’s once -- and possibly future -- gubernatorial rival, Scott Walker, for making the savings possible.

Barrett, the signs’ smaller print says, got the savings ""thanks to Gov. Scott Walker’s reforms.""

The billboards hit on a theme voters undoubtedly will hear over and over from Republicans if Barrett takes on Walker in a possible recall election in 2012.

The billboards refer to Walker’s controversial budget legislation that took health care and pensions out of collective bargaining for most public employees.

That allowed local governments and schools to impose cost-sharing for those benefits instead of negotiating with labor leaders.

Barrett’s campaign, reacting to the ad, denounced it as completely off base, in a statement to WTMJ4 that said: ""The only thing accurate about that billboard is the picture of Tom Barrett.""

What’s the truth?

Club for Growth didn’t respond, but the Journal Sentinel reported in August that the city of Milwaukee will indeed save $25 million in 2012 just on health care costs, in large part by asking employees to pay more.

In fact, Barrett’s budget document said revisions to the city’s health insurance -- the ones made easier by Walker’s changes -- would help drive overall health care costs down for the first time in more than 20 years.

We contacted the same Milwaukee budget official quoted in August 2011, and he told us the city still expects a $25 million drop in health costs.

Case closed?

The official, city economist Dennis Yaccarino, says the $25 million actually overstates savings related to the Walker budget alone. He said city officials didn’t make that clear in early August when a Journal Sentinel reporter first got the number from the city and published the $25 million figure in the context of Walker’s changes. That story ran Aug. 8, 2011.

The newspaper followed up August 21, 2011, quoting city officials saying $6 million of that savings number was from the city’s own decision to switch from an insured HMO to a self-funded approach due to projected cost savings. The $6 million switch is noted that way in Barrett’s budget.

The move, we should note, was negotiated with the city’s largest union two years ago but was not put in place until now for reasons unrelated to the state budget, according to Yaccarino and Richard Abelson, executive director of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, which represents general city employees.

Yaccarino said the city calculated in 2011 that it was paying a profit to its carrier and could keep the money for itself by going self insured. That scenario had not existed until 2011, hence the delay, he said.

So that leaves $19 million of savings for Milwaukee from Walker’s original budget plan and the amended one he signed, right?

Not exactly.

Remember, the $25 million figure is just on the health care costs side fo the equation. What about public employees paying more in pension costs? That’s the second part of Walker’s limits on collective bargaining over benefits. Milwaukee didn’t put them in place due to questions about the legality of the state changes as they apply to Milwaukee. So that’s a 0.

Finally, city official note Walker’s overall budget cut municipal aid, leaving the net ""savings"" to the city much reduced from $19 million.

But the billboard refers to Walker’s ""reforms,"" which is the changes tied to  the collective bargaining issue. It is making a narrower claim, on how much was saved from the reforms, not how the city fared overall.

Our conclusion

Billboards say Walker’s ""reforms"" allowed Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to save $25 million for the city.

The city is that much ahead, but a portion was Barrett’s doing before Walker’s budget was enacted.

Sheila Oliver says 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958
","
Gay rights advocates are casting the fight for same-sex marriage as a struggle mirrored in the nation’s past.

""This is a civil rights issue,"" Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said during a news conference announcing Democratic plans to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey.

Oliver recounted the story of an interracial couple forced to leave Virginia in the 1950s or face jail time for being married. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard Richard and Mildred Loving’s case and ruled state statutes banning interracial marriage unconstitutional.
 
But, ""in 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married,"" Oliver (D-Essex) said on Jan. 9. ""Without question, Senator (Stephen) Sweeney said it best: this is a civil rights issue.  It is a snapshot in time in the history of our country issue. And I think for those of us that believe in equality, equality, equality, marriage equality represents the third leg on the stool of civil rights and equality in this country.""

A spokesman said Oliver based her statistic on a New York Times article published earlier this month.  It put the number of states where interracial marriage was illegal in 1958 at 16.

It’s actually more than that, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Oregon repealed its law in 1951, becoming the first state to do so since Ohio in 1887. Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota followed suit.

By 1958, two dozen states still prohibited interracial marriage: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Although California still technically had a miscegenation law on its books in 1958, ""once the state Supreme Court declared the law invalid in the 1948 Perez V. Sharp case, it was no longer legally enforceable. So from 1948 on, California is put into the ‘legal column,’"" Renee Romano, the author of ""Race Mixing: Black-White Marriage in Postwar America"" and an associate professor of history at Oberlin College in Ohio, said in an email.

""The Speaker was responsibly relying upon the data graphic included in that New York Times [article],"" Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, wrote in an email. ""The Speaker’s overall point was to note that same-sex couples continue to suffer from the same wrongful discrimination that interracial couples such as the Lovings and many, many others endured until the Supreme Court rightly put a stop to it.""

By the time the Supreme Court unanimously ruled miscegenation laws unconstitutional in 1967, 16 states still had such statutes.

""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State,"" then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the opinion for the court for the Loving v. Virginia case.

Romano said the analogy between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage isn’t exactly parallel, but it’s powerful.

If you can make the case that 50 years ago people supported bans on interracial marriage, but ""now, we know that it goes on and it’s no big deal, you can sort of use that,"" she said, to say in another 50 years, people may ask ""what the hullabaloo is about. It’s a really powerful analogy. There’s a lot of richness there politically.""

Our ruling

Oliver claimed that 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958. 
There were actually 24 states with legally enforceable statutes banning the marriage of blacks and whites then.

Oliver’s number is off, but the precise figure only further supports her point about discrimination against interracial couples in the 1950s.

Providence Mayor Angel Taveras says that Achievement First charter schools in Connecticut and New York outperform city and state averages on standardized tests
","Politicians, parents and education officials are wrangling over a proposal by Achievement First to open two charter schools in Providence. Supporters say the charter school operator will be able to better educate poor and minority students. Opponents, however, question some of their teaching methods and worry that charter schools will channel money from traditional city-run schools that are already financially strapped.

Providence Mayor Angel Taveras is among those in Achievement First’s corner. In a Jan. 8, 2011, commentary in The Sunday Journal, he pointed to the success of schools operated by the organization in two nearby states.

""In Connecticut and New York, students at Achievement First schools consistently outperform city and statewide averages,"" the mayor wrote.

That’s essentially the basis of Achievement First’s pitch. According to test scores, the nonprofit organization says, its schools do better than others in their communities and can even compete with those in affluent communities.

Many have waded into this debate already. There are claims and counterclaims about the improvements Achievement First’s schools have made on test scores in Connecticut and New York. We decided to examine the issue ourselves.

We contacted Taveras’ office first and asked for data to back up the mayor’s statement. While we waited, we started our own search.

We began with Achievement First’s website, which lists test results for all of its schools. But the site averages results for math, reading and writing together, so it’s impossible to get a clear picture of how the schools did in individual subjects.

We wanted to analyze precise scores, not averages, so we went directly to the sources for testing data. Both the Connecticut State Department of Education and the New York State Education Department make test results available on their websites.

Before we get to the test scores, it’s helpful to have some background on Achievement First, which operates 10 schools in Connecticut and 10 in New York.

Its flagship, Amistad Academy, opened in New Haven, Conn., in 1999 with a mission to serve underprivileged children. The school has since expanded and so has the organization’s reach, moving into Hartford, Bridgeport and New York City. Achievement First’s approach includes a longer school day, more days in the school year, strict discipline and a focus on reading and math.

Taveras uses the present tense in his claim, so we examined results from the most recent years, 2010 and 2011.

Because the 20 schools opened at different times and because Achievement First typically starts each school with a single grade and then expands, testing data varies for each year and each school. For some schools, there is only one year of test results. For others, there is six years of results.

In considering test results, we used the percentage of students that meet or exceed the standard. (In Connecticut, this is considered being at or above proficiency.) Achievement First argues that a greater percentage of students in its schools meet the standard or are proficient than state and city averages, so we’ll focus our attention on these results.

We’ll look at Connecticut first. All students in grades 3-8 take the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT), which tests students in math, reading and writing. Fifth graders and eighth graders are also tested in science. All 10th graders take the Connecticut Academic Performance Test (CAPT), which tests them in math, science, reading and writing.

In 2010, students in four Achievement First schools were tested on the CMT, totaling 16 classes in six grades.

For math, 11 of those classes exceeded the state average for the percentage of students at or above proficiency. Fifteen of  the 16 exceeded city averages. For example, of the 51 seventh graders at Elm City College Preparatory Middle School, in New Haven, 92.2 percent were proficient or better. The state average was 87.2 percent and the city average was 75.2 percent.

In the other subjects, Achievement First schools didn’t do as well, with only 4 of 16 classes exceeding the state average in reading and 8 of 16 in writing. Thirteen of the 16 classes did better than city averages in reading and 14 of 16 in writing.

The 2011 exams followed a similar pattern. Twenty Achievement First classes in four schools took the tests and 12 exceeded the state average on math while all 20 exceeded city averages. In reading, however, only three exceeded the state average while 16 exceeded city averages. And in writing, 10 exceeded the state average while 19 exceeded city averages.

For the CAPT, the only Achievement First high school -- Amistad Academy -- outdid city averages in all subject areas in both 2010 and 2011 and all state averages except in reading in 2010.

The results so far: students in Connecticut Achievement First schools do well in math, not as well in reading and writing.

Now let’s look at New York. Students in grades 3-8 in that state take the New York State Tests in math and English language arts.

In 2010, students in four Achievement First schools were tested, totaling 18 classes in six grades. For math, 15 of those classes exceeded the state average for the percentage of students that met the standard or did better. All 18 exceeded the city average.

On the English portion of the exam, only 1 of the 18 Achievement First classes exceeded the state average and only 6 of the 18 exceeded the city average.

Results for the 2011 exam were similar. Twenty-one Achievement First classes in five schools took the tests and all 21 exceeded the state and city averages on math. In English, however, only seven exceeded the state average and 12 exceeded the city average.

Before making our ruling, we should point out that Taveras’ office did eventually send us data that was nearly the same as what we found ourselves. The only difference was that for New York, Taveras’ office compared the results of Achievement First’s schools to district results, not citywide results.

We chose citywide results, because in his commentary in The Journal, Taveras made the comparison to city averages. If district results were used, the Achievement First schools would have fared better, especially in English.

Our ruling

Achievement First schools do outperform city and state averages for math in Connecticut and New York, but the results aren’t as definitive for other subjects.

To quantify this, we added up the number of classes that were tested in the two states in 2010 and 2011 and totaled the number of times the class results in different subject areas could be compared with either state or city averages.

Here’s what we found: 
In total, for all grades and all subjects in the two states, Achievement First outperformed state or city averages 66 percent of the time. (If the New York district averages provided by Taveras’ office were substituted for city averages, this number would have risen to 70 percent.)

Generally, combining all grades and all subjects, Achievement First schools performed better than their home cities, scoring better 83 percent of the time. Compared with state averages, however, they scored better only 50 percent of the time.

Achievement First schools also did better on math, scoring higher than state or city averages 87 percent of the time. But in other subject areas -- science, reading and writing -- they had higher averages only 54 percent of the time.

Taveras said that Achievement First schools in Connecticut and New York ""consistently outperform city and statewide averages."" That’s true for math but it’s not true for other subjects. It’s true for city averages but not for statewide averages.

In other words, the mayor overstated the case for the charter school operator. We rule the claim Half True.

Bonamici claims she votes 98 percent of the time with Republicans
","
In a previous PolitiFact ruling we awarded a Half True to Rob Cornilles for claiming that his opponent, Suzanne Bonamici, voted a partisan 98 percent of the time with Democrats. He was ignoring evidence that many bills in the Legislature are unanimous and noncontroversial.

This time, we check Bonamici’s claim, repeated at a televised debate this week, that she voted with Republicans 98 percent of the time while serving in the Oregon Legislature.

""Rob keeps using this 98 percent figure that is misleading …"" she said about 7-1/2 minutes into the program. ""Yes, I voted 98 percent of the time with the majority of Democrats. I also voted 98 percent of the time with Republicans in the Oregon Legislature.""

We also knew from our previous PolitiFact that the 98 percent figure sounded funky. That’s because when we checked Bonamici’s voting record against that of state Sen. Jackie Winters, a Salem Republican with social services expertise, we found that they voted the same way 89.6 percent of the time in 2011, for an overall average of 83 percent from 2009-11. (During the 2010 special session, she voted with Winters 87 percent of the time and in 2009, 77 percent of the the time.)
   
Nearly 90 percent is not 98 percent.

Just to make sure we weren’t overlooking a friendlier Republican, we asked Mark Friesen, The Oregonian’s database expert, to see how often Bonamici voted the same way as Sen. Frank Morse, R-Albany. We picked Morse because he’s considered a Republican moderate.

In 2009, Bonamici and Morse voted together on 900 out of 1,123 votes, or just slightly over 80 percent of the time. In 2010’s short session, they voted together on 119 out of 146 votes, or nearly 82 percent of the time. In 2011, they voted together on 822 out of 955 votes, or just over 86 percent of the time.

The average over three sessions? Nearly 83 percent, same as with Winters. So not anywhere near 98 percent.

(We also checked Bonamici against Sen. Dave Nelson, R-Pendleton. In 2009, they voted the same way on 843 out of 1,123 votes, or 75 percent of the time. In 2010, they voted the same way on 95 out of 146 votes, or 65 percent. In 2011, Bonamici and Nelson voted together on 785 out of 955 votes, or just over 82 percent. The three-session average is 77 percent.)  

Bonamici’s campaign has long circulated a version of the 98 percent figure: ""However, an independent analysis shows that Bonamici voted with the majority of legislators voting on a measure -- both Democrats and Republicans and an indication of the bipartisan nature of the Oregon Legislature -- 98.1 percent of the time.""

As evidence, the campaign tallied the bills from The Oregonian’s government database and concluded that she voted with the majority of legislators 2,116 times, out of 2,157 votes cast in 2009’s regular session, 2010’s short session and 2011’s regular session.

The problem with that analysis is Democrats were in charge all years, with an 18-12 lead in 2009 and 2010, and a 16-14 majority in 2011. Which means Bonamici was able to vote with the majority without any Republican help. In fact, we spotted about 170 such heavily lopsided votes from her campaign’s own database, which means she voted against the Republican caucus at least 8 percent of the time.

We took Cornilles to task because it’s not accurate to characterize Bonamici as a button-pushing partisan hack. The members take lots of unanimous votes. They also work on many bipartisan issues.  
   
But it’s inaccurate to say that she voted with Republicans 98 percent of the time. The closest she comes is a 90 percent match voting record with Sen. Jackie Winters over one session. We find no evidence of a Republican who has voted with her 98 percent of the time, much less the majority of Republicans. We rule the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097126700>],/factchecks/2012/jan/14/suzanne-bonamici/bonamici-claims-she-votes-98-percent-time-republic/

Has Rob Cornilles disputed a statement in a Daily Astorian story for two years?
","
A statement attributed to Rob Cornilles in an article in the Daily Astorian newspaper two years ago is inaccurate, and he has ""disputed"" it ever since. The article paraphrased Cornilles as saying he would cut Social Security and Medicare programs before trimming the U.S. defense budget.

During the debate, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici brought up the article at last week’s debate and asked Cornilles what he would cut from Social Security and Medicare, and what criteria he would use. Cornilles responded: ""Well, that quote that you reference in the Daily Astorian, I’ve disputed and have for two years. That’s not what I said.""

Say what?

We talked to the reporter who wrote the story, Cassandra Profita, who now works for Oregon Public Broadcasting, and to Steve Forrester, the editor of the Daily Astorian. Profita stands by her story and said she never heard from Cornilles after it ran. Forrester said much the same thing: The story was accurate, he said, and ""We heard nothing from Cornilles. He didn’t ask us for a correction.""

We asked the Cornilles campaign to provide evidence that the story was inaccurate at the time and that he disputed what it said. Cornilles doesn’t recall asking for a correction, or telling either the reporter or the editor that the story was wrong, according to his campaign manager Mary Anne Ostrom.

But she provided videos from a September 2010 debate with David Wu, in which he denies saying he would cut entitlements, and a recent interview with KATU(2) in which Cornilles said he would cut defense spending before entitlements.

However, it wasn’t until last week’s debate that Cornilles directly called the article into question.

There is little to suggest the reporter got her story wrong. Cornilles has said in at least one previous debate and in a recent interview that he wouldn’t cut entitlements, but that doesn’t amount to disputing the story for two years. We rule the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A4AC0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/14/rob-cornilles/has-rob-cornilles-disputed-statement-daily-astoria/

Our hunch was right. In 2009, state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 676, which authorizes farmers to grow hemp, subject to regulation by the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Oregon became the seventh state to do so, joining Maine and Hawaii.

But we can’t grow industrial hemp yet because the federal government has yet to authorize it.

Did Cornilles go after Bonamici on Medicare from day one?
","
Candidates like to say that their opponent is trying to destroy Medicare, the health care program best known for servicing seniors. Candidates also like to claim that their opponent has attacked them unfairly.

Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, has expressed outrage that Rob Cornilles, the Republican, has picked up a favorite talking point of Republicans across the country: That Democrats favored a $500 billion cut to Medicare by supporting President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

""My opponent on day one of this campaign attacked me on Medicare and Medicare Advantage and that claim was found to be False,"" she said in last week’s televised debate for the Jan. 31 1st Congressional District special election.

Cornilles did make this claim against her in his Nov. 8 speech, the day after winning the special primary election: ""Sen. Bonamici says she supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year.""

PolitiFact Oregon found the statement False, because the $500 billion is a reduction in future spending. In other words, those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts and the bill does not actually eliminate any current benefits.

Democrats like to attack Republicans on Medicare as well and scare seniors, so they’re not angels either. But in this instance, Bonamici is correct. Cornilles made the claim the day after he won the special primary election and PolitiFact Oregon ruled the statement False.

Was Suzanne Bonamici the sole no vote in the Senate on a drunk driving bill?
","
This week’s televised debate between Republican Rob Cornilles and Democrat Suzanne Bonamici offered a rare chance to watch the two question each other.

Cornilles tried to paint Bonamici as a candidate weak on crime, by asking her about certain votes she took in 2009. We’ll focus on just one of those statements. ""And in another bill that same year, you were the only vote in the entire state Senate against keeping repeat drunk drivers off the road,"" Cornilles said.

House Bill 2238, now law, increased the penalty for refusing to take a breath test. Before the legislation, a person who refused could qualify for a hardship driving permit after 90 days or maybe one year, depending on the driver’s previous record. Now, the minimum is 90 days — and the maximum is three years.

Bonamici was the only no vote in Senate committee and on the Senate floor. Her campaign manager Carol Butler said Bonamici wanted to stop people from driving drunk in the first place, not fiddle with legislation that addressed the problem after the fact.

In her five years in the Legislature, Bonamici has voted for many bills that crack down on drunk driving. But in this instance, Cornilles is correct. She was the sole no vote.

How bipartisan is support for the Keystone XL oil pipeline?

""I do support the Keystone Pipeline. It’s a bipartisan proposal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress want this to move forward, because it’s not only a job creator, it’s also a way for us to responsibly manage how that oil is transferred from Canada to Mexico.

Much of the really vocal support for this project comes from Republicans. Democrats, not so much, although there are some who want the project. Environmentalists are opposed while labor’s AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position.

Senate Democrats who like the project are Max Baucus D-Mont., Jon Tester D-Mont., Mary Landrieu D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D.  

We queried our delegation. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are opposed. Rep. Earl Blumenauer was among 32 House Democrats who sent a letter urging the State Department

Democratic leaders say up to a quarter of African Americans don’t have government photo ID
","
Two Democratic congressmen last month challenged the fairness of state voter identification laws like one in Texas, suggesting the mandates would target certain Americans.

In an opinion piece published in the Austin American-Statesman on Dec. 13, 2011, U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and John Lewis of Georgia said: ""New measures introduced in several states would mandate government-issued, current photo identification for all wishing to vote. However, as many as one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote under these conditions and would be hit hard by these new laws.""

A reader asked us to check if indeed as many as 25 percent of African Americans do not carry a current government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license, passport or military ID.

That statistic comes from a 2006 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. Hoyer spokesman Dan Reilly told us by email that the congressmen got their number from a Nov. 14, 2011 speech by the center’s Lawrence Norden. Norden cited the center’s 2006 survey of Americans’ ownership and access to citizenship documents and identification.

The Brennan Center combines research and legal advocacy on public policy issues such as campaign finance reform and racial balance in criminal law, and it has said that state efforts to require photo IDs from voters at the polls could discourage millions from voting, especially minority and low-income Americans. In an October 2011 report, the center said that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, some 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states’ voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs.

Two of those states -- Texas and South Carolina -- must have their laws cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice because of past failures to protect minority voting rights. The department rejected South Carolina’s law last month (saying that minority registered voters were more likely than whites to lack state IDs), and has asked Texas to supply more data about the impact of its law on minority voters.

Specifically, federal officials asked Texas in September 2011 for the racial breakdown and counties of residence of registered voters who don’t have a state-issued license or ID -- about 600,000 people, Texas’ secretary of state estimated. Secretary of state spokesman Rich Parsons told us the office is preparing those numbers.

Texas’ law, signed last year by Gov. Rick Perry, requires voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.

Back to the nationwide data: The Brennan Center’s 2006 survey reached by telephone 987 U.S. citizens of voting age, asking them questions including, ""Do you have a current, unexpired government-issued ID with your picture on it, like a driver’s license or a military ID?""

As voter ID debates heated up in 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a critique of the survey, noting it was still frequently cited and questioning its decision not to focus on registered or actual voters. The center’s response said in part, ""While it is true that citizens in those groups are more likely to vote in any given election, they are not the only citizens who have the right to vote.""

Overall, according to the survey, 11 percent of voting-age Americans did not have current government-issued photo ID. Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said.

A December 2011 report by the NAACP on barriers to voting rights mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that reasons for such a disparity can include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) and the lack of documents they need to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which can also cost money to obtain.

The center has not surveyed voting-age Americans since 2006 about whether they have photo IDs, Keesha Gaskins, senior counsel for its Democracy Program, told us.

Separately, we found no other national surveys by race of which U.S. citizens eligible to vote have government-issued photo IDs. Two national surveys taken in 2008, however, checked on registered voters.  

Before the 2008 presidential election, researchers from the University of Washington and other schools carried out a national telephone survey of 4,563 registered voters. In the survey, 10 percent of blacks, 11 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites said they did not have a valid driver's license or an ID issued by their home state.

Another survey, reaching 10,000 registered voters via phone and Internet after the 2008 election, included questions about driver’s license ownership by race. In an Aug. 30, 2011, blog post, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III said responses showed that 19 percent of black respondents and 3 percent of whites did not have a driver’s license. In his blog post, Stewart did not break out results for Hispanic respondents.

Of respondents who reported having a driver’s license, 16 percent of blacks and 9 percent of whites said the address on it was not current. In all, 32 percent of black respondents did not have a driver’s license bearing their current address, Stewart said, compared to 13 percent of whites.

Among half a dozen other studies, ranging in scope from three counties to three states, several struck us as having limited applicability to the statement by Hoyer and Lewis:   
  
Two other surveys asked questions closest to matching the statement by Hoyer and Lewis.

A 2007 survey of Indiana’s voting-age citizens found 26.6 percent of blacks and 13.6 percent of whites did not have a ""current"" government-issued or state university-issued photo ID. Lead researcher Matt Barreto of the University of Washington told us Hispanics composed too small a share of the population for their survey results to be analyzed separately.

A 2008 survey of registered voters in Indiana, Mississippi and Maryland found 3.8 percent of blacks and 0.9 percent of whites did not have government-issued photo IDs. Results for Hispanic voters were not broken out.

Our ruling

Hoyer and Lewis stated that ""as many as one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote"" under conditions imposed by photo ID laws -- ""government-issued, current photo identification.""

That figure came from a national survey taken about six years ago and, far as we could tell, mostly unchallenged since. While other collections of data do not touch on exactly the same point, most indicate that African Americans are less likely than whites to hold varied kinds of government-issued IDs, with percentages of blacks without such ID ranging from nearly 4 percent to more than 26 percent.

Newt Gingrich ad says Mitt Romney 'runs away from Ronald Reagan'
","
In a web video released on Jan. 13, 2012, Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign took aim at ""Massachusetts moderate"" Mitt Romney, comparing him to fellow Bay State politicians (and Democratic presidential losers) Michael Dukakis and John Kerry and even taking him to task for being able to speak French.

The ad fires a fusillade of shots designed to show that Romney is too liberal to be a Republican presidential nominee. We’ve chosen one of those claims to check.

""What has Massachusetts given us?"" the ad asks, offering grainy footage of Dukakis’ ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign and Kerry’s windsurfing from 2004. The video goes on to describe Romney as ""a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan,"" then cuts to a clip of Romney speaking during a debate while running for Senate in 1994. In the debate, Romney said, ""Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""

We have already looked at the question of Romney’s view of Reagan, a conservative icon, during a fact-check of a Democratic National Committee ad on Nov. 29, 2011.

The DNC ad from 2011 juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. The first was the same one later used in the Gingrich ad. The second showed Romney standing at a podium saying, ""The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.""
   
The 1994 clip, which came during Romney’s bid to unseat the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, showed part of an exchange in which the two men had a philosophical discussion about poverty and families. Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House.
   
""Under the Reagan-Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs,"" Kennedy said. ""If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well.""
   
Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score ""political hits,"" prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was.
   
""I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush,"" Romney said, in a clear attempt to distance himself from the former president.

In our fact-check of the DNC ad, we couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, Romney did say it on live television, so we have no quarrel with the Gingrich campaign using it. The Gingrich ad also correctly identified it on-screen as having occurred in 1994, some 18 years ago.

But we have a different problem with the Gingrich ad: It erred by using the present tense in the voice-over, saying that Mitt Romney ""runs away from Ronald Reagan."" To us, that means that Romney is still distancing himself from Reagan. And that’s definitely not the case.

Consider the second clip in the DNC ad, in which Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about America’s position in the world.

""I have to tell you that I’m optimistic. I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.""

After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased ""that wonderful line"" of Reagan’s:

""(Reagan) said, ‘Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right,"" Romney said.

We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy:

• During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. ""That's failing Reagan 101,"" Romney said, essentially holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire.
   
• In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, ""I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan.""

• When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new ""Reagan Economic Zone,"" an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have ""embraced free enterprise and open markets.""

• On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance.

""I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong,"" Romney said. ""Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself.""

• On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called ""Reaganites for Romney,"" featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration.

""These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world,"" said Romney. ""The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships. I am proud to announce this group of conservative leaders – with their help we can recreate the robust job creation of the Reagan years.""

Our ruling

Ginrgich’s ad contains a grain of truth: In one televised debate 18 years ago, Romney distanced himself from Reagan and his policies. But more recently, Romney has had only kind words to say about the Gipper. When the DNC charged that Romney had flip-flopped on his support for Reagan’s policies, we ruled that charge Mostly True. In this case, though, we don’t think Romney’s long-ago discomfort with Reagan-era policies justifies the Gingrich ad’s claim that Romney is ""a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan."" We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2E0F40>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-ad-says-mitt-romney-runs-away-ronald/

King of Bain video accuses Romney of hiding his fortune
","
UPDATE: After Mitt Romney released his tax returns for 2010 and 2011, new evidence surfaced of his foreign bank accounts. We are adding that information to this report. Despite the new evidence, it still accounts for a small part of Romney's fortune, so our rating is unchanged. 
The King of Bain documentary tells viewers, again and again, that Mitt Romney is a very wealthy man. The video, released by a super PAC backing Newt Gingrich, flashes dollar signs and suitcases full of cash, along with images of Wall Street landmarks, to hammer home its Romney-as-corporate-raider message.
   
Here, we’re looking into the film’s claim’s about Romney’s personal worth. At the end of the 28-minute film, white letters flash on a black background as somber piano music plays.

""Romney’s own financial statement shows his personal fortune to be at least a quarter billion dollars.""

""No one knows for sure...""

""The bulk of Mitt Romney’s personal wealth remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts.""
   
What we found is that some, but not all, of what’s in those statements is accurate.

The size of his fortune

Last year, Romney filed a financial disclosure Form 278 with the Office of Government Ethics, as required by all presidential candidates. It’s 28 pages long, listing bank accounts, mutual funds, stock holdings, speaker’s fees and more.

That form only requires filers to select a range, for example between $100,001 and $250,000, for the value of each asset. King of Bain cites a Washington Post story that said the top end of the range of Romney’s wealth is $264 million. The low end is $85 million.

In that same story, the Romney campaign told the Post that ""a more accurate range"" is between $190 million to $250 million.

So the King of Bain narrator’s statement that Romney is now worth ""somewhere over a quarter of a billion dollars"" goes right for the high end of the range cited by the Washington Post. But the actual amount could be considerably less.

Blind trusts and offshore accounts

Romney’s disclosure form includes an attachment addressing the blind trust issue. It states:

""Other than assets and income sources listed on page 1 of Schedule A, all of the assets listed in this Report are held by the W. Mitt Romney Blind Trust, the Ann D. Romney Blind Trust, Mr. Romney's IRA or Mrs. Romney's IRA (collectively, the 'Reporting Entities'). In each case, R. Bradford Malt, as Trustee (the 'Trustee'), has complete investment discretion over the assets held by these investment vehicles, except where the Trustee has delegated that discretion to third-party investment managers.

""The management of the assets of the Reporting Entities was deemed blind by the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission. Since January 1, 2003, neither Mr. Romney nor Mrs. Romney has had any control over any of the assets acquired or disposed of by the Reporting Entities and neither Mr. Romney nor Mrs. Romney has previously received any reports identifying specific assets currently held by any of the Reporting Entities.""

Politicians commonly put their money in blind trusts while they hold office to prevent conflicts of interest. If they don’t know what investments they own, they can’t pass laws benefiting themselves, the theory goes.

Bill Allison, editorial director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for openness in government, said that even though the rules aim to prevent self-dealing, they aren’t airtight.

""I think a lot of times politicians with blind trusts do have a pretty good idea what they own,"" he said. News stories have raised questions about the ""blindness"" of Romney’s trust.

Still, the intent of blind trusts is to avoid conflicts of interest. So the video is correct in stating that much of Romney’s wealth is in a blind trust -- all but about $1.5 million, according to the form.

But what about offshore accounts?

We asked Winning Our Future to provide us with support for that claim but didn't receive any.

The evidence emerged when Romney released two years of his personal tax returns in January 2012. The documents showed he previously had a Swiss bank account -- $3 million that a trust in his wife’s name reported holding in a Swiss money-market account, according to a story in the New York Times.

Malt, the trustee, told reporters that he had opened the account with the United Bank of Switzerland in 2003 and closed it in 2010. The Times said the interest it accrued in 2010, about $1,700, was reported on tax documents.

Malt told reporters the account was opened ''for diversification.''

''It is a bank account, nothing more, nothing less,'' he said, according to the Times.

The tax returns also revealed investments in low-tax locales including the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Ireland and Luxembourg. But it’s impossible to tell how much of Romney’s fortune comes from his holdings in offshore funds and institutions, according to numerous news reports.

""You really can’t determine where his wealth is from tax returns because they’re just reporting income,"" Allison said.

Allison inspected Romney’s returns and noted that on his 2010 return, Romney reported $2.7 million in gross foreign income. That’s out of $27.3 million in total gross income.

""The thing that jumped out at me is that his foreign income is just a fraction of his total,"" Allison said.

He added that it’s possible that Romney has other foreign assets not reported on the tax return because they aren’t producing income.

Romney’s financial disclosure form lists other investments held by firms in Europe, including PNB Paribas, in France, and Rabobank Nederland, which is Dutch. But that type of investment isn't different from holdings in many people's 401(k) retirement savings funds. 
Allison said that based on publicly available records, foreign assets and income do not ""appear to be the bulk of his wealth.""

""But the forms that we’re looking at really aren’t designed to answer these kind of questions,"" Allison added. ""And that’s the problem with the disclosures we require of our presidential candidates.""

Our ruling
   
Winning Our Future’s movie puts Romney’s personal fortune at $250 million and says most of it ""remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts.""
   
According to one analysis of Romney’s financial disclosure, his wealth may total $264 million -- but it may also be closer to $85 million. It’s clear that most of it has been held in blind trusts since 2003, which is common practice among elected officials to avoid conflicts of interest.
   
But the super PAC didn't provide, and we didn't find, good evidence that ""the bulk"" of Romney’s money is in overseas accounts. His tax returns show he previously had a Swiss account and that he made almost $3 million in foreign income in 2010. But the tax returns and financial disclosures indicate that a relatively small share of Romney’s wealth is overseas.

Have Republicans “never done anything really” to tame the nation’s deficit?
","
With Congress tied in knots about the massive federal debt late last year, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen wasn't shy about pointing fingers.

Now at more than $15 trillion, the debt is the result of many policies and actions -- by Republicans and Democrats alike -- but Memphis’s Democratic congressman took the opportunity to cast Republicans as the main villains and his own party as courageous leaders fighting to balance the budget.  

Appearing as a panelist on an MSNBC program hosted by liberal political reporter Chris Hayes, Cohen said: ""Democrats have dealt with the deficit before. In 1993, all Democrats balanced the budget or put it on the way to being balanced. And the Republicans have never done anything really to balance the budget. They’ve had two wars off budget, Afghanistan and Iraq. They’ve put these Bush tax cuts in effect. That’s the reason we’ve got this great deficit.""

Cohen offers some specifics to back up his claim. But the core statement here, that Republicans have never done anything to balance the budget, immediately struck us as an overreach.

Never? Not even once?

Stephen Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-partisan group that opposes wasteful spending, got right to the point in an email reply: ""Both parties can lay claims to doing things to balance the budget, and both parties can be blamed for doing things that made the budget more out of balance.""

Cohen is correct that in 1993, not one Republican voted in favor of President Clinton’s budget reconciliation act that reduced the deficit mainly by raising various taxes – a move many Republicans predicted would lead to economic disaster. Cohen was also careful in the segment to distinguish that the 1993 act put the budget ""on the way to being balanced."" But getting to a balanced budget – and eventually creating a surplus – required more than just unilateral Democratic actions and leadership.

Indeed, we found plenty of examples of other Republican actions to reduce the deficit:

A Wall Street Journal news article on Aug. 1, 1996, attributed the shrinking budget deficit partly to that 1993 deficit-reduction package and largely to ""a stronger-than-expected economy."" Also, it says, ""spending cuts engineered by the Republican Congress,"" deserve credit but ""to a lesser extent.""

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the product of a Democratic president and a Republican Congress, also deserves credit, said says Marc Goldwein, policy director for the New America Foundation’s Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

""In the '90s, it’s clear there were many cases where Republicans worked to balance the budget,"" Goldwein said.

The liberal columnist and blogger Jonathan Chait is among those who question whether the 1997 act actually lowered a deficit that was projected to become balanced even without the legislation. Essentially, he says, Republicans traded with Clinton, getting cuts in capital-gains taxes for the wealthy in exchange for giving Clinton a childrens’ health insurance program. Chait also points to research by Michael Linden of the left-leaning Center for American Progress that shows ""legislation passed by the Republican-led Congress of 1995 through 1997 combined to actually worsen the fiscal situation – albeit slightly.""

But even Chait acknowledges that a Republican president’s budget deal deserves as much -- or more -- credit with leading the nation toward a balanced national budget: ""George H.W. Bush's 1990 budget did even more to reduce the deficit.""
 
At the time, Bush was attacked from the right for compromising with Democrats, trading small tax increases on the wealthy for spending reductions. Among the measures to impose fiscal discipline: Caps on discretionary spending and an innovation called PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) that required future Congresses to pay for any tax cuts or spending increases with corresponding tax increases or cuts in spending (that provision expired in 2002).

Ultimately, only 10 Republican members of the House and 23 Republican senators supported that deal -- but they were Republicans nonetheless, acting at the behest of a Republican administration.

""Obviously the ‘never’ is inaccurate because we could go back to Herbert Hoover,"" Goldwein, of the New America Foundation, said.

When we asked Cohen about this, he stood by his statement and continued to focus on Republican actions taken (or not taken) in the 2000s, when President George W. Bush had a Republican House and Senate. He cited the Bush tax cuts, the ""off budget"" wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (the war costs were included in a ""supplemental appropriation"" every year), the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and lax financial regulations.

However, on all of the above, Republicans received support from more than a few Democrats.

Cohen also said he doesn’t believe Republicans should receive credit for just proposing ideas on ways to reduce the deficit, such as House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s 2012 budget resolution that contained trillions of dollars in spending cuts. More recently, Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, joined forces with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., on a plan to reduce the deficit by allowing seniors to choose between traditional Medicare and private insurance plans.

""But they haven’t done anything, really,"" Cohen said. ""They haven’t passed any bills, have they?"" 
Our ruling 
Cohen so deeply believes Republicans are to blame on the budget deficit he even, on the MSNBC show, brought up the story ""about the child who kills his parents and has the great chutzpah to say I’m an orphan and you should feel sorry for me – that’s the Republicans saying look at the deficit.""

But if Cohen is going to use the wayback machine to travel to 1993, he can’t then ignore what happened under the first President Bush and the Republican Congress of the mid-'90s.

Cohen’s strong feelings and unapologetic liberal leadership have helped him win landslide elections and extremely high approval ratings, but in this instance his partisan passion led to a statement not supported by facts. Republicans have done things that would lead to a balanced budget, at present and in the not-so-distant past. We rate this statement Pants On Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1EB7C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/13/steve-cohen/have-republicans-never-done-anything-really-tame-n/

Marsha Blackburn says she is battling for freedom of choice – for energy-inefficient light bulbs
","
U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has been on a crusade to, as she put it on the House floor in July, prevent higher efficiency standards for light bulbs from creating ""a de facto ban on the incandescent bulb."" In an appearance on the Fox Business Channel in December, she re-calibrated her rhetorical salvo when she told Stuart Varney she’s fighting ""to keep our freedom of choice and selection in the light bulbs we have in our homes.""

Like many critics of the higher efficiency standards, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007, Blackburn said she was concerned with government limiting consumer choice. The House voted 233-193 in July to repeal the higher standards but the measure failed to get the two-thirds majority necessary to fast-track the bill to the House floor.

The Obama administration issued a statement before the vote that said consumers still have freedom of choice under the law. ""Any type of bulb can be sold as long as it meets the efficiency requirements.  In sum, the bill would hinder an opportunity to save American consumers money, while enhancing energy efficiency and reducing harmful emissions associated with energy production.""

Supporters of the standards say the higher-efficiency bulbs mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act not only save energy but, despite higher up-front costs, save consumers money over time because the bulbs last longer.

So does the imposition of higher energy standards amount to a ""de facto ban"" on incandescent bulbs? Does it strip away ""our freedom of choice and selection in the light bulbs we have in our homes?""

The short answer is no. Existing inefficient bulbs will stay in circulation and will continue to be sold to consumers until supplies run out. And while traditional tungsten-element bulbs can’t meet the higher standards and will not be manufactured, light bulb companies are continuing to make incandescent halogen bulbs, although they are more expensive than incandescent tungsten. So the only way you could consider there to be a ban would be if you couldn't  afford the halogen bulbs.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that supports the higher standards, points out that the trade association for domestic light manufacturers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, which would appear to have an interest in a banning of its products, has embraced the increased efficiency standards. The NRDC also notes that a factory in St. Marys, Pa., is retooling to make more efficient incandescent bulbs, creating domestic jobs.

In perhaps the most telling endorsement of the higher standards, Barry Edison Sloane, the great-grandson of the inventor of the incandescent bulb, Thomas Edison, called those who sought their repeal ""narrow-minded."" Consumers Union, which produces Consumer Reports, also endorses the higher standards.

Asked for source material, Blackburn’s spokesman Mike Reynard said: ""It’s a de facto ban because traditional incandescent light bulbs can’t meet the new energy standards. An American innovation may be able to create a new incandescent bulb 2.0 -- which can meet the new standards -- but it won’t be the incandescent bulb your parents grew up with.""

Traditional 100-watt incandescent bulbs would have been the first to fail to meet the new standards that were to have taken effect Jan. 1. Congress in late December effectively delayed that until October 2012. Other traditional incandescents will fail to meet the lumens-per-watt standard between then and 2014, when the standard for 40-watt bulbs kicks in. Several kinds of incandescent bulbs within those wattage ranges are exempt from the new standards, including appliance bulbs, colored bulbs and stage lighting in theaters.

PolitiFact has checked many other assertions regarding the light bulb controversy, finding a claim by the conservative political action committee AmeriPAC that ""you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs"" to be a ""Pants on Fire""-level misrepresentation. Others have been equally misleading, particularly Varney, who can be found in a 2009 debate with environmentalist actor Ed Begley Jr. stating: ""The government is telling me I may not have incandescent lights.""

Our ruling

Blackburn has been more careful in qualifying the language she uses to advance her cause. Because the standards will ultimately bring about the end of traditional incandescent bulbs, there is an element of truth in Blackburn’s claims. But consumers will still have plenty of choice of different types of bulbs, even if traditional incandescents are not for sale.
