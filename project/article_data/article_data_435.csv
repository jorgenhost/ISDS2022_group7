Brian Laundrie’s remains confirmed by dental records, FBI says
","The murder of Gabrielle Petito and disappearance of her fiancé Brian Laundrie, a person of interest in the killing, captivated many Americans but dental records solved at least part of the mystery: human remains found in Florida on Oct. 20 belonged to Laundrie, according to the FBI.  Unsourced social media and blog posts had previously claimed without evidence that Laundrie was actually alive in Mexico. That claim has persisted even in his death. One Facebook post claimed that he had a twin, and the bones that were discovered in Florida belonged to the twin, while Laundrie was still somewhere south of the border.  But this defies evidence, and there’s nothing to support it.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the FBI, Laundrie’s remains were found near his notebook and backpack in a park in North Port, Fla. Dental records confirmed they were his remains, the New York Times reported. Twins — even identical twins — don’t have identical dental patterns, according to a study published in a 1982 issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association.  There has been no mention in news or law enforcement reports that Laundrie had a twin, but there has been media coverage of his sister and their parents.  We rate this claim False.

Yes, Foxconn deal was largest government incentive package offered to a foreign company
","Wisconsin’s former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch announced a bid for governor Sept. 9, taking shots at Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and touting her own credentials.  Kleefisch, a Republican from Concord, served for eight years as former Gov. Scott Walker’s second-in-command.  One thing she didn’t mention in her announcement: the Foxconn deal that came to define the final years of Walker’s governorship, a deal she touted. In 2017, Walker signed off on an agreement that called for the Taiwanese tech company to build a liquid crystal display panel factory in Mount Pleasant, which was to lead to the creation of 13,000 jobs, many of them in high-tech manufacturing.  In return, the state would provide $3 billion in incentives to the company.  Since the deal was announced, Foxconn abandoned plans for the LCD screens, then a later plan for robotic coffee kiosks, as well as its promise to create as many jobs. Most recently, the company signed a renegotiated deal with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to hire 1,454 full-time workers by 2025 in return for up to $80 million in tax credits.   In a Twitter thread criticizing Kleefisch, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin Ben Wikler pointed out her support for the Foxconn deal.  ""Kleefisch played a key role in negotiating the disastrous Foxconn deal, the largest attempted government handout to a foreign company in American history,"" he tweeted.   Is Wikler right that she played a key role, and that it was the largest attempted handout to a foreign company in the country’s history?   Let’s take a look.  When the deal was made, it was the largest government subsidy given by a state to a foreign company.  In 2017, PolitiFact Wisconsin wrote that the Foxconn incentives would exceed the previous highest deal with a foreign company, which was a $1.65 billion package given by the state of Pennsylvania to Netherlands-based Dutch Royal Shell.  The 2017 item cited Good Jobs First, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit that calls itself ""a leading monitor and critic of company-specific subsidy deals."" (They criticized the Foxconn deal, calling it ""a sure loser"" for Wisconsin taxpayers.) In the nonprofit’s list of megadeals last updated in April 2021, Foxconn’s deal ranks third-highest, following Boeing and Alcoa, both U.S. companies. That would make the Foxconn deal the largest package offered to a foreign company. Nathan Jensen, a professor of government at the University of Texas-Austin who researches business-government relations, agreed in an email that the size of the package in dollars would make it nominally the biggest deal given to a foreign company ""and one of the biggest deals period.""  The Foxconn incentives were also partially front-loaded and spread out over a shorter time period than other billion-dollar deals, making it an even more lucrative package, Jensen wrote.  So Wikler is on track that the Foxconn incentives were the largest offered to a foreign company.  But while he’s right about the size of the deal, he’s a bit off base in describing it as a handout, even an attempted one. The taxpayer-backed payments were contingent on the company meeting specific thresholds of jobs created.  Even under the smaller, renegotiated deal, those thresholds haven’t been met and none of the prescribed payments have been made.  In response to a query from PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kayla Anderson, rapid response director at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, sent several links to news articles detailing Kleefisch’s involvement with the deal.  Chief among them was her 2015 trade mission to Japan and Taiwan. Two years later, she said she’d met with Foxconn officials on that trip, not discussing specifics but rather a ""general, wide-ranging conversation"" about what the state had to offer if the company expanded there.  Kleefisch also said personal relationship-building and face-to-face meetings were important to convey security, stability, quality and value while getting the deal done.  While the definition of a ""key role"" might be subjective, there’s no question she was a strong proponent and was pushing for the deal.  Wikler said Kleefisch played a key role in the Foxconn deal, ""the largest attempted government handout to a foreign company in American history.  Kleefisch did meet with Foxconn officials and promoted the deal publicly before, during and after its creation.  And the $3 billion incentive package still stands as the largest one offered to a foreign company. But calling it a handout isn’t exactly accurate — the payments had specific rules attached to them, without which Foxconn couldn’t get the money.  We rate his claim Mostly True.    ",/factchecks/2021/oct/26/ben-wikler/yes-foxconn-deal-was-largest-government-incentive-/

Has the NIH approved ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment? No.  The NIH is a central access point for much of the latest COVID-19 research — including research into treatments that are approved or being studied.

But the site makes clear that the NIH has not approved or recommended ivermectin to treat COVID-19.  ""Remdesivir is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19,"" reads the NIH’s summary recommendations.  The page includes the language from the post — ""Antiviral Drugs That Are Approved or Under Evaluation for the Treatment of COVID-19"" — and was last updated on July 8.

Gas prices peaked under Bush, but they don’t correlate with who’s in office
","President Joe Biden has faced a lot of criticism from Republicans for the rise in gasoline prices since he took office. But the left-wing social media account Occupy Democrats claims that under one Republican president, prices were far higher. ""You won’t see THIS on Fox ‘News’: Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush,"" Occupy Democrats wrote on Facebook. The post included images of two gas station price signs, labeled 2008 and 2021.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’re not sure where or when the photos of gas signs were taken, but they do accurately reflect the gasoline prices that were in effect at the time.  Statistics from the U.S. Energy Information Administration back up the claim about prices. During the past 20 years, the highest gas prices occurred in July 2008, during the Bush administration.  But the statement leaves out important context. Some of the lowest prices of the past 20 years also occurred during the Bush administration, which included both the post-9/11 economic slowdown and the 2008 Wall Street crash and financial crisis.  Indeed, gas prices have fluctuated within and across administrations, with little correlation to which president or party is in power. As with most things, the price of gasoline is determined not by the president, but rather by the state of the economy and the balance of supply and demand. Following our inquiries, Occupy Democrats changed its post to reflect this. Occupy Democrats cofounder Rafael Rivero told PolitiFact that the point of its original claim was to highlight the context that it says was missing from critiques of the Biden administration. The fact that prices were at historic highs during the Bush administration ""is conveniently ignored by the chorus of Fox News anchors blaming Biden for today’s rising prices,"" Rivero said. Today’s gas prices are around $3.32 a gallon, up from $2.37 when the Biden administration took office, according to the EIA. That’s still well off the peak of about $4.11 in July 2008. But Bush’s term also included two major economic shocks that sent gasoline prices tumbling. The first was the 9/11 attacks in 2001. By the end of that year, gas prices were around $1.07. The other was the 2008 mortgage crisis and Wall Street collapse, near the end of his second term. By the time Obama took over, gas prices were down to about $1.83. While the health of the economy influences the demand side of the price balance, global supply is largely controlled by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.  ""OPEC tries to control the price of oil by either increasing or decreasing production to keep the price of oil stable,"" De Haan said.  In 2001, the average price of oil set by OPEC countries was around $23 a barrel. That low price incentivized more consumption, and global demand began to rise during Bush’s second term, De Haan said. 
""People became so accustomed to low energy that they made long-term decisions based on that. People were driving big cars, people were living hours away from (work) in some cases,"" De Haan said. By the middle of 2008, USA Today reported, oil prices spiked past $147 a barrel due to rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as well as supply disruptions in Nigeria and Brazil. That’s when prices hit their peak above $4 a gallon.  Then came the crash, followed by another recovery under President Barack Obama’s administration that sent prices back toward the $4 mark in 2011 and 2012.  In November 2014, in order to compete with production in other countries like the U.S., OPEC changed its policy to produce as much oil as possible and flood the market, which led to very low prices. Those low prices continued into the Trump years, until OPEC once again adjusted its policy to raise prices. Then in March 2020, the pandemic hit and oil demand plummeted. Under President Donald Trump, prices ranged from around $1.80 (near at the start of the pandemic) to $2.90. ""Because Americans stayed home, the price of oil plummeted into negative territory for the first time ever,"" De Haan said, referring to the price of crude oil futures contracts. ""Demand for gasoline was down 60%, and along with it, the price of oil crashed."" That led to job cuts in the oil industry and a decline in production. But demand recovered quickly because of optimism surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine, De Haan said, and producers haven’t been able to ramp back up as quickly, leading to another spike in prices that continues today.  ""Was that Trump’s fault? No. Was that Biden’s fault? No,"" De Haan said. ""The vaccines held the key to an increase in demand.""  After PolitiFact’s inquiry, Occupy Democrats modified its post to add that point: ""The truth is that presidents have little if ANY effect on gas prices, which are dependent on the price of crude oil, which is determined by global supply and demand. High gas prices in 2008 weren't really Bush's fault, just like rising prices today aren't Biden's fault."" An Occupy Democrats Facebook post said gasoline prices were ""way higher"" under Republican President George W. Bush than today under President Joe Biden.  Prices did peak during the Bush administration, but they also were very low at other points during his presidency.  More broadly, experts say, movements in gas prices have little to do with who’s president. Rather, they reflect the balance between global supply and demand, and the global supply is largely determined by OPEC. Occupy Democrats modified its post to add context, but our rating is based on the original post. We rate this claim Half True.

Indiana congressman signed letter as top Republican on Jan. 6 committee. He’s not on the committee
","In at least one letter requesting information from a federal agency related to Congress’ probe of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, Rep.

He is not listed as a member of the committee, and his official website does not say he is a part of it. Yet he signed at least one letter, which was revealed Oct. 21 by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., as the ""ranking member,"" the term for the leading member of the minority party on a committee.   ""The gentleman also said that he is not on the committee,"" Cheney said Oct. 21. ""He noted that the speaker had determined that he wouldn’t be on the committee. So I would like to introduce, for the record, a number of letters that the gentleman from Indiana has been sending to federal agencies — dated Sept. 16, 2021, for example — signing his name as the ranking member of the committee he has just informed the House that he is not on, and that he in fact is not on."" PolitiFact obtained a copy of one letter that Banks, an ally of former President Donald Trump, sent to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Sept. 16.

""You are receiving this letter because the House of Representatives Select Committee to Investigate the events of January 6th may have sent you a request for information,"" Banks wrote in his letter to Haaland. ""The House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy appointed me to serve as the Ranking Member of the Select Committee. Yet, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to allow me to fulfill my duties as Ranking Member."" ""I ask that you provide me any information that is submitted to the Select Committee,"" Banks wrote. ""Additionally, please include me on any update or briefing that you provide."" Asked about the letter, a Banks spokesperson sent PolitiFact a statement criticizing focus on the signature as ""a bizarre Democrat narrative meant to distract from the actual contents"" of the letter.  ""The letter — if read in full — tells the whole story: It clearly states that Rep. Banks was refused the opportunity to fulfill his duties as ranking member,"" the statement said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had initially tapped Banks to serve in that role as one of five Republicans on the 13-member Jan. 6 committee. But after Pelosi blocked the appointments of Banks and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and asked McCarthy to recommend two different Republicans in their place, McCarthy withdrew all five appointments, leaving Pelosi to round out the roster with Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., as the only Republicans.  In a statement, Pelosi cited ""concern about statements made and actions taken by these members"" as reason for excluding them. Banks, for example, claimed that the committee was created ""solely to malign conservatives"" and insisted on investigating the Biden administration and protests that occurred over the summer of 2020 in addition to the events on Jan. 6.  Republican senators previously killed an effort passed by the House to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 riot, similar to the body that investigated the 9/11 attacks. Banks claimed in the signature of at least one letter to a federal agency that he is the ""ranking member"" of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack. Banks is not the ranking member of the committee, or even a member of the committee. The Indiana congressman’s appointment was blocked by Pelosi, as the legislation allowed.

As we and other fact-checkers have reported, experts say that the backup of cargo ships, focused in Southern California, is being caused by a number of factors: shortages of truck drivers and other workers to unload increasingly larger ships; surges in buying as pandemic restrictions ease and the holidays approach; COVID-19 related issues such as COVID-19 outbreaks at factories; and a shift in consumer spending habits as folks spend more time at home.  As Jeffrey Michael, executive director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at University of the Pacific, told PolitiFact: ""The ports in Southern California are actually moving record levels of containers, but they haven’t been able to keep up with increased demand."" An Instagram post claimed that cargo ships ""can’t get into port"" because of Donald Trump’s executive order 13959. That 2020 order restricted certain investments in Chinese companies. It did not prohibit goods from being brought from other countries to the U.S. The backlog is caused by numerous factors, including surges in consumer demand amid labor shortages.

FDA rules have blocked COVID-19 vaccine makers from advertising vaccines on TV
","Big Pharma seems to be on television all the time, advertising prescription medicines with three- or four-syllable names for treating all sorts of problems, large and small. There have been many public-service TV ads promoting vaccination generally. But one Instagram post claims that drug makers aren’t doing TV ads for their own COVID-19 vaccines because they would have to list the possible side effects. ""Have you noticed there’s been no commercials for the death dart?"" the post begins, falsely suggesting that the COVID-19 inoculations are lethal. ""Here’s why. Because in the US they are required by law to list all adverse side effects to medications advertised on TV to consumers. Fact check that."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The actual reason is that Food and Drug Administration rules prohibit advertising of drugs that have not been fully approved by the FDA. Only one COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer’s, has been approved, and that didn’t occur until August.  A Pfizer spokesperson said the company plans to take a ""thoughtful approach"" to marketing and will adhere to FDA requirements about disclosing any serious side effects. During public health emergencies, the FDA has the legal power to grant emergency use authorization to certain products if they meet specific criteria, and when there’s no adequate, approved and available alternative to treat the malady. That’s what happened when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in early 2020 and there weren’t any approved vaccines for it. Emergency use authorization was granted to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in December 2020 and to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in February 2021.  FDA approval, meanwhile, depends on more substantial evidence that the product is effective and that its benefits outweigh its risks. Approved medical products must follow numerous FDA regulations, including rules for ads that make claims about what a product can do. So far, only Pfizer’s vaccine has gained FDA approval, and only for people age 16 and over. That occurred Aug. 23. The FDA’s announcement noted that Pfizer would now market its vaccine under the name Comirnaty. The approval allows Pfizer to advertise Comirnaty on TV, but the company has not announced plans to do so. Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said ""we cannot share our specific plans at this time. But we plan to take a thoughtful approach to marketing and advertising Comirnaty."" TV ads would be subject to FDA requirements, including that the ads must identify ""the most significant risks of the drug."" Side effects from the vaccines have generally been mild. Effects such as tiredness, headache or chills may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they are normal signs that your body is building protection, and they should go away within a few days, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Serious side effects are rare. More than 408 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Oct. 18, 2021, according to the latest CDC figures. During this time, a reporting system run by the CDC and the FDA received 8,878 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.  We have rated False claims that the vaccines have caused death. There is no clear evidence that the vaccines have caused any deaths. An Instagram post claimed: ""There’s been no"" TV commercials for the COVID-19 vaccines because ""they are required by law to list all adverse side effects."" The vaccine manufacturers have been kept from advertising their vaccines because FDA rules don’t allow advertising for drugs that have only emergency use authorization and not full FDA approval. For the vast majority of the time that the three COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S., they have been available through an emergency use authorization. On Aug. 23, Pfizer’s vaccine became the first to gain FDA approval. Pfizer plans to advertise its vaccine in compliance with the FDA’s disclosure rules, a spokesperson said.

PETA Claims Clinton Saving 200 Animals Annually
","
Former President Bill Clinton was well known for his appetites while at the White House.

The man jogged to McDonald’s for a Big Mac. His ability to pile a plate high with crispy pieces of fried chicken, mounds of  barbecued pork and slabs of smoky ribs was legendary.

But last year the former chief executive shocked America with a real dietary stunner. Clinton announced he was giving up meat and dairy and undertaking a vegan diet. Following a vegan diet means Clinton will not eat any product that comes from animals.

He told reporters that he made the decision after suffering through two major heart procedures.Clinton has undergone bypass surgery and has had stents put in some of his arteries to keep them open.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals responded by naming Clinton its ""Man of the Year.""
It said: ""By choosing a plant-based diet, President Clinton has spared the lives of nearly 200 animals a year..."" 
Did they say 200?

We understand that beef is what’s for dinner, but 200 sounds like Bill was ravaging pastures of cows, not to mention barnyards of chickens and pigs -- the other white meat.

PETA’s estimate is still being disseminated widely -- it appeared just last week in a Los Angeles Times article.

A PETA spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia the group actually has no way of knowing precisely how much meat Clinton ate or how many animals were slaughtered to satiate his carnivorous cravings. But the organization conducted a study that determined the average meat-eating American is responsible for the deaths of 198 animals annually.

It used statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and other sources to calculate the total number of animals raised in the United States and imported for American consumption. PETA then divided the total number of butchered animals by the U.S. population, minus the estimated number of vegetarians and vegans of course.

It didn’t count eggs. But it did count every chicken, cow, pig, fish and duck. But -- and this is where it gets a bit murky -- PETA also counted shrimp, clams, lobsters, oysters, scallops and any other animals that died as part of dairy and meat production.

Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, said this sounds like a reasonable approach and could provide an accurate average. But he still thinks the number is misleading the way PETA used it.

The USDA estimates the average American eats about 85 pounds of chicken, 58 pounds of beef, 46 pounds of pork, 16 pounds of turkey, 1 1/2 pounds of veal and 1 pound of lamb each year.

Hurt estimated -- and he stressed estimated -- this would equal about 28 chickens, one turkey, and a fraction of a cow, pig, and lamb per person annually. This comes to about 30 animals per year, well short of PETA’s 200 number.

Hurt, however, did not include sea creatures in his estimate. The majority of the animals killed would have to be small sea creatures for PETA’s estimate to stand, Hurt said.

""Perhaps the misinterpretation is that these are farm animals we’re talking about,"" he said. ""That’s a little misleading.""

The average American eats 15.8 pounds of fish and shellfish a year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That includes an average of 4.1 pounds of shrimp per person, 4.6 pounds of fish filets and steaks, and 2.5 pounds of canned tuna.

James Dunn, a professor of agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University, said even counting the small creatures he thinks the PETA number still sounds ""way too high.""

The National Meat Association said the number doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.

""They’re only saying that because it sounds good and people can wrap their minds around,"" said Jeremy Russell, director of communications and government relations for the association.

While PETA’s spokeswoman acknowledges its number includes bivalves and other creatures, its number seems to imply a vegan is saving the lives of cute cows, adorable baby chickens and Wilbur-like pigs. Those are, after all, the animals PETA chooses to showcase on its website.

PETA’s statement is technically accurate. But it leaves out important details.

U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland says his health insurance is no different than any other federal employee
","
U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City, is just eight months into his first House term. But he's already developed something of a reputation for his blunt comments and bold approach.

Southerland paid a visit to a Tallahassee retirement home during Congress' annual August recess, where Westminster Oaks community residents asked Southerland about a variety of topics, including the future of entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare. Somehow, according to an account provided by the Tallahassee Democrat, the forum turned to the perks (and mythical perks) of being in elected office. Southerland, a funeral home owner before his congressional run, assured the crowd that his salary ($174,000) is not excessive given the amount of hours required of House members. Plus, he said, he had to give up his role in the family business to comply with Congress' conflict-of-interest rules.

""And by the way, did I mention? They're shooting at us. There is law-enforcement security in this room right now, and why is that?"" he said. ""If you think this job pays too much, with those kinds of risks and cutting me off from my family's business, I'll just tell you: This job doesn't mean that much to me. I had a good life in Panama City.""

His comments about working for the federal government didn't end there. An elderly woman asked if it would help the country's economic problems if more people could get the same health insurance that federal and state employees, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott, enjoy. Her tone was ""accusatory,"" Southerland said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida, and he got defensive in reply.

He told her he selected his Blue Cross Blue Shield plan from several options presented to him upon taking office, just like other rank-and-file federal employees.

""The health insurance plan that I have is no different than any other federal employee's in the United States government,"" said Southerland. ""I pay my portion.""

The woman's question wasn't unusual. Southerland said constituents ask him about members' supposed ""instant pensions"" and free health insurance all the time. Reporters from the Los Angeles Times and our friends at FactCheck.org investigated members' taxpayer-subsidized pay and benefits in summer 2009 as Congress debated health care reform.

Southerland's claim about members of Congress getting the same health insurance option as career federal employees presented us with a different take. We wondered if he had it right.

 A primer about health care plans for federal workers

The federal government is the nation's largest employer with more than 2 million employees. That makes its health care program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program.

About 8 million people -- including most active federal employees, 1.9 million federal retirees, their spouses and children -- obtain private health insurance through enrollment in the federal program. This setup offers many different plans through an insurance exchange and is overseen by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

In 2011, the program offered 207 total plan options, including fee-for-service plans, HMOs and high-deductible health insurance plan options with a tax-advantaged account. The plans cover a variety of services, including hospital visits, surgeries, mental health, prescription drugs, emergency care and ""catastrophic"" benefits. An employee's plan selection is limited to providers near his or her home (and family).

The most popular plan is offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield and covers 62 percent of federal employees and retirees. This year, the bi-weekly employee premium contribution for individual and family plans under standard Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage would cost $199.20. Blue Cross Blue Shield basic coverage would cost $122.53.

Taxpayers pick up about 75 percent of the premium, and employees contribute the rest, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

It's a process very similar to private industry practice, but private employers generally contribute more toward employees' plans, according to a 2007 study by the Congressional Research Service about congressional health benefits. And federal employees have a wider plan selection than private-sector employees, said Pete Sepp, spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit organization that scrutinizes government and taxes.

""They can buy into HMOs, straight insurance, health savings accounts, all kinds of options,"" Sepp said. ""Whereas in the private sector with a given company, you may only have a handful.""

The same buffet of plans is available to federal government workers and members of Congress, experts we talked to said. They pick the plan that is best for them, and they pay the same price. In short, there is no discount for members of Congress, or their staffs.

 Other Congress-only benefits

So Southerland is right that he has the same insurance arrangement as all other federal employees.

Experts, however, pointed to a couple of things he's leaving out.

First, Southerland could have mentioned that federal employees ""have one of the most generous health care plans in the country,"" said David Williams, president of Taxpayers Protection Alliance, a nonprofit group that monitors government spending. For instance, federal employees are not required to have medical examinations and cannot be excluded based on pre-existing conditions. And there are also no waiting periods before their insurance kicks in.

""It's a lot more generous than the private sector,"" Williams said.

On top of that, members of Congress do have two optional health perks that not all other federal employees enjoy.

One is use of the Office of the Attending Physician, a low-profile Navy clinic on the Capitol's first floor that offers basic medical services to members, Hill staffers and sickness-stricken tourists. The clinic was started in 1928 to respond to accidents and emergencies on the Hill, according to a July 2011 profile of the operation by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. Members can opt to regularly access the clinic for services such as X-rays, flu shots and physical therapy at an annual fee of $503.

The other is access to medical and emergency treatment at military hospitals. There's no charge for outpatient care at Bethesda Naval Hospital (or at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, though it has closed).

Southerland, who entered office in January, said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida he did not know about either service. ""I've not needed a doctor since I've been there,"" he said.

As an aside, Southerland's comments about his salary sparked criticism from national Democrats, who said Southerland was out of touch with his Panhandle district. ""While he's complaining about only making $174,000, his constituents are struggling to put food on the table, keep a roof over their head or find a job,"" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Adam Hodge said. 
Southerland told us that the original story about his comments left out the ""positive"" things he said he enjoyed about being in office. Moreover, he told the audience of retirees that he would answer any question about what life and compensation is like for freshman members. 
""At no time was I complaining,"" he said. ""I was explaining.""

 Our ruling

Back to the claim at hand. Southerland said his health insurance plan is no different from ""any other federal employee's"" in the country. The key here is his use of the phrase health insurance plan. While Southerland does get some extra health care benefits as a result of being a member of Congress, his choices of insurance plans are the same as every federal employee using the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. He doesn't get a discount, or free coverage, just because he is a member of Congress. So we rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/30/steve-southerland/southerland-says-his-health-insurance-no-different/

Bob Casey says non-IED deaths in Afghanistan are ""very, very rare""
","
Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., visited Pakistan in late August 2011 -- the deadliest month so far of the war in neighboring Afghanistan, with 66 U.S. servicemembers killed through late August. During a media conference call to discuss his trip, Casey noted that improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, are one of the major the reasons for the death toll in Afghanistan, where U.S. forces and their allies, have been involved for almost a decade.

First, some background. IEDs can be made from easy-to-obtain components, such as batteries, cell phones and radios, yet they create blasts that are often deadly. This makes them a key weapon of insurgents, including those in Afghanistan. They are often planted along roadsides and either detonated directly by passing U.S. vehicles or remotely by insurgents. They can also be carried by suicide bombers.

A wire service story by the French news agency Agence France Press said that during Casey’s conference call, the senator said he had pressed the Pakistani government to reduce the flow of ammonium nitrate -- a component of explosives that can be used in IEDs -- into neighboring Afghanistan.

""They have not implemented a strategy yet, and ... that's one of the reasons I'm over here,"" Casey said on the call. He added, ""I think we made real progress impressing upon the Pakistani leadership our sense of urgency to get results on this strategy to reduce the flow of ammonium nitrate into Afghanistan.""

One statistic Casey used in the conversation caught the attention of a PolitiFact reader, who asked us to check it.

""It is very, very rare that someone who is killed in action is not killed by an IED,"" Casey said, according to the Agence France Presse account. ""And that's why we've got to take steps to focus intensively on a strategy against this kind of explosive device and the main ingredient in that explosive device.’

We wondered whether non-IED deaths in Afghanistan are in fact ""very, very rare.""

We found a report issued by the Brookings Institution titled, ""Afghanistan Index: Tracking Variables of Reconstruction & Security in Post-9/11 Afghanistan."" Using the data, we were able to determine the annual totals for U.S. deaths caused by IEDs in Afghanistan, the total ""hostile"" deaths in Afghanistan and, ultimately, the percentage of hostile deaths that were caused by IEDs. The numbers are based in part on totals compiled by an independent monitoring organization called iCasualties.org. (Here’s some background about iCasualties.org and the use of its data by media outlets.)

2001: 0 IED deaths, 6 total hostile deaths, 0 percent
2002: 5 IED deaths, 41 total hostile deaths, 12 percent
2003: 1 IED death, 32 total hostile deaths, 3 percent
2004: 12 IED deaths, 29 total hostile deaths, 41 percent
2005: 18 IED deaths, 82 total hostile deaths, 22 percent
2006: 27 IED deaths, 86 total hostile deaths, 32 percent
2007: 33 IED deaths, 92 total hostile deaths, 36 percent
2008: 84 IED deaths, 135 total hostile deaths, 62 percent
2009: 142 IED deaths, 277 total hostile deaths, 51 percent
2010: 257 IED deaths, 465 total hostile deaths, 55 percent
2011 (through July 31): 112 IED deaths, 210 total hostile deaths, 53 percent

We also asked the Pentagon for the official statistics, and they provided them. The two data sets differ for varying technical reasons, but the overall pattern is similar:

2001: 3 IED deaths, 3 killed in action, 100 percent
2002: 6 IED deaths, 18 killed in action, 33 percent
2003: 1 IED deaths, 17 killed in action, 6 percent
2004: 14 IED deaths, 25 killed in action, 56 percent
2005: 23 IED deaths, 66 killed in action, 35 percent
2006: 32 IED deaths, 65 killed in action, 49 percent
2007: 34 IED deaths, 83 killed in action, 41 percent
2008: 68 IED deaths, 132 killed in action, 52 percent
2009: 168 IED deaths, 271 killed in action, 62 percent
2010: 268 IED deaths, 437 killed in action, 61 percent
2011 (partial year): 102 IED deaths, 202 killed in action, 50 percent

By either set of numbers, IED deaths account for the largest share of U.S. in-action deaths in Afghanistan -- a large enough share to have inspired the Pentagon to establish the Joint IED Defeat Organization, created to spearhead efforts to defeat the weapon. But Casey went too far when he described non-IED deaths as ""very, very rare.""

Over the past four years, non-IED deaths have ranged between 38 percent and 50 percent of hostile deaths. In 2010, according to the Brookings report, the other causes of hostile deaths, in declining order, were miscellaneous hostile fire (35 percent); helicopter losses (4 percent); mortars, rocket propelled grenades and rockets (3 percent); and suicide bombs (2 percent).

And while the absolute number of IED deaths has spiked, they have actually declined slightly as a proportion of all deaths since 2009.

""Technically, (Casey is) pretty wrong,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, the Brookings Institution senior fellow who coauthored the report.

""The data does not support Casey’s assertion at all,"" agreed Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies and senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security.

April Mellody, a spokeswoman for Casey, said the senator has made IEDs one of his major issues on Capitol Hill for years. She added that Casey was speaking off the cuff on a conference call and prefaced his comment by talking about battle deaths among his Pennsylvania constituents.

""Many of you know in Pennsylvania we have a total of 78 killed in action in Afghanistan,"" Casey said on the conference call in dialogue not included in the Agence France Presse article. ""I literally cannot remember the last time I read about … one of our servicemen and women killed who was not killed by an IED. It is very, very rare that someone who is killed in action is not killed by an IED.""

Mellody said that ""while the transcript makes clear that the intent was to convey the sense that you rarely hear of someone killed in action that was not killed by IED, the overarching point is that the majority of servicemen and women killed in action are killed by IEDs. I don’t think that’s disputable.""

Our ruling

We agree in the accuracy of Casey’s underlying point that IEDs pose a special danger to troops in Afghanistan. However, we think it’s important to correct the record for those who may have been misled by the specific statistic he cited. We think most people would consider 38 percent to 50 percent of hostile deaths to be something more than a ""very, very rare"" occurrence. So we rate Casey’s comment Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/30/bob-casey/bob-casey-says-non-ied-deaths-afghanistan-are-very/

Of 11,000 attempts to amend U.S. Constitution, only 27 amendments have passed
","
At a press briefing about the debt limit negotiations, Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., criticized a Republican push for a balanced budget amendment. He said Congress should not be hasty about amending the Constitution and noted that only a tiny number of amendments ultimately pass.

""We’ve had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789. Twenty-seven amendments have been passed, 10 of them in one shot with the Bill of Rights. And so, we’re now hearing that Republicans may want two, three days before they plunge us into the economic abyss, propose the eleven-thousand and first constitutional amendment so that in less than three days we pass that when it’s taken over 230 years to pass 27 out of the 11,000 that were proposed,"" Rep. Becerra said, adding, ""That’s the height of ridicule."" 
Becerra was later named to the ""super committee"" that is developing a plan to comply with the budget cuts required by the debt ceiling vote.

Before we get to the numbers, it’s worth reviewing the process for amending the U.S. Constitution.

Amendments can be proposed two ways: in Congress or by a national convention assembled at the request of the two-thirds of the states legislatures.  

The national convention approach has been attempted twice but has never been successful. So the successful amendments have all originated in Congress.  

And according to a congressional tally, Becerra is just about right on target: Congress has considered ""approximately 11,372 amendments"" from 1789 through December 31, 2008, the most recent tally available, according to the Statistics and Lists section of the United States Senate website.

Why is it ""approximately"" 11,372? The site says that's because of a number of factors, including inadequate indexing of legislation in the early years of Congress.

Of those 11,372 proposed amendments, only 27 have been approved by Congress and ratified by the states. Why such a low success rate? Senate Historian Donald Ritchie told us that amending the Constitution is ""an extremely complicated process"" and an amendment ""essentially only gets adopted when there’s a broad national consensus on the issue.""

University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt agreed, noting that ""the founders wanted the bar set high because they believed that most issues should be left to the ordinary political process. A constitutional amendment takes an issue away from the normal process of democratic politics, quite likely forever. So it makes sense to require an extraordinary consensus to resolve it permanently.""

Most proposals aren’t inspired by a broad national consensus, however. The motivation for introducing a constitutional amendment is often political. ""Every time the Supreme Court makes a ruling some member of Congress doesn’t like, someone pushes for a constitutional amendment on the matter,"" Ritchie told us.

For example, the day after the Supreme Court ruled flag burning to be protected speech in 1989, U.S. Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., introduced an amendment outlawing desecration of the flag. Amendments to ban flag burning have been introduced in every session of Congress since, spanning more than two decades.

Many amendments are introduced many times. An amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman has been introduced numerous times in the last decade, including four times in a single session of Congress. Some are introduced many times but with variations. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, members of Congress introduced amendments that would provide for the continuity of Congress in the event of a sudden mass vacancy in the Capitol. The amendments varied on what constituted that ""mass vacancy"" and how replacement lawmakers would be chosen. None of the amendments passed. 
Back to Becerra. He was correct that only a tiny percentage of amendments ultimately pass and are ratified. He said 11,000; the official count puts the number at approximately 11,372. That's close enough to earn a True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/30/xavier-becerra/11000-attempts-amend-us-constitution-only-27-amend/

Rick Perry says national debt, Obama's refusal to control spending led to credit rating downgrade
","
A video posted on Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign website portrays the U.S. economy under President Barack Obama as deeply troubled. 
In addition to citing the nation’s housing and unemployment problems, the video's narrator states: ""Record debt and the president's refusal to control spending led to our nation's credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history."" 
For this article, we’re going to assess whether the recent downgrade was really unprecedented and whether Perry accurately recounted the factors behind it. 
Perry's video surely refers to Standard & Poor's Aug. 5 announcement that it had lowered its credit rating of U.S. long-term debt one notch from the top-rated AAA to AA+. S&P is one of the three major U.S. credit-rating agencies, which assess the riskiness of bonds issued by companies and governments. The agencies' ratings are designed to reflect the ability of the borrower (bond issuer) to repay its loans (the bonds). 
The other two major U.S. agencies, Moody's and Fitch, have not followed S&P's lead, maintaining the United States' top credit rating. 
Numerous news reports about the Aug. 5 downgrade described it as a ""first"" in history. We checked with the three major agencies. S&P told us that the U.S. had held its AAA rating since 1941, when the firm was created in a merger. Fitch said that it first assigned a credit rating to the U.S. in 1994 and that it has always been AAA. We didn't hear back from Moody’s, but several recent news articles have reported that it has assigned the U.S. government its highest rating since it began evaluating the country's debt in 1917. 
Interestingly, however, we learned in an Aug. 10 policy paper from the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that a small credit-rating agency based in Pennsylvania, Egan-Jones, downgraded the United States in mid-July. A couple of weeks later, ""S&P followed suit, becoming the first major certified agency to downgrade U.S. long-term debt securities,"" the paper says. 
Also, according to our search of news reports, a rating agency in China, Dagong, downgraded its U.S. rating from in November and then again this month. 
The Egan-Jones downgrade came amid the tumultuous debate in Washington over raising the U.S. debt ceiling, the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. After hitting the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling in May, the U.S. Treasury Department said that it juggled accounts to buy time for further negotiations but that action was needed by Aug. 2. 
In its analysis, Egan-Jones said its downgrade was not related to the ""delay in raising the debt ceiling but rather our concern about the high level"" of the nation’s debt. The firm also cited the government's ""difficulty in significantly cutting spending."" It did not mention Obama. 
S&P’s downgrade followed by three days Obama's signing of a proposal enacting an agreement between the White House and Republican leaders in Congress to increase the debt ceiling while also reducing budget deficits. The deal, agreed upon two days before the Aug. 2 deadline, followed heated debate that was centered on whether deficits should be lowered solely through spending cuts, as advocated by Republican leaders, or through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, as urged by Obama. 
The final plan, which was intended to slow the growth of the nation’s debt, does not contain measures that raise revenue. About $900 billion in spending cuts were implemented with the passage of the bill. Additional cuts will be determined by a committee made up of 12 members of the House and the Senate, with six members from each party. Its goal is to reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over fiscal years 2012 to 2021. It must recommend cuts by Nov. 23. It also could recommend revenue increases. 
The law enables Obama to seek an initial increase in the debt limit of $400 billion, with the possibility of two additional increases, for a total of $2.4 trillion. 
S&P’s Aug. 5 report explaining its downgrade presents two main reasons. 
One is that the size of the U.S. debt is very large and growing. And, the report says, the deal struck this summer doesn’t go far enough in controlling that growth. The deficit-reduction plan ""falls short of the amount that we believe is necessary to stabilize the general government debt burden by the middle of the decade,"" the report says. 
S&P's second major reason is its view that politicians seem unable to agree on what steps to take to lower debt levels — typically measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the nation. S&P's report called the political process ""contentious and fitful"" and said the firm was ""pessimistic"" that the White House and Congress would be able to agree on measures to significantly reduce the debt soon. 
As noted in two PolitiFact Ohio fact-checks, S&P’s report criticizes both parties, but does not apportion blame or indicate which should bear more responsibility. Nor does the report name individuals. Also, it does not advocate specific steps to cut the deficit. 
So, S&P didn’t single out Obama in its rationale for the downgrade. Then how much is he to blame for the nation’s debt levels — the first of the ratings agency’s cited factors? 
That question is debated. 
Analysts Bill Hassiepen of Egan-Jones and Jason Peuquet of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us in interviews that both parties have contributed to the nation’s fiscal situation. Hassiepen said it's true that the debt has ballooned during the Obama administration but it also grew during the two-term presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican. 
In dollar terms, gross national debt — made up of debt held by the public and debt held directly by the government, such as in trust funds for Social Security — increased about $5 trillion during Bush's eight years as president and rose by nearly $4 trillion in the first two years and seven months of Obama's presidency. 
Total debt as a percentage of GDP also jumped under both presidents, rising from 56.4 percent at the end of fiscal 2001 to 69.4 percent in 2008, 84.2 percent in 2009 (a fiscal year shared by Bush and Obama) and 93.2 percent in 2010. 
In a fact-check examining the increase in the national debt under Obama, PolitiFact New Jersey cited an April 2011 report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative that analyzed the difference in the CBO's projections of publicly held debt — the largest chunk of the total national debt — and the actual debt from 2001 to 2011. The report found that about two-thirds of the growth in publicly-held debt — expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product — resulted from new laws, some of which came to be under Bush. 
The report said tax cuts enacted under Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the 2009 stimulus legislation, signed into law by Obama, are three of the five ""most significant legislative drivers"" of the debt. But it also notes that ""no single policy or piece of legislation, however, is overwhelmingly responsible"" for the increase. 
Experts also point to the recent economic downturn as a factor in the growth of the debt. 
We asked Perry’s campaign for additional information about the statement in the video but didn’t hear back. 
So, where does that leave his statement? 
Some of it checks out. First, as far as we can tell, the recent downgrades of U.S. debt were historic. Second, Perry is correct that the nation's rising debt level was a major factor in the rating agencies' decision. 
However, the statement's focus on spending under Obama overlooks the fact that increases also occurred under Bush. And finally, Perry's claim ignores the primary factor cited by S&P for its downgrade, the political divisiveness in Washington that has sapped the firm's confidence that the United States will soon reach a consensus on tackling its debt problems.

Chancellor Jim Petro says boosting bachelor's degrees in Ohio would boost economy
","
Ohio Board of Regents Chancellor Jim Petro was firing up the troops. 

During a speech Aug. 11, 2011, at Ohio State University to announce a new ""enterprise university"" plan aimed at cutting red tape for public universities, Petro preached to his audience of higher education types why pushing up the college graduation rate in Ohio is so important. 

Only 26 percent of Ohioans hold a bachelor’s degree, Petro told his audience. Raising that figure toward the national average of 31 percent would give Ohio’s economy a tremendous boost. 

While Petro told the crowd he’s seen various estimates of the economic impact of a rising bachelor’s degree rate, he said he had a ""solid"" and ""good"" estimate. Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees, Petro said, would mean multiple billions a year in sustained economic growth. 

""For every percent we move up, it means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars,"" he said. 

While the correlation between education levels and higher wages for individuals is fairly well-established, we were struck by the specific price tag Petro was able to put on Ohioans getting their sheepskins. So PolitiFact Ohio checked it out. 

Spencer Waugh, a policy liaison for the Ohio Board of Regents, sent us three documents to corroborate Petro’s claim. In an e-mail, Waugh said Petro’s estimate of $2.5 billion is ""fair and conservative"" given that some studies show less and at least one study shows more. 

The first document was a memo from Waugh to Petro which claimed that a 1 percent jump in Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees would net an income increase of $1.09 billion. Waugh’s memo multiples the number of new Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees by $19,000 a year — a figure he says represents the annual gain for those going from holding a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree.

Waugh’s figures were based on a data from the National Center for Education Statistics as well as 2007 census data, according to Kim Norris, Petro’s communications director. 

The 2007 census data states that the gap is $20,000 per year for adults. The National Center for Education Statistics data shows the gap at $18,000 for males but only $15,000 for females in the age group of 25-34. So $19,000 is in the ballpark.

Using the $19,000 multiplier assumes that everyone who went back to school and got the bachelor’s degree had only achieved a high school education. Presumably some in that group would be people who already have associate’s degrees or ""some college"" and didn’t have far to go to get a bachelor’s degree. People who have ""some college"" or an associate’s degree generally make more than those with just a high school diploma, and that would have an impact on net benefit to Ohio’s economy. 

Regardless, the figure is well below Petro’s estimate of $2.5 billion.

The second document is a memo from Board of Regents staffer Patrick Maloney to Petro which outlines a 2008 Arizona State University study which found that a 1 percent jump would add $1.5 billion to that state’s economy.

The ASU study focuses solely on Arizona and relies on a 2004 Journal of Econometrics paper that estimated the effects on the earnings of all working adults from increasing the proportion of the workforce with a university degree. It used data from the 1980 and 1990 census. 

However, the paper’s author, Enrico Moretti, didn’t specify how he defined adults nor how he calculated hourly wages. And Moretti finds a ""spillover effect"" which pushes up wages for all workers on every education level as the share of workers with a bachelor’s degree increases.

Because Moretti’s spillover effect requires different calculations over each level of educational attainment, it’s virtually impossible to compare Arizona to Ohio as the states have different profiles. Additionally, Arizona’s labor market is much smaller than Ohio’s with only 1.82 million workers year-round versus 5.11 million in Ohio — nearly three times as many. 

If the gains projected in Arizona would come true in Ohio, then you could probably assume an economic benefit of nearly three times what was projected for Arizona -- about $4 billion a year. 

The third study cited by Waugh comes from a CEO for Cities study, which concludes that an improvement of 1 percentage point in each of the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the United State would increase aggregate personal income by $124 billion nationwide. 

In the report, the authors explain that each additional percentage point in aggregate adult four-year college attainment was associated with a $763 increase in annual regional per capita income.

Per capita income refers to the income of each man, women and child. If we apply the increase to Ohio’s  11.5 million population, we get an additional $8.8 billion a year in income.

So where does all this leave Petro’s claim? 

As chancellor of the Board of Regents, Petro wanted to show the importance of more adults getting their college degrees. 

To underscore this point, Petro claimed that a ""good and solid"" estimate showed that increasing the number of bachelor’s degree holders in Ohio by 1 percent would increase ""economic activity"" in the state by $2.5 billion a year. 

Asked for studies to prove this point, Petro’s staffers muster a pair of memos which assert Ohio’s income would rise by $1.09 billion a year and another which estimates that Arizona’s would rise by $1.5 billion a year. The Arizona estimate would extrapolate to about $4 billion in Ohio given the larger labor market here. 

Lastly, they cite a study done on the nation’s biggest urban areas, which if applied to Ohio’s population would mean $8.8 billion in additional income. 

The underlying point in Petro’s statement is accurate -- that raising the percentage of Ohioans who have a bachelor’s degree would benefit Ohio’s economy. 

What is less clear is how great that benefit would be. Petro’s estimate was $2.5 billion. But the supporting documentation his staff provided shows that estimates very wildly. 

Is it $1 billion? $4 billion? $8.8 billion?  Something in between?

That’s a point that needs clarification.

Georgia pol whips up debate on Romney record
","
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is trying to gain support for his presidential bid in Georgia, and one of his chief supporters here recently offered a case for Romney’s candidacy we found quite interesting.

""Georgians are suffering under the leadership of President [Barack] Obama. Mitt Romney is the candidate with the vision and experience to turn around the failing economy,"" Edward Lindsey, a Republican state representative from Atlanta, said in a news release pumped out Aug. 22 by the Romney campaign.

Lindsey, the House majority whip, one of the most influential positions in the Georgia Legislature, added: ""As governor, [Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs. He has the experience in both the private and public sectors to get Americans back to work.""

Romney, widely considered one of the Republican front-runners, is trying to make the argument that he can do a better job than Obama in managing the American economy. The candidate that makes the best argument will likely win the presidency in 2012. With that in mind, we wondered whether Lindsey is right about Romney’s record in Massachusetts. Did he balance the budget without raising taxes and create jobs?

We talked briefly to Lindsey, who referred our questions about his claim to the Romney campaign.

So first, let’s deal with the budget question. Romney took office as Massachusetts’ governor in January 2003. The Massachusetts economy, like much of the country, was struggling before he took office. In 2002, Massachusetts leaders passed tax increases that raised revenue by about $1 billion, said Mike Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Tax Foundation.

In 2003, the money problems continued, and it was now Romney’s job to find solutions. That year, the Massachusetts Legislature balanced the budget through spending cuts and raised revenue through some revisions of the corporate tax code. Romney signed off on several other corporate tax revisions in 2004 and 2005. Those changes resulted in an additional $350 million in revenue, Widmer said. When Romney left office, Massachusetts collected about $18 billion in revenue.

Were those code changes a tax increase?

Romney officials call them ""loopholes."" Widmer refers to them as ""corporate tax increases.""

""I don’t fault Romney,"" Widmer said. ""I commend him and the Legislature for the balanced approach that they took.""

Noah Berger, president of the Massachusetts Budget & Policy Center, does not believe they are tax increases.

""I think it’s fair to say that’s different than raising taxes,"" Berger said of the changes.

The issue has been debated for years.

""[Romney’s] indicating that he balanced a budget without raising taxes is misleading at best,"" Brian Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest business lobbying group, told MSNBC in 2007. ""We respectfully disagree.""

Romney officials countered that he was trying to stop some companies from using ""aggressive accounting"" to reduce their tax liability. The changes, according to MSNBC, included real estate investment trust subsidiaries created by banks to hold mortgages. The parent banks received dividend income from the trusts and took advantage of deductions to lower their state taxes.

Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams told us the candidate was under pressure from the Legislature, which he described as 87 percent Democrat and among the most ""liberal"" in the country, to raise taxes. Romney, he said several times, resisted and did not raise ""broad-based taxes."" We asked whether we should then consider the corporate tax code changes a tax increase.

""[Romney] did not increase taxes to solve a difficult situation,"" Williams said.

As for job creation, federal data show the number of employed Massachusetts residents grew by about 1.3 percent during Romney’s four years as governor. The job growth was greater than population growth. Critics argue Romney cannot make much of a case that he was a great job creator as governor. Massachusetts was ahead of only Louisiana, Michigan and Ohio in the percentage of job growth during Romney’s four years in office. Louisiana leaders then had an excuse for slow job growth, contending with the aftermath of a hurricane called Katrina.

Some economics experts argue governors should get little credit, or blame, for job growth. Williams, the Romney spokesman, correctly noted that unemployment fell from 5.6 percent the month Romney took office in 2003 to 4.6 percent four years later. He also correctly pointed out that Massachusetts had lost jobs in each of the two years before Romney took office. Massachusetts also had about 30,000 fewer employed residents in the two years after he was no longer governor.

Technically, Lindsey has a point on both parts of that specific quote. Romney did preside over an increase in job growth as governor. As past research has shown, it was smaller than nearly every other state. There was improvement, however, on the employment front when he was governor.

As for taxes, Massachusetts didn’t raise the property tax rate or other traditional types of taxes during Romney’s time as governor. But he did close several corporate loopholes, which resulted in companies paying more taxes. Because the changes to the corporate tax code resulted in some businesses paying more in taxes, we believe Lindsey’s statement needed some clarification and rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/30/ed-lindsey/georgia-pol-whips-debate-romney-record/

Bloggers claim Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are socialists
","
Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress -- hot head, visionary, renegade, principled, effective and determined.

Now, if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed, DeFazio is something else -- a socialist.

And he’s not alone. The posts, all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks, says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Rep. Earl Blumenauer, another Democrat from Oregon. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70 while others insist it’s either 73 or 76. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.)

An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name. It also says this: ""I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse.""

""This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one,""  says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. ""The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth.""  

In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem.

While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon.

Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too.

Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth:

""The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).  These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’.""

Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And we couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte.

Before we get to our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office.

Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as ""card carrying"" socialists who are no longer serving include: Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii).

Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including DeFazio and Blumenauer, aren’t Socialists.

The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon ""is completely fraudulent,"" said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5.

There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said.

The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.

Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away.

Second, Llewellyn said, ""if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues.

For the record, both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America.

""This is another made-up Internet rumor that has no merit,"" DeFazio said.

""I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years. I am anti-so called free trade, pro-American jobs, pro-infrastructure investment, pro-fair taxation, anti-amnesty, pro-balanced budget amendment, pro-Wall Street re-regulation, and pro-audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve. I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker.""

Blumenauer was equally annoyed.

""No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from, this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today,"" he said. ""Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation's problems, it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public. It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done.""

Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from?

The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two:

Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA?

A: Seventy

It then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially, not a single socialist.

According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus.

Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist.

Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created.

""There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. ""I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it.""

Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Scott Randolph']","
Rep. Scott Randolph says Gov. Rick Scott wants to take away $60 million in health care rebates
","
Under the leadership of Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the state's Republican-dominated Legislature, Florida has rejected at least $19 million to implement parts of the controversial federal health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

The decision shouldn't be much of a surprise. 

Scott, after all, spent millions of his own fortune to form Conservatives for Patients Rights to fight the health care law, and he then ran for governor on a platform of opposing the controversial legislation. (Florida also is leading a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the law, which is expected to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.)

But the state isn't only poised to turn down tax dollars, a Democratic state legislator now says. Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, told a nationwide cable audience recently that Scott is trying to prevent Floridians from accessing millions of dollars in rebates from their HMOs. 

Randolph -- whose wife Susannah Randolph heads up Florida Watch Action, a progressive group behind the Pink Slip Rick campaign -- made the claim during an interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC on Aug. 11, 2011.

""You've got a situation where Florida has the second-highest rate of uninsured,"" Randolph said. ""We have one, obviously the highest rates of senior per capita, and here you have a governor that is absolutely determined to use to put ideology above the health of their own citizens. In addition -- I'm sorry, in addition to the money you already talked about, he also is trying to get a waiver under the federal healthcare law that would deny consumers in Florida the right to the $60 million in rebates they have from their own HMOs."" 
Randolph made a couple of claims in his response to Sharpton, but we wondered if he was correct to say that Scott is trying to get a waiver under the federal health care law that would deny consumers the right to $60 million in rebates from their own HMOs. 
The $60 million Randolph is talking about 
Randolph was referring to a provision in the federal health care law known as ""medical loss ratios,"" which require insurance companies to spend 80 to 85 percent of premiums on health care rather than on overhead starting in 2011. If insurers fail to meet that standard they must pay rebates to consumers starting in 2012. The federal government has provided this fact sheet about the new standard.

The idea of medical loss ratios isn't new -- what's new here is the 80 percent threshold set up in the health care law. Currently, insurers in Florida must meet a 65 percent standard and HMOs must meet a 70 percent standard. 

As part of the law, states can apply to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver to the new requirements. To receive a waiver, states must show that meeting the 80 percent standard may result in fewer choices for consumers. So far, HHS has granted a handful of waivers, but the majority of applications -- including Florida's -- were pending as of Aug. 23. The waivers are temporary -- all states must comply with the 80 percent standard by 2014.

Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation applied for a waiver in March -- initially asking that the state be allowed to keep its current 65 percent and 70 percent standard. In June, OIR proposed phasing in the new 80 percent threshold: raising the standard to 68 percent in 2011, 72 percent in 2012 and 76 percent in 2013.

In the state's application, Office of Insurance Regulation Commissioner Kevin McCarty argued that insurers may stop issuing new policies due to the threat of rebates, that four insurers have already notified the office that they intend to withdraw from the individual market as a result of the new rules and that the 80 percent requirement hurts companies trying to establish in Florida because administrative costs can be higher in the early years.

""There is simply no way to build a growing company on that amount of money,"" McCarty wrote in the application.

 News articles cite the $60 million

We found at least two news articles stating that if the waiver is granted, Florida's consumers would lose $60 million. 

""Floridians could miss out on an estimated $60 million in health-insurance rebates next year if state officials successfully block enforcement of spending rules in the year-old reform law,"" stated Health News Florida July 20. The article stated that about 340,000 Floridians would be eligible for the rebates.

And the Palm Beach Post wrote on March 17: ""Florida consumers would lose cash or insurance benefits worth about $60 million if Florida is allowed to opt out of a key element of health reform this year"" -- the article attributed that conclusion to Citibank managed care industry analyst Carl McDonald.

McDonald and a colleague wrote in a report to investors in March predicting that the federal government will deny Florida's application arguing that none of the six largest plans in the state -- which dominate the majority of the market -- will drop coverage in Florida if the 80 percent rule stays in place. 

McDonald sent us a copy of his 13-page report which states:

""Based on the 2009 data, it appears consumers would have received around $60 million in rebates had minimum MLRs (minimum loss ratios) been in place last year, and given how favorable utilization was in 2010, it seems likely the rebates would have been even bigger last year."" 
As part of its application for a waiver, Florida created two different scenarios. 

In the first scenario, they calculated how much insurance companies would have to pay in rebates under the new 80 percent standard using 2009 data. The figure? About $62 million (see column F).

In the second scenario, the state showed the effect if the state's waiver request was granted -- allowing Florida to slowly ramp up to the 80 percent mark. In that case, insurers would be required to pay out about $4.8 million rebates (compared to $62 million in rebates without the waiver).

What's critical to note in both scenarios is that the dollar figures are based on 2009 data, before insurers had to comply with the 80 percent threshold. More on that shortly.

The state's response

Setting aside the numbers for a moment, OIR spokesman Jack McDermott said it's wrong for Randolph to say Scott is trying to get the waiver. The application was actually made by Office of Insurance Regulation, which is overseen by Scott and the Cabinet acting as the Financial Services Commission. 
The Cabinet includes three Republicans, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. 
On the numbers, McDermott notes that the $62 million figure is based on 2009 data -- at a time when insurers didn't have to meet the 80 percent standard but had to meet the state's 65 to 70 percent standard. Companies are now making changes in response to the new standard, he said.

That's a flaw in trying to anticipate what the rebates might be. The $62 million assumes insurers would ignore the new standard and make no changes, exposing themselves to having to pay tens of millions of dollars in rebates. 

Like it or hate it, insurance companies -- and businesses -- attempt to make as much money as possible. So it's natural that if they're required to spend 65 to 70 percent of insurance premiums on health care costs (meaning the rest can be spent on overhead or kept as profits) that's what they are likely going to do.

And if the standard is raised to 80 percent, they're likely to try and adapt -- out of fear of having to rebate premium payments.

In this case it's the regulation that's influencing how a company operates, not free will.

Will all companies move right in line with the new 80 percent threshold? Probably not. Will all insurers do absolutely nothing? Probably not. 
McDonald, in a rebuttal, acknowledged that the money won't necessarily be paid out in rebates. But dollars that aren't going to rebates, he said, are in theory helping lower health care costs or improving health care coverage. 
For example, if United knows it needs to get to an 80 percent medical loss ratio, it has choices: It can pay a rebate to get to the 80 percent threshold, it can lower their prices for customers by the same amount or it can offer additional health care coverage. ""One way or another consumers benefit."" 
Conclusion 
Randolph said Scott ""is trying to get a waiver under the federal health care law that would deny consumers in Florida the right to the $60 million in rebates they have from their own HMOs."" 
The statement has a few flaws. 
Technically Scott isn't seeking the waiver -- the Office of Insurance Regulation (an office overseen by Scott and the Cabinet) is. But that's a minor point. 
More importantly, the waiver wouldn't necessarily deny consumers $60 million in rebates. At most, the waiver would phase in possible rebates over three years. And while rebates are possible, they are not a given. That's because the dollar figure is based on how insurance companies operated before prior to having to meet the new 80 percent standard. We won't know to what extent insurers will make changes to meet that new 80 percent standard yet, but it's safe to assume that they will try to avoid paying out tens of millions of dollars a year in rebates. 
However, it is clear that Scott is supportive of getting a waiver for a program that was designed to be pro-consumer by resulting in either lower rates or better coverage.

The Wisconsin Club for Growth says Democrats in the Legislature in 2009 voted for various “pork projects” including “a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks.”
","
There was plenty of hot air expended during the unprecedented state Senate recall elections during the summer of 2011. An enormous amount of time and money was spent by political parties and third-party groups to protect or promote their candidates.

And, of course, to attack their rivals’ record.

The elections are over. But some of the claims lingered with us.

One involved the Bradley Center, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, Marquette University Golden Eagles, Milwaukee Admirals and Milwaukee Mustangs. With the busy season of the downtown Milwaukee venue just around the corner, we thought we’d take a deeper look.

The Bradley Center is a $90 million gift to the community from Jane Bradley Pettit in honor of her father, industrialist Harry Lynde Bradley. The facility is a state building but operates without state taxpayer support.

For years, the Bradley Center board of directors and the Bucks have complained the facility, which opened in 1988, is obsolete for an NBA team. Most recently, the team sought $10 million in borrowing for renovations, a request that Gov. Scott Walker shot down.

In recent years, a variety of smaller-scale renovations have been undertaken to generate more revenue for the team. That includes a new scoreboard that debuted in the fall of 2010 in an effort to increase advertising revenue.

That scoreboard popped up in a string of television ads the conservative Wisconsin Club For Growth used to attack Democrats running in the recall elections. For instance, one spot targeted state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo), who lost to state Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon) in his recall election.

""Clark voted for $37 million in pork barrel projects, including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks,"" the narrator states in the ad.

Did state taxpayers really buy the Bucks a new $5 million scoreboard?

Let’s go to the replay.

We asked the Club for Growth for backup, and they sent us to a Journal Sentinel story about items included in the budget, and the budget bill itself.

So, we dug further.

The Bradley Center board sought state assistance for the facility, arguing for the economic benefits that the facility provides to Milwaukee. The request was heard in 2009 by the state Building Commission, which handles requests for large-scale construction projects.

The commission voted April 1, 2009, to recommended a $5 million grant for the Bradley Center, and the amount was included in the proposed 2009-’11 state budget.

Among those voting to approve the borrowing was commission member Dean Kaufert, Republican member of the state Assembly from Neenah. Clark was not a member of the commission, nor were any of the Democrats targeted by the Club for Growth ads.

The bonding for the Bradley Center was then included in the budget by then-Gov. Jim Doyle.

Al Runde, an analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, said there was no amendment made to remove the Bradley Center funding from the budget package. In other words, there was no separate vote on that item. 
(After this item was published, our attention was directed to a budget amendment that would have -- among other things -- cut the funding for the Bradley Center and nine other projects approved by the Building Commission. That amendment was tabled on a 51-47 vote with Clark voting in the majority.)

The budget was approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature with Clark among those voting in favor of it.

We’ve seen this type of approach before, where a vote for an entire budget is used to hammer home a point on one relatively small item contained within it. This often distorts what really happens in the Legislative process.

Beyond that, the Club for Growth’s claim is off base when it says the $5 million went for a scoreboard.

""Nothing in the act says anything about the scoreboard, just general funding"" for the Bradley Center, Runde said.

The Bradley Center spent $1.29 million of the state money on the $3.2 million scoreboard, said Evan Zeppos, spokesman for the center’s board. The state funds also went to repair concrete, lighting, elevator and escalator maintenance, plumbing, flooring and a new hockey dasher-board system, he said.

The Bradley Center has not yet spent the entire $5 million, and more than $580,000 remains on hand, Zeppos said.

Zeppos noted the scoreboard isn’t just for the Bucks. Marquette, the Admirals and other tenants also use it.

""It’s for everything we do there,"" Zeppos said.

Let’s settle the score on this one.

The Wisconsin Club for Growth said Clark and other Democrats voted for $5 million for a new scoreboard for the Bradley Center. 
There’s no evidence that Clark had an opportunity to vote yea or nay on that specific matter, although he did vote to table an amendment that included the Bradley Center funding and numerous other projects. And it’s a reach to make a specific charge against him for an item that was wrapped in a broader vote. What’s more -- and more importantly -- the group misstates how the state money was used. About a fourth of the money went to the scoreboard. And it’s not specific to the Bucks.

So it’s wrong in multiple ways. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2011/aug/29/club-growth/wisconsin-club-growth-says-democrats-legislature-2/

Sen. Sherrod Brown likens rooting for the Red Sox to rooting for the drug companies
","
Politics and policy were the scheduled topics when Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown appeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program Aug. 4, 2011.

In a startling example of ambush television, however, the segment opened with a report about the Boston Red Sox beating the Cleveland Indians the night before -- much to the delight of host Joe Scarborough and political analyst Mike Barnicle, who once wrote in the Boston Globe, ""Baseball isn’t a life-and-death matter, but the Red Sox are.""

""Did you know that?"" Scarborough gloated about the victory. ""And did you know it's twice in a row?""

""I should have been on 'Morning Joe' Tuesday morning after Cleveland won Monday night,"" Brown said. ""If you would have invited me then ...""

""We didn't,"" Scarborough cut in. ""Actually, we never report on any of the Red Sox games when they lose. But fortunately it doesn't happen much these days.""

Brown, unfazed, made a pitch for the Tribe: ""They're a young team that's going to be good in the years ahead, and I will gloat a couple of years from now ... as you gloat today, Mr. Barnicle.""

Then he threw a hard curve.

""Rooting for the Red Sox is like rooting for the drug companies,"" Brown said. ""I mean it's like they have so much money, they buy championships against the working-class, middle-America Cleveland Indians. It's just the way you are.""

That brushed back Scarborough and Barnicle. PolitiFact Ohio, scoring at home, raised its Chief Wahoo mug of morning Joe in salute.

But when a self-proclaimed member of Red Sox Nation wrote to say the senator ""needs to check his facts,"" we were stirred to action.

We asked if Brown’s analogy could be right. Is rooting for the Red Sox really like rooting for the drug companies?

It’s a claim difficult to quantify, but we’re talking baseball bragging rights here, not more mundane topics like reforming Social Security or extending jobless benefits.

A generation or so ago, the Red Sox bore almost striking resemblance to the Indians of today. They were a good and interesting team that teased and tantalized its fans, only to end up breaking their hearts.

""No team is worshipped with such a perverse sense of fatality,"" sports columnist Thomas Boswell wrote in 1982. He said it was ""an almost inexorable baseball law"" that ""a Red Sox ship with a single leak will always find a way to sink.""

Boston played in the only single-game play-offs ever held in the American League and lost them both -- to Cleveland in 1948 and to the New York Yankees in 1978. They played in memorable World Series in 1946, 1967, 1975 and 1986, but suffered an 86-year championship drought, from 1918 to 2004. The drought usually was blamed on the Curse of the Bambino, or simply The Curse, which followed the sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920.

The Yankees were their arch-rivals, winners of 40 American League pennants since 1921, a well-heeled juggernaut that always seemed ready to deny Boston, Cleveland and everyone else a championship ring.

""Rooting for the Yankees,"" went the famous line that inspired Brown's, ""is like rooting for U.S. Steel"" -- or for General Motors or Standard Oil or the Roman Empire. In more recent versions, it was like rooting for OPEC or Microsoft, or for the house at a casino, or for Brad Pitt to get the girl.

The original line was credited to a variety of sources including sportswriter Red Smith, comedian Joe E. Lewis, one-time Tribe owner Bill Veeck and publisher Bennett Cerf.

Jim Murray, the legendary sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, staked a claim to saying it first, citing a piece he wrote for Life magazine in 1950 titled ""I Hate the Yankees.""

""For my money,"" he wrote, ""the Yankees were and are super-champions for the same reasons General Motors or U.S. Steel or Standard Oil are super-businesses. They have more fans paying more money than any other club in the history of the game... The Yankees traditionally dominate baseball by sheer economic might.""

Noting that someone had written a song about ""the poor old Yankees"" suffering a rash of injuries that year, Murray wrote: ""I would as soon feel sorry for Standard Oil because it was getting slightly the worst of it in a marketing fight with an independent gas station in East Podunk.""

Revisiting the subject almost 50 years later, as the 1998 season opened, Murray wrote, ""The Yankees were built with dollar bills. So were last year's champions, the Florida Marlins"" -- the team that beat the Indians in seven games.

Murray said he didn't think it was necessary to study rosters, scour scouting reports or do ""any of the usual things we do at this time of year to divine a champion. All we have to do is look at a balance sheet.""

For example, he said, ""The Boston Red Sox are off and running at 18-7. Think it's because Mo Vaughn took off a few pounds? Naw. It's because the Red Sox put on a few. They went from a $38.7-million payroll to a $51.6-million one.""

That was 1998.

This year, the Yankees opened the season with the biggest payroll in baseball, almost $203 million. An off-season spending spree pushed Philadelphia to $173 million and second place -- just past Boston, whose payroll of almost $162 million ranks No. 3 (Cleveland was 26th in the major leagues at $49 million.).

A big payroll doesn't guarantee a championship, though the Red Sox -- a good team that got better -- have won two since getting the boost of deep-pocketed new ownership in 2002. A big payroll does permit the pursuit of free agents to improve rosters. It makes possible the cultivation and retention of home-grown players.

Their well-balanced roster shows that the Red Sox have been able to do both.

""The point is not that if you have more money than someone else you automatically win more games,"" journalist and bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell, who has made a specialty of testing conventional wisdom and accepted premises against research, said in an interview with ESPN.com. ""The point is that if you have more money than someone else you're playing a different game than they are. Wal-mart is not competing against mom-and-pop corner stores. They're in a different business. And it isn't fun, at the end of the day, to watch a mom-and-pop compete against Wal-mart. It's painful and pointless.

""To root for the Yankees or the Red Sox,"" he said, ""is the functional equivalent of rooting for Microsoft or General Electric.""

Brown did not name any company in his analogy. In mentioning the drug companies,  however, he referred to the industry that ranked fourth-largest in revenues on IndustryWeek's IW U.S. 500 for 2011. In terms of profitability, the pharmaceutical industry was third in the Fortune 500 ranking of return on revenues for 2009, the most recent we found.

And the drug companies have served as a foil for Brown for more than a decade.

As a congressman, he gave senior citizens free bus rides to Canada to buy prescription drugs at a fraction of their cost in the United States. He pushed to include prescription drugs in Medicare benefits, to allow the prompt reimportation of cheaper drugs made in the U.S. but sent abroad, and to speed low-cost generic drugs to pharmacy shelves.

So what’s the count?

The template for Brown's statement was the old line about rooting for the Yankees, a quip that was apt enough to last more than half a century. Its likely originator, Jim Murray, later said his point was that the Yankees ""were not an athletic hegemony but an economic one."" Citing examples to prove that point, Murray linked spending to the success of the Red Sox.

Brown's point was much the same.

While the intangibles of baseball make proving it difficult, if not impossible, it is true that the on-field success of the Red Sox has tracked their off-field prosperity. And it is true that the team's salary ranking -- No. 3 -- gives it about the same relative position in baseball that drug companies occupy in industry.

Brown checked his facts, but not his swing. And while Red Sox fans may protest, we call them as we see them.

"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich Says Defense Spending at Historic Low
","In case you missed it, there’s been a lot of talk recently about spending cuts in Washington, D.C.

Led largely by conservative Republicans, Congress curtailed future spending by more than $3 trillion earlier this month. But there’s one element of the federal budget that some conservatives are reluctant to curtail -- money for guns, fighters, tanks and missiles.

A few Republican presidential candidates are even calling for increased military spending as they rally the base in anticipation of next year’s primaries.

For example, Newt Gingrich, Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. House speaker, last month tweeted: ""We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor.""

In 1941 the country was unprepared to fight the Axis powers, but today, with thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, cruise missiles raining down on Libya and predator drones circling terrorist enclaves across the globe, is our investment in defense really comparable to the days preceding the Japanese sneak attack?

Gingrich and his staff did not return calls seeking clarification of his tweet.

Benjamin Friedman, a defense research fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said this lack of response is predictable.

Friedman said politicians and other policy wonks sometimes use the percentage of gross domestic product, which refers to the value of all goods and services produced in the country, spent on defense as a talking point to support spending billions more on military gear. But he said the statement is so ""indefensibly false"" they typically will not engage in a discussion about the concept.

""They’re not lying, they’re just being deliberately obtuse and misleading,"" he said.

The actual numbers don’t help Gingrich.

The United States spent 4.8 percent of its GDP on defense in 2010, according to statistics from the Office of Management and Budget. Defense spending was smaller than 4.8 percent of the GDP from 2009 back through 1991, 1979, 1978 and 1948.

""It’s wrong for every year since the end of the Cold War and other years besides,"" Friedman said.

So Gingrich is flat out wrong on his statement, but maybe the facts were erroneous -- grossly erroneous, true -- but the general idea that we spend less is still spot on?

Gingrich is wrong there, too, said Gordon Adams, a former senior White House national security budget official for President Bill Clinton.

""Beyond the point of him being factually incorrect, it’s an irrelevant measure,"" Adams said. ""The GDP is a completely red herring argument. It doesn’t tell you how much you’re spending in real dollars or what you’re getting.""

Adams and Friedman both point out the GDP is growing and therefore tying defense spending to the GDP would suggest military spending would have to increase every year.

""It’s kind of crazy to say you should have a fixed percentage of your wealth to spend on defense because your enemies and circumstances in the world change,"" Friedman said.

A better way to compare defense spending, or any kind of government spending over a long period of time, is to use dollars adjusted for inflation, Adams said.

The United States spent $700 billion on defense in 2010, $300 billion more than the adjusted Cold War average, Adams said.

Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project, said defense spending also does not include funding for other agencies that contribute to national defense such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State Department.

""It’s a distorted way to think of it for the sole purpose to pimp for more money,"" Wheeler said.

Gingrich tweeted that the country now spends less on defense as a percentage of the GDP than at any time since the start of World War II. That’s a firm statement, but since the Cold War ended, and in a few other years as well, the percent of GDP used for defense has been consistently lower than current spending levels.

Further, experts say the concept is highly misleading.

Gingrich gets our lowest rating on this one. Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb4f23c2-73ca-401b-a074-f0e112a9968a",/factchecks/2011/aug/29/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-defense-spending-historic-low/

Scott says debt-limit deal pays for half of Bush tax cuts
","
U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, was not pleased with the debt limit deal that became law earlier this month.

He said the measure will lead to deep cuts to programs that help needy families, students and seniors while keeping George W. Bush-era tax cuts that benefit the middle-class and wealthy. Scott has long called for ending the tax reductions.

""The estimated savings of this deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade,"" Scott said in an Aug. 1 news release.

Do the savings in the debt deaI come to half the price of keeping the Bush tax cuts? We decided to check.

First some background. The deal passed by Congress earlier this month expanded the nation’s debt limit to $16.4 trillion -- a $2.1 trillion increase the will give the federal government enough money to pay its bills until early 2013.

The measure requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget over the next 10 years in order to meet or exceed the size of the debt ceiling increase.

The deal calls for $900 billion in cuts up front. A recently appointed bipartisan deficit reduction panel is charged with finding an additional $1.5 trillion that could come from spending cuts and revenue hikes, though House Republicans could still block any move to increase taxes.
If the committee deadlocks, there’s a trigger in the legislation that would enact $1.2 trillion of cuts to domestic and defense spending.

So the total reduction would be at least $2.1 trillion and could as much as $2.4 trillion.

Scott, in a phone interview, said he used the $2.1 trillion figure in his comparison of spending reductions to the 10-year cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.

Jason Peuquest, a policy analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Scott is justified in using the lower figure. ""It seems the $2.1 (trillion) is what people are focusing on most because the goal of the super committee is backed up by this automatic trigger,"" he said.

Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed. He said there is ""at least an even chance"" that the deficit panel will not reach an agreement, forcing the total of $2.1 trillion in spending reductions.

The Bush tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003 and scheduled to expire in 2010. Congress, at the end of last year, extended them through 2012.

Scott pointed us to Congressional Budget Office reports that say the total cost of keeping the tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion.  Of that amount, $3.3 trillion comes from lost revenues and the cost of interest payments needed to service the additional debt caused by the tax relief.

The remaining $600 billion is the cost of maintaining adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Bush tax cuts required many Americans who had once itemized their  returns to pay the more expensive AMT. As a result, about 20 million Americans lost part or all of the benefits of the tax relief. Congress came to their aid by increasing AMT exemptions.

Three analysts said it’s legitimate to lump together the expense of extending Bush tax cuts for 10 years with the costs related to increasing the Alternative Minimum Tax exemptions.

""Back when the (initial Bush) tax cuts were in play, a lot of people thought they wouldn’t be given any of the benefits of the tax cuts because more people would be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax,"" Peuquet said.

So let’s sum this up.

Scott says spending cuts required by the recent debt-limit deal pay half the cost of maintaining the Bush tax cuts through 2020.

Scott figures $2.1 trillion in spending reductions will result from the agreement. That’s the smallest amount of cuts Congress is required to make under the deal, but it’s a widely-used number because its set in stone.

The CBO says the total cost of extending the Bush tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion.
That means the spending cuts would equal 53.8 percent of the Bush tax cut costs through the end of the decade.

It’s questionable whether the divided Congress will agree on a bipartisan package of spending cuts and revenue increases to achieve the maximum $2.4 trillion goal in debt savings. If it does, the savings over the decade would equal 61.5 percent of the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.

But three analysts said Scott’s use of the $2.1 trillion figure is solid. His claim lands close to a moving bull’s-eye and we rate it True.",/factchecks/2011/aug/29/bobby-scott/scott-says-debt-limit-deal-pays-half-bush-tax-cuts/

Assemblyman Joseph Cryan says direct shipment of wine would allow underage residents easy access to alcohol
","
You can do a lot of things with the click of a mouse. End a relationship. Destroy a career. Forward funny pet videos to your friends.

Add get alcohol when you’re underage to the list of possibilities if a bill allowing wineries to ship directly to New Jersey consumers becomes law, said Assemblyman Joseph Cryan (D-Union). 
Cryan wrote an op-ed criticizing legislation in the state Senate  that would allow direct shipment of wine. Cryan has sponsored a bill that would amend the state’s licensing laws for wineries but does not allow direct shipping.

And the debate over shipping wine is certain to raise at least one concern: underage drinking.

""Direct shipment provides a virtual store for teens to buy alcohol they would otherwise be prohibited from buying at liquor stores. It makes the face-to-face purchase transaction practically irrelevant; and makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click,"" Cryan wrote in an op-ed posted on CourierPostOnline.com on Aug. 21.

Can the under-21 crowd get drunk with the click of a mouse? PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s not that easy.

Cryan’s deputy chief of staff, Dave Jenkins, sent PolitiFact New Jersey a 2005 report from an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the claim. The report said ""the Internet acts as a general store"" where teenagers can ""get hold of almost anything,"" including beer, wine and liquor, but also marijuana, prescription drugs and ""crack dealer locator services.""

Though the report raises concerns about what teenagers can access online, it does not address underage consumers ordering wine through a licensed winery.

A 2003 study by the Federal Trade Commission and a 2010 report from the Comptroller of Maryland -- that noted the difficulty of proving a cause and effect relationship in this case -- found little to no evidence of an increase in underage drinking due to direct shipment of wine.

The Maryland report said, ""The reasons for this may be that: (1) ""wine"" is not the drink of choice for youth; and (2) direct shipment of wine is costly and time-consuming.""

Jenkins called the Maryland report ""useless"" because its conclusion ""only recognizes the need for a better method of evaluation.""

Other studies show, and experts said, that underage consumers looking for alcohol probably aren’t going to buy wine.

An April report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and a 2006 report by Columbia University’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse both concluded that wine is not the first choice for underage drinkers.

Marilyn Aguirre-Molina, professor of clinical population and family health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said, ""teens are going online for everything imaginable, but something like alcohol -- which requires a credit card, an address to mail it too, as well as patience until it arrives -- online purchase of wine is a drag and hassle, especially if it’s the least preferred of alcoholic beverages.""

Even if someone younger than 21 wanted to order a bottle of wine and successfully placed that order online, Cryan’s claim starts to unravel when the product is packaged.

FedEx and UPS require packages containing wine to be labeled, saying they contain alcoholic beverages. Also, both companies require the signature of an adult 21 or older upon delivery. The U.S. Postal Service does not ship wine.

Cryan’s deputy chief of staff said it’s lawmakers’ responsibility to ensure underage individuals do not get access to alcohol.

""We cannot depend upon the policies of FedEx, or others to properly deny those underage from delivery.  We must be proactive, not reactive.  What if FedEx changes their policy tomorrow?"" he wrote in an email.

Joanne Tetlow, a division staff attorney with the Comptroller of Maryland's field enforcement division who compiled the agency’s report on direct wine shipment, said since ""we don’t license consumers like we do retailers"" states that allow direct shipment of wine are relying on the shipping companies.

And there is a chance those measures will fail.

""Do we believe it represents a threat? Absolutely,"" said Michael Scippa, public affairs director for Alcohol Justice, a California-based industry watchdog. He said age verification online and by delivery companies are ""two areas where it seems easy to or possible to bypass the law.""

The ruling

Cryan claimed that allowing wineries to ship their product directly to consumers makes ""underage drinking as simple as a mouse click.""

But even if an underage individual can order a bottle of wine online, the two major shipping companies in the U.S. require an adult signature in order to deliver the package.

Cryan’s claim exaggerates a legitimate concern, but we can’t ignore the hint of truth in the statement -- that shipping wine directly to homes provides another opportunity for underage access.  

We rate his statement Mostly False.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus says public-employee unions spent $30 million on Wisconsin Senate recall races
","
In a round of interviews following the Wisconsin Senate recall elections, the Republican Party’s national chairman framed the results as a clear victory for Gov. Scott Walker.

Republicans lost two seats but retained Senate control, despite a major -- and expensive -- effort from Democrats and their supporters.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown on Aug. 18, 2011 that the results show Walker shouldn’t worry about the left trying to recall him in 2012. He argued voters stood with Walker in the face of the challenge by public employee unions outraged over his changes that curtailed collective bargaining for most government workers.

And he put a number on the union’s effort.

""I don’t think he should be worried at all, and if the public employee unions want to flush another $30 million down the toilet, and then allow Scott Walker to be even stronger and win a recall election … then they should go ahead and do it, because the $30 million they flushed down the toilet will be $30 million they don’t have for other races. So, hey, go for it.""

Thirty million -- that’s a pile of money.

Especially if that’s just what unions spent on the races.

An RNC spokesman told us Priebus -- the former Wisconsin GOP chairman -- actually was referring not just to labor unions, but to any spending on the pro-Democrat side.

""Analysis from our political folks in Wisconsin suggests that when all is said and done, pro-Democrat groups will have spent between $20 (million) and $30 million on their failed effort to win a majority in the state Senate,"" said Ryan Mahoney of the RNC.

Of course, Priebus on MSNBC limited his claim to the public unions -- and said a flat $30 million. So there are already problems with his claim.

We’ll focus on what Priebus said on MSNBC, but also take a quick look at spending by both sides.

Asked for backup for his claim, the RNC sent us dozens of links to media accounts of the disclosed spending in the recalls.

Priebus, like reporters, based his arithmetic on what is publicly known about spending in the nine races. That’s notable. Under state and federal laws, millions of dollars in campaign spending by various political groups goes unreported, but Priebus isn’t suggesting he has inside information about that. He’s citing the information that is publicly released.

That -- and a decision by labor groups to collectively work through a political action committee, We Are Wisconsin, that has to publicly account for its spending -- makes our math easier.

A coalition of national, state and local labor groups funded most of the activities of We Are Wisconsin. The national AFL-CIO was most prominent, followed by various teachers unions; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Service Employees International Union, and many others.

We Are Wisconsin was by far the major player on the pro-Democrat side, spending nearly $10.8 million through election day, according to official figures reported to the state.

Several teachers unions and miscellaneous small unions separately spent about $1 million more.

So that’s a total of about $11.8 million, far short of $30 million.

Let’s look at this another way, and compare our numbers with those of other organizations that track campaign spending.

We looked at links between We Are Wisconsin and other major liberal groups active in the election. If you stretch the union label to include groups that got direct financial support from We Are Wisconsin, you could count at least another $2.2 million.

So that would get you to $14 million in union-linked money.

Meanwhile, two organizations have produced comprehensive scorecards of left vs. right spending in the nine recall contests. They base their numbers on official campaign reports filed with the state Government Accountability Board.

The John K. MacIver Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Wisconsin, produced an elaborate flow chart of pro-Dem spending – including unions but also ""national and state liberal groups.""

MacIver’s definition, then, was broader than Priebus’ ""union"" claim.

Still, its total tops out at about $15.2 million, or roughly half of what Priebus claimed.

The most prominent campaign-spending tracker is the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit that advocates for transparency in campaign spending. It’s allied with a coalition of left-leaning groups, including several unions.

Its total for pro-Democrat spending by groups: $15.1 million.

Again, $15 million is far short of $30 million.

None of these figures include spending by the candidates themselves.

The candidate spending was dwarfed by the outside groups, but still amounted to about $2.5 million by all the Democrats in the recall elections, according to our tabulations of reports filed with the state Accountability Board.

So, even if you include candidate spending -- which Priebus didn’t -- the pro-Dem total is only about $17.6 million.

That’s the pro-Dem side. What about the pro-GOP side?

Looking just at the publicly disclosed money, Republican candidates and pro-GOP groups spent about $3.5 million compared to the $17.6 million on the other side, according to official figures compiled by the Democracy Campaign.

That’s a big mismatch -- but there’s a big caveat.

Several prominent pro-Republican groups -- including the biggest player on that side, the Wisconsin Club for Growth -- were set up in way that doesn’t require disclosure of millions of dollars in spending on TV ads and other activities. To a much lesser extent, pro-Democrat groups did the same.

The Democracy Campaign estimates that undisclosed spending by groups could equal the publicly reported figures. But that’s an educated guess at amounts of undisclosed spending.

The bottom line: Nobody really knows how the undisclosed numbers break down.

So we -- and Priebus -- were left with the publicly reported numbers.

Priebus claimed public-employee unions poured $30 million into the state Senate recalls in Wisconsin.

But the publicly disclosed spending reports that he cites -- by our account as well as groups affiliated with the left and right -- put total spending by pro-Democrat groups at $15 million or less. And that includes campaigning by liberal groups not connected to unions. Based on available information, even if he meant to say all pro-Democratic spending he was way off.

In an opinion column published Aug. 9, 2011, Margaret Carlson of Bloomberg News says Gov. Rick Perry has said some ""far-out things."" Among examples: Perry ""has advocated abandoning Social Security, scuttling Medicaid and ending the federal income tax.""

Talk about shaking up the USA. Is this right?

We did not hear back from Carlson on the basis of her claim.

But we had an idea of where to start our check. ""Fed Up!,"" Perry’s 2010 book urging Americans to resist Washington’s drift, includes his critiques of Social Security, Medicaid and the federal income tax.

For instance, Perry writes that Social Security is ""something we’ve been forced to accept for more than 70 years now"" and calls it a ""crumbling monument to the failure"" of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. He likens the program, which provides benefits to senior citizens and the disabled, to a Ponzi scheme — a claim we rated False in November 2010, noting that Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people while a Ponzi scheme is a criminal enterprise.

He also highlights the decision by three Southeast Texas counties in the early 1980s to leave Social Security for a private retirement savings program. In December 2010, we rated Mostly True his claim that employees in the counties fared well as a result.

In a Nov. 4, 2010, interview on CNN's Parker Spitzer, Perry said an option for the country going forward would be to let states decide whether to stay in Social Security or take a different approach to retirement savings.

Part of the exchange between host Eliot Spitzer and Perry:

Spitzer: ""So, you want to let people opt out (of Social Security)?""

Perry: ""I think, let the states decide if that’s what’s best for their cities.""

Spitzer: ""So the states will let people opt out of Social Security.""

Perry: ""They should, I think it’s a discussion…""

Spitzer: ""I haven’t seen anybody propose that before because that’s going to be …""

Perry: ""Well, we just laid that on the table so let’s talk about it.""

Spitzer: ""OK, so that’s your plan?""

Perry: ""That’s not my plan, Eliot.""

Spitzer: ""But, governor, I’m trying to get you, look, you’ve written a book …""

Perry: ""I know, you’re trying to get me in a corner and I don’t corner very good. What I’m trying to do is have a discussion with the people of this country on an issue …""

So, Perry has advocated a discussion of letting states opt out of Social Security.

In his book, Perry doesn’t call for scuttling Medicaid, a state-federal partnership providing health insurance to low-income Americans, though he writes that the 2010 Democratic-passed health care overhaul ""only makes matters worse for the existing broken systems of Medicare, Medicaid and"" the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures children of the working poor. Perry adds: ""The primary problem with Medicaid right now is that there are too many beneficiaries and not enough doctors or funding,"" a situation he says will worsen under the health care overhaul because more residents will be eligible for Medicaid.

Perry sounded another anti-Medicaid note in a November 2010 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Network, telling her: ""I'd like to see the states be given the opportunity to opt out of the Medicaid program that we are looking at today."" An Austin American-Statesman news story at the time said that in interviews, Perry had referred to a December 2009 Heritage Foundation memo stating Texas could save $60 billion between 2013 and 2019 by dropping out of Medicaid—even though the federal government was picking up 60 percent of the Texas costs.

That memo says: ""On a state-by-state basis, every state except North Dakota would come out ahead financially by leaving Medicaid but continuing long-term care (nursing home) spending with state-only dollars.""

In a Dec. 3, 2010, press release from his state office, Perry calls for changes to Medicaid. ""The current Medicaid system is financially unsustainable for states and the federal government, as costs increase about 9 percent per year in Texas alone,"" Perry said. ""Without greater flexibility and the elimination of federal strings, Medicaid will strangle state budgets and taxpayers as Obamacare and other programs expand Medicaid rolls.""

Perry continues: ""Texas, the states and the federal government would be much better served by increasing flexibility and innovation in Medicaid, even block granting funds to the states, so we can tailor Medicaid dollars to best serve the needs of Texas patients, families and taxpayers.""

The same month, Perry said a Texas request for a waiver enabling the state to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool helping some low-income Texans get private insurance ""has languished in a file cabinet at the (federal) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years."" We rated his statement Pants on Fire after noting we’d earlier determined the federal government was waiting for Texas to submit a revised proposal.

Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us this month the Texas waiver request was ultimately shelved by the state in the wake of the 2010 congressional overhaul of health care laws, though this year the commission submitted a limited proposal seeking a waiver to change how some Medicaid payments are made to hospitals. She said the request isn’t intended to curtail any Medicaid services.

In his book, Perry lists changes to taxation among steps ""we must take to wrest the reins of the federal government from those who have let it run wild for far too long.""

Toward restricting ""the unlimited source of revenue that the federal government has used to grow beyond its constitutionally prescribed powers,"" Perry writes: ""One option would be to totally scrap the current tax code in favor of a flat tax,"" simplifying taxation and making it harder to manipulate. Another option, he continues, ""would be to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment,"" which enabled the income tax, and then pursue an alternative model of taxation such as a national sales tax.

Asked to comment, gubernatorial spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email that Carlson didn’t reflect Perry’s views. ""Social Security and Medicaid programs are unsustainable in their current form,"" Frazier said, ""and Gov. Perry believes they must be substantially reformed.""

Frazier said Perry ""has never advocated ending the federal income tax, but has"" called it misguided. Her email continues: ""The 16th Amendment sadly gave far too much taxing power to Washington, and helped usher in a massive expansion of government and a tax code too complicated and onerous to easily comply with. The way the federal government taxes Americans must be reformed.""

Our judgment: Perry would at least study giving states leeway not to continue Social Security. If study led to such an option, and if states went along, this would effectively amount to abandonment. As far as we can tell, though, Perry has not said Social Security should now be abandoned.

Perry has said he wishes states could opt out of Medicaid. If that option were offered and if states agreed, the program would effectively be scuttled. But Perry also has said he favors Medicaid reforms.

Finally, he says taxation could be improved by replacing the federal income tax. While this would end the income tax, Carlson’s statement misleads by failing to note that Perry would replace some income-tax revenue with money from a new tax.

State Sen. Kevin O’Toole claims some 9/11 hijackers used New Jersey driver’s licenses to carry out terrorist attacks
","
Nearly 10 years after 19 hijackers took over four flights on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, state Sen. Kevin O’Toole wants to remind people of what some of those terrorists used to carry out the attacks: a New Jersey driver’s license.

O’Toole (R-Essex) provided that history lesson in an Aug. 21 opinion piece in the Times of Trenton about the need for technology upgrades in the state’s Motor Vehicle Commission. A computer failure in July affected commission offices and other state agencies.

""Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain,"" O’Toole wrote. ""As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver’s licenses to board those aircraft.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the 9/11 hijackers did not have New Jersey driver’s licenses. According to reports by the FBI and the 9/11 Commission staff, the hijackers had gathered driver’s licenses and state identification cards from five states, but not New Jersey.

First, let’s explain the documents cited by O’Toole as the basis for his claim.

The senator referred us to 13 documents, including news articles and columns. Two of the documents appear on websites of organizations focused on opposing illegal immigration, and two columns were written by conservative author Phyllis Schlafly. Another document appears on the website for Free Republic, which bills itself as the ""Premier Conservative Site on the Net!""

The news articles included items published in the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The only government document cited by O’Toole was a portion of the 9/11 Commission report, which states ""several (hijackers) also obtained new photo identification, first in New Jersey and then at the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.""

But that section only states hijackers obtained ""photo identification"" in New Jersey, not driver’s licenses.

A separate report entitled ""9/11 and Terrorist Travel,"" which was released in August 2004 by the commission’s staff, provides a breakdown of the identification documents of the 9/11 hijackers.

According to that report, the hijackers collectively obtained driver’s licenses from Arizona, California and Florida, and state identification cards from Florida, Virginia and Maryland. Those same findings were presented in FBI reports in 2003.

Janice Kephart, former counsel to the 9/11 Commission and an author of ""9/11 and Terrorist Travel,"" confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that it is wrong to claim any of the hijackers had New Jersey’s driver’s licenses.

Kephart suggested the misunderstanding about the driver’s licenses may stem from the fact that some hijackers obtained USA identification cards in New Jersey. A USA identification card does not represent any state or the U.S. government, Kephart said.

""They don’t mean anything,"" Kephart said in a phone interview. ""It’s meant to be deceptive.""

Less than two years before the 9/11 Commission completed its work, the FBI had already debunked the myth about New Jersey driver’s licenses being used on Sept. 11.

The story about the licenses became so widely accepted that the administration of former Gov. Jim McGreevey used the claim to boost support for its plans to overhaul the motor vehicle agency.

But in December 2002, the FBI said a lengthy investigation found no evidence that any of the hijackers had New Jersey licenses, according to a Star-Ledger article at the time. The McGreevey administration backed off from using the hijackers to tout its proposal.

""As a result of the discrepancies raised, we no longer have sufficient confidence to say that there were New Jersey driver’s licenses involved,"" Eric Shuffler, chief of staff for state Transportation Commissioner Jamie Fox, said at the time. 
Some of the documents cited by O’Toole were published before the Star-Ledger revealed the results of that FBI investigation -- and before the 9/11 Commission did its job.

The ruling

In an opinion piece about Motor Vehicle Commission upgrades, O’Toole claimed ""some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver’s licenses to board those aircraft."" To back up his point, the senator provided various sources, some of which had a conservative bias and/or were published before the 9/11 Commission completed its investigation.

But the claim has been refuted by research done by the FBI and the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 hijackers obtained driver’s licenses and state identification cards from five states, but New Jersey wasn’t one of them.

We rate the statement False.
