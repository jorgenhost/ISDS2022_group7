Newt Gingrich defends calling Barack Obama ""food stamp president""
","
On the May 15, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich defended his earlier characterization of President Barack Obama as ""the most successful food stamp president in American history."" 
Host David Gregory first showed a clip of Gingrich’s earlier comment, made at a Georgia Republican Party dinner. 
 ""You want to be a country that creates food stamps, in which case frankly Obama's is an enormous success,"" Gingrich said in the recorded excerpt. ""The most successful food stamp president in American history.  Or do you want to be a country that creates paychecks?""

Gregory then asked Gingrich if that comment included overtones of racism.

Gingrich shot back, ""Oh, come on, David!""

Gregory responded, ""What did you mean? What was the point?""

Gingrich replied, ""That's, that's bizarre. That -- this kind of automatic reference to racism, this is the president of the United States. The president of the United States has to be held accountable. Now, the idea that -- and what I said is factually true.  Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps.  One out of every six Americans is on food stamps.""

We're not going to address the racial implications but decided to check Gingrich's main comment. We see two points to investigate. First, are Gingrich’s numbers accurate? And second, is it fair to blame Obama for today's high use of food stamps?

First, the numbers.

We’ll start by noting that ""food stamps"" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name.

For the most recent month with available data -- February 2011 -- roughly 44.2  million people received SNAP benefits. That’s a bit less than Gingrich had said, but it’s in the ballpark. That also wasn’t a fluke: February marked the third consecutive month that the number of recipients topped 44 million.

In fact, based on our look through the historical data, February’s numbers appear to be the highest number of beneficiaries in any month since the program was established in 1969. As recently as October 2007, about 27 million Americans received SNAP benefits. That’s more than a 60 percent increase in beneficiaries in three and a half years.

The 44 million accounts for about 14 percent of Americans -- slightly less than one out of every seven, rather than one out of six, as Gingrich said. 
Now the second question: Is it fair to lay the blame on Obama?

Obviously, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the serious recession that began in December 2007 -- more than a year before Obama took office. It’s hard to determine how much blame Obama deserves compared to his predecessor, President George W. Bush, but the experts we spoke to, conservative and liberal, agree that Obama inherited a serious economic situation.

Part of the reason it’s tricky to divvy up blame is that there is typically a lag time before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The monthly growth has slowed over the last three months, and if current trends continue, it could start declining in a month or two.

It’s also impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010. However, the fact remains that SNAP usage has continued to climb every single month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. So Gingrich’s charge cannot simply be dismissed out of hand.

One last point: The number of food stamp beneficiaries had started to head upward under Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits, and partly because of changes in the rules that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama.

The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency -- most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency.

Where does this leave us? Gingrich was close on the numbers of Americans receiving SNAP benefits. In addition, the number of beneficiaries is at a record level, and it has risen every month of the Obama presidency. On the other hand, Gingrich oversimplifies when he suggests that Obama should be considered ""the most successful food stamp president in American history,"" because much -- though probably not all -- of the reason for the increase was a combination of the economic problems Obama inherited and a longstanding upward trend from policy changes. On balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/may/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-defends-calling-barack-obama-food-st/

Obama says the border fence is 'now basically complete'
","In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, President Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is ""now basically complete.""

Still, he predicted that many Republican opponents won't be satisfied.

""We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,"" Obama said. ""All the stuff they asked for, we’ve done. But even though we’ve answered these concerns, I’ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time."" 

""They'll want want a higher fence,"" Obama said. ""Maybe they’ll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat. They’ll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That’s politics.""

Fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border has long been a thorny political issue, so with Obama declaring mission accomplished, we decided to check it out.

Department of Homeland Security officials told us they have finished 649 out of 652 miles of fencing (99.5 percent), which includes 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of pedestrian fence.

But the same day as Obama's speech, Sen. Jim DeMint penned an op-ed for National Review in which he countered that the Obama administration has ""not done its job to finish the border fence that is a critical part of keeping Americans safe and stopping illegal immigration.""

""Five years ago, legislation was passed to build a 700-mile double-layer border fence along the southwest border,"" DeMint wrote. ""This is a promise that has not been kept. Today, according to staff at the Department of Homeland Security, just 5 percent of the double-layer fencing is complete, only 36.3 miles.""

So what gives? Is the border fence ""now basically complete"" or not?

Not to go all Clinton on you, but it largely depends on how you define ""fence.""

You need to go back to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified ""at least two layers of reinforced fencing.""

But the law was quietly altered in a significant way the following year.

Responding to urging from the Department of Homeland Security -- which argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing, that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense -- Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,  proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  ""nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.""

In other words, Border Patrol would have the leeway to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions.

The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite being condemned by legislators such as Reps. Peter King, R-N.Y., and Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill.

At the time, Hutchison told the San Antonio Express-News, ""Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border.""

DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been vehicle barriers, which are designed to stop vehicles rather than people (see here), and single-layer pedestrian fencing (see here). The design specifications vary depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, it includes ""post on rail"" steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings; ""Normandy"" vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh.
 
That's not enough for some opponent of illegal immigration. ""They are interpreting the requirements of the Secure Fence Act in a way that is clearly contrary to what Congress intended,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tougher enforcement against illegal immigration.

There may be a role for the vehicle barriers, but ""your grandmother could hop over them,"" he said, and ""that's not what Congress thought it was voting for.""

Krikorian said, ""The president's claim that the job is done is misleading.""

A Government Accountability Office report on border security, issued in February 2011, paints a mixed picture. The report acknowledges progress on the fences, as well as hundreds more miles deemed to be under ""operational control,"" but ""DHS reports that the southwest border continues to be vulnerable to cross-border illegal activity, including the smuggling of humans and illegal narcotics.""

T.J. Bonner, retired president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents all the front-line border patrol agents, said the type of fencing is less important than whether  the border is secure.

It is estimated that for every person caught (Border Patrol reported apprehending over 445,000 illegal entrants in 2010) two more get by, Bonner said. ""To me, that doesn't seem like border security.""

But is it accurate for Obama to claim that ""the fence is now basically complete""?

DHS reports that there is now fencing for 649 of the 652 miles described in the Secure Fence Act of 2006. But the vast majority of the requirement was met with vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fence. The original act specifically called for double-layer fencing, and only 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing currently exist. However, the act was later amended to allow Border Security the discretion to determine which type of fencing was appropriate for different areas.

So Obama can make a case that the vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fences meet the amended letter of the law. But we also think Obama misleads, particularly when he mocks Republican opponents, saying that even though the fence has been built, ""They'll want want a higher fence. Maybe they’ll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat."" The Border Patrol has not gone ""above and beyond"" what Republicans requested, as Obama claimed. What they originally requested was a double-layer fence, and they didn't get much of it. And so we rate Obama's statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2011/may/16/barack-obama/obama-says-border-fence-now-basically-complete/

Laura Ingraham says Massachusetts health plan is ""wildly unpopular""
","On the May 12, 2011, edition of the Fox News Channel's’ O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly and conservative commentator Laura Ingraham discussed a speech on health care given earlier that day by possible Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

Romney’s speech was designed to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts health care plan passed when he was governor and the national health care law signed in 2010. In a separate item, we analyzed whether Romney was justified in calling the national law a ""government takeover.""

Here, we’ll look at a comment Ingraham made regarding in-state public opinion about the Massachusetts plan.

""Look, I like Mitt Romney,"" Ingraham said. ""I think he's a really smart guy, and I think he would be a good president. ... On this, I don't get it, though, Bill. I mean, costs have gone up. It's wildly unpopular.""

We wondered whether the Massachusetts system was in fact ""wildly unpopular"" with Bay State residents.

We found two polls that shed light on this question to one degree or another.

One was conducted in early April 2011 by Suffolk University of 500 Massachusetts residents.

In response to the question, ""Do you think health care in Massachusetts is working?"" the poll found that 38 percent said yes, 49 percent said no, and 13 percent were undecided.

This would seem to provide a measure of support for Ingraham’s claim. However, the question was phrased more broadly than Ingraham’s claim because it referred to ""health care in Masschusetts,"" which could include factors well beyond the state health plan, such as their own personal experiences with the specific doctors, hospitals and pharmacists they use.

And even if the results were a direct commentary on support for the Massachusetts system, a split of 38 percent in favor and 49 percent against doesn’t indicate the state health care law is ""wildly unpopular,"" as Ingraham said. Unpopular, perhaps, but not necessarily ""wildly"" so.

A more appropriate yardstick for measuring the plan’s popularity is a survey taken by the Harvard School of Public Health with the Boston Globe in mid September 2009. Here are two questions that most directly address Ingraham’s claim. Both were asked of the 467 respondents who told the pollsters that they were aware of the law:

Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law?

Support: 59 percent
Oppose: 28 percent
Don’t Know: 13 percent

Do you think the Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform Law should be repealed, continued as the law currently stands, or continued but with some changes made?

Repealed: 11 percent
Continued as the law currently stands: 22 percent
Continued but with some changes made: 57 percent
Don’t know: 10 percent

The first question found residents support the law by more than a two-to-one margin. The second demonstrated that residents were not entirely satisfied with all of the law’s provisions, but it did show that support for outright repeal was low -- only 11 percent.

A major caveat to the Harvard poll is that it was taken a year and a half ago, and sentiment may have changed since then. (Support for the law did drop by about 10 points compared to a 2008 Harvard poll.) Still, the Harvard data, despite being older, directly addresses Ingraham’s claim and indicates she was wrong.

""The statement about the plan being ‘wildly unpopular’ is unfounded given available polling data,"" said Robert Blendon, the Harvard researcher who helped do the poll.

As for the newer poll, David Paleologos, who directed the poll in question, said the question has value, while acknowledging that it is broader in focus.

""It’s a snapshot of how people feel currently about Massachusetts health care,"" he said. ""I think that’s all we can garner from the question. … Unless questions are identically worded, a lot of the comparison is left open to one’s opinion."" On the advice of experts, we decided not to consider a recent customer satisfaction survey commissioned by the government agency that runs the state health insurance exchange created under the law. That study found that 84 percent of participants in the Commonwealth Care program rated it 4 or 5 on a five-point satisfaction scale, while only 4 percent said they were dissatisfied. Some news accounts mistakenly reported that this was a poll of all Massachusetts residents, but it wasn't, so we don't believe that it's a valid yardstick for assessing Ingraham's comment. We should note that an estimated 400,000 Massachusetts residents -- or only about 6 percent of people living in the state -- have secured health coverage as a direct result of the law, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. That has enabled 98.1 percent of Massachusetts residents to secure insurance -- the highest rate of any state. But that also means that the impact of the law has been indirect for more than 9 of 10 Massachusetts residents.

Residents need to include a certificate of insurance when they file their taxes. More important, but less tangibly, they may find their insurance costs or their taxes going up due to how the law has reshaped the insurance market. And there is evidence that the increase in number of insured residents in the state has put pressure on primary care physicians, potentially leading to longer waits for service.

Still, one Massachusetts political analyst, Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry, said he didn’t detect a groundswell of opposition to the law among residents.

""Massachusetts voters, like voters everywhere, are unhappy with rising health care costs,"" Berry said. ""They see that in their insurance premiums -- every paycheck and every year, the rates go up. The reform for the uninsured passed during the Romney administration is, itself, largely invisible. People know it's there but don't know how it's working (or, unless they're on it, don't know how it works). There's very little press coverage of the program. In Massachusetts there is simply no controversy about the plan at this point. Most telling is that there is no real organized opposition to it and no effort in the state legislature to revise it.""

Berry concludes that Ingraham’s ""wildly unpopular"" claim is ""wildly exaggerated.""

Additional data from the Harvard poll supports Berry’s sense that it’s actually apathy -- rather than opposition -- that’s shaping views of the Massachusetts plan.

The pollsters asked, ""Generally speaking, do you think this health insurance law is helping, hurting, or not having much of an impact on the quality of your health care, the cost of your health care and your ability to pay medical bills if you were to get sick."" Here are the results:

• On quality, 23 percent said the law was ""helping,"" 14 percent said ""hurting,"" and 55 percent said it was ""not having much of an impact.""

• On cost, 19 percent said it was helping, 24 percent said it was hurting and 47 percent said it wasn’t having much impact.

• And on people’s ability to pay their medical bills, 24 percent said it was helping, 14 percent said it was hurting and 53 percent said it wasn’t making much difference.

In other words, for each of these three issues, either a majority or a plurality of respondents said the law wasn’t having a significant impact.

So where does this leave us? The Harvard data contradicts Ingraham’s argument, showing a fair amount of support for the law in general alongside feelings that it’s not doing much for them personally. The Suffolk poll is more recent, but the question asked is too broad to speak directly to Ingraham’s claim. And we couldn't find any other support for Ingraham's claim. So we rate Ingraham’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/may/16/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-massachusetts-health-plan-wild/

Rep. Randy Forbes says holding line on debt limit doesn't force default
","
If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, the result would surely be an immediate financial Armageddon the likes of which the U.S. has never seen, right?  

Not so, says Virginia Congressman J. Randy Forbes, R-4th.

With the nation expected to reach its $14.294 trillion debt cap as early as today, a decision on the debt ceiling looms large. Unlike previous votes, this one won’t be a formality. Republicans say they won’t approve a hike without a sweeping plan to reduce the debt.  

Recognizing that consensus will not be reached by today, Forbes has co-sponsored the ""Full Faith and Credit Act,"" which would require the U.S. Treasury to prioritize payments on the public debt over any other payments when we reach the ceiling.

In a blog post on his website, Forbes touts his legislation as a safeguard, saying warnings of impending fiscal calamity have been greatly exaggerated.

""The most inflammatory rhetoric we’re hearing is the threat that failure to raise the debt limit would automatically cause the U.S. to default on our national debt. This claim, thankfully, is baseless,"" he said.

Is it? We decided to take a look.

Although Forbes did not identify who he thinks is guilty of spreading ""inflammatory rhetoric,"" a growing number of House Republicans are accusing U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner of overstating the risk of default if the debt limit is not raised by this summer.  

Forbes, in his blog post, rolled out the identical argument being used by Geithner’s critics.
""Whether or not the debt ceiling is raised, the federal government collects significantly more revenue than it needs to fulfill U.S. debt obligations,"" Forbes wrote. ""If the debt ceiling is reached, the government will still have ten times as much revenue as it needs to make debt payments. The only way the U.S. will immediately default upon reaching the debt ceiling is if the government actively chooses to do so by not making debt payments.""

Well, if we’re talking about today, Forbes is absolutely right.  

As it has become clear that consensus will not be reached by today, the U.S. Treasury has said that through various fiscal maneuvers, it can extend until Aug. 2 the deadline before default is even a possibility.

OK, but the larger question is, if Congress remains deadlocked in early August, do we default ""automatically"" then?

Well, no. But it wouldn’t be pretty.

""What will happen is that we’d have to stop making payments to our seniors — Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,"" Geithner recently said in an ABC interview. ""We’d have to stop paying veterans’ benefits. We’d have to stop paying all the other payments on all the other things the government does.  

""And then we would risk default on our interest payments,"" he added.

A Congressional Research Service report backed that up Geithner’s assessment. It said the federal government needs to borrow $738 billion beyond the current statutory limit to finance obligations for the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

""To put this into context,"" the report said, ""the federal government would have to eliminate all spending on discretionary programs, cut nearly 70 percent of outlays for mandatory programs, increase revenue collection by nearly two-thirds, or take some combination of those actions in the second half of FY2011 in order to avoid increasing the debt limit. Additional spending cuts and/or revenue increases would be required, under current policy, in FY2012 and beyond to avoid increasing the debt limit.""

Jim Horney, an analyst with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said taking dire steps to keep up with debt payments would not avert U.S. credit problems. He said the federal government would still likely default on payments for goods and services and benefits to Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries.

""There are really serious consequences from us defaulting on any of our legal obligations even if we make interest payments but default on other things,"" he said. ""It would do serious damage to the credibility and credit worthiness of the U.S. government.""

Horney said reneging on any payments would cause creditors to lose faith in the U.S. to meet all of its obligations and lead to higher interest rates.

On the other hand, some conservatives argue that it would simply force the U.S. to start living within its means.

""It would be a disaster if we defaulted on our debt. It would be a disaster if we were hit by an asteroid. I think being hit by an asteroid is a more likely scenario,"" said J.D. Foster, an expert on fiscal policy with the conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggests that Congress look for dramatic spending cuts or offer guidance through legislation on which debts should be paid first to reassure creditors.

So let’s look back.

Forbes’ claim is that failure to raise the debt ceiling would not ""automatically"" cause the U.S. to default on its debt.

We checked it against two deadlines: first, the May 16 date when we are expected to reach the current debt cap, and then the ominous Aug. 2 date issued by the Treasury.

On both, Forbes is right. The Treasury has already said we can reach the max and be OK for a couple months. Beyond Aug. 2, debt payments could continue at the expense of maiming popular government programs.

That’s an option. So we rate Forbes’ claim True.",/factchecks/2011/may/16/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-holding-line-debt-limit-does/
"['Abortion', 'Ohio', 'Health Care', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sen. Sherrod Brown critical of House bill's potential impact on insurance coverage for abortions
","
The use of federal dollars for most abortions has been prohibited since Congress first passed the Hyde Amendment, a ""rider"" attached annually to health appropriations bills, in 1976.

A bill passed by the House this month would use the tax system and federal health care reform to extend restrictions to private insurance coverage.

The ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,"" proposed by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., one of the House's leading abortion opponents, would not allow small businesses to deduct the cost of private employee insurance plans if the plans cover abortion. The tax deductibility of policies is the foundation of employer-provided health insurance.

Sen. Sherrod Brown called the bill the ""latest declaration of war on women.""

""Eighty-seven percent of private insurance plans currently include such coverage,"" the Ohio Democrat said in a fundraising letter to supporters.

If that figure is true, the bill would tightly narrow the range of policy choices or lead insurance plans to drop abortion coverage. We wondered where it came from.

Because Brown's statement came in a fundraising message, his office referred us to his sole current campaign worker, Sarah Benzing. She cited stories from the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and other sources using the 87 percent figure, which is attributed to the Guttmacher Institute -- an independent nonprofit whose statistics are used by both sides of the abortion debate.

The institute conducted a federally supported study in 2002 with the aim of ""assessing levels of insurance coverage for a wide range of reproductive health services,"" and found that 87 percent of typical employer-based insurance policies ""covered medically necessary or appropriate abortions.""

A similar study, cited by Guttmacher, was conducted at about the same time by the Kaiser Family Foundation and released as part of its 2003 Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey. It found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortion.

The studies asked different questions, helping explain the disparity in results. While Guttmacher reported on policies, Kaiser counts covered workers. Membership in plans would not be evenly distributed.

The bottom line, to the institute, is that ""most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion.""

So where does Brown’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter?

A study by the Kaiser Foundation yielded a much lower figure for coverage, but it is a percentage of covered workers, not plans. Brown’s claim specifically cites ""87 percent of private insurance plans.""

His figure, widely cited in the news media, comes from an organization that both sides of the debate rely one for information.

But while the source Brown used is widely cited, it is worth noting that it is not a recent study. The study, attributed to the Guttmacher Institute, was done nearly a decade ago. That’s an additional piece of information that helps put the data in context.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/may/16/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-critical-house-bills-potential-i/

State Sen. John Whitmire says the Texas Board of Nursing has a backlog of 3,000 complaints, including many cases of sexual assault and malfeasance
","
Explaining why he couldn’t support the Texas Senate’s version of the 2012-13 state budget, Sen. John Whitmire said he didn’t know how state agencies can cope with further budget cuts, singling out the Texas Board of Nursing as an example.

""I asked them for their backlog of investigations,"" he said. ""They’ve got 3,000 complaints against nurses, many of them sexual assaults, malfeasance.""

Time to crank up the Truth-O-Meter, starting with the board’s unresolved complaints.

Some background: The board investigates and adjudicates complaints about Texas nurses who could be violating the Nursing Practice Act, which imposes regulations on nursing education, licensing and practices in the state including rules against unnecessarily exposing patients to the risk of harm or failing to adequately care for them.

At the nursing board, spokesman Bruce Holter told us the senator’s count of 3,000 backlogged complaints is too low, accounting solely for unresolved cases from fiscal years 2009 and 2010.

In 2010, the board resolved 14,429 of 16,890 complaints filed against nurses, leaving 2,461 unresolved cases. As of this March, another 511 complaints filed in 2009 remained unresolved, bringing the total backlog to nearly 3,000. There also are several hundred lingering complaints dating back to May 2006, board officials said.

As of March, the board had about 11,000 open investigations, including the backlog.

What are the complaints about?

""In general,"" Holter said, ""criminal conduct, drug-related conduct and failure to follow the minimum standard of care are the main types of complaints.""

That covers malfeasance. But what about Whitmire’s other charge — that a chunk of the backlogged cases are sexual assault complaints?

Lara Wendler, Whitmire’s chief of staff, told us the senator based his statement on conversations with administrators at agencies, including the nursing board. She added, though, that Whitmire was referring to all regulatory agencies, not just the nursing board, when he said backlogged cases included ""many"" sexual assaults. That was not clear from Whitmire’s floor remarks.

Holter said the board checks all nurses licensed in Texas against state and national databases identifying sex offenders. Currently, the board is investigating complaints against four nurses who appear on the Texas Department of Public Safety’s sex offender database, and 12 nurses who appear on a national sex offender registry kept by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.

""Sexual assault complaints against nurses make up a small percentage of the overall number of complaints investigated by the board,"" Holter said. But he added that other than the nurses found on the sexual offender databases, ""it would be difficult for staff to ‘pin down’ the number of complaints involving sexual assault.""

Why? The board doesn’t categorize complaints by type, though when disciplinary action has been taken, Holter said, the board can run a data mining program to identify specific rule violations. But because the board doesn't track the number of sexual assault cases, it would have to review each resolved complaint individually.

Lastly, why have complaints stacked up?  Board employees are barred from discussing the details of individual complaints, but the board’s general counsel Dusty Johnston told us that generally, complaints don’t get resolved for a variety of reasons. He offered several examples: The investigator may be under-performing; extensive due process is required; the medical records of the patient involved in the complaint are difficult to obtain.

So, the board says it has about 3,000 backlogged complaints, as Whitmire said. According to the board, many of the complaints allege malfeasance by nurses, as Whitmire also said, and a smaller number involve sexual assaults. But no one can determine the precise breakout without access to confidential board information.

State AFL-CIO head says unions have not encouraged anti-Walker boycott efforts
","
In April 2011, the Wisconsin Grocers Association issued an alert to its members warning that  protests against Republican Gov. Scott Walker were about to escalate. Store owners were told  activists were planning a May 1 campaign to slap stickers on several products to express anti-Walker sentiments.

An April 27 Journal Sentinel story about the association’s warning was picked up by other media outlets, including some that took it another step -- saying unions were behind the sticker threat. A day later, Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO responded with  a statement that said in part:

""We have no knowledge beyond un-evidenced assertions made to the media by the Wisconsin Grocers Association of any such campaign, but let's be crystal clear -- there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations.""

The second part of that statement caught our attention.

Following the collective bargaining law, haven’t unions been turning up the heat on businesses -- including M&I Bank and Kwik Trip -- where executives or political action committees supported Walker or GOP groups?

Let’s stop and look at the dictionary definition of boycott:

""To abstain from or act together in abstaining from using, buying or dealing with as an expression of protest or disfavor or as a means of coercion,"" says The Free Dictionary. Others such as Merriam-Webster.com and ethicalconsumer.org have similar definitions.

We asked Neuenfeldt about his statement, in light of the anti-Walker activities that have been in the news.

His answer: Those aren’t official AFL-CIO boycotts.

In fact, there have been very few such boycotts. The reason, Neuenfeldt said, is simple: Such actions by the umbrella labor group are illegal under federal law.

""We don’t boycott,"" he said. ""We can’t.""

That seems pretty cut and dried. But is it really?

Indeed, the state AFL-CIO is an umbrella group. But it includes about 1,000 affiliated local unions, which represent 250,000 members in the state. And Neuenfeldt’s statement was ""there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations.""

That sure seems to include member unions, who under law are allowed to participate in boycotts. What’s more, the statement didn’t apply only to organizing boycotts, but ""encouraging"" them. So, let’s turn to the record.

For instance, there is a ""Boycott Scott Walker Contributors"" page on Facebook, which has more than 23,000 people and businesses -- including some unions representing firefighters, police officers and teachers -- listed as ""liking"" the page.

Neuenfeldt said those are individual actions and not coordinated by the umbrella labor group.

Meanwhile, members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, have been urging businesses to put signs in their windows supporting workers’ rights.

A letter sent to the businesses said in part: ""Failure to do so will leave us no choice but (to) do a public boycott of your business."" State AFSCME leaders later dismissed that effort as the actions of a ""rogue"" union local.

What about the actions of the state AFL-CIO itself?

At a May 5 news conference outside an M&I Bank branch on Milwaukee’s west side, the group said it withdrew $105,000 from the bank and closed its account as part of what it called the ""Move Your Money"" campaign.

The group withdrew its money to protest M&I executives’ contributions to Walker and to underscore the threat to Wisconsin jobs that could come from the upcoming sale of M&I to the Bank of Montreal. M&I is listed among dozens of businesses on the ""Boycott Scott Walker Contributors"" page on Facebook.

Sounds like the state AFL-CIO wants you to take your business elsewhere. Isn’t that a boycott?

University of Wisconsin-Madison history professor William Paul Jones, an expert on organized labor, disagrees. He said ""technically, a boycott is an organized action,"" while the withdrawal of money from M&I by the state AFL-CIO is an individual action.

Under federal law, he said, the existence of coercion is a key threshold for a protest or action to be considered a boycott.

So the state AFL-CIO, for instance, can say: We’re doing this, and we hope you follow suit. They run afoul of federal law if they set up picket lines and try to prevent customers from entering and so forth.

Perhaps the most famous boycott was that staged against grape growers from 1965-70, a nationwide effort that led to the creation of the United Farm Workers.

That boycott was not deemed illegal and resulted in the signing of a contract with the farm workers. Federal law expressly bans ""secondary"" boycotts -- such as actions against a parts supplier tied to a strike against an automaker.

Indeed in the end, there was no mass stickering, which was what prompted the original warning from the grocers association and the Neuenfeldt response.

Grocers association CEO Brandon Scholz said he received word from one store up north where a customer was asked to leave because he was believed to have stickers with him.

Scholz said media attention might have dissuaded protesters.

But as we have noted, Neuenfeldt’s statement was much broader than about the stickering threat. And making it more sweeping made it more problematic.

Neuenfeldt said ""there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations."" He notes the statewide group is barred under federal law from engaging in boycotts.

But his statement also applied to the organizations within the state AFL-CIO and not only to organizing boycotts, but also encouraging them. And unions clearly have been taking actions to support the anti-Walker boycott movement. Indeed, the state AFL-CIO called a news conference to highlight to the public it was taking a step that some of its member groups were withdrawing money from M&I Bank.

What’s more, the average person does not view the issue from the legal perspective, but the practical result. They see union members protesting Walker and listing a gas station chain, bratwurst maker and many other businesses on a boycott Facebook page.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Steve Ogden']","
State Sen. Steve Ogden says businesses pay most of the taxes in Texas
","
Asked by reporters how legislators can address the state’s recurring revenue shortfall, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Steve Ogden reiterated his belief that a good start would be reworking the business franchise tax. 
Readers may recall that the franchise tax was revamped in 2006 to help pay for a statewide reduction in local school property taxes, but it has not brought in as much money as was projected. 
However, ""the issue is not to single out businesses as some sort of villain,"" Ogden, R-Bryan, said April 5. ""They already pay most of the taxes. The issue is having a tax system that, in my opinion, is uniform and equitable and as low as possible."" 
Readers who spotted Ogden’s comment in an Austin American-Statesman news story asked us to check whether businesses do ""pay most of the taxes."" 
Responding to our inquiry, Ogden pointed to the way the tax system is structured in Texas. Because the state has no personal income tax, Ogden said, most state and local tax revenue comes from taxes that are levied on businesses and individuals alike. And because businesses ""are the largest economic entities in the state,"" he said, it stands to reason that they pay the most. 
Ogden referred us to a biennial report from the state comptroller’s office on tax burdens in Texas. The latest version, published in February, projects how much businesses and individual consumers will pay in state sales and use taxes, franchise taxes, gasoline taxes, motor vehicle sales taxes, cigarette taxes, oil production taxes and school property taxes in 2013. 
According to the report, two of the taxes — franchise and oil production  —  are initially paid entirely by businesses. A third tax, the cigarette tax, is paid entirely by consumers. The remaining four taxes are shared between consumers and businesses. 
The largest expected revenue producers are school property taxes ($11.3 billion projected to be paid by businesses in 2013, $10.7 billion by consumers) and state sales taxes ($9.8 billion projected to be paid by businesses, $12.1 billion by consumers). 
To get a total tax dollar amount for each category — consumers and businesses — we added up the estimated burden imposed by each of the taxes analyzed in the report. The results were close: $28.2 billion for businesses and $27.5 billion for consumers. 
Two previous comptroller’s tax-incidence reports calculated slightly greater tax burdens for businesses, compared with individuals, but differed from the current report because they included a natural gas tax but not cigarette and oil production taxes. 
The 2009 report, projecting ahead to 2011, estimated $30.1 billion for businesses and $28.4 billion for consumers. The 2007 report, projecting for 2009, estimated $25.9 billion for businesses vs. $25.2 billion for consumers. 
Next, we touched base with the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, about Ogden’s statement. Dale Craymer, its president, said by email that the comptroller’s report does not consider ""the entire spectrum of taxes in the state."" 
R.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for the comptroller’s office, told us that the six state taxes in the agency’s 2011 report — excluding school property taxes, which are collected locally — represented 86 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2010. Also excluded are property taxes paid to local governments such as cities and counties. 
Craymer suggested that we consider what he called the most comprehensive look at business taxes, a study done for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses. Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, also pointed us to the report. 
The study, by the economics and statistics unit of consulting firm Ernst & Young, estimates the taxes paid by businesses to state and local governments in each state in fiscal year 2008. Among them: property taxes, state and local sales taxes paid by businesses on purchases of production materials and equipment, corporate income and franchise taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and business and corporate license taxes. 
The study estimates that in Texas, businesses paid 61.2 percent of state and local taxes. That compares with a national share of 44.1 percent. 
We asked how the study was done. Andrew Phillips, an author, told us that researchers drew data from several sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, IRS and Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
For another perspective on the Ernst & Young report, we turned to Matt Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research arm of Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. 
Gardner suggested that the Ernst & Young report may have overestimated the share of total property taxes paid by businesses. He said his own estimate, based on available 2008 data from the Census Bureau, indicates that Texas homeowners paid about 45 percent of property taxes that year. If one assumes that businesses paid the rest, Gardner said, their share is 55 percent, not the 62 percent share of property taxes reported by Ernst & Young. 
Still, Gardner didn’t quibble much with Ogden’s statement. ""It’s probably OK to assert that a majority of Texas taxes fall initially on non-individuals,"" he said. 
Both Gardner and Hammond, the TAB president, echoed Ogden’s point that businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of a minority that have no income tax on individuals. 
But inherent in the distinction between taxes on individuals and on businesses is the idea that the latter can shift their burdens to customers, employees, tenants and others. The comptroller’s report says: ""It should be recognized that any tax levied directly on a business"" will ultimately be passed on — either to consumers through higher prices, to employees through lower wages or to business owners and shareholders through reduced profits. Businesses can also push some of their tax burden out of the state. 
How much tax shifting occurs depends on the market in which a business operates and other complicated factors. ""The only thing that can be said with certainty is that no one really knows how taxes (particularly those levied on property and business) are shifted,"" according to the comptroller’s report. 
Tom Neubig, an author of the Ernst & Young report, told us, ""All economists would say that it isn’t business that bears the burden of the taxes; it’s people."" He pointed to a January 2010 national study in which he and other researchers, using 2005 tax data, estimated where state and local business taxes ultimately fall. The study concluded that in Texas, business owners wound up holding the bag for 4 percent of those taxes. The rest were shifted into higher consumer prices (2 percent), lower wages (45 percent) and to people living outside Texas (49 percent). 
For Gardner, this ""final incidence"" is more important than whether businesses or individuals initially pay the taxes. 
Upshot: The analyses we found basically support Ogden’s claim that businesses pay ""most"" of the taxes in Texas, though the margin varies from a slim 51 percent (according to the state comptroller) to 61 percent (Ernst & Young). However, analysts also agree that businesses — unlike individuals — can offload their tax burden through various means.

"['Afghanistan', 'Rhode Island', 'David Cicilline']","
Cicilline says there are only 25 to 30 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan
","
Congressman David Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, was on WPRO-AM (630) radio May 6 making the case that the United States should stop funneling money to Afghanistan for construction projects and use the money for badly needed projects back home.

""We are investing in that infrastructure and rebuilding a country. We ought to be directing those resources back here to the United States. We have some urgent needs of infrastructure and investments in law enforcement that we need be making in our own country,"" he said during an interview with Morning News hosts Tara Granahan and Andrew Gobeil, just days after the killing of Osama bin Laden.

Putting aside his views on President Obama’s strategy for Afghanistan, we were struck by another statement the congressman made to support his position.

""I think that most military experts say there is anywhere between 25 and 30 members of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. So we have succeeded in our mission. That was to dismantle al Qaeda and you know we have to, of course, still have a presence in that part of the world. The growing danger, I think, is really in Pakistan.""

We wondered: Are there really so few al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan?

We didn’t hear back right away from the congressman so we began to conduct some reconnaissance of our own.

There aren’t any census workers checking caves in Afghanistan and asking if whether anyone belongs to al Qaeda. And the Defense Department doesn’t make a habit of announcing its intelligence estimates.

But there have been numbers cited in the media and elsewhere.

In December 2009, as Mr. Obama was deciding whether to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan,  ABCNEWS.com reported that senior U.S. intelligence officials estimated about 100 al Qaeda members in Afghanistan.

On June 27, 2010, CIA Director Leon Panetta gave an estimate on ABC’s ""This Week"" that has been cited frequently.

""I think the estimate on the number of al Qaeda is actually relatively small,"" Panetta said at the time. ""At most, we’re looking at 50 to 100, maybe less. It’s in that vicinity. There’s no question that the main location of al Qaeda is in the tribal areas of Pakistan.""

The Wall Street Journal gave a different estimate in an April 6, 2011, story.

""Precise numbers of al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan at any given time are hard to come by,"" the story said. ""For the most part, al Qaeda has been viewed by Western officials as a declining force in the Afghan fight. Just six months ago, U.S. intelligence estimates indicated only one or two dozen al Qaeda fighters were present in Afghanistan at any one time.""

But, the story  continued, ""Most of the few hundred fighters it had in the region were holed up in Pakistan hiding from Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes."" With the pullback of U.S. troops from northeastern Afghanistan, senior military officials were quoted as saying, al Qaeda fighters are reportedly returning.

On April 9, 2011, Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces, told the Associated Press that he did not believe al Qaeda was making a comeback. ""There is no question that al Qaeda has had a presence in Afghanistan and continues to have a presence — generally assessed at less than 100 or so,"" he said .

Finally, we contacted Bing West, of Newport, a former assistant secretary of defense and author of several military books, including his just-released ""The Wrong War."" In it, West argues that counterinsurgency efforts are not working in Afghanistan and that U.S. troops should be withdrawn and replaced by a corps of advisers to assist Afghanistan battalions.

""He’s basically right,"" West said about Cicilline’s comments. ""No one knows the number and, of course, since they can walk back and forth across the border, the number is elastic to begin with. If we are trying to make the general point that there are relatively few al Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan, that’s a correct statement.""

So the estimates varied, but none was as low as the numbers Cicilline cited on WPRO.

When we did hear back from the congressman’s office, spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw said that Cicilline had erred and referred us to the estimates we had already found.

""Congressman Cicilline accidentally misspoke during his interview with WPRO and meant to say that military members and the Director of the CIA indicate there are more like 50-100 al Qaeda members in Afghanistan,"" Kershaw wrote in an e-mail. ""However, the point Congressman Cicilline was making is simple and rings true -- compared to the approximately 100,000 American troops stationed in Afghanistan, there is a relatively small number of hardcore al Qaeda members left in that country, and that is supported by General Petraeus and CIA Director Leon Panetta.""

We’ll grant that precise numbers are hard to come by. But Cicilline claimed the number he cited -- lower than most others -- was what ""most military experts"" were saying. In fact, that’s not what most military experts were saying. And even he acknowledges he ""misspoke.""

We rate his claim Barely True.

"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'Charlotte Lehan']","
Will Sellwood Bridge have to be shut down in eight years if it is not replaced?
","
The Sellwood Bridge, opened in 1925, is the only crossing in a long stretch between the Interstate 205 and Ross Island bridges. It’s skinny and worn out and people have been talking forever about doing something about it. In the mid-1980s, the maximum vehicle load on the bridge was reduced to 32 tons. In June 2004, the county dropped the limit even further, to 10 tons, after discovering cracks. TriMet buses and heavier trucks have not been allowed since then.

Last year, Clackamas County commissioners approved a $5 annual increase in motor vehicle registration fees to help pay for a new bridge. The issue is now before voters, some of whom argue it makes no sense to pitch in for a bridge owned by neighboring Multnomah County even if it is used by Clackamas County residents. Bridge supporters argue that if left alone, the Sellwood will have to be shut down soon.

""Our time to act is limited -- if the bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years,"" wrote Clackamas County Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan. ""This will lead to increased congestion and wait times on alternate routes including I-205, Highway 43 and McLoughlin Boulevard… Its complete closure would further hurt the hundreds of Clackamas County businesses and families who depend on it.""

Eight years. Yikes. That’s a pretty specific timeline and a pretty definitive statement. Obviously, we wanted to know where she got her figure.

Tim Heider, spokesman for Clackamas County, said Lehan based her statement on a study provided by Multnomah County staff. The engineering study was conducted by David Evans and Associates in 2005 and had two purposes: to assess the condition of the Sellwood, and to find out what Multnomah County would need to do to keep the bridge in operation for another 10 to 15 years, at various weight limits, until a major rehabilitation or replacement could occur.

The engineering group detailed how much money was needed to maintain different load limits. Multnomah County chose the least expensive option -- $1 million to inject epoxy into cracks and to monitor the situation. The load limit remained 10 tons.

Simple math tells you that six years later, we have at most nine years remaining on the original 10- to15-year time frame. Mike Baker with David Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon that he found Lehan’s statement ""consistent with conclusions reached by our firm.""

We at PolitiFact Oregon are not ones to quibble with engineers. They know a lot more about bridge mechanics than we do. But we still had questions.

Did the county have any other evidence pointing to a bridge shutdown within eight years if it’s not replaced? Is replacement, and not repair, the only option for getting more life out of the bridge? And, significantly, what happens if Clackamas County voters vote down the vehicle registration fee on the May 17 ballot? After all, Lehan said what she said in the context of urging a yes vote on a fee increase.

Multnomah County officials haven’t been very clear on what would happen if voters reject Measure 3-372. Clackamas is providing only $22 million of an estimated $290 million for a new bridge, but with funding already short $20 million, Multnomah County spokesman Mike Pullen said the county is not optimistic it could make up yet another $22 million.

""We are working to replace the bridge, as you mention,"" Pullen wrote in an email. ""But we cannot replace it if we can't pay for it. Without the $22 million from Clackamas County the project could be delayed, take longer to complete, or be partially completed.""

We also asked Pullen if the county had any other evidence indicating a bridge shutdown date. He spoke with the county's project manager and lead bridge engineer for the Sellwood Bridge, and reported this:

""He said there is not a hard and fast date when we know we will need to close the bridge if it does not get repaired. But in the absence of that, the David Evans study is the best guide to how long the bridge can remain in service in its current condition,"" Pullen said.

And finally, is replacement the only way to get more life out of the bridge? Pullen argued yes, because the county concluded it’s not cost-effective to do anything less. The spokesman could not entertain the possibility that more repairs or a lower weight limit might extend the life of the bridge, because in 2005 the engineering company’s ""task was to tell us what it would take to keep the bridge in service ... for 10 to 15 years.""

We hate to say it, but all of this left us vaguely dissatisfied. Let’s return to Lehan’s statement: ""Our time to act is limited -- if the bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years.""

She didn’t say, well, based on this study the bridge has about four to nine years left at the 10-ton limit, if nobody does anything about it in the meantime. She didn’t say that the study was in response to a specific question asked by Multnomah County. The bottom line is that PolitiFact Oregon can’t predict the future -- and neither can Charlotte Lehan.

Her statement contains some element of truth -- there is a study, there is a time frame -- but it ignores the fact that officials would have to abandon long held plans and do nothing else in the interim for the Sellwood Bridge to ""have to be shut down."" We rate this statement Barely True.

"['Religion', 'Texas', 'Leo Berman']","
State Rep. Leo Berman says judges Dearborn, Michigan, practice Shariah law
","
This legislative session isn’t just about the budget; state Rep. Leo Berman has won House approval of a proposal that would prohibit courts from making legal decisions based on foreign laws, such as Shariah, the religious law of Islam.

On May 9, House members attached Berman’s legislation as an amendment to House Bill 274, a tort reform measure that Gov. Rick Perry earlier declared emergency legislation, before sending the overall proposal to the Senate.

But Berman, R-Tyler, drew our attention April 4 when he told the House Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence that Shariah law is ""being done in Dearborn, Mich,"" adding:""The judges in Dearborn are using, and allowing to be used, Shariah law. Also in England... in France and in Germany, the use of Shariah law is being allowed as well.""

Keeping this fact-check stateside, we wondered if judges in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb, practice Shariah law.

But first, what is it? According to an April 3 United Press International news article, Shariah is ""roughly comparable to the Talmudic tradition in Judaism"" — in other words, religious principles which adherents seek to live by.

Testifying before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on March 30, Farhana Khera, the president of Muslim Advocates, a legal resource for the Muslim community, said Shariah guides Muslims ""in the way that religious law guides those everyday activities for Christians and Jews, and other faith communities in the United States.""

When we sought back-up for Berman’s claim, his legislative director, Sharon Guthrie, guided us to Grand Prairie, Texas, resident Dorrie O’Brien, who told us she’s a speaker for Act! For America, a Florida-based group that describes itself as a citizen action network that ""defends America and democratic values against the terror and tyranny of radical Islam.""

O’Brien pointed us to a Feb. 24 post on ""Creeping Sharia,"" a blog about ""the slow, deliberate and methodical advance of Islamic law (Shariah) in non-Muslim countries,"" according to the blog’s ""about"" page. The blog says that on June 18, police at Dearborn’s annual Arab International Festival jailed four Christian missionaries, one of whom was ""peaceably discussing his Christian faith with Muslim youths"" and three others who were ""allegedly ‘breaching the peace.’""

According to a June 20, 2010 Detroit Free Press news article, the missionaries were with the group Acts 17 Apologetics, which seeks to convert Muslims to Christianity. They were arrested and jailed for disorderly conduct. One of the four, Negeen Mayel, was also charged with failure to obey a police officer’s order — to put down the camera she was videotaping with — according to the article.

A July 27 Free Press news article says Dearborn Mayor Jack O'Reilly and others had said the missionaries were trying to provoke festival goers, according to the article.

""Creeping Sharia"" has a different take: ""The Christians were led away in handcuffs by police to the applause and cheers of Muslim onlookers who just witnessed a victory of Shariah law over the Christians.""

The blog post quotes Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel for the Thomas More Law Center, as saying: ""Muslims dominate the political and law enforcement process in Dearborn. It seems that police were more interested in placating the mayor and Muslims than obeying our Constitution. Shariah law makes is a crime to preach the Gospel to Muslims. This a classic example of stealth Jihad being waged right here in America.""

The Christians were charged with disorderly conduct after police said theyr eceived a complaint from a Christian volunteer working at the festival who said he was harassed by the group, according to a Sept. 25 Free Press news article.

When the missionaries stood trial in September, festival volunteer Roger Williams testified that at the festival, they ""were making me nervous and I felt intimidated.""

A jury acquitted the missionaries, according to the Free Press. Mayel was found guilty of failure to obey the officer’s order.

The Dearborn dust-up made national headlines that month, when U.S. Senate hopeful Sharron Angle of Nevada claimed that the city is subject to Shariah law. ""We’re talking about a militant terrorist situation,"" she said.

Weeks later, O’Reilly appeared on CNN to dispute the characterization.

""There’s no Shariah law in Dearborn, Mich.,"" he said. In an Oct. 11 letter to Angle, he wrote: ""Contrary to the Shariah law misconception, there are Christian Evangelists who proselytize to Muslims 365 days a year without resistance or interference from anyone.""

On Feb. 22 of this year, the Thomas More Law Center, which describes itself as a law firm that defends and promotes Christians’ religious freedom, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Dearborn’s mayor, chief of police and two executives for the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, which puts on the festival. The case is still pending, and neither the city, police department or law center responded to our queries.

Dawud Walid, executive director of the Detroit-based Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called Berman’s claim ""complete rubbish."" Shariah is a ""spiritual compass"" that Muslims live by, not a ""thick codex of laws,"" he said. ""Obviously the U.S. and Michigan Constitution are the law of the land in Dearborn, Mich.""

He offered this example: Islamic law prohibits a Muslim from marrying a Hindu. ""But obviously if a Muslim male wants to go to the justice of the peace with a Hindu woman, he can marry a Hindu woman,"" he said. ""Actions guided by a person’s belief in what God wills for him is not anything that can be endorsed by the state.""

However, as PolitiFact Florida reported this month, courts may use religious laws when interpreting a contract that specifies, for example, Shariah as the legal foundation, and both parties agreed to those laws from the beginning.

Markus Wagner, a professor of international law at the University of Miami’s School of Law, said: ""It happens all the time... We could use Jewish law, Canaanite law, so long as it doesn’t contravene public policy.""

Detroit attorney Noel Saleh, who specializes in civil liberties and immigration law, told us in an email that ""judges in Michigan (like all judges in the United States) are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the state."" The Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution makes the Constitution and the laws of the United States ""the supreme law of the land.""

As for the way Berman is suggesting judges use Shariah law, Saleh said: ""There are no courts in Dearborn, Michigan that utilize Shariah law in any way, shape or form. This is an urban legend.""

Lastly, we searched online and in the Lexis-Nexis database, which archives news articles, for evidence of Berman’s claim. We found nothing but unsubstantiated claims and speculation.

As we were finishing up this item, Mark Somers, chief judge for the 19th District Court in Dearborn, emailed us this statement: ""As with every justice, judge and magistrate of this state, the judges and magistrates of Michigan’s 19th District Court are sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Michigan and to faithfully discharge the duties of the office to which they have been elected or appointed. There are no other laws that govern the adjudication of the matters within the jurisdiction of this court.""

All told, Dearborn Muslims, like all U.S. Muslims, may follow Shariah law in their personal lives and may enter into contracts — such as pre-nuptial agreements — bound by their principles. So may adherents of other religious faiths. And judges may use religious laws to interpret such contracts, providing all parties agree from the beginning.

Far as we can tell, though, judges don’t use Shariah law in lieu of the U.S. Constitution or state laws — nor are they doing so in Dearborn. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/may/14/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-judges-dearborn-michigan/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney calls Obama's health care law a government takeover
","
Some talking points keep getting recycled, even when they're not true.

Such is the case with the claim by many Republicans that the new health care law is ""a government takeover of health care."" PolitiFact has repeatedly rated that False or Pants on Fire and selected it as our 2010 Lie of the Year. But the line still gets repeated, most recently by likely presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

During a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., on May 12, 2011, Romney sought to explain how the health care plan he signed as governor of Massachusetts was different than the law signed by President  Barack Obama.

The Massachusetts plan -- passed with bipartisan support in the Legislature in 2006 -- shares many features with the Obama plan, so it poses a political problem for Romney.

In the speech, Romney sought to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts plan and Obama’s. He said, ""When I ask people what they dislike most about the president’s plan, what I typically hear is they say, ‘Obamacare represents a government takeover of health care, and I don’t like it.’ And I think they’re right.""

He made the same point in an accompanying PowerPoint slide, which called ""Obamacare"" ""a government takeover of health care,"" as opposed to ""Mass-Care,"" which he said was designed to ""help people get and keep their health insurance.""

We have examined the government takeover claim in detail in our previous coverage, but since the line is being used by a likely 2012 presidential candidate, it's worth revisiting why we found it flatly incorrect.

""Government takeover"" conjures a European approach in which the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the law Congress passed, parts of which have already gone into effect, relies largely on the free market. Critics of the law are correct that it significantly increases government regulation of health insurers. But it is, at its heart, a system that relies on private companies:

• Employers continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies.

• Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law sets up ""exchanges"" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it.

• The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors.

• The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers.

• The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. But here too, the approach relies on a free market with regulations, not socialized medicine.

Critics of our conclusion have said the significant increase in government regulation -- which, among other things, requires that adults have health insurance -- justifies the use of the term.

In an editorial  responding to our Lie of the Year choice, the Wall Street Journal wrote that ""at the heart of ObamaCare is a vast expansion of federal control over how U.S. health care is financed, and thus delivered. The regulations that PolitiFact waves off are designed to convert insurers into government contractors in the business of fulfilling political demands, with enormous implications for the future of U.S. medicine. All citizens will be required to pay into this system, regardless of their individual needs or preferences. Sounds like a government takeover to us.""

Michael Cannon, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, went so far as to announce that he was boycotting PolitiFact because of problems he had with both the ""government takeover"" article and the previous year’s Lie of the Year -- former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s argument that the Obama health care bill included ""death panels.""

When we asked Romney’s camp to explain their use of the term ""government takeover,"" spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said, ""It seems pretty obvious that under Obamacare, the federal government takes on a vastly expanded role in health care. Whether you call it a ‘takeover’ or a ‘power grab,’ the effect is the same -- it shifts power and responsibility from the states to Washington and suffocates the nation under a massive, byzantine bureaucracy fueled by a half trillion dollars in higher taxes.""

But we find flimsy evidence for such a strong claim. The government's expanded role in health falls far short of being a government takeover. As we said in our Lie of the Year announcement,  analogies about strict government regulation provide some helpful illustrations. The Federal Aviation Administration imposes detailed rules on airlines. State laws require drivers to have car insurance. Regulators tell electric utilities what they can charge. Yet that heavy regulation is not described as a government takeover.

There's no question that ""government takeover"" has been a successful talking point. A poll in March 2010 found that a majority of the American people believed it was true. But the facts simply don't support it. The health care law continues to depend on private health insurance and private-sector physicians. So Romney earns the same rating as others who have made the false claim: Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/may/13/mitt-romney/romney-calls-obamas-health-care-law-government-tak/

Jamie Radtke says George Allen had 40,000 earmarks while senator
","
Tea Party organizer Jamie Radtke says George Allen was a big spender during his time in the U.S. Senate.

Allen and Radtke are among five candidates vying in next year’s Republican primary for the Senate seat occupied by Democrat Jim Webb, who will not seek reelection.

In a May 4 telephone interview with the WJHL 11 Connect television, which serves northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, Radtke used a startling statistic to attack Allen’s 2001-2007 Senate term.

""He had 40,000 earmarks,"" she said.

Earmarks -- better known as ""pork"" -- are the line items inserted into larger bills that direct federal spending to specific projects. Lawmakers request the earmarks during the appropriations process, often to direct money to projects back in their home state.

Radtke’s 40,000 figure seemed bizarrely high to us. Allen served in the Senate for 2,193 days. So he would have had to request an average of 18 earmarks a day to reach that tally.

We asked Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for the Radtke campaign, where her information came from.

Hansen said Radtke’s position isn’t that Allen personally requested those items, but rather that he ""voted for"" 40,000 earmarks by supporting larger appropriations bills containing the line items.

""He owns all the votes for all those 40,000 earmarks even if they weren’t Virginia earmarks,"" Hansen said.

We’ll examine that argument in a second.

But first we should point out that Radtke has repeatedly suggested Allen requested the 40,000 earmarks.

In a Jan. 29 story in the National Journal, she was asked if Allen should have voted against the appropriations bills during his tenure.

""Well a good starting point is not to have 40,000 earmarks of your own,"" in those bills, Radtke was quoted as saying.

In a March 15 Twitter post, Radtke mused about the possibility of stripping the funds from ""Allen’s 40,000 earmarks.""

A March 25 blog post on Radtke’s website added some qualifications, but it still took Allen to task for his earmarks record.

""Allen supported nearly 40,000 earmarks during his six years in the Senate, costing taxpayers more than $90 billion,"" Radtke’s post said.

All this begs the question: Where did the 40,000 earmarks tally come?

Hansen said the campaign arrived at that number using figures from Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative non-profit group that has long derided earmarks. CAGW has posted on its website an annual list of what it calls ""pork projects"" from fiscal years 1991-2010.

The group says the projects it counts have to fit at least one of seven criteria, among them that the line items were requested by only one house of Congress, were not subject to hearings or serve only a local interest.

Radtke’s campaign tallied 52,319 congressional earmarks for 2002-2006. Seeking a conservative estimate, Hansen said they lopped off a budget year when Allen was in the Senate and then dropped the tally to 40,000 earmarks.

Those tens of thousands of earmarks were included in appropriations bills during Allen’s term. Because Allen voted for all the appropriations bills that came up while he was in the Senate, Radtke’s campaign concluded he supported each of the 40,000 earmarks that were contained deep within those spending bills.

Is it legitimate to blame Allen for earmarks other lawmakers’ earmarks because he voted for the overall appropriations bills?

Josh Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, a non-partisan organization seeking balanced federal budgets, said Radtke is leveling ""kind of an absurd criticism.""

""I think if you were going to criticize someone for earmarks, the more appropriate measure would be the amount of earmarks the senator requested for Virginia, and how many he got,"" Gordon said. ""You can’t just not fund the government because one of the 535 representatives (in Congress) has a $1,000 check going to somewhere in his district.""

Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, agreed the better measure of a legislator’s earmark record is whether they vote for bills containing items that they themselves requested.

But DeHaven does not give legislators a complete pass on earmark culpability when they vote for ""earmark-laden"" bills. ""He’s still culpable for voting for the underlying bills, all the bills that contain those thousands of earmarks,"" DeHaven said.

It’s impossible to track down the amount of earmarks that Allen requested because when he left office in 2007, members of Congress weren’t required to disclose whether they requested a particular line item. That changed in 2008.

For what it’s worth, we dug deeper into the Citizens Against Government Waste database and found that it lists 1,135 earmarks for Virginia from 2002-2006. They could have been requested by any and all of Virginia’s 13-member congressional delegation. The total cost of those line items: about $1.2 billion according to the database.

So, where does this trip down earmark lane lead us?

Radtke, at least three times, said that Allen ""had 40,000 earmarks"" during his tenure in the Senate. That suggests he actually requested those line items.

Her campaign spokesman said that she means that Allen ""voted for"" those earmarks because that he said were included in overall appropriations bills that Allen supported.

But that’s not what she said. Her statement is False.",/factchecks/2011/may/13/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-george-allen-had-40000-earmarks-/

Supreme Court's Ginsburg not retiring, despite what fake news headline says
","Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made it no secret last summer that she is not a fan of President-elect Donald Trump. But contrary to what a popular fake news story says, she has not announced she’s retiring. Bloggers on multiple websites have posted an article with the headline, ""Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resigning from the post of associate justice of the Supreme Court."" The most recent one we saw was on Jan. 2, 2017, but recently there are plenty of other examples going back to December 2016. The posts draw on speculation that Trump will have the opportunity to nominate replacements for several Supreme Court justices as they retire over the next four years. Trump already is preparing to nominate a successor for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, after Republicans in Congress for months refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland. At 83, Ginsburg is considered to be one of the justices Trump might replace, should Ginsburg retire or die while he is in office. Fueling that talk is Ginsburg’s outspoken opposition to Trump. All the fake posts read essentially the same, allegedly quoting Ginsburg in an interview about what would happen if Trump started choosing replacement Supreme Court justices. ""I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,"" Ginsburg told the Associated Press, according to the posts. Ginsburg really did say those words, but in a different context: She told the AP she couldn’t imagine Trump becoming president in an interview on July 7, 2016, and didn’t want to consider the prospect. It was one of several comments over the span of a week in which Ginsburg expressed a low opinion of Trump, calling him a ""faker"" and that she ""can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president."" That netted Ginsburg plenty of criticism before she said a week later she regretted making the ""ill-advised"" and ""incautious"" remarks. While Ginsburg did express distaste for Trump publicly, everything else in the fake news posts appear to be completely contrived. The posts all include lengthy faux quotes in which Ginsburg says she could not tolerate Trump as a president and would resign should he become commander in chief. Tellingly, even the posts after the Nov. 8 election refer to Trump as a candidate instead of the president-elect. That’s because the posts draw from a fake story posted July 8 on a website called TheRightists.com. The site says on its ""about us"" description page that ""This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!"" In the fake story, Ginsburg announces she will resign if Trump becomes president. In real life, she said five weeks before Trump was elected that she had no intention of retiring. TheRightists.com, which is registered to an address in Israel, is part of a family of websites that take a kernel of real news and then construct a fake story around it. Related sites like Politicono.com and Newslo.com include a button so that readers can identify what is fabricated, but TheRightists.com does not. That makes it very difficult to tell that most of the quoted material is completely made up. We attempted to contact some of the sites that reposted the article to see if they knew it was fake, but did not receive any responses. Clearly many readers in the comments sections of these websites are unaware the story is fabricated. Adding a real, out-of-context quote from Ginsburg with no disclaimer that the story is fake only confuses matters more.

Scott Walker says Wisconsin property taxes, as percentage of income, are lowest since end of WWII
","Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recited a number of statistical accomplishments during his seventh state of the state speech on Jan. 10, 2017, including one that dates back to two decades before he was born. ""Property taxes -- as a percentage of our personal income in this state -- are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II,"" the 49-year-old Republican said. ""Think about that -- since the end of World War II."" Cutting property taxes has been a priority since Walker took office in 2011, as is shown on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks the governor’s campaign promises. We rated Promise Kept Walker’s pledge to freeze property taxes during his first term; and In the Works his promise to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. But on the measure Walker cited, are property taxes lower than they have been in generations? The speech Figures highlighted during a formal address such as the annual state of the state speech are likely to have been well vetted. But as we found during our live fact checking of Walker’s speech on Twitter, the governor made some statements that could benefit from clarification. Walker said more people were employed in Wisconsin in 2016 than at any time in history. When that same claim was made in June 2016 it rated Mostly True. But we pointed out economists generally prefer the unemployment rate, which accounts for population growth over time. Walker’s speech also touted listening sessions he has held throughout the state. But as we found in checking an August 2016 claim by a potential 2018 gubernatorial candidate, Democratic state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, Walker’s sessions were ""invite-only and excluding the press."" World War II times To back Walker’s statement on property taxes, the governor’s office pointed to a July 2015 memo from the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance. The memo stated that Wisconsin’s property tax burden was at 3.6 percent of personal income, the lowest since 1946 (when it was also 3.6 percent). Dale Knapp, the alliance’s research director, gave us the raw numbers: The levy was $9.45 billion in 2015 on property taxes payable in 2016. That figure amounts to 3.6 percent of total personal income of $263.3 billion in 2015. Knapp told us comparing property taxes to income is one way to see how much of a take property taxes have on the state’s economy. He said the memo reflects the most recent figures available. (A note: In a January 2017 report, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau measured property taxes versus income at 10 intervals dating back to 1970. Wisconsin’s property tax level per $1,000 of personal income exceeded the national average during each period and ranked 12th nationally in 2014, the latest year covered in the report.) Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, didn’t dispute the taxpayer alliance’s 3.6 percent figure. But she told us one thing to note is that some people haven’t benefited as much from Walker’s property tax cuts. For instance, Walker’s 2011-’13 state budget stopped inflation adjustments for the state Homestead Credit, which softens the impact of property taxes and rent on persons with lower incomes. The program can put more than $1,100 back in people’s pockets through income tax refunds. For 2016, people with a household income of less than $24,680 could qualify for the credits. Cornelius cited figures from the state fiscal bureau showing that the credits have been reduced by $133.5 million since Walker ended the inflation adjustments. That means the money stayed in state coffers rather than being refunded to residents. The office of state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, also pointed to Walker's budget moves, including limits on how much school districts can levy in property taxes, in noting that more than half of Wisconsin's 424 school districts have passed referendum initiatives since the beginning of 2012.  Our rating Walker said Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, ""are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II."" It’s worth noting that one change Walker made reduces income tax refunds given to lower-income taxpayers through the state Homestead Credit, which is aimed at softening the impact of property taxes. But an analysis by the respected Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance shows that on the measure Walker cited, property taxes are the lowest they have been since 1946.

Keith Ellison wrong that CBO can't analyze cost of Obamacare repeal
","House rules don’t often become big news. This year was somewhat different. The biggest news in the 2017 rules package was an amendment to curb the power of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. After a big public backlash and critical tweets by President-elect Donald Trump, the amendment was withdrawn. Somewhat less widely noticed, but which has come up periodically in pro-Democratic web posts and social media, was a provision that seemed to prevent the Congressional Budget Office from analyzing the cost of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If true, this would be significant, since the CBO, Congress’ number-crunching arm, is a respected independent referee on questions of how much legislative proposals will cost the federal treasury. If this happened, it would make it easier for Republicans to avoid answering the question of why they want to repeal a law at significant cost to the U.S. treasury. At least one lawmaker made an issue of this rules provision on Twitter: Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who has taken on a higher profile due to his bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman. ""House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal,"" Ellison tweeted on Jan. 5, 2017. It was retweeted more than 2,400 times and received 1,600 likes.  The House rules package governs how the U.S. House of Representatives handles its basic procedures for the two-year duration of a congressional session. We wanted to know if it really contained what Ellison said. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t, as Ellison’s office now acknowledges. What the rules package says The passage in question can be found here in section 3, subsection h.  The provision is laden with jargon, but the gist is this: The rules package established a new requirement for CBO to undertake an unusually long-term analysis for legislation, and then specifically freed the ACA repeal from this type of analysis. The rules package says that ""the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, prepare an estimate of whether a bill or joint resolution reported by a committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) ... would cause, relative to current law, a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 fiscal years after the current fiscal year."" According to the rule, any bills flagged as adding to the deficit by this required CBO analysis would be considered out of order, effectively sidelining them. However, the rules package went on to list a specific exception to this requirement, including repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act or a portion of the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. These were the two legislative vehicles that were used to enact President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. What the provision actually means But while Ellison tweeted that the package ""bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal,"" it actually doesn’t say CBO can’t analyze the law’s costs. Rather, the provision in the rules package lifts the requirement that CBO track the cost of repeal or reform over the unusually long period mandated by the rules provision -- that is, 50 years after the first year CBO measures. Analyses over more typical -- and shorter -- time periods are not barred. ""People have misinterpreted this exemption to conclude that CBO wouldn't provide a cost estimate for ACA legislation at all,"" said Ed Lorenzen, a senior advisor to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a former senior aide to House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. ""But the exemption only applies to the new requirement for additional information regarding long-term costs in CBO estimates of legislation."" The Congressional Budget Act requires a cost estimate covering the next 10 years for all legislation considered by Congress, he said, and ""the rules package doesn’t change that."" Lorenzen added that the rules package doesn’t prevent CBO from making a long-term analysis of the costs of an ACA repeal — it just says that doing such an analysis isn’t mandatory. ""There’s obviously a difference between saying something is not required and actually prohibiting it,"" Lorenzen said. ""There’s reason to believe that CBO would probably provide information about a ballpark estimate of budgetary effects of legislation related to the Affordable Care Act beyond the 10-ten year window even without a requirement to do so, given the magnitude of the impact and interest among members of Congress in the long term budgetary effects of the ACA."" Lorenzen said that he and his organization would have opposed a provision of the type Ellison assumes in his tweet. ""But that’s not what’s happening here,"" he said. Donald Wolfensberger, a former House Rules Committee aide who is now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, agreed with Lorenzen’s analysis. ""This is a new point of order and exemption from it, and implicitly does not alter existing budget rules and requirements, including the ability of CBO to make cost estimates,"" Wolfensberger said. Ellison’s office backed off after PolitiFact relayed Lorenzen’s analysis and acknowledged that the interpretation in the tweet was incorrect. Our ruling Ellison tweeted that the ""House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal."" In reality, the rules package doesn’t bar CBO analysis of ACA repeal proposals. Rather, the rules package says that CBO is not required to conduct an extra-long-term analysis that goes 50 years into the future, although the office could do one if it wants. It also doesn’t prevent CBO from doing the more typical, 10-year analyses it does for proposed bills.

Rex Tillerson misleads on Russian sanctions opposition
","U.S. senators grilled former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson about his past dealings with Russia at his recent confirmation hearing to become secretary of state. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Tillerson whether he thought Vladimir Putin was a war criminal (Tillerson's answer: ""I would not use that term""), while Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pressed him on Exxon opposing sanctions against Russia.     Senators have taken a hardline on Russia, both for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine and its likely interference in the 2016 elections. Some, including Rubio, were keen supporters of economic sanctions against Russia in 2014. At that time, Exxon, with Tillerson at the helm, had struck joint venture deals with the Russian petro giant Rosneft to explore for oil across the country. Exxon estimated its exposure on those deals at $1 billion. Sanctions presented big problems for those investments. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017, Tillerson rejected the assertion that he ever tried to scuttle sanctions. ""I have never lobbied against sanctions personally,"" Tillerson said. ""To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions."" That’s an artfully crafted answer that’s pretty misleading Government lobbying records show that in 2014 and 2015, Exxon paid the Nickles Group over $193,000 to press ""issues related to Russian sanctions impacting the energy sector,"" along with a number of other matters. It paid another $120,000 in 2014 and 2015 to Avenue Solutions for work on a range of issues, including ""energy sanctions in the Ukraine and Russia."" In the same time frame, according to public logs, Tillerson visited the White House five times to see Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council. The meetings started about a week after President Barack Obama authorized the first of three rounds of sanctions. Bloomberg reported that Tillerson saw Treasury Secretary Jack Lew seven times in the second half of 2014. The Treasury Department oversees how sanctions are carried out. That seems to directly contradict Tillerson’s statement, but Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told us it didn’t. ""Exxon Mobil regularly engages with lawmakers and others to discuss the potential impact of sanctions and to express our view that sanctions should treat American companies fairly,"" Jeffers said. ""We do not express an opinion as to whether or not sanctions should be imposed; that is a decision for policy makers."" But at Exxon’s May 2014 shareholder meeting, Tillerson offered a more negative take on sanctions overall. He told reporters that sanctions are ""imprecise and ineffective."" and that ""our views are being heard at the highest levels,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. Oil industry experts told us it’s hard to believe that Exxon wouldn’t have opposed the sanctions. Tadeusz Patzek is a professor and petroleum industry analyst at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Patzek thinks Tillerson is a good choice for secretary of state, but he also said Exxon’s interests in Russia were quite clear. ""Russia is the last global frontier with big untapped oil resources that could be made available to Exxon,"" Patzek said. ""From this point of view, Exxon must have viewed the sanctions as unhelpful to the corporation."" Tim LaPira, a political scientist who studies lobbying at James Madison University, told us Tillerson’s claim is ""implausible."" ""The message of what sanctions would do would necessarily communicate that they were taking a clear position against them,"" LaPira said. ""If Exxon Mobil hired expensive lobbyists to communicate about sanctions, but not the corporation's position against them, then it seems to me they used shareholders' money to accomplish exactly nothing."" Government ethics advocate Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said, ""I doubt they would lobby for a bill that essentially cost them $1 billion."" Our ruling Tillerson said that he never lobbied against sanctions that targeted the Russian energy industry, nor to his knowledge had Exxon. But lobbying records show Exxon spent over $300,000 to argue its case on sanctions. Visitor records for the White House and the Treasury Department show Tillerson was a visitor when sanctions were being considered. An Exxon spokesperson said the company simply offered information on sanctions. But in 2014 Tillerson told reporters that he thought sanctions generally were ineffective and that he had let top government officials know what he thought of them.

Viral post exaggerates GOP senators' bill on embassy move
","Are three Republican senators who once blasted lax embassy security in Benghazi, Libya, now playing Russian roulette with other embassies around the world? A meme making the social media rounds says so, and readers asked us to check it out. The image includes pictures of three Republican senators — Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida — along with the caption, ""The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent.""  We wanted to know if the meme was accurate about how these three senators responded to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic extremists on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, and whether the lawmakers are indeed trying to roll back embassy security. Many Republicans used the attack to criticize Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, for being insufficiently attentive to embassy security and thus being at least partially at fault for the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. How accurate is this assertion? Actually, it’s misleading on several points. (We were unable to reach the group that created the meme, the Other 98, a group that says it fights ""economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy."") On the first point, Cruz and Rubio have levied strong opinions about Benghazi and Clinton for years, but it’s a stretch to put Heller in the same category. To cite just one example, Cruz in June 2016 responded to the release of the final report of the House Select Committee on Benghazi by issuing a statement that called it ""disturbing"" that the ""bureaucratic incompetence of the Department of State under Secretary Clinton contributed to the administration’s willful blindness, as the pleas for help from our foreign service officers in Libya were routinely ignored."" Rubio, who like Cruz ran for president in 2016, also cast Benghazi as a shadow over Clinton’s record. For instance, during a GOP primary debate in October 2015, Rubio said that Clinton ""got exposed as a liar"" during her day-long testimony before the Benghazi committee. (The Washington Post Fact Checker gave this Two Pinocchios out of a maximum of four.) And Rubio released a statement that rapped Clinton for the ""extraordinary failure"" by State Department officials, including Clinton, ""to grasp the security risks in Libya and Benghazi in particular, and take the appropriate action to protect Americans stationed in that country."" Heller, however, has been much more circumspect about Benghazi. We found less rhetoric about Benghazi by Heller than by either Cruz or Rubio in our searches of Google, Lexis-Nexis and their respective Senate websites. For instance, Heller issued a statement calling for ""thoughts and prayers"" for the victims the day after the attacks took place, and another one two days later specifically memorializing one of the victims, Tyrone Woods, who was a Nevada resident. Those are the only two releases related to Benghazi on his Senate website. The only other examples linking Heller and Benghazi that came up in Nexis or Google searches occurred after the recent bill’s introduction. Meanwhile, the meme’s argument that the senators are hypocrites for wanting to cut embassy security by 50 percent is exaggerated. The bill at issue is S. 11, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act, which Cruz, Rubio and Heller laid out in a joint news release. The main focus of S. 11 is on moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- something that Congress mandated in 1995 when it passed the Jerusalem Embassy and Relocation Act. Presidents of both parties have declined to carry out the move, expressing concerns that doing so would complicate the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. President-elect Donald Trump is seen as more supportive of an embassy move. The part about the 50-percent cut for embassy security isn’t made up. The bill says that if the embassy is not moved, then ""not more than 50 percent of the amounts appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 2017 under the heading ‘Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance’ may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened."" The bill has not yet been taken up. So saying that the senators ""introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent"" is misleading. The senators introduced a bill to move the embassy, using the specter of a budget cut as leverage to support that goal -- not as the goal itself. None of them affirmatively wants to cut embassy security funding, though they are willing to risk that outcome if their primary goal is not met. In the Jan. 3 news release announcing the bill, the three senators didn’t even mention the threat of a security cut, while repeatedly highlighting their goal of moving the embassy. In addition, Heller’s office told PolitiFact that a different State Department account than the one mentioned in the bill -- the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account -- is a ""critical source"" of funds for ""high threat protection needs, security technology, armored vehicles, cyber security, and diplomatic couriers."" And that account would not be touched by the threatened cuts. Finally, it’s worth noting that this is the fourth time Heller has introduced a bill along these lines -- S.1622, introduced on Sept, 23, 2011; S.604, introduced on March 19, 2013; S.117, introduced on Jan. 7, 2015; and the current bill. So one could just as easily view the bill’s introduction as the latest in a series of nearly identical bills that Heller has introduced like clockwork since 2011 -- almost a year before the Benghazi attacks took place. Our ruling A meme from the Other 98 said, ""The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent."" The meme has a point — Cruz, Rubio and Heller did submit a bill that seeks to leverage the threat of a 50 percent cut to the State Department’s ""Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance"" account in the service of forcing the executive branch to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, the meme goes too far in suggesting that the 50 percent cut was the purpose of the bill, and it ignores that some of the most important security funds would be untouched. The meme also ignores that essentially the same bill was introduced almost a year before the Benghazi attacks, and it incorrectly labels Heller as one of the more outspoken Republican lawmakers on Benghazi.

Astorino has not raised the tax levy in Westchester County
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants local governments to cut costs and share services to reduce burdensome property taxes for New York state residents. Cuomo unveiled a proposal in his State of the State speech for county leaders to craft an annual cost-cutting plan, which would be submitted to voters for approval. Westchester County Executive Robert P. Astorino took exception at Cuomo deflecting blame for property taxes.   ""I would remind the governor that I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years --  while Mr. Cuomo's state mandates have ravaged county, municipal and school budgets,"" Astorino said. Has Astorino kept the tax levy flat in Westchester County since taking office? Astorino’s budget Cuomo won a second term as governor in 2014 when he beat Astorino, the Republican nominee. Astorino has acknowledged he’s keeping the door open to another shot at Cuomo. As county executive of Westchester County, Astorino leads a county that has among the highest property taxes in the country. When Astorino started as county executive in 2010, the county collected about $560.7 million in property taxes from residents. In his first year, Astorino approved a $12.3 million, or two percent, cut in the county's real property tax levy. Since then Westchester County’s property tax levy has remained flat. So the county portion of residents’ property tax bill has decreased. Instead of just keeping the tax rate flat, Astorino and the county legislature opted to keep the dollar amount of the tax levy the same. Since more residents have moved into Westchester County in the past seven years, the property tax levy - now $548 million annually - has been spread out among more taxpayers. ""With the tax levy frozen, county property taxes for residents in Westchester have actually gone down,"" said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center, an independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank in Albany. That does not necessarily mean a resident’s total property tax bill is lower. Their bill is comprised of county and local taxes, including school taxes. The sales tax rate in Westchester County has been 3 percent since 2004, according to the state Dept. of Taxation and Finance. Yonkers, the largest city in the county, was allowed by the legislature to raise its local sales tax in 2015. That decision was made by the city council and approved by the state legislature, not the county. The few other taxes the county collects, like the hotel occupancy tax, have also stayed at the same rate since Astorino was elected, the county’s press office says. Revenue from these taxes has increased since Astorino took office. Our ruling Astorino said ""I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years."" He’s right, according to the county’s budget department and the New York State Comptroller’s Office. He has proposed seven budgets, all of which either kept the tax levy flat or lowered it. We rate Astorino’s claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8d4a03aa-443d-4f46-a6b9-323e5ecb108b",/factchecks/2017/jan/11/robert-astorino/astorino-has-not-raised-tax-levy-westchester-count/

Trump wrong that Americans don't care about his tax returns
","In his first press conference since July 2016, President-elect Donald Trump scolded reporters for asking about his tax returns, saying members of the media are the only ones who care about the records. Trump said on Jan. 11, 2017, that he had no financial ties or business deals with Russia. He then dismissed the concerns of a reporter who asked Trump whether he would be releasing his tax returns to prove it. ""I’m not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they’re under audit,"" Trump said. The reporter pointed out that presidents have been releasing their returns since the 1970s. Trump interrupted her and said, ""Oh, gee, I never heard that."" ""You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, okay? They’re the only ones,"" he said, saying he thought the American public isn’t concerned about it. ""I won; I mean, I became president. No, I don’t think they care at all. I don’t think they care at all. I think you care."" Media outlets have called for Trump to release his returns throughout his campaign, and have increased calls since his election. Trump and his surrogates have offered myriad excuses as to why he won’t release any information. But are they the only people who care whether he does it? Polling data consistently shows that overall, a majority of Americans want to know what’s in Trump’s tax records. The vocal majority It’s been common practice for decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Despite Trump’s argument that he isn’t releasing his because he’s being audited, the IRS has said he’s allowed to release them whether he’s under an audit or not (as Richard Nixon did). Tax returns show a lot of details about a president’s business dealings and financial background, much more than, say, campaign finance disclosures, which Trump has offered as an alternative. That explains the media interest, which Trump has attacked before. Trump’s transition team did not elaborate on his statement when we contacted them, but he is wrong to say that the public doesn’t care, by most polls. One such poll taken before Trump's news conference confirms most Americans said he should release the returns.  Pew Research Center released a new poll Jan. 10, on the eve of Trump’s latest press conference, that re-examined how voters felt. The poll showed that close to two-thirds of Americans think the issue is important. The poll was conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points for the total sample. Sixty percent of the people polled by Pew said Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns. The numbers do vary broadly depending on political affiliation, however — 38 percent of Republicans or those leaning Republican agree he has a responsibility, compared to 79 percent of Democrats or those leaning to the left. There was a lot more polling about this topic before the Nov. 8 election. The way the questions were framed varies from poll to poll, so it's difficult to compare the figures directly. But generally they illustrate that Americans think Trump's tax returns are a serious issue.  A Quinnipiac University poll released Aug. 25, 2016, showed that 74 percent of all voters said Trump should release his tax returns publicly. That figure dipped only slightly among Republicans, 62 percent of whom said he should release them. A Monmouth University poll the same week said that 62 percent of Americans thought it was either somewhat or very important to them that presidential candidates release their tax returns. A Fox News poll released Sept. 7 showed that 60 percent of voters, including 36 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats, thought Trump was hiding something in his tax returns. On Sept. 21, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 52 percent of voters were concerned about Trump not releasing his tax returns. The choice was among several options about voters’ areas of concern about both Trump and Clinton. ""Trump’s comments and language about women, immigrants and Muslims"" was the top concern with 69 percent, and ""Trump not having the right temperament to serve as commander in chief"" was second with 66 percent. ""Trump’s praise for Vladimir Putin"" also ranked as a higher concern, at 59 percent. One outlier was when Fox News asked voters in a poll conducted Sept. 27-29 whether ""the fact that Donald Trump hasn’t released his tax returns bother you, or is it no big deal?"" Forty-six percent of respondents answered ""bothers me,"" while 52 percent said it was ""no big deal."" But even that tally shows about half of Americans were concerned that Trump hadn't released his tax returns. Our ruling Trump said Americans don't ""care at all"" about his tax returns. Several polls, including one released the day before his latest press conference, show that a sizable portion of the public does think Trump’s tax returns are an important issue. These polls word their questions differently, but most results showed a majority of Americans believed the issue was relevant, undermining Trump’s assertion that only the media wants to explore the issue.

Does tuberculosis top HIV/AIDS as the deadlier disease?
","Among nations, the United States is the runaway leader in the money it spends on global health programs, and the looming question for advocates is what will happen under President Donald Trump and a Republican Congress. Nick Seymour, a Harvard junior volunteering at a health clinic in Mexico, argued for sustained spending. ""One would be hard-pressed to find a policy issue that has a greater impact on more lives than global health financing, yet the topic has not broken through the white noise of the election and post-election coverage,"" Seymour wrote in a Jan. 7 op-ed published in The Hill. Seymour underscored the many millions of HIV/AIDS patients helped by American dollars, and noted a disturbing trend with tuberculosis. ""Tuberculosis’ recent surpassing of HIV/AIDS as the leading infectious killer globally has not been met with anything close to equal funding for relief,"" he wrote. We’ve looked at TB’s death toll before; it is a wickedly tenacious disease. The data question is, has it really become a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS? And looking at the data, the estimates are mixed. But just as importantly, the relative death tolls of the two diseases has more to do with success in treating HIV/AIDS patients, and less to do with any change in the spread of TB. Seymour told us he relied on figures from the United Nations and World Health Organization. For 2015, they estimated 1.1 million people died from HIV/AIDS. In the same year, TB deaths reached 1.4 million, jumping 300,000 from just a year before. The rise inspired headlines that tuberculosis was now the leading cause of death from infectious disease. And within the framework of that UN data, that was accurate. But there is another widely used and well regarded overview of global health. It is the Global Burden of Disease study, produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and published by the British medical journal Lancet. By their calculations, TB deaths in 2015 totalled 1.1 million and HIV/AIDS deaths 1.2 million. But as institute researchers Hmwe Kyu and Theo Vos, told us, you couldn’t actually say that one topped the other. ""We didn’t find any statistically significant difference between the number of deaths due to both diseases,"" they said. An imperfect science: The India factor Estimating deaths from TB and HIV/AIDS requires judgment calls. As the WHO’s TB report noted in its methodology section, ""There are many potential sources of uncertainty associated with estimates of TB incidence, prevalence and mortality."" Many poorer, more rural nations have a hard time collecting the data from doctors and clinics. Faced with missing numbers, analysts make assumptions to fill in the gaps. Then they run the country totals through overall statistical models that involve other assumptions. Usually, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the WHO roughly agree at the global level. But in 2015, there was a 300,000 death difference for TB. That was also the first year when new numbers from India began to change the WHO’s global estimates. Prudence Smith, a WHO spokeswoman, told us in October that between 2013 and 2015, India shifted from a reporting system based on paper to one that lives on the Internet. ""In addition,"" Smith said, "" the country has made case notification legally mandatory."" In the world of tuberculosis, India is a huge deal. It is home to more than 25 percent of all TB cases and deaths worldwide. With more raw data in hand, the WHO’s estimate of the TB death toll in India more than doubled, going from 220,000 in 2014 to 480,000 in 2015, a jump of 260,000. To be clear, it’s not that more people were dying from TB, just that India reported more deaths to the WHO. Curiously, in the same period, the institute’s estimate for India barely changed. It had judged the figure to be in the neighborhood of 480,000 since 2013. The WHO’s upward shift for India accounted for 80 percent of the rise in its global total for TB. The institute had no reason for such an adjustment. It had factored in a higher number for India all along and it's global total remained about the same. Why TB might overtake HIV/AIDS (without even trying) Most people hearing that TB deaths now outnumber HIV/AIDS deaths, or had simply pulled even with HIV/AIDS, would likely think that TB was spreading. That would be wrong. Beyond the matter of better reporting out of India and a couple of other countries, the real driver behind the shifting numbers has to do with HIV/AIDS. ""We have been much more successful in the fight against AIDS than TB,"" said Audrey Jackson, a senior global health fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (Jackson just published a report on the many ways TB programs have played second fiddle inside Washington.) Death rates for both TB and HIV/AIDS have been falling, but the decline has been faster for HIV/AIDS than TB. Using the institute's data, between 2005 and 2015, the death rate for HIV/AIDS globally fell by 42 percent. At the same time, the TB death rate fell by about 34 percent. This chart from the institute’s database shows the impact on the number of deaths.  The gains against HIV/AIDS have a lot to do with a massive hike in the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment. There has also been a rise in the number of people getting treated for TB, but according to researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, in many countries, it’s proven harder to spot patients with TB. That leads to delays in care, which in turn make it harder for the person to beat the disease. Couple that with the rise in antibiotic resistant TB, along with other factors, and the gains are slower compared to HIV/AIDS. Those trends cast TB as more of a growing threat than HIV/AIDS. Right now, the death rates are about the same. However, Hmwe Kyu at the institute said that if the trend lines continue, then the victims of TB will outnumber those of HIV/AIDS. Not because TB has become worse, but because the situation with HIV/AIDS got better faster. Our ruling Seymour said tuberculosis is now a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS. Numbers from the United Nations and the World Health Organization support that, but another equally credible source, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said the death tolls are about the same. The data’s not good enough for highly precise estimates. It’s also unclear that TB is killing more people than it did before. The higher estimate by the WHO reflects better reporting, mainly from India, but not more actual deaths. The one undisputed point is that death rates are falling faster for HIV/AIDS than for TB. Both sets of data back that up. In that respect, TB is the more threatening infectious disease because the world is having a harder time getting ahead of it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the TB threat is itself rising. It looms larger than HIV/AIDS because that threat has fallen. On balance, we rate this statement Half True.",/factchecks/2017/jan/11/nick-seymour/tuberculosis-might-top-hivaids-deadliest-infectiou/

Trump says Russians were unable to hack the Republican National Committee
","After months of discounting Russian involvement in the election, President-elect Donald Trump admitted that Russia was behind the campaign hacks and document leaks. ""As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,"" he said at a Jan. 11 press conference from Trump Tower in New York, his first press conference in several months. Government intelligence agents have concluded that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in a way that favored Trump over Hillary Clinton. A leading reason for this conclusion is that Russian actors tried to access accounts belonging to both Democrats and Republicans through cyber intrusion, but they only widely disseminated significant information stolen from the Democrats. At his press conference, Trump said the Democrats could have done a better job protecting themselves, like the Republicans did. The Russians ""tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through,"" Trump said. Over the past few weeks, there has been some confusion about whether the RNC had been infiltrated in a manner similar to the DNC. So we decided to put Trump’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. In a Kremlin-directed campaign, online con artists stole, then leaked, emails from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. The emails ended up being posted on WikiLeaks and other online sources. The leaks caused many headaches for the Clinton campaign and led to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s resignation. It’s clear that Russian hackers did infiltrate some Republicans and affiliated groups. The website DC Leaks published about 200 emails related to Republican Party business, as well as the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN that Russian actors compromised his campaign emails. But the claim that the RNC specifically was not hacked is significant because the organization is the core of the national Republican Party structure. The New York Times reported Dec. 9 that the Russians did hack the RNC’s computer systems. But the Wall Street Journal reported Dec. 16 that the RNC hacking attempt was unsuccessful. Both reports were based on anonymous sources. Two government reports about the Russian election interference — published Dec. 29 and Jan. 6 — don’t provide any clarity. The more extensive Jan. 6 report says only: ""Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign."" FBI Director James Comey offered the most definitive statements recently, in a Jan. 10 hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He explained that the Russian hackers had accessed state-level Republican organizations and candidates, as well as outdated email domains associated with the RNC, but not the active RNC or the Trump campaign. ""There was evidence that there was hacking directed at state level organizations, state level campaigns and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC,"" Comey said. ""That is, email domains that they were no longer using, and the information was harvested from there, but it was old stuff. None of that was released. We did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked."" He added that the methods used to attack the RNC and DNC systems were similar. The Russian actors used a technique called phishing, meaning the cyber intruders sent emails designed to trick the recipient into clicking a link and giving over his or her email password. But Comey said the Russian attackers ""got far deeper and wider into"" the DNC, though he couldn’t say why they didn’t get into the current RNC system. Trump and other Republican leaders say that the hackers were unable to get into the RNC because of the organization’s superior cyber defenses. While this is a plausible claim, we are unable to independently corroborate it. The RNC pointed us to the December Wall Street Journal article mentioned previously, which reported that ""intruders failed to get past security defenses on the RNC’s computer networks."" Additionally, the cyber intruders were much less aggressive in their attempts to penetrate the RNC than they were in their attacks against the DNC. This article is based on unnamed sources said to be close to the RNC and the intelligence investigation. The DNC, in contrast, did not have the most-advanced programs for detecting suspicious email traffic installed, and the organization was slow to respond to the FBI’s warning that it had been hacked, reported the New York Times, in an article based on interviews with several on-the-record sources. Our ruling Trump said the Russians ""tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through."" While Russians were able to get into the email accounts of some Republican individuals and state-level Republican organizations, they did not break into the Republican National Committee’s current system, according to the director of the FBI. Russians did access email domains associated with the RNC that were no longer in use, but the information was outdated and wasn’t released. Additionally, it’s not completely clear why hackers were unable to get into the current RNC. The gist of Trump’s claim is correct, but it’s important to keep in mind that Russian hackers did access some Republican data, including the outdated RNC account. So we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jan/11/donald-trump/trump-says-russians-were-unable-hack-republican-na/

Facebook flagged the article as being potentially fake as part of its efforts to root out fake news on the website. This unpalatable tale certainly qualifies. The story, rife with odd punctuation and capitalization, claimed that an eatery called China Chow had been serving dogs slaughtered in the back of the restaurant as a special-order menu item for customers who asked for it. The article said police shut the restaurant down after a two-month investigation following a customer complaint, according to a faux department spokesman. For all the dog lovers out there, take heart that none of these things happened. A Coral Springs Police Department employee told PolitiFact that nothing about the story is true. Community Involvement Coordinator Lynne Martzall said there was no two-month investigation by the department, and the police spokesman named in the story is not a real person. Furthermore, there is no restaurant named China Chow in Coral Springs, and there is no Chinese restaurant at the intersection named in the fake story. (We did notice that there is a fictional Yelp profile of China Chow, but it only links back to the same story, published the same day on GummyPost.com.) After receiving complaints, the department had posted a message on its Facebook page in December to tell the public the story was totally contrived. Martzall said Facebook removed the post from the department’s page after police reported the story as fake.

In Russian hacking case, did Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman use 'password' as his password?
","The first question posed to Reince Priebus on the Jan. 8, 2017 edition of CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" was on what President-elect Donald Trump believes about Russian efforts to meddle in the presidential election. Priebus, the Wisconsinite who is chairman of the Republican National Committee and Trump’s pick for White House chief of staff, responded with a catchy claim. The reference was to the unauthorized release of thousands of emails of John Podesta, an Illinoisan who was chairman of the campaign of the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. ""The reason this particular hack was so large wasn’t necessarily because the effort was so great by the Russians. It was that it was so easy,"" he said. ""I mean, John Podesta’s password into his system -- do you know what his password was? Password."" Priebus didn’t offer any evidence to host John Dickerson and we didn’t hear back from Trump’s transition team or the Republican National Committee on our requests for information to back Priebus’ claim. But there doesn’t appear to be any evidence to support what he said. The hacking Here’s how the New York Times reported on what happened to Podesta: Russian hackers sent a ""phishing"" email -- which aims to get the recipient to click on a deceptive link that gives hackers access to their information -- to Podesta’s personal Google mail account in March 2016. The email said Podesta needed to change his password immediately in order to protect his account. Podesta correctly perceived that the email might be a hoax and sought advice from other campaign staffers. In a response, one campaign staffer meant to tell Podesta that the email was illegitimate, but wrote legitimate -- prompting Podesta to change his password. ""With another click,"" as the Times put it, ""a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account — a total of about 60,000 — were unlocked for the Russian hackers."" The trove amounted to what The Guardian called ""an unprecedented window into a presidential run."" Trump used the emails as fodder for attacks on Clinton -- a number of which PolitiFact National found to need context or misinterpreted what the emails actually showed. Podesta would later say that WikiLeaks began publishing his emails about an hour after the October 2016 release of an ""Access Hollywood"" tape that showed Trump making lewd comments about women during a 2005 interview. His claim was rated True by PolitiFact National. Now back to Priebus. Previous claim Two days before the Priebus interview, our partners at PunditFact rated as False a claim by Jesse Watters. He has a ""Watters World"" a segment that appears on Fox News Channel’s ""The O’Reilly Factor,"" which is hosted by conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly. Watters’ claim was essentially the same as Priebus'. He said Podesta’s email password was password, a claim that originated with WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange. Our colleagues found: → None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta’s email password. → Among the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta’s and others’ accounts, none have made similar claims.

→ Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn’t allow users to make their passwords password.

Jeff Sessions objected to immigrants in armed forces, Senator Durbin says
","Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., challenged fellow senator and nominee for U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over his lack of support for bills that would’ve helped immigrants in the country illegally during Sessions’ first confirmation hearing. ""Sen. Sessions, since joining the Senate in 1997, you've voted against every immigration bill that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented,"" Durbin said during the hearing Jan. 10. ""You described the DREAM Act, which I introduced 15 years ago to spare children who are undocumented through no fault of their own, as 'a reckless proposal for mass amnesty.' You opposed the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, which passed the Senate four years ago."" Durbin then spotlighted Sessions’ comments about immigrants in the military. ""You've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?',"" Durbin said. We wanted to know if that was Sessions’ position. Durbin was referring to a 2014 radio interview on the Lars Larson Show, a conservative talk radio program. Durbin quoted Sessions accurately, but it’s not clear from the quote he plucked that the discussion was about immigrants in the country illegally, not all immigrants. The Lars Larson Show On the show, Sessions raised concerns about ""immigration-type language"" being added to a defense authorization bill. Host Larson asked him about that language: ""Sen. Sessions, the essence of the idea is, we would say, if you are here in the United States illegally, if you go join the military and do some service, then we will give you permanent resident status to stay in the United States."" Sessions agreed on that assessment, but he said, ""The real issue would be to open it up to adding additional language."" The Alabama senator told Larson he had heard talks of reducing the Army by 100,000 or more soldiers, and that he didn’t think it was the right thing to do. Sessions brought up a news story about a ""native of Kenya"" who had been accused of demanding $50,000 from a local family to protect them from a hitman. The man was serving in the Navy and Sessions questioned how he had been able to get in. (The Kenyan man was found not guilty of the extortion charge in 2015.) ""So, I’m wondering could you get a good test score from his high school, could you get good grade point average from Kenya or wherever,"" Sessions said. ""I just think in terms of who’s going to be the most likely to be a spy: somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?"" Sessions added: ""We’re going in the wrong direction in a lot of ways. Our head isn’t thinking clearly. At a time when this country needs a good military, the last thing we need to be doing is turning out of our military of people who served and then bringing in people who are illegally in the country."" Sessions is initially asked about legislation that would allow ""Dreamers"" to serve, said Durbin spokesman Ben Marter, ""but then speaks at length about immigrants serving in the military and when he says this, he does not distinguish between legal and undocumented immigrants."" In the Senate confirmation hearing, Sessions didn’t directly address Durbin’s claim about him objecting to immigrants volunteering to serve in the armed forces. A spokeswoman for Sessions said the Republican senator ""has no problem"" with eligible immigrants serving in the military ""and as attorney general he will enforce and defend such laws as well."" ""Generally speaking, illegal aliens are not eligible to serve in the military. But regardless, the decision of whether to allow illegal aliens to serve in the military is up to Congress and not something that the attorney general controls,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. The secretary of defense has authorized immigrants approved for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to be considered for enlistment in the armed forces. Our ruling During Sessions’ Senate confirmation for attorney general, Durbin told him, ""You've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'"" In a 2014 radio interview, Sessions discusses immigrants in the military and raises concerns about a man from Kenya serving in the military, after allegations of the man trying to extort a local family. Sessions does question who’s more likely to be a spy -- somebody from Alabama or Kenya. The radio conversation includes comments about a subset of immigrants, people in the country illegally. With military reductions on the table, Sessions said ""the last thing we need"" is to get rid of people who have served in the military and bring in ""people who are illegally in the country.""

Full Flop: Dawnna Dukes sworn in after vowing to resign her Texas House seat
","Months ago, Dawnna Dukes declared that she’d resign her Texas House seat, effective Jan. 10, 2017. Yet on that date, the 11-term Austin Democrat, who's been under investigation for possibly using taxpayer resources for nongovernmental purposes, joined House colleagues in getting sworn in to serve  a fresh two-year term. Dukes represents House District 46, which extends from East Austin north into Pflugerville. Dukes’ actions prompted us to roll out the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Let’s recap: In 2013, Dukes sustained injuries in an automobile accident that she subsequently blamed for often missing House meetings. In two 2016 investigations, too, the Austin American-Statesman uncovered questionable expenses on Dukes’ campaign spending reports and revealed that she was absent from the Legislature for much of the 2015 session, even as she apparently attended several social events. The newspaper also found that Dukes’ consulting company and her subcontractors made more than $1 million over four years working to boost the number of minority- and women-owned companies working for the Austin school district, but had little to show for its work. Dukes then stressed persistent injuries and her desire to care for her daughter in initially telling the Quorum Report, a Capitol news organization, about her plans to resign. That report’s Sept. 26, 2016, story about Dukes’ plans quoted her as saying that multiple visits to the emergency room combined with a more serious evaluation of her condition from physicians had forced her to re-evaluate her situation. ""This has been a very difficult decision to make,"" Dukes said. ""However, in light of my ongoing health issues and concerns, I find that I can no longer provide the active, effective leadership that is needed to continue my sworn duties. I must take the time to focus all of my energy to heal and continue to provide for my young daughter and extended family."" Later that day, the Statesman noted in its news story on Dukes’plans that she’d been dogged by a criminal investigation into use of taxpayer resources for nongovernmental purposes. Her retirement announcement came days after the Texas Rangers delivered the findings of their probe to the Travis County district attorney’s office, which was reviewing the file, the story said. The story also said Dukes was ""allowing her current term to expire rather than resigning immediately, allowing her to make an extra $3,220 per year in retirement benefits from the state because serving any amount in January counts as a full year when calculating pension benefits."" Also noted: Dukes’ name would still appear on the November 2016 general election ballot. Without campaigning for the seat, Dukes went on to defeat her Republican opponent in the heavily Democratic district. Still, the expectation remained that the seat would become vacant starting Jan. 10, the first day of the 2017 regular legislative session, and remain vacant pending the results of a special election to be called by Gov. Greg Abbott. Next, though, the Statesman reported Jan. 7, 2017 that Dukes had notified the new Travis County district attorney, Margaret Moore, that she was no longer planning to step down. Three days later, about half an hour after the noon start of the 2017 session, Dukes joined colleagues in the House and was sworn in to serve a fresh two-year term. Earlier, Dukes explained her move in a Jan. 9, 2017, Facebook post, which she described as her replies to questions from the Texas Tribune, that after constituents urged her to reconsider her plans, her doctors ""gave me the green light and I decided to ensure District 46 had experienced representation starting on"" the session’s opening day. After her swearing-in, Dukes reaffirmed that explanation to reporters. She also declined to discuss the county's probe, saying, ""Anything concerning legal is in the process, or not, and I don’t plan on discussing it."" After we posted this story, Dukes responded to our earlier requests for comment on whether she'd flip-flopped by saying her late-breaking decision to fill the seat honored her longstanding commitment to voters who gave her the 2016 Democratic nomination before she announced her plan to resign the seat. Voters went on to re-elect her, Dukes stressed. Doctors gave her encouragement, Dukes reaffirmed by phone, and constituents ""talked me into keeping the promise to serve."" Asked if she plans not to resign at all, Dukes said she intends to serve ""as long as the people elect me."" Our ruling Summing up, Dukes said in September 2016 that she’d resign her seat in early 2017. On Jan. 10, 2017, however, she was sworn in to serve an additional two years representing the Austin-area district. We find this a FULL FLOP. Full Flop A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop. UPDATES, Jan. 10, 2017: This story was revised to clarify when the Statesman reported on possibly questionable uses of goverment resources. We also heard back from Dukes and added her elaboration about deciding to get sworn in. These revisions didn't affect our Flip-O-Meter rating. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43553e90-2b5d-4a23-a195-4a45f99271c0",/factchecks/2017/jan/10/dawnna-dukes/full-flop-dawnna-dukes-sworn-after-vowing-resign-h/

Mitch McConnell says 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether
","As congressional Republicans decide how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., published an op-ed on FoxNews.com titled, ""ObamaCare failed Americans. Now it's time for relief."" ""By nearly any measure, Obamacare has failed: It didn’t lower costs, it didn’t increase choice, middle-class families continue to lose health plans they were promised they could keep, and Americans continue to call for Obamacare’s repeal,"" McConnell wrote on Jan. 9. ""They spoke loudly again this November, and about 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether."" ""That doesn’t mean the law will end overnight,"" he continued. ""There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now."" What caught our eye in this passage was McConnell’s citation of the eight of 10 figure. When we took a closer look, we found a credible source for it, but also some missing context. Let’s take a closer look. Where the number comes from McConnell’s office pointed to a Nov. 28, 2016, news release by Gallup that summarized one of its periodic polls on health care. The headline was, ""Most Americans Want Changes to Affordable Care Act."" Gallup’s release goes on to say, ""Whatever the exact course of action that ensues once Trump and the new Congress take office, it is clear that about eight in 10 Americans favor changing the ACA significantly (43 percent) or replacing it altogether (37 percent)."" This data is based on a survey conducted on Nov. 9 to Nov. 13, 2016. ""The majority leader made an accurate statement that, according to Gallup, about 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether,"" said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. ""Given the myriad problems with the law and the impact on families, the poll was not a surprise."" An outside specialist in health policy and polling, Robert J. Blendon of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said McConnell has a good basis for supporting his claim, given Gallup’s framing of the results. ""For years, politicians have taken what's in Gallup releases,"" Blendon said. Why it can be misinterpreted McConnell has been careful in how he relates what Gallup wrote. But the statistic's usefulness for supporting his larger point -- that Obamacare should be repealed in the way he's proposing -- is not as clear. Reading his op-ed, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that 80 percent of Americans want to repeal the law. But that's not the case, according to the Gallup data. It’s true that only 14 percent of respondents said they would keep the law as is, and that’s less than the 37 percent who wanted to repeal the law entirely. However, a plurality of respondents -- 43 percent -- said they wanted to keep the law but make ""significant changes"" to it. Specifically, 28 percent said they approved of the law but wanted to see significant changes to it -- and this constituency included both people who generally approved of the law and those who generally disapproved of it. The inclusion of those who approve the law and want changes to it -- and who would be unlikely to be on board for a full repeal, as McConnell seeks -- is what inflates the number to 80 percent. Other recent surveys fill in some of the blanks about what these respondents might be thinking. An October 2016 survey by Harvard University’s Chan School and Politico gave respondents six options for handling the Affordable Care Act (not counting ""don’t know,"" which registered 10 percent). The first three categories include people who either support the law or think it should go even further than it does today: Replace with universal Medicare: 14 percent Expand the existing program: 8 percent Keep the law as is: 18 percent Collectively, then, 40 percent either support an even stronger law or keeping the law as is. The other three categories align more closely with McConnell’s opinion, and they add up to 50 percent. Replace with a tax credit program: 16 percent Scale back and give states control: 14 percent Repeal completely: 20 percent  The Politico-Harvard results broadly mirror other recent polls about repealing the Affordable Care Act. In general, more people favor a repeal than oppose one, but support levels for a repeal are in the 40 percent to 50 percent range, rather than the 80 percent range. For instance, a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll taken in mid December 2016 found that 49 percent favored repeal, 47 percent opposed repeal, and 4 percent were unsure or refused to answer. Our ruling McConnell wrote that ""Americans continue to call for Obamacare’s repeal. … About 8 out of 10 favor changing ObamaCare significantly or replacing it altogether."" McConnell has carefully worded a statistic from a credible source, the Gallup news release. However, it's worth remembering that a notable share of people whose favored ""significant"" changes to the law either want a single-payer plan or an even stronger Obamacare law -- two options that are off the table for McConnell.

Schumer: Trump and his HHS pick Tom Price at odds on Medicare
","Newly minted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted the incoming administration for already abandoning campaign pledges in an interview on MSNBC. For example, he pointed to Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Price, the guy from HHS, Donald Trump said when he campaigned he wouldn't cut Medicare and Social Security, but he turns around nominates as his HHS secretary, guy who made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid,"" Schumer said on Jan. 3’s Rachel Maddow Show (around the 14:10 mark). ""We’re going to slam him on these things."" Trump certainly promised to keep health care programs for seniors (Medicare) and the poor (Medicaid) intact and to protect Social Security (which doesn’t fall under HHS’ jurisdiction). But what about Schumer’s characterization of Price’s record on the health care programs? Price has supported reducing the government’s role in Medicare and Medicaid and reducing spending on the programs. That would be a major change of course from how the programs ran under the Obama administration.    Trump’s pledges Throughout the course of the 2016 election, Trump largely promised to protect or save Social Security and Medicare and instead to crack down on waste and fraud, with a few detours. Trump tweeted that he would leave all three safety nets intact in May 2015, a month before he made his official presidential announcement (in which he said the same thing). During the election, Trump continued to promise to protect Social Security and Medicare during debates, numerous campaign events, multiple interviews and campaign ads. He even seemed to suggest expanding Medicare or Medicaid in some instances and (falsely) accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to cut them. Post-election, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said Trump intends to keep those promises. Trump’s health care plan, released in March 2016, proposed to turn Medicaid into a ""block grant"" program but didn’t specify what that would look like. (Typically, block grants set a cap on the amount of federal funding to states for Medicaid instead of the current structure of the federal government matching state spending.) Price’s career A doctor and staunchly conservative policy wonk, Price has made health care one of his legislative priorities in his 20-year stint as a public servant. Price, who had his own orthopedic clinic in northern Atlanta, first ran for state office in 1996. During his time in the Georgia State Senate from 1997 to 2005, he sponsored legislation ""to increase patient choice, enact Medical Savings Accounts, and reform the Medicaid system,"" according to his Georgia legislature biography. In 2006, he ran for and won former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s old seat, spurred at least in part from outrage over the rising cost of malpractice insurance (tort reform is another pet issue of Price’s). Price has focused on reducing government oversight of health care and shifting to more private insurance. The first piece of legislation he introduced was a resolution ""recognizing the need to move the nation's current health care delivery system toward a defined contribution system,"" which would be a move away from employer-provided coverage as it exists today. He also sponsored bills to increase Medicare payments to doctors, allow doctors to enter into private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries and charge the program for their services,  and called for implementing cost-saving measures in Medicare and Medicaid. After Obama’s election, Price emerged as one of the leading opponents of the president’s signature Affordable Care Act. ""While the stated goal (of health care reform) remains noble, as a physician, I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government’s intrusion into medicine through Medicare,"" Price wrote in a 2009 column in Politico that advocated for ""a third way that puts patients in charge."" He has introduced a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare every legislative session since 2009. Price’s Empowering Patients First Act instead provides tax credits to help pay for private insurance plans and expands health savings accounts.    The Price plan also allows for people to opt out of Medicare and Medicaid (and other government-run health programs) and choose the tax credits to purchase private plans instead. It folds in his previous advocacy of private contracting between Medicare beneficiaries and doctors. Beyond his own proposals, Price supported Paul Ryan’s 2011 budget plan, which would have eventually moved Medicare toward private insurance by giving people under 55 voucher-like tax credits to purchase plans. This is also called premium support. When he became chairman of the House budget committee, Price was the primary author of a budget for fiscal year 2016  that included $900 billion in spending reductions to Medicaid (through block granting) and $148 billion to Medicare (by leaving the Obama administration’s cost-saving measures intact), according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Price’s budget for fiscal year 2017 similarly sought: $1 trillion from Medicaid and $449 billion from Medicare. After Trump’s election, Price expressed optimism that lawmakers could overhaul Medicare in 2017. Did Price cut Medicare, Medicaid? For all of Price’s efforts to change Medicare and Medicaid and reduce spending, nothing actually came to fruition. Whether Price’s supported policies amount to ""cutting"" the health program or making it more market-oriented is a matter of debate, though he clearly wants to reduce the government’s role in Medicare.   Schumer’s office pointed to Price’s comment on Medicare being government intrusion and his support for Medicare overhaul as evidence for Schumer’s claim. But a Trump transition team spokesman told us Price ""has long been a champion for strengthening Medicare for both current and future beneficiaries"" and believes that ""Medicaid provides a crucial safety-net for millions of Americans."" Experts, meanwhile, were divided over whether Price’s proposals amounted to ""cutting"" Medicare and Medicaid. The Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonpartisan health care advocacy group, typically doesn’t weigh in on cabinet appointments but opposes Price’s nomination precisely because of his position on Medicare, said David Lipschutz, the group’s senior policy attorney. ""The policies he has advocated would significantly cut and alter Medicare,"" Lipschutz told us, listing Price’s support for a premium support model, opposition to allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and advocating for private contracting between Medicare beneficiaries with physicians with Medicare footing the bill. Gail Wilensky, the former director at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, called Price’s comment on Medicare as government intrusion a ""gross exaggeration."" But Wilensky preferred to characterize Price as a supporter of Medicare reform. She added that like Price, she supports premium support as a model for Medicare reform, as do prominent Democrats Alice Rivlin, a health care policy expert who served under President Bill Clinton, and Bob Reischauer, a fellow at the left-leaning Urban Institute. Our ruling Schumer said, ""Donald Trump said when he campaigned he wouldn't cut Medicare and Social Security"" but his nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Services ""made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid."" Price, Trump’s HHS pick, has supported reducing the government’s role in Medicare and block granting Medicaid, which would amount to spending reductions to both programs. While it’s clear these proposals would reduce federal spending on the health safety nets, experts say it’s not the same thing as gutting the programs entirely. Trump did pledge to leave Medicare and Social Security alone, and Price’s positions seem at odds with that. (It’s worth noting that Social Security isn’t administered by HHS).

No, Trump never called departing Ghanaian president
","Globetrotting fake news aimed to parlay Donald Trump’s name into advertising clicks recently. A website called USA Radio crafted some imaginary thoughts from the incoming American president about the departing president of Ghana. Under the headline ""Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President,"" the faux article said, ""Talking to the New York Times, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa’s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country’s elections."" It then continued with this purported quote: ""As an outgoing president, you don’t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming president. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately."" Facebook users flagged this for vetting as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stymie fake news. Needless to say, there is no New York Times article quoting Trump as saying this, nor did a search of the Nexis news database uncover any time when Trump spoke about Ghana. A search of the ICANN Whois registry failed to identify the website's operator. Since the December elections in Ghana drew modest press coverage in the United States, a bit of background is in order. Ghana emerged from a military-controlled government in 1992 and since that time has established itself as a stable democracy. Residents of the West African nation went to the polls in early December 2016. Challenger Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President Mahama by a million votes. Akufo-Addo took office Jan. 7, 2017, making this the third peaceful handoff from one ruling party to another. Mahama’s administration was marred by charges of corruption, and frequent breakdowns of the electric grid that left homes and businesses in darkness. On top of that, Afrobarometer, an internationally backed public opinion project, found that more Ghanaians trusted Akufo-Addo's party to control inflation and boost jobs. The invented quote from Trump referred to Mahama’s post-election appointments for several key anti-corruption jobs in the government. The slots had been vacant for over a year and the move sparked pushback from some newly elected lawmakers. We reached out to the Trump transition team and did not hear back.

Fake news: First grandma Marian Robinson is not getting $160,000 annual pension
","With President Barack Obama and his family soon vacating the White House, several websites continue to spread a fake news story that says ""first grandma"" Marian Robinson will be getting a $160,000 annual pension after they move out. Bloggers on the websites USPostman.com and ENHLive.com both posted undated articles that said Robinson will get paid the money for ""services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver,"" meaning she watched granddaughters Sasha and Malia Obama. Facebook flagged the stories as part of its efforts to combat fake news. These stories lambast the Obamas for allegedly abusing their power and wasting taxpayer money by taking advantage of the pension. But there is no pension for the first grandma — the story is fake, and originated on a website known for trafficking in fabricated news. Robinson, a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to First Lady Michelle Obama and her brother Craig, doesn’t qualify for any kind of pension, because she’s never been a federal employee. She did move into the White House in 2009, and has helped raise her granddaughters. But she didn’t draw a salary and wasn’t on any kind of government payroll for doing that. There was no contact information for USPostman.com, and we received no response from ENHLive when we attempted to contact that site. But both articles mention elements found in an Oct. 17, 2016, article posted on the faux news site BostonTribune.com. That fake story said that an unspecified Freedom of Information Act request provided documentation that Robinson would be getting the lifetime payment. There’s no indication of what the request showed, or how they arrived at the $160,000 figure. The story also said she likely qualified under the Civil Service Retirement Act. That is a benefits program for federal employees that our colleagues at FactCheck.org note is only for workers who started service before 1987. It has since been replaced by the Federal Employees Retirement System. The false article makes oblique reference to the Former Presidents Act, which provides an annual pension for chief executives (plus Secret Service protection and some travel and transition expenses) after they leave office. For 2016 the pay level was $205,700, unless the former president holds an appointed or elected office in the federal government. And while presidential widows can qualify for $20,000 annual payments should their husbands die, there are no provisions to pay pensions to any other member of a former president’s family. The BostonTribune.com website doesn’t appear to be working as of this writing. It was run by Associated Media Coverage, another website that also ran fake news, including one about several states enacting a two-pet limit that we rated Pants On Fire! in the past. There’s no indication that the story is true, but other websites continue to cite it as fact in various vitriolic posts.
