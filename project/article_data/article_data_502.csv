Crist says Scott spent $800K on Governor's Mansion renovations
","Florida gubernatorial candidates are now taking shots at each other’s wallets in campaign commercials, with Democratic challenger Charlie Crist working overtime to get voters to realize that millionaire Gov. Rick Scott is, in fact, a millionaire. ""He flies on a private jet and owns an $11 million oceanfront home,"" an Oct. 24, 2014 ad says. ""Rick Scott is used to the finer things. Maybe that's why he spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion."" The commercial then repeats a lot of prior attacks about education spending. Meanwhile, we got to wondering whether Scott, who campaigned in 2010 on cutting government spending, spent $800,000 on his new home in Tallahassee after taking office. Ringing up the renovations As the basis for the claim, the Crist campaign sent us an Oct. 28, 2013, Associated Press story posted on CBS Miami’s website. That story said that more than $800,000 in renovations had occurred at the governor’s Greek Revival mansion at 700 N. Adams St. Those renovations included cleaning oriental rugs, refinishing wood floors, ""new wallpaper, pillows, furniture, drapes, paint, window repairs, new screens for the swimming pool and an upgraded kitchen,"" the story read. According to the story, the state spent almost $3 million on the property during Gov. Jeb Bush’s eight years in office, although a third of that money was for security upgrades after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The story said that during Crist’s four-year term from 2007-2011, the state spent a bit more than $27,000. The AP later corrected this amount to almost $443,000. Of the $800,000 the AP said was spent during Scott’s term, almost $600,000 was taxpayer money that went to grounds upkeep, the story said. More than $200,000 more was donated to the Governor’s Mansion Foundation by U.S. Sugar, Florida Crystals and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida. There were also $20,000 in gifts from lobbyist Brian Ballard, Scott adviser Tony Fabrizio and the CEO of a private prison company, George Zoley. That private money was used to pay for things like $38,000 in new rugs and $2,000 for a new mirror for First Lady Ann Scott, who had been an interior designer, the AP story said. For this fact-check, we won’t look at private donations, because Crist said ""your tax dollars."" The Scott campaign said the mansion has routinely been funded by both public and private money, and that the public money involved was used according to state law. It paid for things like code compliance in the kitchen, repairing safety hazards in public areas, electrical upgrades and plumbing repairs, spokesman Greg Blair said. We checked in with the Department of Management Services, the agency that handles expenses for upkeep. Spokesman Ben Wolf told us that the DMS has a budget for mansion projects, and periodic fixes are needed. He declined to be more specific for us. He did give us totals for renovations, maintenance and purchases made for the mansion’s improvements using public money, but we found some numbers were a bit different than what the AP reported in 2013. From January 1999 to December 2006, Jeb Bush’s terms in office, the total was $2.87 million, including post-Sept. 11 security upgrades such as buying surrounding property and putting up barriers. The total from Crist’s term, January 2007 to December 2010, was almost $443,000, including almost $254,000 for heating and cooling ductwork and $102,000 for the design and installation of a ""fuel cell"" designed to cut emissions and power use. Adding in miscellaneous purchases like tools, supplies, building materials, freight and so on, the total went up to almost $628,000. As for Scott, the DMS disclosure said a little more than $499,000 had been spent for the things Blair claimed. Although that measured more than just 2011, that year is when the bulk of the expenses were incurred. (We’ll also note that more than $10,000 in tax money was spent on cabana repairs.) Add in other expenditures, as we did with Crist and Bush, and the grand total from January 2011 to the present is almost $745,000.   In 2013, the Department of Management Services said the agency had reviewed the mansion and decided it needed some freshening, without Scott’s input. Scott’s office said then that neither the governor nor the first lady asked for the changes, but the AP reported that May 2011 meeting minutes from a Governor’s Mansion Committee gathering showed Ann Scott had mentioned the house’s condition. ""It’s important to me to maintain its beauty and showcase its history, making the mansion a welcome destination for all guests,"" she said. We also tried contacting mansion curator Carol Beck several times, but never heard back. She was quoted in the AP story as saying Department of Management Services officials ""have been exceptionally proactive in addressing concerns of the first lady and myself as it relates to the current condition of the interior and exterior of the mansion proper, as well as the grounds."" This wasn’t the only time spending on the manse has been an issue. In 2011 and 2012, staffers were instructed to use private phone lines and email accounts while working to find about $5 million in public and private money to buy commercial property around the mansion and turn it into a public space. Our ruling Crist said Scott ""spent $800,000 of your tax dollars upgrading the Governor's Mansion."" When we checked with the agency in charge what the totals were, it said almost $745,000 in taxpayer money had been spent during Scott’s term. So the amount of tax money spent on renovations at the mansion is close. However, the ad is trying to make it sound like Scott was being wasteful, and that's not as clear. The Crist and Bush administrations also spent large sums on expensive renovations, and the money doesn't appear to have come from a direct request from Scott (although the Scotts did accept donations to spruce up the mansion). We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/31/charlie-crist/crist-says-scott-spent-800k-governors-mansion-reno/

Rove PAC says Obamacare cuts $1,700 from Medicare benefits in California
","Even though Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., wasn’t in office when Obamacare passed, a pro-Republican ad in California’s seventh congressional district is using the law to attack him. Bera is running against Republican Doug Ose for a second term, and it’s a tight race. Less than six months into his first term, Bera voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act, and American Crossroads, Karl Rove’s conservative political action committee, used this fact to appeal to California seniors in a recent ad. ""Bera voted to keep Obamacare, which cut $716 billion from Medicare, slashing Medicare Advantage,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Now California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700."" Many times, we’ve rated the claim that there are $716 billion in Medicare cuts as Half True. But we hadn’t heard claims about specific benefit cuts by state before, so we decided to check it out. We found that the claim that California seniors will see $1,700 in benefit cuts as a result of the Affordable Care Act is misleading. The statistic comes from a report that ignores critical context and evidence that the law has expanded Medicare’s benefits packages. Advantages We should first note that the statistic comes from an April 2014 report by the American Action Forum, and they have a stake in the election. The American Action Forum is an arm of the American Action Network, which is a conservative political nonprofit with financial ties to the Koch brothers. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the group shares office space with American Crossroads -- the group that produced the very ad we’re checking. Now to the claim. The ad makes it sound like all California seniors will face cuts to this degree. However, the report only addresses Medicare Advantage. About one-third of seniors use Medicare Advantage, which is a private coverage option. Medicare Advantage plans are required to provide at minimum the same array of benefits as traditional Medicare. Many Advantage plans offer extra benefits -- things like gym memberships, vision exams or generous cost-sharing -- that have contributed to escalating program costs. The creators of Medicare Advantage thought that letting seniors choose plans from private insurance providers would be more cost-effective than traditional Medicare. But Advantage has turned out to be more expensive. Medicare paid insurers about 114 percent more for Advantage plans than for traditional plans, as of 2009 before enactment of the federal health care law. The law attempted to close that gap in part by gradually reducing how much Medicare pays Advantage plan providers. It was estimated that its changes would slow down spending on Medicare by about $716 billion over 10 years, and Medicare Advantage cost-saving measures accounted for about one-third of that. (Though the Obama administration has reversed these cuts for the past two years -- facing pressure from insurance providers, Republicans and some Democrats, including Bera.) Critics argue that the cuts will force insurance providers to reduce the benefits they offer to Medicare Advantage enrollees. However, Medicare Advantage plans are still required to offer, at minimum, the same level of benefits as traditional plans. And Obamacare includes language protecting that set of guaranteed benefits from shrinking. In fact, the law expanded Medicare’s required benefits to include certain preventative services, annual visits, closing a gap in prescription coverage and more. Additionally, the law rewards Medicare Advantage providers with financial bonuses to encourage quality and cost-efficiency. Providers are required to use the bonuses to offer extra benefits, attracting more enrollees. Nearly all Medicare Advantage plan providers received these bonuses in 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A matter of speculation It’s possible that Medicare Advantage providers could respond to their pay cut by reducing benefits, but the only benefits they could cut would be those extra benefits that go beyond Medicare plan requirements. ""It's not automatic and won't affect every (Advantage) enrollee or any of the (traditional Medicare) enrollees,"" said Dylan Roby, an expert in health economics at the University of California Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research. Insurance providers could also  respond to lower payments by offering the same benefits while operating more efficiently. They could cut administrative costs, adjust cost-sharing plans, take in less profit or drop out of the market altogether. But, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Department of Health and Human Services and more, insurance providers’ response to the cuts has been less dramatic than was expected when Obama signed the legislation in 2010. In fact, Medicare Advantage enrollment is at an all-time high, and the percentage of plans with four or more stars in the program’s five-star rating system is increasing. ""When Congress debated the payment reductions in 2010, forecasters and analysts also projected that reductions would drive insurers to raise premiums, cut extra benefits and even pull out of the Medicare Advantage market,"" Kaiser experts wrote in May. ""Thus far, however, the response by insurers to the (Affordable Care Act) cuts has been more muted."" Health and Human Services reported in fall 2013 that ""The average number of plan choices will remain about the same in 2014 and access to supplemental benefits remains stable.  Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, average MA premiums are down by 9.8 percent."" Experts also told us that they haven’t seen evidence of reduced Medicare Advantage cuts. ""The evidence is that plan participation has been stable, premiums have been stable or even a little bit lower, and there are no overall changes in the benefits provided,"" said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University and a member of the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. ""In my view, the claims in this advertisement are misleading,"" Hoadley added. ""Seniors have not faced benefit cuts in Medicare Advantage, even though the plans (and providers) have to manage with somewhat lower payments."" So how did the American Action forum report come up with their estimated benefit cut figures? The American Action Forum report breaks down the reduction in Medicare payments to Advantage plan providers by state and county. It says, compared to pre-Obamacare, Medicare Advantage benefits in California are down $1,718 per beneficiary. We asked several experts to take a look at the report, and they told us that it is misleading because it assumes that Obamacare’s spending reductions directly results in reduced benefits. Yes, Obamacare reduces Medicare’s spending per Advantage beneficiary, but this does not necessarily mean fewer benefits for seniors with Advantage plans. Like we said before, there are multiple ways that an insurance provider can deal with the spending cuts other than slimming down its offerings. ""To immediately treat it as a cut to benefits is an exaggeration,"" said Judith Feder, a professor of health policy at Georgetown University. Our ruling American Crossroads said that as a result of Obamacare, ""California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700."" First of all, this claim is misleading because it makes it seem like all seniors will face these cuts, when the statistic actually refers to Medicare Advantage enrollees -- only about one-third of seniors. The statistic comes from a report that assumes all reductions in Medicare Advantage spending results in fewer benefits for enrollees. While insurance providers feel the cuts, there are multiple ways for them to respond other than reducing benefits, such as trimming administrative costs. We heard from multiple experts and researchers who said Medicare Advantage benefits have remained stable. The ad also leaves out the fact that the federal health care law expanded Medicare’s minimum required benefits and established incentives for Advantage plans to provide extra benefits. It’s possible that some Medicare Advantage enrollees could see their benefits shrink, but this ad blows that possibility out of proportion and ignores important context. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/31/american-crossroads/rove-pac-says-obamacare-cuts-1700-medicare-benefit/

Wisconsin Republicans repealed an equal pay law that protected women, Barack Obama says
","Seeking to boost voter turnout among Democrats, President Barack Obama campaigned for Wisconsin gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke one week before the November election. At one point during his Oct. 28, 2014, appearance at Milwaukee’s North Division High School, Obama focused his remarks on women. And without mentioning Gov. Scott Walker by name, the president made a claim about equal pay and Republicans that we want to check. ""We believe that America is stronger when women are full and equal participants in the economy,"" Obama said, according to a transcript from The White House. ""In 2012, Republicans here in Wisconsin repealed a statewide fair-pay law. Now think about that.  Just like I don’t understand why somebody would be against somebody having health insurance, I don’t understand -- why would you want to repeal a law to make sure women are treated fairly on the job?  That’s your platform?  That’s your agenda?  Earlier this year -- it don’t make no sense."" So, Obama's claim is that Wisconsin Republicans ""repealed a statewide fair-pay law"" that made ""sure women are treated fairly on the job."" That’s similar to a statement made by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee in a TV ad attacking Walker. Let’s check what the president said. Previous factcheck We covered much of this ground when Burke claimed that Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law left Wisconsin as one of five states ""without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck."" We rated her claim -- which goes much further than Obama’s -- as False. Here’s what we found: The law Obama alluded to was the Equal Pay Enforcement Act. It was adopted in 2009 when Democrats controlled state government, then repealed in 2012 after Walker was elected and his fellow Republicans won the majority in the Legislature. The 2009 law allowed equal-pay claims to be filed as lawsuits in state court (such suits in federal court were already allowed and continue to be). That meant women claiming pay discrimination could potentially collect more money -- compensatory and punitive damages -- through state court, which some employee attorneys contend is easier and less expensive than suing in federal court. Previously, at the state level, they could only file a complaint with a state agency and potentially collect back wages and legal expenses. That approach remains. So, Obama is correct that Republicans repealed a fair-pay law. And that law was aimed at ensuring that women were treated fairly on the job. But Obama's claim could leave the impression that the repeal meant Wisconsin had no equal-pay law, when in fact it still does. Unaffected by the Republicans' repeal is the state's Fair Employment Act, which has been in place since 1982. It explicitly prohibits gender-based employment discrimination ""in promotion (and) compensation paid for equal or substantially similar work."" It allows people who believe they’ve faced pay discrimination to seek back wages and legal fees -- smaller damages than they might get in state court -- from their employers through a state administrative hearing process. And there is also the option to sue in federal court. Our rating Obama said Wisconsin Republicans ""repealed a statewide fair-pay law"" that made ""sure women are treated fairly on the job."" Walker and the GOP-led Legislature did repeal an law that provided more assurance -- through stiffer penalties against employers available in state court -- that women are treated fairly. But there is still a state law that allows women to win smaller damages for unequal pay through an administrative hearing process. For a statement that is accurate but needs more information, our rating is Mostly True.

Allan Fung says Gina Raimondo paid ‘millionaire hedge fund managers’ $70 million in taxpayer money
","In the race for Rhode Island governor, Republican Allan Fung is airing a TV commercial that questions the allegiance of his Democratic rival Gina Raimondo. ""Who does she serve?"" the commercial asks. Wall Street, if you believe what it goes on to say. The commercial cites contributions Raimondo received from donors in the financial services industry  and also says she used state pension money to invest heavily -- and the commercial suggests, unwisely -- in hedge funds. ""She paid 70 million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers,"" the commercial states. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the decision by the State Investment Commission, which is chaired by Raimondo, to increase investments in hedge funds. Critics note the high fees charged by those funds -- management fees of 1 percent to 2.5 percent of investments and performance fees of 17.5 percent to 25 percent of profits -- in questioning the move. But Raimondo says those fees are justified because the pension fund’s portfolio is more diversified and less exposed to risk. Because it has become such a charged issue, we thought it was important to check the numbers in the Fung commercial. The ad cites a Providence Journal story from Aug. 25, 2013 as the source of the claim. We couldn’t find a story about investment fees from that date, but we did find one that was published on providencejournal.com on Sept. 25, 2013 and in the next day’s newspaper. That story reported that the state pension fund earned about $780 million in investment returns in the 2013 fiscal year after paying about $70 million in fees. Those fees were divided between management fees, which totaled about $36 million, and performance fees, which totaled about $34 million, according to the story. The story did not break down the fees that were paid to the different types of funds in which the state invests. This is an important point, because the state invests only a small portion of the $8 billion in pension money in hedge funds. Investments are divided between cash, bonds, real estate, private companies, publicly traded companies and other areas. Currently, 14.7 percent of the pension money is invested in hedge funds, according to the General Treasurer’s office. Fees are paid on all those investments. So how much was paid to hedge funds? We looked at the expense analysis for the 2013 fiscal year, which is available on the website for the General Treasurer. According to the document, the state paid $69.1 million in investment fees that year. Of that amount, $24.8 million went to equity hedge funds and $20.6 million went to absolute return hedge funds -- for a total of $45.4 million -- $25 million less than the number cited in the Fung commercial. That figure, or one very close to it, has been published by the media on numerous occasions. The first report we could find that included it was a June 2013 PolitiFact Rhode Island item. Since then, it has been cited in The Journal in at least five separate stories in 2013 and 2014. The fees for the 2013 fiscal year were made public more than a year ago. We were curious when numbers for the 2014 fiscal year, which ended June 30, would be available. The Treasurer’s office told us that they wouldn’t be ready until the end of the year. When the ""Friend of Wall Street"" commercial first aired, The Journal asked the Fung campaign about the $70-million figure. Spokesman Robert Coupe was quoted in an Oct. 10 story saying that the ad ""faults Raimondo for paying $70 million in fees associated with alternative investments just in fiscal year 2013."" When we asked Coupe about the figure this week, he said that it’s actually a sum of the $45 million paid in hedge fund fees for fiscal 2013 and an unspecified estimate for fiscal 2014. ""Looking at the history of the pension fund and the information known about the rates of return and fee calculations, a conservative estimate of the total fees paid is equal to or exceeds the $70 million claim in the ad,"" he told us. Our ruling A TV commercial for Allan Fung says that Gina Raimondo paid $70 million in taxpayer money to cover fees to hedge fund managers. The commercial incorrectly cites an Aug. 25,  2013 Journal story as its source. But a raft of other Journal stories do give the exact figure -- about $45 million -- as does the website for the General Treasurer’s office. Fung’s campaign now insists that the figure they quoted is not just for fiscal 2013. They’re also assuming an equal amount or more will be paid in fiscal 2014. The commercial doesn’t say that, but that may be reasonable over the longer haul. If the 2014 fees are as much as they were in 2013, the two-year total would easily reach $70 million. (And even though the Fung campaign didn’t mention it, let’s not forget the $16 million paid in hedge fund fees in fiscal 2012.) But by citing only a 2013 Journal story, the ad implies that the fees were paid only in 2013. Finally, the commercial’s claim that Raimondo herself paid taxpayer money to hedge fund managers is misleading at best. Raimondo has recommended increasing hedge fund investments, but she is not solely responsible for how the state invests its pension fund. The 10-member State Investment Commission, of which she is the chairwoman, makes all decisions. Because the statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, we rule it Mostly False.

Ad about Deal and scholarship Mostly True
","Former Democratic Gov. Zell Miller has had at least a small role in this year’s two biggest elections: the race for U.S. senator and governor. First, Miller endorsed Democrat Michelle Nunn over Republican businessman David Perdue for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat. Then he came out for Republican Gov. Nathan Deal in his close race against state Sen. Jason Carter. In campaign ads currently airing in the Atlanta television market, Miller gives Deal credit for saving Georgia’s lottery-funded HOPE scholarship, arguably the most popular state program ever created. ""HOPE was a big achievement for Georgia,"" Miller says in the ad. ""But when it ran into trouble and headed for bankruptcy, Nathan Deal rose to the challenge. Now, thanks to Nathan, HOPE is available for the next generation."" Those are strong words from Miller, considered the founder of HOPE. PolitiFact decided to take a closer look. First, a little background on the merit-based scholarship program that inspired a federal tax credit and persuaded more than a dozen states to start their own lotteries and scholarship programs. In 1991, newly elected Gov. Zell Miller proposed legislation calling for a constitutional amendment to create a state lottery. Voters approved the amendment a year later, funding three distinct programs: the HOPE scholarship; universal voluntary pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds; and instructional technology. That third program was later abandoned. The first HOPE scholarship was awarded in 1993, and by 2010, more than $5.2 billion in scholarships and grants had been awarded to more than 2.9 million students attending Georgia colleges, universities and technical colleges. The popular program was simple: earn and keep a 3.0 grade-point average and receive free tuition to a public college. But Deal and lawmakers were presented with a dire forecast heading into the 2011 General Assembly session, Deal’s first as governor. If changes weren’t made to HOPE and pre-k by the fiscal year that started July 2012, all the lottery’s reserves would be depleted. Some of the needs of pre-k and HOPE also would not be met, lawmakers were told. Deal led the revamp effort. He included some Democratic ideas in the final bill. For instance, House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams pushed for, and won, retaining $13 million in the program to cover technical college students taking remedial classes. Her negotiations with Deal also kept grants for 5,000 students to continue at proprietary schools such as DeVry – and met some pushback from Democrats angry at her cooperation. But Abrams gave a rare impassioned speech during the House floor vote, noting the program remained a way to invest in Georgia students and included both political parties’ priorities. She stood next to Deal as he signed what would be the signature legislation of his first year as governor. The biggest change to emerge: students with a 3.0 grade-point average would no longer receive a full college scholarship. Those would be reserved for about 10 percent of students -- valedictorians, salutatorians and those with at least a 3.7 GPA and a combined 1200 on the math and reading sections of the SAT. These students, now known as Zell Miller scholars, also would be required to maintain a 3.3 GPA in college to keep the full scholarship. Other major changes eliminated the automatic increases in scholarship awards to match tuition increases and raised the GPA for technical school grants from 2.0 to 3.0. Renewed criticism of the changes came the following year, when almost 9,000 students lost the technical school grants because they couldn’t meet the higher academic standards. Thousands more did not enroll because they couldn’t afford to pay what HOPE no longer covered, according to the commissioner of the state’s technical college system. By 2013, lawmakers reverted to the 2.0 GPA for technical college students, who tend to be older and work full time while attending school. Carter, this year’s Democratic nominee for governor, was among those who didn’t agree with the changes that were made. Carter and Senate Democrats favored a $140,000 family income cap, a proposal GOP leaders dismissed as fiscally impractical. Carter has maintained his criticism of Deal on HOPE during this year’s campaign, saying the governor’s to blame for tens of thousands of students no longer receiving HOPE. Earlier this year, the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute issued a report showing that the post-2011 scholarship program, which some have dubbed ""HOPE Lite,"" continues to pay less and less of the costs of attending college. At Georgia Tech, for example, a HOPE scholarship that once covered all tuition and mandatory fees, plus a book allowance, now covers 59 percent of tuition costs. At the University of Georgia, a scholarship pays 62 percent of tuition costs, the researchers found. The number of HOPE recipients dropped from about 250,000 in 2010-2011 to about 200,000 in 2013-2014, and scholarship and grant awards in that period were down about $215 million, from $747.6 million to $532.9 million, according to the Georgia Student Finance Commission’s website. We tried to get Miller’s take on those major changes but could not reach him. But when our colleague at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Janel Davis, spoke with him a week ago, he said Deal was true to his goal for HOPE. ""He held to that original thinking of mine that it was for the best students, not the best students who might have low-income families, but just the best students period,"" Miller said. ""I still think it serves a wonderful purpose, and that’s to give students an incentive to do well."" Our ruling With bipartisan backing from the General Assembly, Deal made changes that eased financial pressures on the popular HOPE scholarship. But the program also changed significantly. The program is still making higher education more affordable for many students. But now, only about 10 percent of HOPE recipients receive scholarships that cover 100 percent of their tuition costs. You could make the argument that Miller makes here: Deal -- with a little help -- saved the HOPE scholarship. But Miller’s declaration needs a bit of context to be fully understood. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/31/zell-miller/Ad-about-Deal-and-scholarship-Mostly-True/

Republicans are trying to impeach Barack Obama, civil rights group says
","In a last-ditch effort to mobilize voters before Election Day, Democrats and their supporters are warning that Republicans will try to impeach President Barack Obama if the GOP wins the Senate. On Oct. 28, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., wrote a fundraising letter for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee claiming that a ""Republican House and Senate could go beyond shutting down the government — they could waste months of our lives on impeachment."" In the South, a New York Times story noted the progressive civil rights group Color of Change echoed similar sentiments in a racially charged message aimed at minority voters. The organization took the sentiment a step further, saying Republicans are actually moving on impeachment. ""Enough! Republicans are targeting our kids, silencing our voices and even trying to impeach our president,"" a flyer the group sent out in Arkansas said. Color of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson defended the flyer in a statement to PolitiFact: ""Republican leadership has shown an inability to contain the more fervent wing of the party that could never accept the idea of a black president."" The impeachment card has proven to be effective for Democratic fundraising in the summer. But is it accurate that Republicans are trying to impeach Obama? There are no official efforts to impeach him and the prospects for impeachment, no matter what happens Tuesday, are very, very dim. However, you can find examples of a number of Republicans talking about it anyway. Understanding impeachment There’s a high bar for impeachment outlined in the Constitution. It’s defined as the act of accusing a nonmilitary federal officer of  ""treason, bribery, high crimes (or) misdemeanors.""  The process must begin in the House with the articles of impeachment, i.e. the allegations. The articles require a simple majority to pass. After the House votes on impeachment, the Senate tries the case, hearing testimony and examining evidence, and then it votes. Conviction, which results in removal from office, requires support from two-thirds of the Senate. The House has initiated 60 impeachments in its history, according to the House archives, though only twice has it impeached a president: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was removed from office because their cases did not receive enough ""guilty"" votes to account for two-thirds of the Senate. We looked at all bills for this Congress and found no member of the House has introduced legislation to initiate impeachment proceedings against Obama. It's worth noting that Republicans have controlled the House since 2011, meaning they've had the numbers to impeach Obama for three years, and no official effort has emerged. If they had attempted impeachment, the Democrat-controlled Senate would almost certainly not have voted to convict Obama. And even if Republicans do well in the elections Tuesday, the rosiest projections would put them well short of the two-thirds vote needed in the Senate to remove Obama from office without Democratic support. Republican leadership In order for impeachment to be a real possibility, it would need support from Republican leaders for the articles of impeachment to get considered — but this support just doesn’t exist. Neither House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell nor Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus have called for impeachment. Boehner has been the most outspoken against impeachment, possibly because the process begins in his chamber. At a July 29 press conference, Boehner said the threat of impeachment was a ""scam"" launched by Democrats to rally their base. ""We have no plans to impeach the president,"" he said. ""We have no future plans.""   On Oct. 30, spokesman Kevin Smith told PolitiFact, ""Boehner has taken impeachment off the table. His stance hasn’t changed."" (Boehner has, though, started the process of suing the president over implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but those plans seem to have been put on hold.) Throughout June and July, other prominent establishment Republicans and potential 2016 presidential contenders — such as Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida — spoke out against impeachment. In some cases, Republicans seem to think that impeachment might backfire; it’s widely thought that voters punished Republicans at the ballot box in the 1998 elections for impeaching Clinton. In other cases, Republicans seem to be rejecting the idea of impeachment on the merits. Obama’s actions, while disagreeable to Republicans, have not amounted to an impeachable offense — they do not ""rise to the high crime and misdemeanor level"" — Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said at a Christian Science Monitor event. The list of Republicans cautioning against impeachment proceedings also includes some strong conservatives, like Reps. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Raul Labrador of Idaho — who said Republicans shouldn't ""even be talking about impeachment at this time."" Republicans for impeachment That is not to say some Republicans have not discussed impeachment. There are Republicans in strong, red districts who said they favor impeachment and others who say it should be an option. We found about a dozen instances where lawmakers said they are receptive to impeaching Obama. Causes for consideration ranged from the attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi to fears of unilateral executive action on immigration. In May 2013, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said impeachment was ""certainly a possibility"" and he was ""not taking it off the table."" Around the same time, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., not-so-subtly hinted, ""People may be starting to use the I-word before too long,"" while Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said that ""there isn’t a weekend that hasn’t gone by that someone says to me, ‘Michele, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren’t you impeaching the president?’"" Others are more blunt. Reps. Kerry Bentivolio, R-Mich.; Steve Stockman, R-Texas; Paul Brown, R-Ga.; and Randy Weber, R-Texas, all said Obama deserves to be impeached. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said impeachment may be necessary but for political purposes consideration should wait until after the November election. Often, the notion of impeachment is raised as a threat if Obama takes certain actions. For example, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, warned in July, ""If the president (enacts more executive actions on immigration), we need to bring impeachment hearings immediately before the House of Representatives."" In June, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cautioned that if Obama released prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, ""There will be people on our side calling for his impeachment."" These threats sometimes take the form of legislation. Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., filed a resolution when Obama was weighing military action in Syria that said if a president uses military force without congressional approval it ""constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor."" Brooks of Alabama authored a bill that would make it impeachable for a president to fail to prevent a fiscal deficit. Impeachment on the campaign trail During the 2014 campaign season, particularly in contested Republican primaries, how a candidate came down on the question of impeachment has at times become a litmus test for their conservative bona fides. Joni Ernst, now the GOP candidate for Senate in Iowa, was pressed on impeachment during a January candidate forum, according to Yahoo! News. Ernst said Obama should face ""repercussions"" for his (later deemed unlawful) recess appointments, ""whether that's removal from office, whether that's impeachment."" Similarly, Ryan Zinke, the Republican nominee for Montana’s at-large House seat, was pressed by a primary opponent on whether he would support impeachment. Zinke said he would. ""So is impeachment in the cards? Let's hope we have the votes,"" he said. This is partly pushed by sentiments among many self-identified Republican voters, who at last tally were supportive of impeachment. According to a July CNN poll, 57 percent of Republicans backed impeachment. Overall, 33 percent of Americans favored impeachment, a number in line with polls from 1998 and 2006 when presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively, were two years into their second terms. Our ruling A civil rights group mailer said Republicans are ""trying to impeach our president."" No members of the current Congress have introduced legislation to impeach Obama, and Republican Party leaders have shut down the possibility. Some Congressional Republicans and candidates have called for Obama’s impeachment. But most of that rhetoric has been isolated to a few members of the party rather than a resounding chorus.

"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Dennis Richardson']","
Are Oregonians earning less now than when John Kitzhaber was first elected? PolitiFact Oregon
","Rep. Dennis Richardson, in his bid to unseat Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber in Tuesday’s election, has made repeated claims that the state is worse off now than when Kitzhaber was elected in 1994 to his first term. With Kitzhaber seeking what would be an unprecedented fourth term, Richardson, a Republican from Central Point, is urging voters to consider what he calls the Democratic incumbent’s many failures. The claim: During a televised debate before the City Club of Portland on Oct. 10, 2014, Richardson said Oregon’s economy has amounted to one long slump during Kitzhaber’s time in office, especially when it comes to wages. ""Women and men both are making less when you adjust for inflation than when he started,"" Richardson said. Are working Oregonians really earning less today than they were in 1995? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We left telephone and email messages with Richardson’s campaign seeking a source for the claim but didn’t hear back prior to our deadline. We did receive an email from the campaign subsequently and have included its response below. Next we emailed Nick Beleiciks, an employment economist with the Oregon Employment Department. In a return email, he noted that there is ""more than one source for this sort of information and multiple acceptable ways to adjust for inflation."" Beleiciks pointed us to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. He used those two sources to compile a list of the annual average monthly earnings of men and women working in Oregon between 1995 and 2013. Included in this category are full-time and part-time workers covered by Oregon’s unemployment insurance program, Beleiciks wrote. That includes just about everyone except federal employees, the self-employed, some agricultural workers, some students and other jobs not covered by unemployment insurance. Since Richardson’s claim hinged partly on adjusting wages for inflation, we asked Beleiciks about that, as well. He said three ways are used most often to accomplish this -- an all city average Consumer Price Index for all consumers (the most common); the Portland-Salem area CPI index for all consumers; and the Portland-Salem area CPI index for wage earners and clerical workers. All showed that both men and women working in 2013 -- the most recent year for which statistics are available -- made more money than their counterparts in 1995. Women, in fact, have seen larger earnings gains than men. A woman working in 1995, for instance, made an average of $2,328 a month using the most common way to adjust for inflation. The same woman in 2013 earned $2,853, a gain of $525 per month. A man, using the same adjustment made $3,883 a month in 1995 compared with $4,207 in 2013. That’s a monthly increase of $324. The other two methods yielded similar increases. Richardson’s campaign, in a subsequent email, provided U.S. Census Bureau data showing the Oregon median household income for 1995 as $36,374. The same table for 2013 shows it at $50,036. Using an automatic Inflation Calculator, the campaign contended that the latter figure would have to be six percent higher to remain even for inflation. We ran those numbers past Beleiciks. The $36,374 figure, he said, is based on the Current Population Survey using data for a single year. He noted that the Census publishes both a not-adjusted estimate (in current dollars) and an inflation-adjusted estimate (using 2013 dollars). The inflation adjusted figures he came up with were %55,375 for 1995 and $56,307 for 2013. ""So the U.S. Census Bureau’s inflation-adjusted estimate of median household income in Oregon increased by $1,100 from 1995 to 2013."" It didn’t, in other words, change the final result. The ruling: Richardson, in criticizing Kitzhaber’s years as governor, claimed that men and women working in Oregon nearly 20 years ago made more then than they do now adjusted for inflation. The Richardson campaign did get back to us but, regardless, the information it provided doesn't hold up. Data from the two federal agencies and the state Employment Department show that both genders make more today, when their wages are adjusted for inflation, than they did when Kitzhaber was first elected in 1995.

Megyn Kelly's errant claim about Colorado voters printing out ballots from home
","Fox News host Megyn Kelly began a recent show with explosive news out of Colorado, where she said ""a new law has opened the door to possible voter fraud"" just weeks before voters decide a crucial U.S. Senate race. Before you can say yikes, there’s more. This law, Kelly said, ""literally allows residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to ‘collectors’ in what appears to be an effort to do away with traditional polling places."" ""What could go wrong?"" Kelly asked before bringing on special guests Michelle Malkin and Citizens United president David Bossie to discuss their conservative documentary Rocky Mountain Heist, which details how the state turned from red to blue. In the days that followed, Colorado-based TV stations as well as The Rachel Maddow Show said Kelly’s segment was misleading and wrong. A reader asked for our take. In 2013, Colorado enacted a law (HB 1303) that moved the state to an ""all-mail"" absentee voting system, among other changes. Every active voter gets a ballot sent to his or her residence, and they can choose to mail it in by Election Day or turn it into a county clerk’s office. They can also still vote in person at a voting service and polling center. We repeat, the ballot is mailed to them -- they don’t print it out. Voters can also give their ballot to someone they trust to turn in for them -- what Kelly refers to as a ""collector."" That person is not allowed to turn in more than 10 ballots. The Colorado law, championed by Democrats and signed into law by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, also authorizes same-day voter registration. Meanwhile, military or overseas Colorado voters have access to an online ballot they can fill out and send back to county elections clerks via email, fax or mail. Some military personnel who reside within the United States, or even station within Colorado, also have this option, said Rich Coolidge, Colorado Department of State spokesman. This was not a new change ushered in by HB 1303. But everyone else is on the normal mail-in system, which also exists in Oregon and Washington state. Kelly addressed the criticism about her original comments during her Oct. 27 show: ""Last week, we said the new law also allows all voters to print out their ballots at home,"" she said. ""That actually is not the case. Members of the military and some others, like Coloradans overseas, can indeed print out their ballots at home, but this is the case even before the new law passed."" Our ruling In a recent segment, Kelly went after a new Colorado law that raises fears of voter fraud for allowing ""residents to print ballots from their home computers, then encourages them to turn ballots over to ‘collectors.’"" That’s wrong, a fact Kelly later admitted. The big change in Colorado with the 2014 midterm elections is a universal mail-in system for active, registered voters. Those ballots are mailed to voters; voters do not print them out. The only people who have access to an online system are members of the military and Coloradoans who live overseas, and that system predates the most recent law.

Mary Burke says U.S. added jobs at twice Wisconsin's rate
","Introducing President Barack Obama in Milwaukee, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke touted economic growth nationwide when compared to that in Wisconsin under Gov. Scott Walker: ""The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker."" Asked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at ""nearly twice the rate"" of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying ""two times the rate."" Burke’s phrasing of the talking point has changed. In early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was ""nearly double"" Wisconsin’s rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013. At the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers, We crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates’ plans. Figures show that from the start of Walker’s term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsin’s 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsin’s. In the most recent year (March 2013 to March 2014), Wisconsin’s growth rate was 1.3 percent, compared with the U.S. rate of 2.1 percent. Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better. As we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures. (We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the state’s, from the start of Walker’s term.) There were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsin’s. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our rating Burke claimed that ""the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker."" Wisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walker’s term.

Radio ad by Democratic PAC blames Trayvon Martin death on Florida's 'stand your ground' law
","The shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, which sparked a national discussion about ""stand your ground"" laws, has become ammunition in the North Carolina U.S. Senate race. The Senate Majority PAC, which aims to elect Democrats, ran a radio ad urging higher turnout among black voters. The ad attacks Thom Tillis, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House, challenging Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad makes a series of claims about Tillis including this one: ""Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous claims related to the Trayvon Martin case. Did Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law cause his death? The radio ad was captured by the conservative blogger SisterToldjah and sparked considerable media attention. It prompted a conservative group to counterattack with a radio ad accusing the Democrats of ""race baiting."" While we are focused on the claim about whether Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law killed Trayvon, other media reports dissected Tillis’ role in the North Carolina law, which Tillis voted in favor of. Trayvon Martin and ""stand your ground"" law The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin of Miami Gardens on Feb. 26, 2012, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman the following year ignited political debate over race, gun rights and Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law. The law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. The law, promoted by the National Rifle Association, now exists in about two dozen states. Trayvon, a black 17-year-old, was returning from a convenience store and walking through a gated neighborhood where he was staying with his father. Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman, called a non-emergency police number to report Trayvon as ""suspicious."" A violent struggle followed and Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon. Zimmerman waived his right to a ""stand your ground"" hearing before trial, and did not cite it in his defense during the trial. But the law was cited in jury instructions: ""If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" In July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. After the verdict, Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor and state legislator from Miami Beach who was a critic of the law in 2005, wrote on his blog that jurors would have received different instructions under the old law, which said: ""The defendant cannot justify the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless he used every reasonable means within his power and consistent with his own safety to avoid the danger before resorting to that force The fact that the defendant was wrongfully attacked cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force."" (Gelber is now an adviser to Charlie Crist’s Democratic campaign for governor in Florida.) It’s difficult to quantify what extent ""stand your ground"" law played in the jury’s decision. One juror told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the jury discussed the ""stand your ground"" law. ""It became very confusing. We had stuff thrown at us. We had the second-degree murder charge, the manslaughter charge, then we had self-defense, ‘stand your ground,’ and I think there was one other one."" The juror, who was unnamed, said the murder or manslaughter charge did not apply ""because of the heat of the moment and the ‘stand your ground.’ "" But while the ""stand your ground"" law could have played a role for the jury, the law itself didn’t pull the trigger in the shooting. It’s impossible to fully evaluate Zimmerman’s thinking when he shot Trayvon, but one factor could have been that Zimmerman was a wannabe cop -- he had been rejected for a job with the Prince William County, Va.,  police department. Racial profiling could have played a role; Trayvon was a black male teenager wearing a hoodie. And then we will mention the obvious: Zimmerman had a gun. Zimmerman said in a TV interview in 2012 he had never heard of ""stand your ground"" until after the shooting, though during the trial the prosecution presented evidence that Zimmerman took a criminal-litigation course in which the instructor said he covered the ""stand your ground"" law. Zimmerman received an ""A"" in the course in 2010. The Senate Majority PAC’s back-up for the ad cites an article in Mother Jones shortly after the acquittal, which points to Zimmerman taking that course: ""In reality, ‘stand your ground’ played a major role, from Martin's death to Zimmerman's acquittal. ... An armed Zimmerman knew about ‘stand your ground’ years ago."" A spokesman for the PAC, Ty Matsdorf, didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s questions other than sending us the ad backup. He gave a statement to the New York Times defending the ad in general terms. But two defense attorneys we interviewed argued that the ""stand your ground"" law itself didn’t play a provable role. ""I don’t recall any evidence that he made a conscious decision to rely on the law before acting,"" said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. Attorney in Miami now in private practice. "" ‘Stand your ground’ may have led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman; that’s a more accurate statement. It’s led to other acquittals, too."" ""The law didn’t cause his death,"" said David Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor and now a Miami defense attorney. ""The bullet that got fired by George Zimmerman’s gun is what caused Trayvon Martin’s death."" After the Trayvon case, efforts to get rid of Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law went nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature. In fact, in 2014 the Legislature added that it applies to warning shots. The law has remained a hot topic nationwide, including in Florida’s race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Crist. During the Oct. 15 debate at Broward College, Scott said he would not change the law, while Crist said it is ""fundamentally flawed"" and needs to be fixed. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC radio ad said, ""Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin."" The part we focused on is whether Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law killed Trayvon. There are plenty of factors that could have contributed to George Zimmerman shooting Trayvon including racial profiling and his desire to be a law enforcement officer (not to mention the obvious: his access to a gun). And the ""stand your ground"" law could have influenced the jury’s decision to acquit Zimmerman of murder. However, it is an overstatement to suggest that the law is to blame for Trayvon’s death.

Ad in Colorado Senate race suggests Cory Gardner would ban condoms
","Even amid a torrent of campaign ads during the waning days of the 2014 midterm election cycle, a new television ad in Colorado’s tight Senate race certainly stands out. It addresses a topic -- abortion and birth control -- that have recurred often in the campaign between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. But the imagery, and the claim, make the ad unusual. The ad shows footage of a young, partially dressed couple in a bed, with the man reaching for a condom on the night table. ""Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!"" the narration says. ""If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms."" In bold type, the ad offers a visual saying, ""Gardner: Ban birth control."" The ad’s sponsors -- the abortion-rights groups NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado -- frame the ad as an ""edgy"" attempt to reach young voters. (The ad also makes claims about climate change, but we won’t address those in this fact-check.) How accurate is the claim about condoms? We have previously addressed claims on Gardner and birth control, but this one is slightly different, so we’ll take a closer look. First, here’s what the Gardner campaign said when we asked about the ad. ""Cory does not want to ban condoms,"" said campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano. ""In fact, he believes in increased access to contraceptives. He has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter."" So where does the ad get its evidence from? Past claims about Gardner and birth control have stemmed from his support of efforts to support ""personhood"" measures that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Gardner co-sponsored H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a ""personhood"" bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would ""implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person"" and ""declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being."" It goes on to say that "" 'human person' and 'human being' include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being."" Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives, such as the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. As we have noted in the past, we can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or their impacts on forms of birth control that are currently legal. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. Gardner’s critics may have a point that some forms of birth control could be outlawed if personhood measures became law -- but that shouldn’t affect condoms. That’s because condoms prevent sperm from reaching the egg in the first place. No fertilization ever takes place. In a further twist, Gardner made a major about-face during the 2014 campaign, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. ""The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position,"" Gardner told The Denver Post. ""I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time."" Gardner has also said that if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, he wants to allow the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. Finally, Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that ""nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical."" This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that Gardner is not anti-contraceptive. The ad’s sponsors didn’t get back to PolitiFact, but Doug Gordon, a spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, told our friends at FactCheck.org that ""we're not saying he is banning condoms. We are saying if Gardner starts limiting other forms of birth control, you better stock up on condoms because there will be so much demand for them — since Gardner wants to ban other forms of birth control."" While an affiliated radio ad does make that argument, the television ad doesn’t say that. It seems much more plausible to us that viewers of the TV ad would assume that Gardner wants to ban birth control, period. Our ruling The ad claims that ""if Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms."" The most obvious interpretation of this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms -- something that’s based on an incorrect interpretation of the measures Gardner has supported in the past (and which he has since distanced himself from). Gardner says he doesn’t support banning condoms, and in any case, condoms would not be at issue under the personhood measure he once supported.

Kristof: Dallas Cowboys stadium draws 3 times more power than Liberia can produce
","As President Barack Obama and countless public health experts keep saying, ""Ground Zero"" in the fight against Ebola are the countries in West Africa. In a recent op-ed, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof repeated that cry, saying American military help there was crucial. Left to their own, Nicholas said, these nations have no chance. ""These are lovely countries with friendly people and some heroic health workers, but roads, electricity and other infrastructure are desperately weak,"" Kristof said. ""All of Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas Cowboys football stadium consumes at peak times."" A reader wondered about Kristof’s claim, which essentially is: The country of Liberia cannot produce enough power to fuel one American football stadium at its peak demand. To be sure, the Cowboys home field, AT&T Stadium, is no small affair. The domed stadium seats 80,000 people, has the world’s largest high-definition video screen (70 feet by 160 feet), and plenty of air conditioning to match the heat of a Texas autumn. It covers 73 acres, cost a reported $1.3 billion to build and opened in 2009. Liberia, meanwhile, isn’t the biggest country, but still, it has more than 4 million people. Geography-wise, it’s the 104th-largest country and about the size of Cuba. So what do the facts say? According the U.S. Energy Information Service, Liberia had installed capacity of 197 megawatts in 2011. The CIA World Factbook has the same figure. (For comparison, the United States has a capacity to generate more than 1 million megawatts.) That means Liberia, at any one time, can generate 197 megawatts of electricity. So how does 197 megawatts compare to peak demand at AT&T Stadium? A rock solid answer proved to be elusive, but we found a reasonable estimate. We would have clear figures if the Dallas Cowboys would say how much electricity the stadium uses at its peak. They refused. A spokesman told PunditFact, ""We don’t give out those kinds of numbers."" However, Oncor, the firm that installed the stadium’s electric system provided a helpful clue. Oncor is a Texas electric company and on its website, it boasts about the work its engineers and contractors did for the Cowboys. In that write-up, Oncor made this interesting comparison. ""The stadium, which is the largest domed stadium in the world, uses more power than most medium-sized cities."" An Oncor spokesman would tell us nothing more than that, but we turned to Douglas Gotham, director of the State Utility Forecasting Group at Purdue University’s College of Engineering. Gotham did some back-of-the-envelope math for us based on what we know about medium-sized U.S. cities. He chose Evansville, Ind., with a population of about 120,000. ""The peak demand for the entire utility service area is about 1,500 megawatts,"" Gotham told us. ""About half of that roughly is in the city itself, so we’re looking at about 750 megawatts at the peak."" With Evansville being on the low end of medium-sized cities, Gotham said the comparison is close. If AT&T Stadium can use at least 750 megawatts at its peak, that is more than three times what Liberia can produce -- if Oncor is right. ""The statement about Liberia is in the ballpark,"" Gotham said. We found some other examples of medium-sized cities that bolster Gotham's estimate. Knoxville, Tenn., population 183,000, has a peak demand of 1,109 megawatts. Huntsville, Ala., population 186,000, has a peak demand of 1,150 megawatts. Eugene, Ore., population 159,000, has a peak demand of 480 megawatts. Many factors such as location and the number of industrial users shape electricity consumption, but overall, the pattern reinforces Gotham's conclusion. (These cities have municipal electric companies that mainly supply power within the city borders.) Some lingering data questions in Dallas There’s one other wrinkle to this comparison. Kristof’s New York Times article linked to a 2013 Wall Street Journal piece that discussed the comparison between Liberia and AT&T stadium. The Wall Street Journal cited the work of a utility analyst with the Bernstein Alliance asset management firm. The analyst, Bob Brackett, was intrigued when Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf made the comparison in 2013. So Brackett tried to run the numbers. He said peak demand at the stadium was 10 megawatts and that Liberia could generate less than a third of that. Both numbers seem to be way off.  We reached Brackett’s office but we never heard back from him to learn where he got his data. Our ruling Kristof said that Liberia can produce one-third as much electricity as the Cowboys stadium draws at its peak. U.S. government data shows that Liberia has nearly 200 megawatts of installed electricity capacity. The utility that worked on the stadium’s electrical system said the facility used more power than most medium-sized cities. Using that benchmark, a utility expert from one the country’s leading engineering schools concluded that peak demand at the stadium would fall in the range of 750 megawatts. That would mean that Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas football stadium consumes at peak times.

"['Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Virginia', 'James Carr']","
Carr says few people had health insurance prior to World War II
","Libertarian James Carr doesn’t agree that health care requires health insurance. Carr, who is facing Republican Dave Brat and Democrat Jack Trammell in the race for Virginia’s 7th District congressional seat, provided some historic perspective to highlight that point in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""Before World War II -- with wage freezes, when health care became attached to a job -- very few people actually had health insurance,"" said Carr, a community hospital administrator. What caught our attention here is Carr’s statement that ""very few"" people had health insurance prior to World War II. Currently, most Americans have some form of health insurance, so we wondered whether Carr was correct. So how does Carr justify his statement? His campaign manager, Jill Anderson, pointed us to a half-dozen documents about health care coverage in the U.S. One of them, a 1965 publication by the Social Security Administration, said that in 1930, there were probably 1.5 million to 2 million Americans who had some kind of private health insurance or pre-arranged payment plan for medical care. With a population of 123.2 million people then, that means that less than 2 percent of the population had private coverage. Private coverage was generally the only option. The federal government’s public insurance plans -- Medicare and Medicaid -- were created in the 1960s. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show that 12.3 million Americans (9.3 percent) had private health coverage for their hospital stays in 1940, a jump of 10 million from a decade earlier. In 1950, 76.6 million Americans, or 50.7 percent, had health insurance. What led to that jump? Topping the list would be the amazing advances in medicine in the past 75 years. The war itself played a major role in the growth of health insurance, according to a March 2002 history of health insurance benefits from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a think tank that examines employment-based benefits. Wages had been frozen by the National War Labor Board amid a shortage of workers as many potential employees went off to fight in the war. Employers sought to get around the wage controls in order to attract scarce workers. Providing them health insurance was one way to do that, EBRI said. ""During this time, employers petitioned, and were granted to have benefits, particularly health benefits, not be considered part of wages,"" Stephen Blakely, the director of communications and managing editor at EBRI, told us. ""Congress agreed to exempt health insurance benefits from taxation."" Blakely said Carr’s historic look at the prevalence of health insurance is correct. The growth in insurance was also spurred by a growth in surgeries and hospital stays. ""(A)s late as the 1920s, hospitals were viewed as dangerous places where people went to die,"" Robert Helms, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a February 2008 paper. That perception changed gradually, Helms said, as hospitals improved management, boosted physician professional standards and developed drugs to control infections. Penicillin, an antibiotic, was used increasingly in the 1940s to control infections. This made surgeries and hospital stays safer, which led to increased demand for both surgeries and insurance to cover those procedures, Helms noted. Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health care policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Carr’s statement is generally accurate, but isn’t relevant to today. Back in 1940, medical care was relatively basic, he said. A victim of a heart attack, for example, would have been ordered to rest in bed, Oberlander said. With today’s advanced medical care the treatment would require surgeries and care that’s very expensive to pay for without insurance, he said. ""There is not a feasible medical care system without health insurance in 2014,"" Oberlander said. Roughly 85 percent of the 310 million people in the U.S. had some form of health care insurance in 2012 either through their job, public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, or individual private plans, according to figures compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That leaves 15 percent of the population -- about 48 million Americans -- who lacked health care coverage. Our ruling Carr said before World War II, very few people had health insurance. While Carr doesn’t take into account the advances in medical care over the past 75 years, he’s right. Only about 10 percent of the U.S. population had private health insurance then, generally from an employer-based system.

Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison says Democratic districts got 81 percent more stimulus funds than GOP ones
","
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, slammed the federal government's spending habits under President Barack Obama in a Nov. 22 op-ed piece in the Austin American-Statesman, singling out the roughly $800 billion stimulus plan that passed last year. 
After asserting that the program is wasteful, Hutchison said: ""It has been reported that, on average, Democratic congressional districts received 81 percent more stimulus funds than Republican districts."" 
She went on: ""Unelected bureaucrats in Washington ... shouldn't be empowered to distribute taxpayer dollars with little or no intimate knowledge of a state or community's need — or, worse, guided by a political agenda that will serve some and neglect others."" 
First, just because Hutchison describes this statistic as ""reported"" doesn't let her off the hook when making claims to her constituents. So, we took the hint from several readers who asked us to truth-test Hutchison's ""81 percent"" statement. 
Next, some background: The stimulus, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, includes tax cuts and spending programs designed to pump money into the economy, create jobs and end the recession. 
The Obama administration created Recovery.gov so the public could track the stimulus spending, which is being spread out over 10 years. The website keeps tabs on only about a third of the money: the $275 billion that is being paid out by federal agencies through contracts, grants and loans to state and local governments, nonprofit groups and private companies. Not included are the tax breaks to individuals and businesses, additional money being sent to states for education and health care, and direct aid to individuals such as unemployment benefits. 
Hutchison spokeswoman Courtney Sanders told us the 81 percent statistic came from a report by Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, which describes itself as a ""source for market-oriented ideas."" Sanders sent us de Rugy's March 31 National Review Online blog post summarizing her statistical analysis of contract and grant data that recipients reported to Recovery.gov from February through September 2009. 
The total spending in de Rugy's analysis: $170 billion, which constitutes 21 percent of stimulus dollars overall. 
As part of her analysis, Rugy sorted the awards by congressional district and labeled each district based on the political party of its U.S. House member. One of her findings: ""The average dollars awarded per Republican district is $260,675,663, while the average dollars awarded per Democratic district is $471,533,539."" Those numbers reflect a Democratic average that is 81 percent greater than the Republican one. 
Her work was quickly challenged by blogger Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, a site devoted to analyzing political numbers that became part of The New York Times' website in August 2010. 
In his April 1 post, Silver wrote that de Rugy’s study ""purporting to find a connection between stimulus spending and the partisanship of a district suffers from an obvious flaw"" by overlooking an important factor in stimulus fund distribution: the location of each state’s capital city. Silver notes that according to de Rugy’s tally, the four districts that received the largest amounts of stimulus funding contain all or part of the capitals of the nation’s four biggest states: California, Texas, New York and Florida. 
""This … makes perfect sense,"" Silver's post says. ""A lot of stimulus funds are distributed to state agencies, which are then responsible for allocating and administering the funds to the presumed benefit of citizens throughout the state. These state agencies, of course, are usually located in or near the state capital."" 
According to Silver, de Rugy's data show that the 18 congressional districts that received the most stimulus funding contain part or all of a capital city. Of those 18 districts, only three are represented by a Republican, including the Texas 21st, whose congressman is Lamar Smith of San Antonio. His district, which ranked third in stimulus funding, includes the Texas Capitol complex and the University of Texas at Austin. 
Another Austin-area district, Democrat Lloyd Doggett’s 25th, which contains part of downtown, ranks 14th. None of the 30 other Texas districts made the top 50 list. 
According to Silver, the 78 congressional districts across the United States that contain part or all of a capital collectively received $118 billion, compared with $48 billion for the 357 districts that are not home to capitals. 
Silver wrote that districts with state capitals ""are much more likely to elect Democrats to Congress"" because they are usually urban; are home to large numbers of government workers (who ""may be more sympathetic to bigger government""); have highly educated populations; and often are home to large state universities. 
Silver suggested that de Rugy adjust her analysis to take into account whether a district contains a capital. She did, and on April 7 blogged on National Review Online that ""even after taking out the money spent through state capitals,"" Democratic districts still received 30 percent more stimulus funds, on average, than Republican districts. 
De Rugy's research assistant at the Mercatus Center, Jakina Debnam, told us that after removing capital districts from the analysis, the average for Democratic and Republican districts fell to $143 million and $111 million, respectively, giving Democratic districts a 29 percent edge. 
De Rugy raised the partisanship issue again in a Sept. 24 National Review Online post about a paper by two Georgia State University political scientists, Jeffrey Lazarus and Jason Reifler, who also analyzed the distribution of stimulus contracts and grants by congressional district. ""They find that the partisan bias does exist,"" de Rugy's post says. ""More interestingly, they explain how and why it happens."" 
In their paper, Lazarus and Reifler confirm that Democratic districts got more stimulus money than Republican ones. But they contend that the results reflect majority rule; Democrats were in the majority in the House and Senate when the stimulus plan passed. ""Congressional majority parties routinely shape legislation to distribute federal funds according to their own policy priorities, and to politically benefit their own members,"" the article says. 
An example of those priorities in the stimulus package, Lazarus told us, was the desire to improve health care. ""So districts with a lot of hospitals got extra money,"" thanks to the stimulus, he said — and the districts with more hospitals are in urban areas that tend to be represented by Democrats. 
Next, we briefed Sanders, Hutchison's spokeswoman, on the de Rugy analysis that excluded state-capital congressional districts. Sanders stuck by the 81 percent figure which, she noted, has not been retracted by de Rugy. 
Still, we wondered why Hutchison's op-ed piece left the impression that she was talking about all stimulus funds, not just a portion of them. Sanders' response: ""The op-ed does not say that — that's your interpretation."" 
To the Truth-O-Meter: Hutchison's statement accurately draws from a researcher's analysis showing that 81 percent of $170 billion in stimulus grants and contracts went to congressional districts represented by Democrats. 
However, after an analyst suggested that stimulus data from districts with state capitals tended to skew the results, the researcher re-ran her analysis while excluding those districts. Using that methodology, Democratic districts on average received 29 percent more stimulus funds than GOP districts — not 81 percent. 
Hutchison also fails to note that the $170 billion being scrutinized is about one-fifth of total stimulus spending, not the whole package. We rate Hutchison's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/dec/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-democratic-districts/

Del. Bob Marshall says violators of Obama health care reform face prison time
","
Among the many conservatives celebrating U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson’s health care reform smackdown this week, perhaps no one was more joyous than Virginia Del. Bob Marshall, R-Prince William County.  

Marshall introduced the state legislation that opened the door for the ruling. Early this year, Marshall was the patron of HB 10, the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, exempting state residents from the federal law. That bill set up Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s challenge to health care reform.

On the day of Hudson’s ruling -- which found the provision requiring nearly every American to purchase insurance or face a penalty unconstitutional -- Marshall unleashed a fresh attack on the health care law.

""The federal law compels American citizens to contract for health insurance they do not want, do not need, or find morally objectionable,"" Marshall wrote in a news release. ""Persons who decline to buy the coverage face fines and imprisonment.""

Later in the release, Marshall reiterated his point:

""The threat of heavy fines and jail time for failure to buy Obamacare health insurance is a power grab without practical limits and has no precedent in American history. It undermines our constitutional form of government, and is an affront to free men and women.""

Jail time? Really?

We asked Marshall for a source, and he pointed to an exchange in the Senate Finance Committee between Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., and Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff Thomas Barthold on Sept. 24, 2009.

After asking about the penalty for failing to pay the fine for not purchasing health insurance, Ensign received a handwritten note from Barthold confirming the penalty for failing to pay an up-to $1,900 fee for not buying health insurance. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in jail or a $25,000 penalty, Barthold wrote.

That was true -- then.

But it took place well before the health care law was approved.

Both House and Senate versions of the health care bill contained language that would levy a tax on persons who refuse to obtain coverage. Under the House version, evading that tax would have resulted in jail time; but not in the bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee and eventually made law.

The health care bill signed by President Obama explicitly says there are no criminal penalties for those who do not obtain coverage and refuse to pay the penalty tax.

As plainly stated on page 111 of the law, ""In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this section, such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure."" There would also be no liens or levies placed on property for failure to pay.

Instead, the law would allow the government to collect the tax by deducting it from any IRS tax-refund checks or other government payments.

Just to be certain we weren’t missing anything, we asked Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s office for their take on the issue.

""The law does not send people to jail for not paying the fine,"" confirmed Brian Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communication.

So Marshall is flat out wrong on the jail time.

His point that there are fines is correct.

The individual mandate in the health reform bill imposes ""taxes"" that are designed to prod uninsured Americans to buy insurance. Exemptions would be provided for families of limited means. The idea is that by expanding the pool of Americans paying for coverage, insurers can use the additional revenue to improve benefits, eliminate barriers for pre-existing conditions and reduce costs for others enrolled in the plans.

Those without coverage could eventually (by 2016) pay a tax penalty greater than $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5% of household income. The penalty will be phased-in. After 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.

Let’s recap.

In his release, Marshall twice said people failing to purchase health care could face imprisonment. That’s not true.

Marshall references an exchange that took place over a year ago, well before the law was approved. At that time, imprisonment was a possibility, but not in the legislation that was enacted.  It is ridiculous for Marshall, no novice in public affairs, to insist otherwise.

"['State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Wisconsin', 'Talgo Inc.']","
Talgo says the Milwaukee business community did not speak out in support of Wisconsin’s high-speed rail project as it was being killed
","
Nearly two years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle made a quiet trip to Spain to look into high speed rail. During that jaunt -- announced the day he departed -- Doyle visited train maker Talgo Inc.

Talgo had been seeking business in Wisconsin, and Doyle’s visit was another step in the courting dance between the Spanish firm and state and local officials, a relationship that turned into a sour one in December 2010.

Not long after Doyle’s visit, Talgo won a $43.1 million no-bid contract to build two trains for Amtrak service between Milwaukee and Chicago. Local officials had hoped Talgo would share work with local firm Super Steel, but Talgo rejected that idea. Milwaukee later offered Talgo incentives to open its own factory at a portion of the old Tower Automotive site on the city’s north side.

Talgo also received an option for two more trains as part of $810 million in federal funds for a planned high-speed route from Milwaukee to Madison. The firm was in the process of hiring 125 people to build the trains when the project hit the wall. Virtually all of that federal money was withdrawn Dec. 9 and sent to other states after Governor-elect Scott Walker held fast to his opposition to the Milwaukee-Madison link.

And the finger-pointing began.

Well, make that, continued.

Talgo issued a statement from Nora Friend, the company’s vice president for public affairs and business development, that included this comment directed at the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce: ""Talgo is also disappointed that the business community did not speak about the facts on this project.""

She added: ""Talgo was encouraged by the business community to move to Wisconsin, and they were silent about the very same facts that made this project the only one in the nation that qualified to be fully funded by the federal government.""

So, did the influential  MMAC really sit idle while a new employer was, in essence, sent packing? Even after, in late November, Talgo pleaded publicly pleaded that it speak out on behalf of the train project?

We talked with MMAC president Tim Sheehy, one of the most plugged in business and political figures in the state.

The high speed train situation, he said, was one of the most contentious matters he has grappled with in the 17 years he’s led the group. Sheehy took the unusual step of surveying his membership about high speed rail and posted the results online.

""It was huge and it was hot,"" he said of the response.

About 40 percent of MMAC members responded, and about 200 included comments with their vote.

The key question: ""Do you support creation of a high speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison as part of a proposed Midwest rail network connecting Chicago to the Twin Cities?""

The answer was a 50-50 split: 214 members for and the same number against.

Said Sheehy: ""When you have a membership split so dramatically and so evenly on an issue you don’t have anything to lobby for.""

The MMAC previously had supported the Milwaukee-Madison connection, along with the new trains and other upgrades for the service to Chicago. Sheehy said he went ""line by line"" through the application for the $810 million to tease out items that his members would agree upon.

""We wanted to see if there was a way to keep half of the money,"" for existing rail service, he said, adding: ""Why throw out the baby with the bathwater?""

Sheehy’s efforts to find middle ground failed, in part because the positions of Walker and the federal Department of Transportation were so rigid. Five weeks after the Nov. 2 election, the feds said they would yank the money from Wisconsin. One day later Talgo said it would pull out the manufacturing jobs after the work was done. Some 60 maintenance jobs will remain.

""Quite frankly, the door closed pretty fast here,"" Sheehy said.

Sheehy included this statement with the survey results, which were posted after the state lost the train money:

""We are disappointed the administration took an ‘all or nothing’ approach to these funds. While our survey reflected clear disagreement on the passenger rail spur to Madison, there was considerable support for individual components of the proposal that would have upgraded existing passenger and freight rail capacity.""

Friend said Talgo felt the MMAC survey ""did not do justice or reflect benefits of rail development.""

She said Talgo thought the MMAC ""would be a neutral educational resource and could speak factually about pros and cons of different infrastructure projects and help disseminate accurate information for people who naturally don't appreciate rail because they are not privileged to know that industry or its benefits.""

""A simple return on investment analysis could prove that a $810 million project shows a very positive return even if the state had to invest $7.5 million a year over 20 years.""

Talgo is not a MMAC member, but Sheehy said that had no bearing on the group’s handling of the issue.

So where does that leave us?

The state lost $810 million in federal funds, Talgo’s train manufacturing jobs and the area’s leading business group and political leaders have a black eye for wooing and then freezing out an international business. Some of Talgo’s ire was directed toward the MMAC, for not speaking out on its behalf. The organization said its hands were tied by a split membership.

U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith says that under the DREAM Act, new citizens older than 21 can sponsor their parents for legalization
","
In a recent op-ed, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, called an immigration bill that would allow undocumented residents brought to the United States as minors to qualify for citizenship ""a nightmare for the American people."" 
Among other arguments against the bill, Smith says in his piece published in The Hill Nov. 30 that ""once the DREAM Act's amnesty recipients become citizens and turn 21, they can sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization."" 
The U.S. House subsequently voted 216-198 in favor of the the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, known as the DREAM Act. But the measure didn't make it through the Senate, where proponents fell five votes short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and usher the legislation to the floor. 
We're not getting into whether providing a path for undocumented minors to become citizens is the same thing as amnesty. Yet we waded into the family issue earlier this month when we rated Barely True a statement by Smith's Texas colleague, Rep. Ted-Poe, R-Humble, who said that ""after you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States."" 
Poe skipped several stipulations that an undocumented citizen must satisfy before becoming a citizen, and he went too far when he said undocumented-residents-turned-citizens can sponsor their extended family to come here. According to the U.S. State Department, citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to come legally to the United States. 
Smith's statement reflects accurately on provisions in federal law permitting a citizen to sponsor immediate family members — a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 — to enter the country with an ""immediate relative immigrant visa."" Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents for legal permanent residence as well, according to the State Department. 
We identified a wrinkle, though, not acknowledged in Smith's statement. 
Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, which is generally pro-immigration, said in an e-mail: ""It is incredibly unlikely that DREAM Act beneficiaries would have citizenship by the age of 21. Even if someone completed every requirement (including higher education) on the date of enactment of the legislation, they would still need to spend 10 years in non-immigrant status and then another three years as a legal permanent resident before they would be eligible for citizenship. With high school graduation at 18, you could assume that many people would be 31 before they would gain citizenship under DREAM."" 
There have been various versions of the DREAM Act, but according to recent legislation, an undocumented resident must be younger than 30, have been brought to the United States at age 15 or younger and have lived here for at least five years prior to the measure becoming law to become eligible for the act's benefits. 
Such a resident must spend 10 years in the United States as a ""conditional non-immigrant,"" during which he or she must complete two years of higher education or serve in the military and be of ""good moral character,"" among other requirements, before qualifying for a permanent resident card, also known as a green card. After three more years, he or she is eligible to become a naturalized citizen. 
So, while Smith is correct that a U.S. citizen must be 21 to sponsor his or her parents for legal residence, it's unlikely that anyone who becomes a U.S. citizen under the DREAM Act would be younger than 21.

"['Agriculture', 'Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'John McCain']","
John McCain says a federal spending bill included a $277,000 request for potato pest management in Wisconsin
","
One bit of conventional wisdom gleaned from the November 2010 elections is voters turned Democrats out of office in Washington because they were turned off by their spending.

The results, no doubt, were more complicated than that.

But even if spending were only one reason Republicans took control of the U.S. House, would an outgoing Democratic congressman -- just weeks after his party got clobbered -- make a special federal funding request for potato pests in Wisconsin?

On Dec. 14, 2010, U.S. Sen John McCain (R-Arizona) took to the Senate floor to blast 2011 earmark requests made by various lawmakers.

An earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker.

McCain, reciting with disdain some of his ""favorite"" requests, highlighted an earmark for ""$277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin.""

Two days later, a 1,900-page, $8 billion bill that included the earmarks was abandoned by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. That means the earmarks are not likely to be funded, said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense (and a University of Wisconsin Law School graduate).

Nevertheless, let’s find out whether McCain’s claim was on target.

The 2008 presidential candidate said his source on the earmarks he highlighted was EndingSpending.com, which has a 2011 earmarks database.

The database was assembled by three Washington, D.C., organizations: Taxpayers Against Earmarks, led by Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts; Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group; and WashingtonWatch.com, which is run by a staff member of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research foundation.

Our check of the database found that an earmark request for $300,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin was made by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau).

Obey, who decided not to seek re-election in November after 41 years in Congress, was regarded as one of the most powerful members as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He’ll be replaced in January by Republican Sean Duffy, a former prosecutor and lumberjack athlete.

So, did Obey request the potato money?

Yes, said Ellis Brachman, spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee. He referred us to Obey’s official website, pointing out that members of Congress are required to post their earmark requests.

Obey’s site does not label his requests as earmarks, but rather ""Wisconsin projects submitted for consideration in FY 2011 appropriations."" If you click there on Obey’s home page, you get a list of his more than 80 earmark requests.

Among them: $36 million for studies of high-speed passenger rail between Madison and the Twin Cities; $2.5 million to replace the Bad River Tribal Youth Center in Ashland; and millions of dollars for water or waste water system improvements in communities including Cadott, Elcho and Unity.  

As for Obey’s potato pest request, here’s the summary:

Recipient: University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture and Life Sciences

Address: 1450 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706

Amount: $300,000

Description: Funding will help promote the development and adoption of bio-intensive integrated pest management practices to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides, enhance habitat quality, develop marketplace incentives for ecologically-produced potatoes and maintain economically viable farming operations in the fragile central sands region of Northern Wisconsin.

Obey was just renewing the potato earmark request. He won $849,000 for the same earmark from 2008 to 2010, according to earmarks databases kept by Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Just how important are potatoes in Wisconsin? The state ranks third in potato production, behind Idaho and Washington, according to the Wisconsin Potato & Vegetable Growers Association.

Among the threats to Wisconsin potatoes is the Colorado potato beetle, which isn’t easily killed by predator bugs. It is ""the most serious insect pest"" found on commercially produced potatoes in the central sands area, according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Entomology.

We wondered why McCain said the potato pest management request was for $277,000, while the database he cited and Obey put the figure at $300,000. McCain’s office didn’t reply to our question. However, a ""working database"" of 2011 earmarks maintained by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), indicates the request was reduced to $277,000 before being put into the bill that was ultimately abandoned.

Obey’s wasn’t the only potato pest management earmark request. Maine’s congressional delegation asked for $450,000 for its program, according to the Coburn database.

OK, let’s return to McCain’s claim.

Citing a database, the Arizona senator said an earmark request had been made for $277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin. The database shows the request was made by Obey, the outgoing congressman. He doesn’t dispute it. (But it’s entirely possible his office considers us a pest on this issue.)

","Portland radio personality and blogger Lars Larson isn’t likely to add Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to his ""friends and family"" list anytime soon.

Not when, as Larson suggests in a Nov. 21, 2010, post on the conservative website OregonCatalyst.com, LaHood is ""going to force you to stop using your cell phone.""

What? I’m sorry, you’re breaking up. Can you find a stronger signal and say that again?

Larson wrote the post five days after LaHood appeared on the MSNBC show Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2010. On the show, LaHood talked about the dangers of distracted driving and how cell phones, smart phones, iPods and other devices have become major contributors to the problem. During the conversation, LaHood was asked about ""slamming"" technology that would render cell phones useless.

""Simply banning talking on a cell phone behind the wheel is not enough for him,"" Larson wrote. ""He’s on MSNBC saying, ‘I think it will be done. Scrambling technology is there and I think you are going to see the technology become adaptable to disable cell phones. We need to do a lot more if we are going to save lives.’""

""Ready for Nanny State LaHood to be driving behind the wheel with you? He’s not only telling you that you can’t use your cell phone but he’s going to disable it so that it won’t work,"" Larson wrote.

Larson wasn’t alone in this charge. A large group of mostly conservative commentators constructed an assortment of conspiracy theories after hearing LaHood.

Here’s the exchange on Morning Joe that touched it off:
  Co-host Mika Brzezinski: ""So, Secretary, everything you said is true. Everybody does it, everybody’s on the phone.

Isn’t the only way to stop this, is to have a device in the car, when that car is on, a ‘slammer.’ Literally, the ‘phone slammer’ starts and phones don’t work. Isn’t that the only way to stop it?"" Secretary LaHood: ""There’s a lot of technology out there now that can disable phones and we’re looking at that. A number of them [cell technology innovators] came to our Distracted Driving Summit here in Washington and presented their technology, and that’s one way. But you have to have good laws, you have to have good enforcement, and you have to have people take personal responsibility. That’s the bottom line."" LaHood’s comments admittedly left room for interpretation and confusion, sort of like talking to someone with a weak signal and hearing every third word. LaHood and his aides apparently realized this, too. Two days later LaHood clarified his comments on the department’s blog. ""Again, personal responsibility – that’s the bottom line,"" LaHood wrote in a Nov. 18, 2010, entry titled ""Setting the Record Straight"" on Fast Lane, ""the official blog of the U.S. Secretary of Transportation."" ""When you get behind the wheel of a 5,000 pound automobile, you have a personal responsibility to drive that vehicle safely. That means, put away cell phones and other devices that take your focus off of the road."" Timing is important, however. The clarification came three days before Larson’s entry on OregonCatalyst. Ignored in the jousting is this central -- and unchallenged -- fact: Distracted driving is a major threat to safety. It’s also beyond question that young and inexperienced drivers are especially at risk. Here are some facts: 
Given that reality, LaHood says, his department is always on the lookout for new approaches and technology to minimize the danger. Some of those technologies are being studied by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Banning cell phone use in cars by way of ""slamming technology"" is not on the list and will not be considered, LaHood and his aides say. That leads to an obvious question. ""Some have asked why NHTSA would research this kind of technology if there was no intent to put it into use,"" Department of Transportation press secretary Olivia Alair said in an e-mail exchange. ""The reality is, many independent researchers and innovators have approached the DOT with technologies they’ve designed to prevent distracted driving. NHTSA needs to evaluate these kinds of technologies in large part because they may one day wind up on the market – geared towards parents who want to install them in their teens’ cars for example – and it’s important for NHTSA to know how they work, whether they are safe, and whether they help or hurt efforts to stop distracted driving."" But, she adds, ""We have never promoted the use of technologies to disable cell phone signals, nor have we ever indicated we intended to require them."" Larson could be forgiven for jumping to the wrong conclusion if his comments appeared the same day LaHood spoke -- or even the  next day. But saying the federal government is moving to cripple your phone three days after the record was clarified to the contrary is dubious no matter how well your smart phone is working. For that reason, we rate his claim False. Comment on this item.",/factchecks/2010/dec/18/lars-larson/government-going-pry-your-cell-phone-phone-your-co/

VEA President Kitty Boitnott says Virginia teachers have gone three years without raises
","
The General Assembly must approve a new state budget in the coming months, and public school teachers are lobbying for a 3 percent pay boost, saying they have gone three straight school years without a raise.

Leaders of the 60,000-member Virginia Education Association, the state’s largest organization of teachers, announced their aim at a Dec. 8 news conference. They said low pay, increased work demands and diminished education budgets are driving veteran teachers to a ""breaking point"" and retirement.

""The men and women who teach Virginia’s children, as well as those who support the education process in a variety of other vital jobs, are working for the third consecutive year -- some longer than that -- without salary increases,"" said Kitty Boitnott, the VEA’s president.

""In fact, many of them are working for less money today than they received three years ago, as a result of pay cuts, furloughs and health insurance premium increases.""

We don’t doubt teachers perform extraordinary public service without expectation of high financial reward. We were curious, however, about the claim they are working their third straight year without a raise.

Boitnott said her statement was based on informal reports the VEA has received from teachers around the state. ""It’s what our members are telling us,"" she said.

Virginia’s public school teachers have two sources for pay raises: the state government and their local school boards. During good years, both entities usually kick in money for teachers.

Recent times have been tough and the state has not put up cash for a teachers’ raise since December, 2007, when a 3 percent increase was enacted. The General Assembly approved an additional 2 percent hike to go in effect July 1, 2009. Lawmakers rescinded that action during the depths of recession in early 2009.

So it is accurate to say that teachers are in their third school year without a raise from the state.

But most localities, while not munificent, have boosted teachers’ salaries during the three-year period Boitnott cites.

At least 126 of the 132 school districts in Virginia increased teachers’ pay for the 2008-09 school year, according to an annual report put out by the state Department of Education.  The report is based on salary data the superintendent of each school system is required to remit.

The average state teacher salary for 2008-09 was $52,309 -- up 3.56 percent from the previous school year -- according to the data.

That does not mean all teachers in those localities received 3.56 raises. Each city and county is free to chart its own course and increases ranged from 10 percent in Dickenson and Russell Counties to 1.17 percent in Bath County. A few localities, as we’ve noted, did nothing.

The 2009-10 school year was not as kind to teachers. Education Department figures show only 19 localities improved teachers’ pay. The average state teacher earnings of $52,149 was 0.31 percent lower than the previous school year.

The study offers no explanation for the decrease, although the VEA notes that some teachers were required to take furloughs during the last school year.

Salary figures for the current school year are not available. The Department of Education is scheduled to release its 2010-11 report next month.

There are strong indications, however, that this school year also has been difficult for teachers. An October survey by the Virginia Association of School Superintendents found that at least 110 school districts froze salaries for 2010-11. Six school systems, including Chesterfield County, implemented across-the-board pay cuts. Chesterfield cut pay by 2 percent but later gave teachers a one-time, 2 percent bonus.

No relief for teachers is in sight for the next two school years, although things can change. Gov. Bob McDonnell did not recommend a state raise for teachers in a two-year budget proposal he made Friday. At the same time, he gave localities permission to pass pension contributions they have traditionally made -- equaling 5 percent of salaries -- on to teachers. To do that, a locality would have to give its teachers a 3 percent raise in July. The net effect would reduce take-home pay.

If you’re curious, state employees have not received a raise since November 2007, when they got a 4 percent boost. Last week, they were given a 3 percent bonus, but it’s a one-time payment.

McDonnell has asked the General Assembly to give state employees a 3 percent raise on July 1 and a one-time bonus of up to 2 percent next December.

Asked why he recommended the state do more for its employees than teachers, McDonnell said: ""Teachers’ compensation is largely controlled by local government.""

Let’s review:

Boitnott said Virginia teachers are working their third consecutive year -- some longer -- without a salary increase. She made no attempt to qualify her statement. The broad context of her comments suggests she’s talking about all state instructors.

Teachers have two sources for their salaries: the state and their local school boards.

The state has not ponied up money for a teacher’s raise since December 2007.

But at least 126 of 132 school divisions did boost teacher’s pay for the 2008-09 school year, according to the state Department of Education. Teacher salaries increased by an average 3.56 percent. That was two school years ago.

Although 19 localities increased pay last school year, the average salary dipped by 0.31 percent. Statistics are incomplete for this year, but indicate teacher pay was flat in most localities and even cut by six school systems.

It would be accurate to say most teachers are going without a pay raise for the second straight school year. But Boitnott added a third year and the possibility of ""longer."" Data shows teachers in every school district received a raise over the last four school years.

We rate her statement False. ",/factchecks/2010/dec/17/kitty-boitnott/vea-president-kitty-boitnott-says-virginia-teacher/

U.S. Rep. John Mica says TSA is growing and growing and growing
","
A northeast Florida congressman is taking aim at the Transportation Security Administration, saying the government agency has grown too big.

U.S. Rep. John Mica, the incoming House Transportation Committee chairman, launched a series of criticisms about TSA surrounding its new screening procedures -- including potentially invasive pat-down searches. Classic government run amok, he says.

TSA ""started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average,"" Mica said during a Nov. 25, 2010, appearance on Fox News.

Mica has suggested the federal government might be better off training private airport security screeners and then slowly backing out of the process, saying a public-private partnership would be more efficient and less costly. ""It would be far better for a streamlined TSA to focus on setting and checking security standards and auditing performance, rather than spending much of its time, resources and energy on managing a huge ballooning bureaucracy,"" Mica wrote in a Nov. 23, 2010, guest column in USA Today.

We'll leave the policy debate for the policy debaters, but we wanted to see if Mica's TSA stats are correct.

Has the aviation security screening force grown from about 16,500 to a bureaucracy of 67,000?

And do TSA's administrative personnel in Washington, D.C., make $105,000 a year on average?

First, some quick background on the TSA. Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, airport security was performed by air carriers with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA essentially provided the guidelines for passenger and luggage screening, and it was up to the air carriers to perform the screening itself. In most cases, carriers contracted that work out to third-party security companies. Results were mixed.

In 1978, the FAA found that screeners missed identifying prohibited items during checks 13 percent of the time --  a rate considered ""significant and alarming"" by both the FAA and the airline industry. In two 1987 reports, the U.S. General Accounting Office pointed out that about 20 percent of test objects were still not being identified during the screening process.

After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government created the Transportation Security Administration to directly handle security screening.

Which segues perfectly to Mica's statements.

Justin Harclerode, Mica's spokesman on the Transportation Committee, said Mica got his figures from TSA itself -- with one caveat. ""When Mr. Mica cites 67,000, he usually indicates that we are growing TSA to that level, because in its FY 2011 budget, the administration requested funding and justifications (more screening equipment operators, more canine unit staff, more behavior detection officers) for a TSA staff of over 67,000. The current staff is about 62,000 (a massive bureaucracy already) and the administration has requested funding to grow it to over 67,000,"" Harclerode said.

We showed Mica's statement to the TSA and asked for clarification on his figures.

TSA spokeswoman Sari Koshetz told PolitiFact Florida that the TSA total workforce is about 62,000. But Harclerode is right that TSA wants to grow. In its FY 2011 budget submittal, TSA asks for funding to grow the agency by about 4,500 employees (page 72 of this request). As for the headquarters staff, Mica is pretty much right on, TSA admits. The TSA headquarters workforce is approximately 3,650 (Mica said 3,590) and the average salary for employees there is $105,000 (exactly what Mica said).

That's one part of Mica's statement. The other examines how the TSA has grown since 2001. How do things measure up there?

Mica is right that in August 2002, nine months after TSA was created, the agency was operating with 16,500 screeners. But it's a misleading claim. The agency was known to be expanding.

Let us explain.

TSA was created in November 2001 as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. That legislation required that all airport security screeners be federal employees by Nov. 19, 2002.

In the year between the congressional act and the deadline, the TSA slowly built its ranks, mixing federal employees with private security workers. At one point in August 2002, that mix included 16,500 federal workers.

But it always was going to be more.

By the end of 2002, TSA reported employing 56,000 security screeners.

The agency shrunk some in 2003 as part of ""rightsizing"" but has slowly grown since then. In 2003, Congress placed a 45,000-employee cap on the agency, but TSA found ways around the cap, which was removed in 2007.

What does that mean for Mica? Well, he said, TSA ""started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average."" Little variances on the numbers aside, we take issue with the suggestion that TSA grew from 16,500 to a bulging 67,000-employee bureaucracy. TSA may have had 16,500 screeners in its infancy, but it was created with the idea that it would have many more. Mica is cherry-picking some numbers in his statement. So we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/dec/17/john-mica/us-rep-john-mica-says-tsa-growing-and-growing-and-/

State Rep. Robin Vos says right-to-work states have higher rates of income growth
","
The new leadership in Wisconsin brought by the November 2010 elections are now bringing proposals for bold changes in policy.

Republicans will take over the governorship, as well as control of the state Senate and Assembly, on Jan. 3, 2011. Governor-elect Scott Walker, in the run-up to his inauguration, has gone so far as to suggest stripping state employee unions of their rights to bargain contracts with the state.

Unions -- for both public and private employers -- are also the target of Robin Vos, a Republican state representative from Rochester in Racine County. He is poised to become co-chair of the Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance Committee.

Vos said Dec. 8, 2010 he may introduce a bill to make Wisconsin a ""right-to-work"" state. As a freshman lawmaker, Walker supported right-to-work legislation in 1993.

In a Dec. 12 Milwaukee TV interview, Vos touted the virtues of such a policy change.

""From my perspective, I think that if you look at all of the data that has been collected,"" Vos said on WISN’s ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" ""states that have non-forced, compulsory union membership when you want to work somewhere have higher rates of income growth, have higher rates of manufacturing -- actually, over time, have seen much greater increases in their standard of living.""

We decided to examine the question of whether right-to-work states are better off.

We’ll start by taking on the terminology.

A state is considered a ""right-to-work"" state if it prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that provide for a ""union shop."" A union shop is a workplace in which all employees are required to pay union dues.

A state that allows union shops is considered by unions to be a ""free-bargaining"" state.

Currently, 22 states, including Iowa in the Midwest, are right to work, according to a map provided by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which says it defends America’s workers ""from the abuses of compulsory unionism.""

Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota are among 28 free-bargaining states, most of which are in the northeast quadrant of the country.

In his TV interview, Vos made three claims about the benefits of right to work, but two are too vague for us to measure.

Vos said right-to-work states have a ""higher rate of manufacturing,"" which is not a common term.

Asked to explain that claim, Vos provided one statistic about manufacturing gross domestic product and another about the loss of manufacturing jobs. A third statistic -- the percentage of a state’s workforce employed in manufacturing -- was cited when we asked the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO union about ""rate of manufacturing.""  

Vos also said right-to-work states have ""seen much greater increases in their standard of living."" Vos himself defined ""standard of living"" with statistics on four different topics.

We’re going to set aside both in this item and focus on the very measurable claim that right-to-work states have ""higher rates of income growth.""

Vos provided four pieces of evidence, but only two addressed growth in income. Both came from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, which advocates for right to work. 

That’s a figure that supports Vos’ claim.

Meanwhile, the national AFL-CIO used census data to examine median income from 2000 to 2009. Those figures show that income dropped 3 percent in right-to-work states and 5 percent in free-bargaining states. The union’s figures adjusted for inflation.

That isn’t income growth, which was what Vos pointed to; but the figures do come out in right-to-work’s favor.

It’s possible, of course, that changes in income may simply be correlated with a state having right-to-work status, and not caused by it. That is, there could be other factors at work.

We consulted five economics professors on this point.

They agreed that income growth has been higher in right-to-work states. But there was no consensus on how important right-to-work status is in causing that growth, and many minimized its role.

Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University: He said because factors such as business incentives and corporate tax rates are also involved, ""it would be a stretch to say"" right-to-work states had higher income growth because of right-to-work laws. With union representation less than 10 percent of private-sector employment nationally, he said, right to work ""is no longer as important as it used to be.""

Russell Sobel, West Virginia University: He said it’s unclear how right-to-work compares to other factors in causing income growth, but the amount of income growth in right-to-work states indicates the impact of right-to-work ""is fairly substantial.""

William Rogers, University of Missouri at St. Louis: ""There has been a lot of research on this topic, and the overall conclusion is that right-to-work laws may have a small positive impact on state income.""

Russell Kashian, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater: Any right-to-work effect on income growth likely is diminishing, he said. Employers seeking low wages are more likely to go overseas, rather than choosing a right-to-work state over a free-bargaining state in the U.S.

Richard Vedder, Ohio University: Laws and regulations relating to taxes, the environment and other areas sometimes play a bigger role than right-to-work in income growth, he said. But right-to-work is an ""extremely simple and inexpensive policy change to implement.""

In a nutshell: None of the economists said right to work has no effect on raising income. But opinion is mixed on just how much of a factor it is.

Let’s punch the clock on this one.

Arguing that Wisconsin would be better off economically if it became a right-to-work state, state Rep. Robin Vos claimed that income growth has been higher in right-to-work states than in free-bargaining states. He’s correct on that statistic. But he leaves the impression that right-to-work status is what causes incomes to rise. As our interviews with economists show, that’s debatable, at best. And that’s important context left out of the statement.

We rate his statement Half True.

University System official says out-of-state tuition covers costs
","
As leaders of the state's public higher education system mulled whether to bar illegal immigrants, money was on their minds. 

Is this financially troubled state paying for illegal immigrants to go to college? they asked.

They're not, according to a State Board of Regents fact-finding committee. Illegal immigrants pay out-of-state tuition, and ""every student paying out-of-state tuition actually covers more than the cost of instruction,"" Regent James Jolly said in a newsletter issued by the board.
More than the cost of instruction? That sounds like a lot.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia contacted the University System of Georgia Board of Regents, showed the regents' data to experts and talked to other experts to check out this claim. 

The debate over illegal immigrants in Georgia public colleges flared with the March 30 arrest of Jessica Colotl, a Kennesaw State University student who was found guilty last month on a misdemeanor charge of driving without a license.

It turned out Colotl, a political science major, had been brought illegally to the U.S. from Mexico as a child.

College officials disclosed Colotl was charged in-state tuition, even though state rules required that illegal immigrants pay much higher out-of-state rates.

The Board of Regents created the Residency Verification Committee to find out more about illegal immigrants in state schools.

In October, the State Board of Regents voted to ban illegal immigrants from Georgia's top public colleges starting next fall. But the debate won't end there. During the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to bar these students from all public colleges in the state.

And so we return to the question of whether out-of-state tuition covers more than the cost of educating students at Georgia's public colleges.  

The subject is more complicated than you would expect, experts told AJC PolitiFact Georgia.

College tuition is not strictly based on how much it costs to educate a student. It's often not even clear to experts what that cost is. That's because professors do more than teach. They also conduct research and use their expertise to help the public. One estimate placed teaching time for professors at research-oriented institutions at best at 40 percent of faculty workload.

Even though professors spend much of their time on other things, their salaries get classified as an instruction cost, said Robert Toutkoushian, a professor with the University of Georgia's Institute of Higher Education. This can artificially inflate how much a college spends on educating its students.

You can underestimate the cost, too, Toutkoushian said. A professor's research and public service experience can improve his teaching, but it's hard to assign a dollar value to that.

The Board of Regents' committee did not dwell on these complexities. Instead, it added all expenditures for teaching and related activities, plus state-funded school repair, renovation and infrastructure costs to figure out the total cost of educating the system's students.

The total cost of instruction: $3.62 billion for fiscal year 2011. 

To get the cost per student, it then divided that $3.62 billion by 280,078, which is roughly the number of full-time students in the system.

The regents found that for every category of school, the average cost of educating a student is significantly lower than out-of-state tuition.

For research universities such as Georgia Tech, it's $18,310. Average out-of-state tuition and fees there total $25,859.

For regional universities such as Kennesaw State, the cost is $10,955, while out-of-state tuition and fees are $17,230.

For two-year and state colleges such as Georgia Perimeter, it's $8,632. Tuition and fees are $10,147.

Tuition and fee figures do not include room and board.

College finance experts agreed that these results are not surprising.

""In general, that's true,"" said Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity, and Accountability. The nonprofit group studies higher education spending and affordability.

While in-state tuition at public universities is typically lower than the cost of educating a student, out-of-state prices often exceed it, Wellman said.

In Georgia, this is by design, according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles dating from the mid-1990s. The state's public colleges increased out-of-state tuition after complaints at the time that state money was being used to educate students from elsewhere.

Still, to check out these numbers, we looked at other estimates.

The Delta Project placed the 2008 average cost for education and related spending in Georgia's public research universities at $12,707. This is below the Board of Regents' estimates, which include certain operation and buildings costs that researchers at the Delta Project do not.

For another perspective, we also looked at raw data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, a program of the U.S. Department of Education that collects numbers from more than 6,700 higher education institutions across the country.

For fiscal year 2009, the combined cost of instruction, academic support and student services at the University of Georgia was $10,619. Again, that's less than UGA's out-of-state tuition and fees, which were $22,342 that year.

Students who pay out-of-state tuition frequently receive scholarships and other money from their college to help them with costs, but if they cannot document their lawful immigration status, they are not eligible, said John Millsaps, a spokesman for the Board of Regents.

Multiple approaches conclude that the cost of educating students in Georgia's public colleges is less than full out-of-state tuition and fees. This means that if illegal immigrants pay the proper price, taxpayers are not financing their education.

We therefore rule Jolly's statement True.

Robert Hurt calls health care reform law a ""government takeover""
","
Among the chorus of conservatives lauding a Virginia federal court ruling last week that declared a piece of the health care reform law unconstitutional was Congressman-elect Robert Hurt.

Hurt, R-5th, hailed U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson’s decision as ""a step in the right direction to preserving and protecting our Constitutional liberties and putting a stop to an overreaching federal government.""

He added: ""I fully support Attorney General Cuccinelli and his efforts in challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate provision in the health care legislation, and I look forward to working to repeal and defund the government takeover of health care in the 112th Congress.""

Hurt is certainly not the first to label health care reform a ""government takeover,"" but he’s the first PolitiFact Virginia has had occasion to check on the claim.

And he’s wrong.

As previous national PolitiFact checks have shown, no matter how you look at it, the legislation cannot reasonably be considered a government takeover.

The government will not take over hospitals or other privately-run health care businesses. Doctors will not become government employees, like in Britain. And the U.S. government intends to help people buy insurance from private insurance companies, not pay all the bills like the single-payer system in Canada.

The legislation is, in fact, designed to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to provide more coverage and better services.

That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover.

The key parts of the current U.S. system -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor -- would stay in place. The government has been running those programs for decades.The law would create health insurance exchanges for people who have to buy coverage on their own, so they could more easily compare plans and prices.

The biggest new element in the plan is a health care exchange that is supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The government (or the states) would create the exchanges, which would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage.

One component that would have lent a small measure of credibility to Hurt’s claim -- the public option -- was stripped from health care legislation in the Senate.  

The public option would have required a government-run insurance program, which many conservatives said would have grown the government's role.

The other element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the law, Medicaid is enlarged to cover anyone at or below 133 percent of poverty level, which would not include undocumented workers.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that will add 16 million new people to Medicaid on top of the roughly 60 million now in it.

But that certainly doesn’t make it a ""government takeover.""

""It does increase government regulation of the health insurance industry and public funding for health care for lower and middle income uninsured Americans,"" said Timothy Jost, a health law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. ""It does not create a government insurance program, however, and has little impact on health care delivery. ‘Government takeover’ is simply political rhetoric.""

In summary, yes, government regulation of the existing system increases under the new legislation. More people will be insured. The government will create exchanges to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now. Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor, will be expanded.

But it is not, as Hurt says, a government-run plan. The public option, which would have added a government-run plan to the mix, was dropped from the bill.  Coverage would be paid for the same way it is now, by private employers and individual premiums.

The claim is False.",/factchecks/2010/dec/16/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-calls-health-care-reform-law-governmen/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Workers', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Tim Pawlenty repeats questionable statistic on growth of federal workforce
","
In the Dec. 13, 2010, edition of the Wall Street Journal, outgoing Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential contender in the 2012 Republican presidential primary -- wrote a column that blasted public-employee unions. Pawlenty wrote that government employees, especially those who are unionized, have become unfairly advantaged compared to private-sector workers, through a ""silent coup, an inside job engineered by self-interested politicians and fueled by campaign contributions.""

""Across the country, at every level of government, the pattern is the same: Unionized public employees are making more money, receiving more generous benefits, and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever-higher taxes, deficits and debt,"" Pawlenty wrote. He even repeated what has become a major Republican talking point -- that ""federal employees receive an average of $123,049 annually in pay and benefits, twice the average of the private sector."" (In November, we ruled a less precisely worded version of this statistic False.)

""The majority of union members today no longer work in construction, manufacturing or 'strong back' jobs,"" Pawlenty wrote. ""They work for government, which, thanks to President Obama, has become the only booming 'industry' left in our economy. Since January 2008, the private sector has lost nearly 8 million jobs while local, state and federal governments added 590,000.""

We thought we'd take a look at one of the cornerstones of Pawlenty's column -- his contention that the private sector lost nearly 8 million jobs while government added 590,000.

To see if he was right, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates a wide range of labor and employment statistics on a monthly basis.

In January 2008, total private-sector employment in the United States stood at 115,562,000. By November 2010, the most current month available, that number had sunk to 108,278,000 -- a drop of roughly 7.3 million jobs. That pretty close to the ""nearly 8 million"" figure that Pawlenty cited. (Almost two-thirds of those job losses, incidentally, happened while George W. Bush was president.)

But Pawlenty's public-sector figures were problematic. The BLS has a category called government employment -- which encapsulates local, state and federal employment, just as Pawlenty had defined it. Over the same period, the number of government jobs went from 22,379,000 to 22,261,000 -- a decrease of 118,000, rather than an increase of 590,000, as Pawlenty had written.

At first we were flummoxed about how Pawlenty got the numbers so wrong. We called BLS to make sure we weren't overlooking another data set that measured the same subject, and spokesman Gary Steinberg confirmed that we were using exactly the same numbers he would use.

We also looked at federal employment trends over the same period, on the guess that Pawlenty might have meant to refer to federal jobs, rather than all government jobs. By this calculation, the number of jobs did increase, rather than decrease, but the amount was only one-sixth of what Pawlenty had indicated. Over that period, federal employment rose from 2,739,000 to 2,837,000 -- 98,000 jobs in all.

After a bit of online research, we found a reference to the mysterious 590,000 number in -- of all places -- a fact-check by our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio.

It turns out that on Aug. 10, 2010, they analyzed a statement by Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio, that ""since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know who's done okay and who's not complaining today? The public sector. We've gained 590,000 public sector jobs.""

LaTourette's number for private-sector job losses at that point was spot-on. But PolitiFact Ohio found fault with his public-sector numbers. Here's what they wrote:

""In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By May, there were 3,396,000 federal workers. That’s a gain of 593,000, putting LaTourette on the money. But here’s the problem. BLS makes clear, the White House makes clear, and every major news report makes clear when these numbers are released each month that the stimulus had little to do with the growth of the federal workforce. Most of it -- 559,000 new jobs from January 2009 through May – came entirely from the temporary buildup of Census workers. And many of those jobs have already disappeared. ... Exclude all the Census workers hired from January 2009 through May 2010 and total federal hiring comes to only 34,000, not the 590,000 figure that LaTourette cited.""

Assuming that Pawlenty was drawing his number from the same source as LaTourette did -- and we don't know for sure, because his spokesman did not respond to an inquiry -- then the Minnesota governor has even less justification for using the 590,000 figure than his Ohio colleague. Here's why:

• When we see Pawlenty saying ""since January 2008,"" we assume he means from January 2008 to the present. But the numbers he used appeared to be based on the change from January 2009 to May 2009.

• Pawlenty specifically wrote that his job numbers referred to ""local, state and federal government"" employment, but LaTourette's 590,000 only counted federal workers.

• Pawlenty's statement doesn't account for the tremendous -- and now vanished -- bump from hiring Census workers.

The closest we could come to a 590,000 job gain using a legitimate statistic was a measurement suggested by Rea Hederman Jr., a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggested looking at the federal workforce minus U.S. Postal Service employees. Postal workers are a different enough category of employee that the BLS does calculate a statistic that excludes them from the federal workforce, and that statistic shows an increase in federal employment since January 2008 of 215,700 employees. But that's still barely one-third of the total Pawlenty cited, and to get to it, you still have to directly contradict the definition of government workers that Pawlenty used in his column.

The question of whether government employees, because of public-employee unions, are compensated too generously or enjoy too much job security strikes us as a fair topic for debate. But Pawlenty did his cause no service by using the 590,000-employee statistic.

Not only did he apparently mangle the time frame, contradict his own definition of federal workers and fail to acknowledge the huge caveat of Census worker hiring, he also repeated a statistic that had been criticized as inaccurate as long as six months ago. (Another politician who got caught by PolitiFact Ohio was the incoming House Speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio.) And in the context of his column, the job numbers comment was more than a throwaway line. The comparison of job growth he made -- which showed the size of the federal workforce going in exactly the opposite direction as it did in reality -- is a key pillar supporting the premise of his column, that government work is ""the only booming 'industry' left in our economy."" Pawlenty's number is so compromised that we rate his statement Pants on Fire! 
UPDATE: After we posted our story, a spokesman for Pawlenty, Alex Conant, contacted PolitiFact to report that the source for Pawlenty's 590,000-job figure was a June 24, 2010, post by Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, on the Big Government site run by conservative activist Andrew Breitbart. After looking at what de Rugy wrote, we stand by our analysis that the 590,000 number doesn't encapsulate the time frame or definition set out by Pawlenty in his Wall Street Journal op-ed, and that it is still skewed by a large bump in temporary Census jobs.",/factchecks/2010/dec/16/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-repeats-questionable-statistic-growth/
"['Veterans', 'Wisconsin', 'Steve Kagen']","
U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen says new veteran's clinic has already spawned numerous related developments
","
Voters in northeastern Wisconsin showed two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen the door in November. The Democrat from Appleton is now -- like many other congressional lame ducks -- working in a basement office at the Capitol while his old digs are readied for a new member of the House.

As he wound down his time in D.C., Kagen took time out for a long interview published Dec. 13, 2010 in the Green Bay Press Gazette, where he discussed his accomplishments and waxed philosophic about his loss to Republican Reid Ribble.

Kagen said he’s committed to maintaining services to the citizens of the 8th District, and said he was proud of his time in Congress. He strongly supported health care reform legislation, and touted his work on behalf of the paper industry and support of Marinette Marine’s bid for a huge contract for a new class of littoral ships for the Navy.

The congressman also mentioned a new Veterans Administration clinic coming to Green Bay.

""Already, the mayor of Green Bay is having ribbon-cutting after ribbon-cutting for economic development around the new VA center,"" Kagen told the Press Gazette. ""It'll have a huge footprint and bring in millions of dollars of revenue to the entire county and the city of Green Bay.""

An achievement, to be sure.

One problem: The clinic itself is a ways off.

Asked whether he’s cut any ribbons in that part of the city lately, Green Bay Mayor James J. Schmitt barely suppressed a laugh: ""I have not.""

Indeed, officials haven’t even broken ground on the veterans facility itself, let alone related spinoff projects.

Let’s take a step back.

The VA has planned for years -- before Kagen was in office -- to build a new clinic that will be named after Milo C. Huempfner, a local World War II hero.

The $60 million facility will be built on the east side of the city, not far from the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Some 20,000 area veterans will be served by the outpatient clinic, which will have some 300 employees. An added boost: The facility is on the local tax rolls.

Schmitt and Derek Lord, Green Bay’s economic development director, said the city has high hopes for the area surrounding the clinic site.

For instance, the two said other medical offices, restaurants and a hotel are among the businesses that one day would want to be near the new VA facility.

But that’s one day.

As it stands, a contractor has not yet been hired to build the clinic and groundbreaking won’t take place until April. Lord said the city has heard from some developers who might be interested in area projects -- but in a very preliminary sense.

Said Lord: ""We anticipate a lot of activity, but we don’t anticipate that until the clinic is completed -- or near completion -- in the summer of 2013.""

So don’t expect Mayor Schmitt to take down those fancy three-and-a-half foot-long shears from their spot on display in Lord’s office -- not just yet, anyway.

""They actually cut the ribbon,"" Lord said, adding  ""they’re the real thing.""

We called Kagen’s office to ask him about his statement about all the development.

His office phone has a greeting from Kagen himself. But the answering machine was full, and a press aide didn’t respond to a telephone message on her cell phone.

The congressman’s Web site includes a press release from 2009 noting that ""Kagen and the Veterans Administration moved the request for the expanded Ambulatory Surgery/Outpatient Diagnostic Center and Community Based Outpatient Clinic from FY 2010 to FY 2009. The VA center will increase the total square feet available from 12,000 to over 160,000.""

So the congressman apparently helped increase the size of the facility and get it built earlier. But it’s not built yet -- and the related development was the central part of his boast.

So here’s where we stand.

Right now, the new VA clinic is an undeveloped, vacant parcel. The golden shovel for the groundbreaking and the special ribbon-cutting shears are ready for action. But once started, completion of the center is years away. And so, too, it seems, is the related economic development Kagen is already boasting about.

The Green Bay officials say they appreciated Kagen’s help on the project, but said he got it wrong about the repeated ribbon cuttings.

We agree. Way wrong. Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/dec/16/steve-kagen/us-rep-steve-kagen-says-new-veterans-clinic-has-al/
"['Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Foreign Policy', 'Texas', 'George W. Bush']","
President Bush says the United States doubled its commitment to fighting AIDS abroad in his first 17 months in office
","
President George W. Bush devotes a chapter of his memoir, Decision Points, to his interest in stopping AIDS abroad.

""When I took office, the United States was spending a little over $500 million a year to fight global AIDS,"" Bush writes. ""That was more than any other country. Yet it was paltry compared with the scope of the pandemic."" In May 2001, he writes, he endorsed the creation of a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, making an initial U.S. pledge of $200 million, an amount increased to $500 million by early 2002. And in June 2002, he writes, he announced the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative.

""In 17 months,"" Bush said, ""we had doubled America's commitment to fighting global AIDS.""

By the time Bush completed his second term, in early 2009, such annual U.S. spending exceeded $5 billion, according to a breakdown posted online in February 2010 by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

But we wanted the back story. We started from an October 2009 PolitiFact inquiry, per a statement by U2's Bono, who credited Bush with tripling U.S. spending against AIDS in Africa. In 2008, the United States accounted for more than half (51.3 percent) of all the the global AIDs relief disbursed by governments around the world, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS. When adjusted for the relative size of the countries' economies, the United States ranked fourth highest, considerably higher than most European countries. The only ones that spent more proportionately were the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Bono's homeland, Ireland.

Kaiser spokesman Craig Palosky passed along a June 2004 report, ""Analysis of aid in support of HIV/AIDS control, 2000-2002,"" whose authors include a program run by the United Nations. A table in the report shows the United States donated the most money to the AIDS fight in 2000, accounting for $329 million in such funding. The United Kingdom ranked a distant second, at $117 million.

In 2003, Bush initiated a $15 billion plan to address global AIDS relief, mostly for countries in Africa where the AIDS epidemic is staggering. And then in 2008, Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — more than tripled the HIV/AIDS relief budget to $48 billion over five years.

We asked Eric Lief, a former senior advisor with the U.N. Joint Program on HIV/AIDS, to analyze Bush's statement about funding. (Lief now works for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a non-partisan public policy institute.) Via e-mail, he said: ""The Bush administration showed real leadership on global HIV/AIDS. U.S. funding grew exponentially during the eight Bush years. But global funding is still far short of anything close to global need.""

For particulars, Lief pointed us to a December 2006 Congressional Research Service report, ""Trends in U.S. Global AIDS Spending: FY2000-FY2007."" In fiscal 2000, the year before Bush was sworn in as president, annual U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS assistance and to combat TB and malaria totaled $236.1 million, the report says. It totaled $564.5 million in fiscal 2001 and a little more than $1 billion in fiscal 2002. Subtracting out what Lief told us was the share of funding focused on battling TB and malaria, we estimated AIDS-specific funding at $518 million for fiscal 2001 and $930 million the year after--amounting to an increase of about 80 percent.

Finally, we heard back from David Drake, a representative of Bush's publisher, the Crown Publishing Group, after asking him for evidence behind Bush's statement. Drake said in an e-mail that by the end of June 2002, Bush had committed $500 million to the Global Fund and another $500 million to the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative.

A former Bush adviser, Jay Lekfowitz, writes in a January 2009 article in Commentary magazine that the initiative was intended to increase the availability of preventive care, including drug treatments, and to devise delivery systems that would reach pregnant women and newborn children in two Caribbean nations and eight African ones (with four to be added later).

Drake said Bush announced the second $500 million on June 19, 2002, just before the end of his 17th month as president. He was sworn in Jan. 20, 2001.

"['Retirement', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott targets government pension plans as a way to cut costs, suggests employees should contribute
","
Gov.-elect Rick Scott is taking office next month with big plans to cut state spending.

One idea Scott has suggested is to cut $1.4 billion in state pension costs by making government employees contribute to their own retirement. Scott brought up the issue during the campaign and again on Dec. 14, 2010, in a meeting with state legislators.

""What do you all think about employees contributing to the pension plan?'' Scott asked legislators about ways to shrink state spending. ""We are the only state in the country that state employees don't contribute'' to their pensions.

Last year, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the state and local governments contributed nearly $3.4 billion to the retirement fund, the Florida Retirement System. Governments typically contribute between 9 and 10 percent of an employee's annual income toward retirement. Employees are required to contribute nothing.

Is Florida the only state with a system like that?

Not quite, according to a PolitiFact Florida review of the state retirement systems of all 50 states. But Scott isn't far off either.

PolitiFact Florida individually researched the state retirement systems across the country, as well as consulted with Ron Snell, the director of state services for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Snell studies state pension and retirement systems.

Most state retirement systems are based on a defined benefit plan -- a system where the state multiplies an employee's years of service by salary and by some percentage to arrive at a pension amount. To qualify, employees have to be vested into the system -- meaning they work for the state for a certain number of years, often five. They also must contribute some percentage of their pay to the overall pension fund. (In most states, individual contributions don't fund the retirement, but go into the overall pension fund.)

A few states, however, have begun to adopt more private-sector-like 401(k) plans where the employee voluntarily contributes to a retirement fund and the employer either matches a portion of the contributions, or contributes on their own.  

And some states offer voluntary, optional 401(k) plans on top of a government pension.

With state revenue sources drying up, states have been moving away from 100 percent employer-funded pensions to plans where employees are required to contribute.

Missouri, for instance, will start making employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, contribute 4 percent of their pay to their retirement plan, said Christine Rackers at the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System. Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation requiring new employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to their retirement. Current employees are operating under old rules where they do not have to contribute, though Virginia has discussed making them pay, too.

Wisconsin also passed legislation making workers pay toward the pension fund -- though their contribution is as little as .2 percent.

Where are governments still footing the entire bill?

The largest chunk of state employees in Utah are not required to contribute to their retirement. But a small percentage do.

In Tennessee, state employees and higher education employees are not asked to pay toward their retirement, said spokesman Blake Fontenay. But some local government employees and all K-12 teachers are required to contribute, Fontenay said. The state, back in 1981, discussed either having employees contribute toward their retirement or forgo a pay raise that year, Fontenay said. The government chose no raise.

And in Michigan, employees aren't necessarily required to contribute to their retirement because they have a traditional 401(k) plan, said Kurt Weiss with the state's Department of Technology, Management and Budget. The state contributes the equivalent of 4 percent of an employee's salary into a 401(k) regardless of whether the employee contributes. The state will then match up to an additional 3 percent employee contribution.

A few other states exempt certain, small classes of employees -- like public safety employees -- from having to contribute to their retirement. But in every case, the bulk of state employees are required to participate in the state retirement system through payroll deductions.

Wisconsin government analysts crafted a good synopsis of the state retirement plans in 2009 as that state was pondering changes. Contribution requirements are listed on Page 22.

A note: Our analysis isn't meant to say Florida's retirement plan is a better deal for state employees than employees in other state governments. It's entirely possible that other state employees receive better pensions than Florida workers, even after accounting for employee contributions. Our focus solely was on where employees are asked to contribute to their retirement. And as we previously pointed out, Florida has the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, according to the state Department of Management Services. The national average was $72 per resident.

Which brings us back to Scott's statement. In a meeting with state legislators, Scott suggested the state might save money by requiring state employees to contribute to their own retirement. Specifically, he said, that Florida is ""the only state in the country"" where government workers are not required to help fund their retirement.

Scott is largely on the mark.

Florida will be the only state, starting Jan. 1, 2011, where no one in the state retirement system is asked to contribute toward their pension. Two states -- Virginia and Missouri -- recently switched their retirement system meaning new hires will have to pay toward their retirement, but not existing employees. Michigan doesn't force its employees to participate either, but that state has a more private-sector-like 401(k) program. And Tennessee and Utah still do not require many of their state employees to contribute toward retirement, although other employees in those states do.

Barack Obama compares legal battle over health care to 1930s fight over Social Security
","
During a White House interview with Tampa's WFLA-TV on Dec. 13, 2010, President Barack Obama reacted to a decision earlier that day to strike down a key portion of the health care law passed earlier this year. In the recently announced ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson of Virginia declared unconstitutional the law's requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or face a penalty.

In the interview, Keith Cate, an anchor at NBC affiliate News Channel 8, asked the president for his thoughts on the ruling. Obama began by noting that other lower courts had issued more favorable rulings, and that the issue was destined to go through additional legal steps on its way to the Supreme Court.

""That's the nature of these things,"" Obama said. ""When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. When the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits.""

In this item, we'll focus on the Social Security Act, in part because we thought we'd give the president a second chance after earning a False from us on a different comment about the early history of Social Security.

It turns out that in his second historical comment, the president was accurate. Even though American society was less litigious in the 1930s, the creation of Social Security -- which is a landmark moment in the history of the federal government -- did attract not just one lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court, but three. And as we looked deeper into the history of the legal battle over Social Security, the more we noticed how much its details echo the battle playing out now over the health care law. So we'll provide an overview of the history here, in which we rely heavily on by an official history of the period written in 1999 by Social Security Administration historian Larry DeWitt.

""Even though the Social Security Act was enacted into law on August 14, 1935, the country still had to hear from the Supreme Court,"" DeWitt wrote. ""This was a new, untested area of federal authority and it was inevitable that it would be challenged in the courts, and until the Supreme Court ruled, no one could be sure that the nascent Social Security Act would survive its infancy.""

DeWitt noted that under the 10th Amendment, powers not given to the federal government are left to the states or the people, so the federal government, in its defense of the Social Security Act, would have to find justification in the Constitution for the expansion of its powers. Even before the Social Security Act was passed, other parts of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- the cluster of programs designed to alleviate the Great Depression -- had been subject to legal attacks and in some cases were ruled unconstitutional by lower courts for overstepping federal powers, just as one of the requirements of the health care law has been.

In 1935 and 1936, a sharply divided Supreme Court -- split between three liberals, four conservatives and two swing votes -- invalidated the Railroad Retirement Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The defeat of three pillars of the New Deal drove Roosevelt to propose, in early 1937, an ill-fated ""court-packing"" scheme in which he would expand the number of justices, thus shifting the court's ideological complexion in his direction.

The proposal was soundly defeated by Congress, with significant collateral damage to Roosevelt's standing with the public and historians. But beginning in March 1937, one of the swing justices, Owen Roberts, shifted from the opponents' camp to become a supporter of New Deal programs, enabling a minimum wage law, the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act to stand.

Three specific cases attacking Social Security reached the Supreme Court. In one, the Steward Machine Company case, the company sued over having to pay unemployment insurance tax under the law. Another case, Carmichael vs. Southern Coal & Coke Co. and Gulf States Paper, challenged a different facet of the unemployment provision having to do with the states.

But the most directly relevant for Obama's comment was Helvering vs. Davis, in which George P. Davis, a minority stockholder in an electric company, objected to being forced to pay the payroll tax that funded the old-age insurance program. The administration, represented by Internal Revenue Service commissioner Guy T. Helvering, filed suit to force compliance.

""The attorneys for Davis argued that the payroll tax was a new type of tax not listed in the Constitution's tally of taxes, and so it was unconstitutional,"" DeWitt wrote. 
""At one point they even introduced into their argument the definitions of 'taxes' from dictionaries in 1788 (the year before the Constitution was ratified) to prove how earnest they were in the belief that powers not explicitly granted in 1789 could not be created in 1935. Davis was also of the view that providing for the general welfare of the aged was a power reserved to the states.""

This sounds to us a lot like some of the arguments in the health care case, which revolves around the question of whether the federal government is justified in imposing a tax-based penalty on Americans who refuse to sign up for health care coverage.

The high court handed down its decision on May 24, 1937. Reflecting a divisive debate in Congress and among the justices, the Court upheld the unemployment-insurance provision by a narrow, 5-4 vote. But in the old-age insurance, the Roosevelt administration won a resounding 7-2 victory, without even a written dissent by the dissenters.

In his majority opinion in Helvering vs. Davis, Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote that the Great Depression was a national problem that demanded national solutions. ""The ill is all one or at least not greatly different whether men are thrown out of work because there is no longer work to do or because the disabilities of age make them incapable of doing it,"" Cardozo wrote. ""Rescue becomes necessary irrespective of the cause. The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey's end is near.""

Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Obama has a point that there are similarities between the legal battle over Social Security and the fight over the health care law.

""Like the Affordable Care Act, the Social Security Act was subject to constitutional challenges, lower courts reached conflicting conclusions, and the issue was not resolved until the cases reached the Supreme Court,"" he said. If the recent past is any guide, the court that eventually takes up the health care law, led by another Justice Roberts, will also be one with a close ideological divide.

Of course, there are limits to the comparison.

""The fact that there are all kinds of lawsuits challenging X, which was eventually upheld, obviously does not mean that every other law that is challenged by all kinds of lawsuits will also be eventually upheld,"" said Stuart Taylor, a veteran commentator on the Supreme Court.

Taylor added that while many of the broader themes are similar, the specific legal arguments are not identical. ""The issue at the heart of the health care individual mandate -- whether the government can, in the name of regulating interstate commerce, require individuals to buy a commercial product simply because they were born and they live in this country -- was raised neither by the Social Security cases nor by any other case in the nation's history,"" Taylor said. ""Also, while one can plausibly defend the individual mandate's enforcement provision as a tax in support of the general welfare, like the Social Security tax, that argument is somewhat undermined by the facts that the President and Congress strenuously denied that the mandate is a tax in order to get it passed and that the law itself was changed to call it a penalty, not a tax.""

So, Obama's comparison is not exact. But there are some striking similarities, so -- unlike in our previous item -- we think the president was justified in making the broad comparison. And on the narrow question of whether ""there were all kinds of lawsuits"" when Social Security was passed, we rate Obama's statement True.",/factchecks/2010/dec/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-compares-legal-battle-over-health-car/
"['Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says Sen. Jim Webb negates votes of Sen. Mark Warner
","
Former U.S. Sen. George Allen is taking aim at a rival who took away his seat in 2006, Sen. Jim Webb.

In a Dec. 9 news release, Allen criticizes Webb for breaking with Virginia's junior senator, Democrat Mark Warner on two recent votes. Webb opposed banning earmarks and backed an unsuccessful effort to advance legislation that would give police and firefighters’ unions collective bargaining rights.

Allen, a Republican, is considering a 2012 rematch with Webb. He says Webb, a Democrat, ""canceled out Senator Warner’s"" votes and ""denied our commonwealth a voice in the Senate.""  

Allen writes: ""No one expects both of our Senators to agree all the time, but when one persists on negating the other, the will of a vast majority of Virginians is ignored, and the Commonwealth is bumped from a leadership role and onto the sidelines.""

We looked at Allen’s assertion that Webb ""persists on negating"" Warner’s votes.

The Oxford Dictionary offers this definition for the verb persist : ""Continue firmly or obstinately in an opinion or a course of action in spite of difficulty, opposition, or failure.""

Has Webb really established a pattern of parting with his fellow Virginia senator and party mate?

We went to the voting records.

According to Open Congress’s head-to-head comparison, the two senators have voted together 727 times time since Warner took office in January 2009, or 87 percent of the time. That’s 2 percentage points shy of the average voting similarity for Democrat senators -- 89 percent.

So it seems hard to support the assertion that Webb ""persists on negating"" Warner while voting with him almost nine times out of 10.  

""Webb votes far more often with his fellow Democrat Warner than not, said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of public policy at George Mason University. ""Picking a few issues of differences does not prove that the senators are marching in opposite directions.""

""But so what if they disagree some times?"" he added. ""Allen's argument is frankly silly. Are two senators supposed to vote as a unit on each issue merely because they are from the same state? Our electoral system never anticipated unity of state delegations. Let's say the House delegation from Virginia goes 6-5 on some issue. Does that mean that 10 members canceled each other out and only one mattered?""

Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, agreed.

""It is highly misleading to suggest that Webb ‘persists’ in negating Warner,"" he said. ""The Senate’s roll call records clearly show this is not true.""  

Republican Senators vote together 78 percent of the time on average, according to Open Congress. So it would seem that there’s even more ""negating"" occurring on the other side of the aisle. Democrat and Republican senators average a 46 percent voting similarity.

""The unusual twist here is that this is a tactic most often employed in a state when one senator is a Republican and the other senator a Democrat,"" Sabato said of Allen’s attack.  ""The irony is that the charge would almost certainly be accurate if the two Virginia senators were named Mark Warner and George Allen.""

Sabato’s point : If Allen were elected to replace Webb in 2012, the chances are nearly 100 percent that Warner and Allen would cancel out each other’s votes on the Senate floor far more often than do Warner and Webb.

Just as point of interest, Webb votes with his party 85 percent of the time while Warner votes with party 91 percent of the time.

So it’s clear that Allen is wrong to say that Webb persists in negating Warner based on total voting records. But maybe he’s pointing to a more recent trend.  

Since Congress reconvened in November after a recess,  the two Virginia senators have both voted on 22 measures, differing on four of them (two of which are the basis for Allen’s claim). They agreed 82 percent of the time.

That’s lightly lower than their average, but hardly a persistent disagreement.

What about key votes?

The senators voted together on health-care reform, the 2009 Stimulus bill, the Pay-As-You-Go Act increasing the statutory limit on the public debt, the HIRE Act, or Senate jobs bill, and most recently on the National Defense Authorization Act for FY11 (including the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell) and the Dream Act.

Not a lot of division on big issues.

How about the suggestion that casting a differing vote is ""negating"" Warner’s, thereby robbing the Commonwealth of a voice?

Couple problems there.

1) Why is Webb the one negating Warner? Couldn’t Warner just as easily be negating Webb?

2) Oxford defines ""negate"" as ""nullify; make ineffective."" Is a vote nullified or made ineffective just because one senator voted another way? Of course not. Virginia is not a sovereign federal entity in which legislation only affects the commonwealth if both of the state’s senators agree.

""The constitutional framers created two senators from each state and staggered election cycles in part to ensure there would be different voices, which leads to better representation,"" Rozell noted.

""Without independent judgment by each senator, why not just have one senator from each state?"" Sabato said. ""The assertion that one vote ‘negates’ the other is simplistic, obviously, since the real goal is to achieve 51 votes (most floor measures) or 60 votes (to shut off a filibuster and proceed to a vote) or 67 votes (treaties and impeachment convictions), depending on the circumstances.""

Let’s recap:

On the basis of two votes upon which Virginia’s two senators differed, Allen claims that Webb has established a pattern of canceling out Warner’s votes, thereby neutralizing Virginia’s voice in the Senate.  

The argument is deeply flawed. Webb and Warner vote together 87 percent of the time, and rarely differ on key votes. Were a Republican to replace Webb, that percentage would undoubtedly plummet.   

Disagreeing doesn’t deny Virginia a voice in the Senate, it merely offers two opposing ones.

We find the claim to be False.  ",/factchecks/2010/dec/15/george-allen/george-allen-says-sen-jim-webb-negates-votes-sen-m/
