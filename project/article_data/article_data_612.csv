State Rep. Mike Foley says Ohio led the nation in job losses for March
","
During budget debates in the Ohio House, Democrats portrayed themselves as the defenders of middle-income Ohioans, announcing a plan they called their Targeted Middle Class Tax Cut. 
The plan, which majority Republicans did not include in the budget, was the brainchild of Reps. Mike Foley of Cleveland and John Patrick Carney of Columbus. The two Democrats announced their plan in the wake of new job figures which they said showed that Republican Gov. John Kasich’s economic policies aren't working. 
In a news release posted to his House webpages, Foley cited the job figures and claimed that Ohio lost more than 20,400 jobs in March, and that those losses were the largest of any state in the nation. 
PolitiFact Ohio decided to check his claim. 
We asked Foley’s staff to support his statement, and also checked ourselves with the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, home of a vast array of jobs data. Foley’s staff provided a news article from The Plain Dealer that relied on data from BLS and the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. 
In March, according to BLS estimates, the seasonally adjusted estimate for the total number of non-farm jobs in Ohio was 5,176,900 jobs. That represents a loss of about 20,400 from the previous month, just as Foley said. 
You have to go back to June 2009, the month the recession officially ended, to find a greater monthly figure. That month about 33,000 jobs were lost. In April 2009, Ohio lost more than 44,000 jobs, the worst monthly performance so farin this century. 
But the March 2013 figure also is small enough that it did not change the unemployment rate. That remained 7.1 percent, just as it was in February, according to the state Department of Job and Family Services. 
So how did Ohio stack up against the rest of the nation? 
Foley’s claim cites a raw number (rather than a percentage), which means Ohio’s size could come into play. The Buckeye State is the seventh most populous in the nation. 
But did it lead the nation in job losses?   
After all, California, with more than three times Ohio’s population, has a much larger economy. Texas has more than double the people. And New York and Florida, Nos. 3 and 4, each have populations more than 60 percent greater than Ohio. 
BLS figures show Ohio did indeed lose the most jobs. 
Nonfarm employment decreased in 26 states and the District of Columbia. It increased in 23 states. New Mexico was unchanged. 
The largest increases were in Florida, which added 32,700 jobs, and California, which gained. 25,500. The largest decreases were in Ohio (-20,400) and Illinois (-17,800). 
In Ohio, the industries posting big losses in March included leisure and hospitality (down 6,000 jobs), professional and business services (down 4,300 jobs) and construction (down 3,300 jobs), according to Job and Family Services.Even the category including health services posted a 2,500 decline. 
""That is extremely unusual. That has been our best growth sector for decades,"" economic research analyst George Zeller told The Plain Dealer. 
A bright spot was manufacturing, which has fueled the recovery in Ohio and gained 1,800 jobs. 
It is also worth noting that the March job losses were preceded by three months in a row of job gains. And so far this year, the state still is showing a net job gain.The state lost jobs during four months of 2012, but nothing on the scale of March’s decline. 
Foley, in his news release, said that Ohio lost 20,400 jobs in March and that it led the nation in jobs lost. 
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms both the number of jobs lost, albeit an estimate, and that Ohio lost more than any other state. Foley’s statement is accurate, although he is focusing on a month in which the number of job losses is unusually high. 

With that point of clarification, on the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.","[('\nOhio House of Representatives, ""Dem Lawmakers Introduce Targeted Middle Class Tax Cut In The Wake Of 20,400 Ohio Jobs Lost In March,"" posted by Rep.

Roberts lays out financial costs of modern wars
","
President Barack Obama is doing his best to fend off characterization as a ""lame-duck"" leader, a moniker that typically plagues term-limited elected officials. 
In his case, Obama has implied that it’s the unyielding Republicans refusing to compromise on issues like gun control and undoing sequestration cuts that prevent him from furthering his agenda. 
Political pundits took up the issue again this month on the ABC television news program ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos."" The roundtable panel debated whether the president can get anything done. 
""With the public being so completely disillusioned with American wars abroad that have gone on for so long … these wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost every American family something like $45,000, not to mention, of course, the lives,"" said ABC and NPR political contributor Cokie Roberts. ""It really takes the whole foreign policy option off the table when Americans say they don’t want to have our troops engaged in another war."" 
Since the beginning of the wars, there has been no shortage of claims about the financial costs to the average American, American families and even Americans who haven’t been born yet. 
Roberts’ figure was the latest we’d heard, so PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. 
Roberts told PolitiFact Georgia that she got her figure within the past two weeks directly from Zbigniew Brzezinski, former President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. 
In the past, wars were financed by war bonds or by raising taxes. Current wars have been funded almost entirely by borrowing, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Cost of War Project housed at Brown University. 
We found various sources that have studied war costs. Some factor in future benefit costs and debt repayment; others include only funds that have been spent and approved by Congress. 
Two recent studies, both published this year, estimate the cost of the two wars has reached $4 trillion. The first, published in March by Harvard professor Linda Bilmes, found that the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts will be the most expensive wars in U.S. history, totaling between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Along with traditional war costs such as weapons and equipment, Bilmes’ study included long-term medical and disability costs for service members and their families. 
The second study, by the Cost of War Project, lists current spending, including interest paid on war debt, through fiscal 2013 at $3.1 trillion. Add in future veterans’ obligations, and the amount reaches about $4 trillion. The amount could rise much higher based on future interest payments. 
Census data reports almost 115 million households existed in the country from 2007-2011, according to the most recent data. 
At $4 trillion, each of the 115 million households would be responsible for just under $35,000 of the war costs. At $6 trillion, the household responsibility would rise to around $52,000. 
Roberts’ claim initially seemed a bit high, but is in the range of estimates based on the most recent studies, said Christopher A. Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. 
""I think it’s essential to give a full picture of costs (including debt service and future veterans’ benefits and expenses),"" Preble said. ""Don’t assume the cost of war ends when the shooting stops."" 
Other studies don’t factor in these long-term costs. 
The National Priorities Project operates the Cost of War website, which keeps a running total of the costs for both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This past week, the constantly increasing total had reached over $1.4 trillion. Based on that figure, each of the country’s households would be responsible for around $12,300 in war costs thus far. Data from the Congressional Budget Office also shows that about $1.4 trillion has been approved for the wars, including some funds for veterans’ benefits and services. 
National Priorities, a nonprofit organization that analyzes the federal budget, includes only funds that have been appropriated by the government that can be found in appropriations documents. The site makes no attempt to project future costs, such as veterans’ benefits and medical costs. 
""There are a lot of people who think that is a component,"" said Chris Hellman, a senior research analyst with National Priorities. ""We acknowledge that this is a growing edge of what our nation’s commitment is, but we look only at the narrowly construed combat operations and related support costs of the wars."" 
A website feature provides the amount of the $1.4 trillion that taxpayers in each state, county and major city have paid toward the wars, and also provides a list of services that could have been provided for the same amount of money. (For example, Georgia taxpayers have contributed $35.6 billion, which could have also funded 721,000 police officers, or 4.8 million Head Start slots, or 4.7 million college scholarships, etc., for one year.) 
So, do Roberts’ numbers add up? 
Her claim that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have cost each U.S. household $45,000 would mean that war spending -- including future veterans’ benefits and debt service costs -- would have to be about $5.2 trillion. 
The most recent studies that include these long-term costs report war spending between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Studies that do not include the long-term costs list war costs at $1.4 trillion thus far in funds that have been approved by Congress. 
Assuming Roberts’ claim factored in future expenses, her claim would fall in the appropriate range of estimated spending. But leave those out, and she comes up short. 
Her claim is partially accurate, but needs a lot of context to be fully understood. 
We rate Roberts’ claim Half True.","[('\n""This Week With George Stephanopoulos,"" May 5, 2013, episode', 'https://abcnews.go.com/watch/this-week/SH559082/VDKA0_abs21050/this-week-0505-does-president-obama-face-lame-duck-second-term'), ('\nWashington Post, President Barack Obama’s April 30, 2013, news conference, transcript', 'No link'), ('\n""The Financial Legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Linda Bilmes, Harvard’s John F.

"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie implemented merit pay for teachers, best funding 'ever' for education, ad claims
","Chris Christie’s earned a top grade for his efforts to reward teachers and fund education in New Jersey, according to claims in a new TV ad. The ad, released May 1 by the group Christie for Governor, cites a number of achievements that have resulted from Christie’s leadership since he took the state’s reins in January 2010. ""Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever,"" a narrator states as scenes from around New Jersey flash in the background. We fact-checked the claims about balanced budgets, taxes and job growth on Thursday. Today we’re looking at the ad’s education claims. Let’s review those claims in more detail, starting with merit pay. Christie’s intent may be to give the state’s best teachers merit pay, but the program is unavailable to the vast majority of teachers in New Jersey’s 588 school districts. So far only Newark has merit pay, which the teachers union approved in November. The three-year pact awards bonuses to teachers earning the classification ""highly effective"" under a new rating system. The Newark deal is the first of its kind in New Jersey and the nation to base teacher pay on classroom performance, including student progress. In addition, four low-income districts -- Asbury Park, Hillside, Lakewood and North Plainfield -- would be eligible for merit pay through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Teacher Innovation Fund. Rutgers University would administer the nearly $40 million grant over five years to improve educator recruitment, evaluation and rewards programs. The state Department of Education is expected to roll out a teacher evaluation system this fall. So merit pay has been approved for one district in New Jersey, and could eventually apply to teachers in four other districts. That’s not exactly rewarding New Jersey’s best teachers. ""Christie’s ad clearly gives the impression that this is a statewide issue,"" New Jersey Education Association spokesman Steve Wollmer said in an e-mail. It’s worth noting that although Christie supports merit pay for teachers, a bill allowing it has been stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature since last fall. The NJEA also opposes merit pay. As for ""most education funding ever,"" Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget calls for nearly $9 billion in education funding, about $1 billion more than the previous year. State aid to schools would increase $97 million. While no district saw a state aid decrease, many either received a nominal increase of $1 or their funding remained flat. Wollmer agreed that in terms of dollars, the ad’s claim is correct, but points out that there’s more to Christie’s education funding story. ""But what he doesn’t mention is that he cut $1.3 billion from state aid in his first year – Withholding $475 million in aid in January, which was the amount that the state’s nearly 600 districts had in total surpluses for unanticipated expenses (a new roof, a bus that needed replacing, an unanticipated special ed placement), and another $820 million in the FY11 budget (which began for schools in September of 2010),"" Wollmer said. ""Districts cut back dramatically, and 10,000 teachers and staff were laid off, programs were cut, and class sizes increased."" The state Supreme Court in 2011 also ordered Christie to increase aid to the now-former Abbott districts by about $500 million. Our ruling A new TV ad for Christie’s re-election campaign claims in part, ""Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever."" The merit pay claim comes across as being available statewide, but so far, the program only applies to teachers in Newark. Of the state’s 588 school districts, four others could offer merit pay eventually. Also, Christie may have a history of slashing education funding as a way to close budget holes, but the ad’s claim about the most education funding, ever, is correct. We rate this portion of the ad’s claims Half True.

Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck says Providence spent $50,000 in one year notifying schools about sex offenders living in the vicinity
","Rhode Island state law and state Parole Board guidelines say residents in the community must be notified if a Level 2 or Level 3 (moderate or high-risk) sex offender is living in their neighborhood. Notifications are also supposed to be sent to schools, police departments,  daycare centers and community organizations that might have contact with the offender. The costs associated with that requirement were raised at an April 11 hearing before the House Finance Committee. At issue was House bill 5557, submitted at the request of the attorney general's office, which would revise the state's sex offender registry system to comply with federal guidelines. Under the bill, responsibility for notifying residents, schools, community organizations and businesses such as daycare centers about sex offenders living in the vicinity would shift from city and town police departments to the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, which includes the state police. During the hearing, two witnesses made interesting comments about how the proposal would cut notification costs for cities and towns. One was Rep. Peter Palumbo, D-Cranston, whose statement is being fact-checked separately. The other -- and the subject of this item -- was Joee (pronounced Joey) Lindbeck, a special assistant attorney general who heads the office's Legislation and Policy Unit. ""Two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the School Department"" about sex offenders. ""This act would allow for e-mail notification alone,"" she said. That seemed like a lot of money, so we decided to check that portion of her statement. Because the data came from a report from the attorney general’s office, we made that our first stop. That office sent us a 2012 PowerPoint presentation that included cost estimates from several communities. There was quite a range. We've ranked the communities by the number of current Level 2 and Level 3 offenders (listed in parentheses) because a community that tends to have more offenders is going to have to spend more. It's important to note that the number of offenders may have been different when these cost estimates were developed and that some may have ended up back in the Adult Correctional Institutions on a new charge or violating probation after they registered.   Per notification Per year Providence (163) $50,000 Cranston (124) $9,137 Pawtucket (39) $3,261 Woonsocket (38) $1,500 West Warwick (16) $22,784 Central Falls (16) $123 Warwick (15) $1,365 Coventry (11) $5,657 Cumberland (5) $4,000 Newport (4) $2,000 West Greenwich (4) $2,000 Johnston (3) $11,000 Hopkinton (3) $2,550 Smithfield (2) ""Minimal"" Middletown (1) $1,000 Richmond (0) $1,000   When we asked about the source of the Providence number, the attorney general's office produced a memo from Police Chief Hugh Clements reporting the cost was ""approximately $50,000 [that year] for the registry and notifications. [Detective Teddy Michael] indicated that the bulk of the cost is related to the notifications to the schools."" Providence currently has 39 schools. So the $50,000 was not just for school notifications, although most of it was. David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Angel Taveras, said the total was $65,000 in 2009, $36,000 in 2010 and $55,000 in 2011. How much of that was spent on school notifications? Ortiz referred us to the Police Department, where Detective Sgt. Philip Hartnett, recently put in charge of Providence police's special victims unit, said firm numbers are not available. He said Detective Michael estimated that the schools took up roughly 60 percent to 65 percent of the money. The costs were high, Hartnett said, because in 2011, the department has routinely sent notices to individual homes of students, although it was not required. ""There are 26,000 students in Providence and it had to be something like that two years ago,"" he said. ""I was amazed by that myself, but it was out of an abundance of caution. The law actually says to notify the schools. They took the step to notify the parents of all the students."" Christina O'Reilly, spokeswoman for the Providence School Department, said when it gets a notice from police, it generates labels for all the students attending each school located within a half mile of a Level 2 offender or within one mile of a Level 3 offender. The labels go to the Police Department, which sends out the mailings, 45 of which have gone out since September. Bus drivers and principals are also notified by the School Department. Hartnett said there are efforts underway to streamline the system. ""Now we are trying to set up an automated telephone system so that a call would go out to each student when we notify the school."" The department was also trying to come up with posters, but with so many sex offenders to track in Providence, the posters quickly became outdated, he said. As Lindbeck told us, ""The real problem is, they move so much and you have to redo this every time they move."" Our ruling Special Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck testified that ""two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the School Department"" about residents in the state's sex offender registry. She was correctly quoting a memo regarding the approximate dollar amount but incorrectly attributed all of the spending on notifications to the School Department. On the one hand, everyone we spoke with said the biggest chunk of money went for school notifications. On the other, it's clear from the people with whom we spoke that a significant chunk of that money went to notifying other entities as well. We rate her statement Half True.

R.I. State Rep. Peter Palumbo says it costs $5,000 to $6,000 to warn Cranston neighbors that a Level 3 sex offender lives in their area
","
Rhode Island state law requires officials to notify neighbors when dangerous sex offenders move into their community. Under a bill proposed by the attorney general’s office, the responsibility for making those notifications would move from cities and towns to the state. 
During an April 11 hearing on the proposal, House bill 5557, there was discussion of the current cost. (We've written about one such statement by Special Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck in a separate item.) 
Rep. Peter Palumbo, D-Cranston, the bill's chief sponsor, said the change would save money for municipal government because their notification costs would disappear. 
""I know [in] the city of Cranston it's somewhere between $5,000 and $6,000, I believe, per Level 3 registered offender,"" he said. ""That's what it's costing now to notify the people in the neighborhoods if we have a Level 3 sex offender in there."" Level 3 offenders are regarded as most likely to get into trouble again. 
The state's website listing sex offenders shows 52 Level 3 offenders registered in Cranston. If Palumbo’s claim were true, the city must be spending a lot of money on notifications. 
(That doesn't mean authorities had to make 52 notifications. Police only have to warn residents, schools, community organizations and other groups when an offender moves into the area.) 
When we checked Palumbo’s figures with the attorney general's office, it listed Cranston as having spent just $9,137 for 2011. That would be barely enough for two Level 3 notifications if his numbers were correct. 
So we went to Cranston Police Chief Marco Palombo to try to reconcile the numbers. The chief sent us a detailed accounting. 
In 2011, the department sent out notifications for seven Level 2 and four Level 3 sex offenders at a total cost of $7,203. (The chief said the $9,137 figure included registration costs.)   
Based on the accounting, that averages out to $655 per offender. The costs were similar whether the offender was designated Level 2 or Level 3. 
So when Representative Palumbo said that it cost between $5,000 and $6,000 to notify people that a registered Level 3 sex offender has moved into a Cranston neighborhood, his estimate was about eight times too high. 
We rate the claim False.

Would Portland teachers have no pay increase for four years, frozen wages for seven years?
","
Oregon’s largest school district and its teachers are bargaining over a new contract, with the expiration of its current contract at the end of June. Portland Public Schools is offering a four-year contract with no cost-of-living adjustments. Portland Association of Teachers would like a two-year contract with COLA increases of about 3.5 percent each year. 
The claim: The union had some tart words for the school district’s offer: 
""Did you know that if you accepted the District's proposal today, you would have NO pay increase for 4 YEARS? 7 years of frozen wages = Disrespect,"" reads the April 25, 2013 bargaining brief newsletter for members. 
The analysis: PolitiFact Oregon can’t weigh in on whether this amounts to disrespect by the district, but we can fact check whether the district’s proposal amounts to four years of ""no pay increase"" and seven years of frozen wages for teachers. In fact, Robb Cowie, spokesman for Portland Schools, urged us to do so. 
Teachers at Portland Public are on a multi-step salary schedule, with starting salary based on education. For example, the 2012-13 schedule calls for a salary of $35,886 for a teacher with a bachelor’s degree. From there, the teacher moves up a ""step"" every year to reach a top pay of $54,020 in the 13th year -- although chances are good that by then, that dollar amount will be higher. (Teachers at the upper end would start at $48,837 and in the 13th year, start making an annual salary of $73,101.) 
The yearly step increases aren’t anything to sneeze at. Those raises are about 3.4 percent every year. 
The across-the-board cost-of-living adjustments are what bump up the salaries contained in the steps from one year to the next. Otherwise the starting salary for that first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree -- or the teacher with a master’s degree -- may never change. 
Again, here’s an example. The last time teachers received an across-the-board raise was in the 2010-11 school year; all the ""steps"" increased 2 percent. So a teacher with a master’s degree who might have moved from $41,955 in the 2009-10 school year to $43,383 in 2010-11 would instead earn $44,251 starting July 2010. 
About 51 percent of Portland teachers are at the top step, meaning that their salaries stay the same unless the district gives cost-of-living raises or adds another step to the top. It is true that teachers who have topped out would have no pay increase for four years under the district’s offer. 
But 49 percent of teachers would continue to see pay go up, because they move automatically up the steps. The actual percentage of teachers who reach the top may fluctuate, of course, but not that wildly, according to historic data. 
PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t track down Marty Pavlik, a consultant with the Portland Association of Teachers, who in earlier interviews defended teachers as real people with escalating bills to pay. Instead, we spoke with Gwen Sullivan, union president. She said the newsletter is intended for members, who know exactly what is meant by ""no pay increase."" That means no cost-of-living adjustments, she said, and teachers should be compensated for experience as well as inflation. 
That may be so. But a step increase of 3.4 percent is undeniably a pay increase, for the teachers who qualify. 
Let’s turn to the second part of the statement, that teachers will have had seven years of frozen wages under the district’s offer. As we’ve said, the last time teachers received a COLA increase was in July 2010, right when this seven-year time period begins. We find that to be selective cherry picking of a time period by the union. 
The statement also ignores the fact that teachers at the top received an additional step in this school year, which amounted to a 2 percent pay raise. It’s true that teachers agreed to delay step raises by half a year in order to shore up this current budget. But still, even the district’s most veteran teachers will have seen a raise within the seven-year period, despite assertions by the union. 
The ruling: Hey, what’s the saying? All’s fair in love and in labor negotiations? PolitiFact Oregon says make the most impassioned pitch for your side when bargaining. But this statement by the Portland teachers union is missing some key facts. At best the union’s assertion that teachers would have had ""NO pay increase for 4 YEARS"" is Half True, as it applies to half of the teaching body. Its second assertion of seven years of frozen wages is False. Which gets us to Mostly False. 
We’ll explain this another way. There’s a bit of truth in the assertion -- some teachers will have no pay increase for four years if this offer is accepted. But the statement ignores step raises, a 2 percent across-the-board raise in 2010, and the addition of a top step this school year -- also known in PolitiFact lingo as critical facts that would give a different impression. We rule the statement Mostly False.

Greg Abbott says he has sued Obama administration 25 times
","
Here’s a typical workday for Texas’ attorney general: ""I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home,"" Greg Abbott was quoted as saying to a tea party group in an April 30, 2013, Associated Press news story. 
Speaking to FreedomWorks Texas in Austin on April 27, Abbott said, ""I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times, over the last four years."" 
Last fall, the Associated Press tallied two dozen: Abbott ""has filed 24 lawsuits against the federal government since Obama took office — litigation that has cost the state $2.58 million and more than 14,113 hours spent by staff and state lawyers working those cases,"" said a Sept. 9, 2012, news story. 
Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us an updated list of Texas’ lawsuits against the federal government: three during President George W. Bush’s tenure and 27 since President Barack Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009, inauguration. (Abbott himself was sworn in Dec. 2, 2002.) 
Outcomes of the 27 Obama-era lawsuits, by our count: five clear-cut ""wins,"" eight ""losses,"" four cases in which Texas agreed to dismiss its case when circumstances changed, nine cases in progress -- and one that could be called a partial win, perhaps: 2010’s 26-state challenge to Obamacare that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care, but states could not be required to expand Medicaid. 
Abbott’s staff, Bean said, would count eight ""wins"" during the Obama administration, including the Medicaid decision and two dismissals in which ""the state got what it wanted."" Bean noted all but one ""win"" are final (can no longer be appealed) and of the eight ""losses,"" she said, six are being appealed and one could be appealed. 
In our count of five ""wins,"" four lawsuits were against the Environmental Protection Agency and one against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EPA has appealed one ruling to the Supreme Court, and FERC filed for a clarification of the judgment in its case. 
In most of the 27 cases, Texas was the lead plaintiff or only plaintiff. These included lawsuits in which Abbott was acting at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Bean said, ""We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client."" 
Twice, Texas was originally listed among other states but not as the lead plaintiff, and in 11 cases Texas and other states or parties filed similar lawsuits that were bundled together by the courts sometimes resulting in Texas not being listed as the lead, or original, plaintiff. 
Both cases in which Texas was an original plaintiff but not the lead plaintiff involved challenges to Obamacare: the 2010 lawsuit by 26 states that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care and the 2012 case in which seven states sued over a requirement that religious employers offer insurance covering certain birth control methods. 
For perspective, we reached Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs at the University of Texas Law School with a specialty in empirical legal studies. Lindquist told us by phone that she would not attach much significance to those circumstances when trying to determine whether Texas was itself suing the federal government agency. 
""This is situations where they’re actually named parties in the suit,"" she said, rather than, for example, filing a brief lending support to one side. 
States’ attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, she said, as in the Obamacare lawsuit that eventually included 26 states. (Texas was among 14 states listed as plaintiffs in the original suit, filed by Florida.) 
""They’re lending resources, so it’s not that Texas is not a real litigant,"" Lindquist said. Even when later joining other plaintiffs, she said, ""I don’t think that means they’re not a plaintiff, I just think it means they’re one of many."" 
Democratic activist Matt Angle, whom we asked to weigh in, did object to Abbott’s inclusion of the two multi-state Obamacare lawsuits. But he raised a larger objection: the inclusion of two cases in which Texas sought preclearance under the federal Voting Rights Act for changes to its voting process. 
Angle, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Lone Star Project, told us by email that in filing these suits, Abbott ""took action as a defensive and not offensive tactic. ... No way he should get credit in these two instances."" 
Under the Voting Rights Act, governments in certain jurisdictions (notably, several Southern states) where minority voter turnout was previously low must get federal clearance before changes in voting laws can take effect. 
To get that clearance, Lindquist said, ""you have a choice of two different avenues. One is you can request the preclearance of the election law change with the Department of Justice via letter. … Or, you can go to court to seek the preclearance"" by the action of filing a lawsuit. 
During the Obama administration, Texas has sought preclearance twice in high-profile cases -- in 2011, for redrawn legislative voting districts, and in 2012, for a measure requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. 
In those cases, Lindquist said, ""to say yes, that the State of Texas sued the government, yes that’s true.""  But looking at the main purpose of such suits, she said, ""it’s not quite the same as suing the government to force the government to change its behavior. They’re suing the federal government to seek preclearance under a federal law, and they’re just going to a different forum to do it."" 
Our ruling 
Abbott said, ""I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times."" Since Obama became president, Texas has filed or been a party to 27 lawsuits against the federal government. This statement is True.","[('\nAssociated Press news story, ""Abbott trumpeting his conservative credentials,"" April 30, 2013', 'https://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TX_ABBOTT_RUNNING_RIGHT_TXOL-?SITE=TXCOR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT'), ('\nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott, remarks to FreedomWorks Texas summit, Austin, April 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nAssociated Press news story, ""Texas spends big bucks suing federal government on state issues,"" Sept. 9, 2012', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21vo_BaOLhs'), ('\nTexas Attorney General’s Office document, ""Suits Filed by the State of Texas Against a Federal Agency December 2002 through Present,"" received May 8, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nTelephone and email interviews, excerpted, with Lauren Bean, deputy communications director, Texas Attorney General’s Office, May 3-10, 2013', 'http://m.lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2012-09-09/texas-spends-big-bucks-suing-federal-government'), ('\nEmail interviews, excerpted, Matt Angle, Lone Star Project, May 6-9, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nTelephone interview, Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs, University of Texas Law School, May 9, 2013', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2Wzr4_cemD5VzE3enJ2NEVBQnM/edit?usp=sharing')]",/factchecks/2013/may/10/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-he-has-sued-obama-administration-/

Wisconsin bill to limit use of food stamps for junk food would restrict organic foods, Democratic lawmaker says
","
State Rep. Dean Kaufert said he was after things like soda and nachos when he proposed to limit how much junk food Wisconsinites could buy with food stamps. 
""Hopefully, people’s health will get better,"" the Neenah Republican said in March 2013. 
But when the former potato chip salesman’s bill came up May 7, 2013, for a vote, there were signs of indigestion on the Assembly floor in Madison. 
""The list of foods that you'd be restricted from buying under this is -- I don't know who came up with it. I think it's kind of shocking,"" complained Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo. 
Clark continued by saying ""we're going to prevent -- or limit -- the extent to which"" food stamps could be used for a long list of foods -- including organic foods. 
Sure, sugary drinks and melty cheese might sometimes addle our brains. But organic foods are supposed to be better for you, right? 
So, is Clark correct -- would the junk food bill, approved by the Assembly minutes after his comments, prevent or limit the use of food stamps for organic foods? 
The program 
The food stamps program, known formally as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal funds pay for all of the benefits, although the states share the administrative costs with Uncle Sam. 
Food stamps -- actually, it’s a plastic card you can swipe electronically at the store -- are available to working and non-working people who have a low income. The benefits can generally be used to buy any food or food product, but hot foods cooked in the store, as well as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and pet food, are prohibited. 
In Wisconsin, the program is called FoodShare. It serves more than 850,000 adults and children, or 15 percent of the state’s residents, at a cost of more than $1 billion per year. 
Junk-food bill 
To take effect, Kaufert’s bill would need approval not only from the state Senate and Gov. Scott Walker but also the federal government. That's unlikely (for Wisconsin and South Carolina, which is considering a similar measure), Governing magazine suggests, given the USDA has denied every request like Kaufert’s that's been submitted for a federal ""waiver."" 
But let’s get the bill out on the table, anyway. 
Kaufert’s measure does not define junk food; rather, it would require FoodShare recipients to spend at least two-thirds of their benefits on a list of foods deemed by the state as healthy. 
The healthy foods list would have two components. 
It begins with a roster of foods approved by another federal-state food program -- Women, Infants and Children (WIC); then the bill adds some other food types, as well. 
So, where does that leave organic foods? 
Well, since the bill wouldn’t make any changes for one-third of a FoodShare recipient’s benefits, they could be used to buy anything from Funyuns to organic specialty onions. A recipient wouldn’t be prevented from spending all of the one-third on organic foods. 
But for the two-thirds portion of a person’s FoodShare benefits, there would be limits. 
The bill explicitly says fresh produce, including white potatoes, as well as beef, pork, chicken, and fish, would be on the healthy foods list. So, using the two-thirds to buy organic versions of those foods would be OK, unless the state at some point specifically prohibited them, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau.   
On the other hand, WIC benefits can’t be used for organic versions of some foods -- such as milk, cereal, bread and canned or dried peas, beans and lentils. (The government wants to encourage cheaper alternatives to stretch the money beneficiaries receive, according to the state Department of Health Services). Likewise, that means a person on FoodShare couldn’t use the two-thirds portion of their benefits toward those organics, if Kaufert's bill takes effect. 
Got it? 
FoodShare recipients could still use one-third of their benefits on any kind of organic food (or junk food, for that matter). 
But they could use the two-thirds portion only for some kinds of organics. 
Our rating 
Clark said a bill to limit use of food stamps for junk food would also ""prevent -- or limit --  the extent to which"" food stamps could be used for organic foods. 
There would be limits on which types of organic foods a person could buy with two-thirds of their food stamps, but not for the other third. 
The meat-and-potatoes portion of Clark's statement is accurate, but it needs a garnish or two of clarification -- our definition of Mostly True.","[('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Assembly passes bill requiring that most food stamp benefits go to purchasing healthy foods,"" May 7, 2013', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-senate-passes-bill-to-define-criminal-sanctions-for-food-stamp-fraud-bt9s3d3-206446871.html'), ('\nCenter for Media and Democracy’s PR Watch, ""Wisconsin bill would treat organic milk, sharp cheddar, brown eggs as ‘junk food,’"" May 6, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, ""In Context: Lawmaker explains food stamps, junk food plan,"" March 21, 2013', 'http://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/05/12095/wisconsin-bill-would-treat-organic-milk-sharp-cheddar-brown-eggs-junk-food'), ('\nWisconsin Eye, video of Assembly debate (quote at 4:28:30), May 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nE-mail interview, state Rep.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
GOP attacks Barrow on 'Obamacare' votes
","
Call it a pre-emptive strike, guilt by association or just good ol’ fashioned partisan politics. 
The National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a news release shortly after the April 29 debate between the candidates running for a vacant congressional seat in South Carolina. Former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, won the seat Tuesday. 
The committee claimed in its release that Sanford’s opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, was attempting to distance herself from the federal health care law, commonly called ""Obamacare."" 
Here’s the paragraph that drew our interest because of its Georgia connection: 
""ObamaCare has gone from being an ‘abstract’ discussion to a real life pain for families and businesses which has Democrats who supported this costly agenda like Bruce Braley, Mark Pryor, Mark Begich, Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Jeanne Shaheen, John Barrow, Mark Udall, Gary Peters, Al Franken, Mark Warner, Tom Udall, Dick Durbin and Jeff Merkley in a tailspin,"" it stated. 
Barrow, from Augusta, is in his fifth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans have tried hard in recent years to unseat Barrow, who has fashioned himself as a moderate. We wondered about the accuracy of this claim because Barrow voted in 2010 against the creation of the health care law. 
""I am strongly in favor of reforming the health care system, but I don’t think this bill is going to do it, and therefore I can’t support it,"" Barrow said before the vote. ""It puts too much of the burden of paying for it on working folks who are already being overcharged, and that’s not fair. It threatens to overwhelm Medicaid in Georgia, and that's not right. And it barely touches the insurance companies, and that's not smart. We can do better and I’m ready to start."" 
NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said the claim is accurate, citing two votes Barrow cast against repealing the entire health care law. Those votes came in January 2011 and last July. 
The repeal measure passed in the Republican-controlled House, but repeal efforts consistently failed in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats held a slim majority. 
""He voted against ObamaCare before voting twice to keep the costly health care overhaul in place,"" Hougesen said via email. 
Hougesen concluded by saying: ""Facts are a stubborn thing, and no matter how hard Barrow or Obama attempt to cast blame on Republicans for their disastrous law, it’s theirs to own."" 
Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said the NRSC’s accusations against his boss are ""the same song and dance from these folks who don’t necessarily understand how the process works."" 
Carbo said there are pieces of the health care law that Barrow wants to keep in place, such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying care because of pre-existing conditions. Barrow also supports the provision that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26 years old. Carbo said Barrow wants to remove some of the most controversial pieces of the health care law, such as: 
The Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers. 
The individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty. 
An employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees. 
Bill Custer, the director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, said the health care law is complicated and blanket statements about its impact on businesses and people ""are wrong on either side."" 
Custer said the law will help some small businesses that were previously unable to hire more workers because they can now offer health insurance or the worker can buy it through a health insurance exchange. Some larger businesses, he said, may be hurt by the law because of its potential penalties. 
""The overarching answer is adding and removing some provisions will help and hurt some individuals and businesses. It’s not an easy divide,"" said Custer, an associate professor who previously was an economist in a division of the American Medical Association and has written several papers on health insurance. 
Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Washington-based America's Health Insurance Plans, sent us a chart showing information from five different organizations that concluded removing the individual mandate would result in millions of additional uninsured Americans and an increase in private health insurance premiums. 
""If you remove just the mandates and leave everything else in place, the cost of coverage would increase quite dramatically,"" he said. 
AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, supports bipartisan legislation introduced in February that would remove the health insurance tax scheduled to take effect in 2014. Zirkelbach noted Barrow is one of the bill’s sponsors. 
""Unless this tax is repealed, next year an average family will pay over $300 in higher premiums, seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage will face $220 in reduced benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs, and state Medicaid managed care plans will incur an additional $80 in costs for each person covered,"" AHIP wrote after the bill was introduced. 
Zirkelbach sent us a chart showing the tax will result in an increase in premiums of between $5,539 and $6,777 for the average Georgia family over a 10-year stretch. 
So where does this leave us? The NRSC says Barrow’s unwillingness to vote for repealing the health care law is a ""real life pain"" for people and businesses because of its costs. 
An argument can be made that Barrow’s votes against repeal are tantamount to indirect support of its implementation. In other words, the NRSC says, Barrow owns it. 
Barrow, however, voted against the original Obamacare legislation and wants to repeal various parts of the law. The GOP cherry-picked a few votes to stretch a point here on a lawmaker it wants to defeat,

Sen. Jack Reed says that, per capita, North Korea has one of world’s largest standing armies
","
In recent weeks, the North Korean government has made numerous increasingly provocative statements threatening South Korea and the United States, at one point warning South Korea that ""our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.""  
As the rhetoric was escalating, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke of North Korea’s military capabilities during an appearance on WJAR Channel 10’s ""10 News Conference."" 
Reed was asked about North Korea’s recent moves and generally about what threat it could pose to the United States. 
Reed said that there is concern that, in five or more years, North Korea could increase its capability to launch nuclear missiles that travel longer ranges. 
""They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world,"" he said of their conventional, non-nuclear, military. 
We wanted to know whether North Korea -- officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea -- really has such a large force, based on the best-known information. The caveat of best-known is underscored by a recent  New York Times news analysis, which reported on the difficulties the United States faces getting accurate intelligence about the country and raised questions about the accuracy of information about things such as nuclear weapons. 
We contacted Chip Unruh, Reed’s spokesman, who e-mailed links to several documents. 
One is a U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on North Korea that says that country’s total military -- army, air and naval capabilities -- ""ranks in personnel numbers as the fourth largest military in the world."" 
It fields ""primarily legacy equipment,"" the report states, meaning hardware ""based on designs of the Soviet Union and China, dating back to the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s, though a few systems are based on modern technology."" 
According to the Department of Defense report, at about 950,000, ""the ground forces comprise the vast majority of North Korea’s military."" The report estimates that country has some 60,000 naval personnel and 92,000 air force personnel -- a total of about 1.1 million. 
Several other sources provided by Unruh, including a March 28, 2012, statement before the House Armed Services Committee by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, supported the statement that North Korea has the fourth largest military in terms of sheer manpower, behind China, the United States and India. 
The 2012 U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs fact sheet said the estimated active-duty military force in North Korea is as many as 1.2 million personnel. 
Unruh also supplied a link to a short 2011 article and graphic in The Economist magazine. Using data from 161 countries for which such information was available, according to the magazine, the graphic said China had the largest active military in number of personnel  -- more than 2.25 million -- while the United States was second with upward of 1.5 million active-duty personnel.  India was third in manpower. 
The Economist placed North Korea fourth in overall personnel at about 1.2 million, but the Economist also noted that, if looked at per population, North Korea was, by far, the ""most heavily militarized of all,"" saying there were 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans -- a ratio greater than that of any other nation. 
China has a population estimated at 1.3 billion people, with 1.7 military personnel for  every 1,000 Chinese, and the United States has a population estimated at more than 316 million, with 5.5 military personnel per 1,000. 
We checked the CIA’s latest estimate, for July 2013, which put North Korea’s population at about 24.7 million people. 
Finally, we contacted the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which issues an annual report ""The Military Balance"" on nations’ military capabilities. Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the institute’s nonproliferation and disarmament program, e-mailed that Reed’s statement ""sounds correct to me"" but suggested checking the militaries of some smaller nations such as Israel. The Economist reported that Israel had 23 military personnel per 1,000 population. 
Of course, sheer manpower numbers aren’t necessarily a good measure of a nation’s military capability. And analysts often assert  that much of North Korea’s technology and hardware is outdated or obsolete. But that’s beyond the scope of our analysis. 
Our ruling

Gilberto Hinojosa says nation gained more jobs in Obama's first term than in Bush's two terms
","
Saying the country needs to build on President Barack Obama’s first term, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party said job gains bear that out.

""In April,"" Gilberto Hinojosa said in an email blast sent May 8, 2013, the day before Obama stopped in Austin to talk economic issues, ""165,000 new jobs were created and the unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level since 2008. The economy added more jobs during four years under Obama than it did in the entire eight years under George W. Bush!""

We were curious about Hinojosa’s comparison. Were more jobs created in Obama’s first term than during Bush’s two terms?

Tanene Allison, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, pointed us to an April 16, 2013, article by FactCheck.org, the fact-checking project based at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, stating: ""The economy has added more jobs since Obama took office than it did in his predecessor’s entire eight years in office."" An accompanying chart laid out an array of facts, including that 1.564 million jobs had been gained nationally since Obama became president. (The chart also said: ""Caution: No single number can tell the whole story."")

Citing figures devised by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the FactCheck article said that in Obama’s first term, the economy added a net total of 1.208 million jobs, beating Bush’s eight-year total of 1.083 million net jobs gained, though the article also cautioned that bureau figures are subject to revision.

By email, Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, sent us monthly job totals covering January 2001, when Bush was sworn in as president, through early 2013, when Obama ended his first term.

The figures indicate that when Bush became president, the country had 132.5 million jobs. In January 2009, when Obama succeeded him, it had 133.6 million jobs — or about 1.1 million more. In January 2013, after Obama’s first term, the U.S. had 134.8 million jobs — or about 1.2 million more than when he became president.

The resulting 100,000 difference in jobs would seem to back Hinojosa’s claim, which if it was extended to consider job gains through the latest month analyzed by the bureau, April 2013, would widen Obama’s lead in jobs gained to nearly 800,000, the figures indicate.

Then again, there were oscillations in total jobs through Bush’s years. For example, total jobs dipped to nearly 130 million in August 2003, the third year of Bush’s tenure. After that, the bureau figures indicate, the economy mostly experienced month-to-month job gains until 2008, peaking at 138 million jobs in January 2008. As of that month, the economy had gained more than 7 million jobs on his watch — a figure outpacing gains to date under Obama. However, the major recession subsequently knocked down the total number of jobs in every one of Bush’s last dozen months, accounting for a single-year reduction of about 4 million jobs.

We’d be remiss, finally, if we failed to point out that while presidents invariably take credit, and are blamed, for economic ups and downs, job gains and losses are influenced by many factors beyond White House control.

Our ruling

Hinojosa said the economy gained more jobs in Obama’s first term than it did through Bush’s two terms.

This statement depends on cherry-picking information for particular months--obscuring the fact that at one point during Bush’s presidency, the economy had gained more jobs than the country picked up in Obama’s first term. It’s also a stretch to pin, or associate, job gains or losses on any president. The economy is influenced by many additional factors.

These clarifications aside, the nation had net job gains during Obama’s first term outpacing net job gains through Bush’s two terms, which ended with a downturn that was the worst since the Great Depression. We rate this claim as Mostly True.","[('\nWeb post, ""Obama’s Numbers (Quarterly Update),"" FactCheck.org, April 16, 2013\n\nChart, ""Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National),"" U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (received by email from Cheryl Abbot, regional economist) May 9, 2013', 'https://factcheck.org/2013/04/obamas-numbers-quarterly-update/')]",/factchecks/2013/may/09/gilberto-hinojosa/gilberto-hinojosa-says-nation-gained-more-jobs-oba/

Rick Perry says Texas accounted for 33 percent of nation's net job gains over the past decade
","In a May 9, 2013, advertisement, Gov. Rick Perry offered President Barack Obama a ""handy checklist"" about job creation to take back to Washington, D.C.

The ad, which Perry’s campaign placed in the Austin American-Statesman the day Obama came to Austin to stress economic issues, said the checklist includes low taxes, lawsuit abuse reform, predictable and effective regulations, balanced budgets and accountable schools and a competitive workforce.

And an indicator that the ""Texas model"" works, the ad said, is that while the U.S. lost 2.5 million net new jobs over the past five years, Texas created 530,000 net new jobs. Also, the ad said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide.""

Texas has had a healthy economy compared with most other states. Still, we were curious if one in three of the nation’s net new jobs over the past 10 years was gained in Texas.

By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred to information attributed to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that Texas reaped more than 1.75 million net new jobs from March 2003 to March 2013, a period in which the United States as a whole accounted for 5.3 million net new jobs, Havens said.

To our inquiry, a regional economist for the bureau, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed the net job gain figures provided by Havens. According to a spreadsheet she emailed our way, Texas topped 42 states with net job gains in the period, considerably outdistancing the No. 2 jobs-gainer, New York, which had a net gain of 458,000 jobs. States with net losses were Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Rhode Island.

Among the states, Texas had the third-greatest percentage gain in jobs over the decade, 19 percent, trailing North Dakota (33 percent increase) and Utah (21 percent), the spreadsheet indicates.

By email and in a telephone interview, though, Abbot said the bureau steers clear of using its employment estimates to declare how much of any national job gains are attributable to net job gains in individual states. That judgment has to do with technical difficulties comparing the results of surveys undertaken state by state to research intended to have national sweep, she said.

Regardless, she said, ""Texas has been a very powerful job creator; during the period, the state created 1.75 million net jobs – and that was equal to one-third of the net jobs created nationwide,"" which is slightly different from saying the state accounted for 33 percent of national net jobs gained.

We sent Perry’s office the bureau’s standing cautionary note about using its figures to reach conclusions about how much each state contributes to national job gains. Havens replied: ""The bottom line is, this is the most accurate way available to compare any single state’s job growth to the nation as a whole.""

We also tried a different way of gauging the degree that Texas job gains fit the national picture by adding up each state’s net job gains as estimated by the bureau. This delivered a slightly higher total for national jobs gained, 5.5 million. Dividing the 1.75 million net jobs gained in Texas into the higher total leaves Texas accounting for 32 percent of the nation’s net jobs gained.

We also asked Jason Abrevaya, who chairs the University of Texas Department of Economics, to review the bureau figures. He said by email that they seem to hold up. If Texas had been performing at the average nationwide from 2003 to 2013, he added, one ""would expect the state to account for roughly 8 percent,"" rather than 33 percent, of the net job changes, since Texas accounts for about 8 percent of the nation’s jobs.

Our ruling

Perry said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide."" That conclusion is supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. This might be an imperfect way to explore this facet, but there also don't appear to be better approaches. We rate the claim as True.","[('Emails, Josh Havens, deputy press secretary, Office of Gov.

Tom Coburn says after national park gun ban lifted, violent crime fell by 85 percent
","
During an interview on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., argued for legislation he’s proposing that would allow guns to be carried into lands controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
To make the case that guns make places safer, Coburn cited a dramatic before-and-after statistic that stems from the lifting of a ban on guns in national parks. Coburn was a leader in the effort to get Congress to approve the change. President Barack Obama signed the national park provision into law, and it took effect in February 2010. 
""In 2010,"" Coburn said on Morning Joe, ""everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that."" 
That’s a pretty stunning drop. Is it accurate? 
When we checked with Coburn’s office, John Hart, a spokesman, acknowledged that his senator had misspoken in a way that overstated the decline. 
Hart said Coburn’s office had compared FBI crime data on National Park Service land from 2008 to 2011, the most recent year available. By the office’s calculations, the number of violent incidents actually dropped by 12 percent, not 85 percent. 
""The numbers show crime rates have declined, but he misspoke when he mentioned 85 percent,"" Hart said. ""On balance, the facts support our conclusion that crime rates would go down under our policy, not the conclusion of the amendment’s critics who said that allowing guns in national parks would lead to more crime."" 
However, before we bless Coburn’s revised analysis, let’s look at the original data. Here’s a summary chart for violent crimes in the national parks between 2008 and 2011.

A few issues jump out to us. First, murders actually went up between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what Coburn said. 
More importantly, using 2008 as the ""before"" year in this before-and-after comparison amounts to cherry picking. 
As we noted, the law went into effect in 2010, so the most obvious way to frame the comparison would be to use the data from 2009 (the last full year before the gun ban was lifted) and 2011 (the most recent year). And as it turns out, the comparison to 2009 is not nearly as favorable to Coburn’s overall point. 
Between 2009 and 2011, these four categories of violent crimes actually rose collectively by 5 percent. Robberies did decline by 9 percent, but murders more than doubled (from a very small base), the number of rapes was stable and the tally of aggravated assaults -- by far the most common of these four crimes -- rose by 9 percent. 
Meanwhile, it’s also worth noting that the number of crimes in national parks is generally pretty small, which makes it unclear how much stock anyone should place in year-to-year percentage increases and decreases. 
Finally, we’ll point out that Coburn’s stated decline may -- or may not -- have been caused by the deterrence of having guns around. But if they were a cause for the decline from 2008 to 2011, what’s to stop someone from arguing that they were the cause of the increase from 2009 to 2011? The numbers alone simply don’t tell us. 
Our ruling 
On Morning Joe, Coburn said, ""In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that."" 
Coburn’s office acknowledges that he misspoke; they actually calculated a decline of 12 percent, which is dramatically lower than 85 percent. 
But we find even the revised statistic to be questionable. It hinges on using 2008 data, when 2009 data would be more appropriate -- and a comparison using data from 2009 actually shows an increase in violent crime in national parks since the gun ban was lifted. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that guns had an influence on the relatively small number of crimes that take place in national parks. 
We rate Coburn’s statement False.","[('\nTom Coburn, interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, May 9, 2013', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/id/3036789/#51827925'), ('\nFBI, ""Offenses Known to Law Enforcement, by State, Tribal, and Other Agencies,"" 2008', 'No link'), ('\nFBI, ""Offenses Known to Law Enforcement, by State, Tribal, and Other Agencies,"" 2009', 'https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/data/table_11_fa.html'), ('\nFBI, ""Offenses Known to Law Enforcement, by State, Tribal, and Other Agencies,"" 2010', 'No link'), ('\nFBI, ""Offenses Known to Law Enforcement, by State, Tribal, and Other Agencies,"" 2011', 'https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_11_fed.html'), ('\nNBC News, ""New law allows loaded guns in national parks,"" Feb. 19, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility, ""Rising Tide of Violence,"" accessed May 9, 2013', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/table-11/10tbl11fed.xls'), ('\nEmail interview with Jeff Ruch, executive director for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, May 9, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Kurt Repanshek, founder and editor-in-chief of National Parks Traveler, May 9, 2013', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table11statecuts/table_11_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_federal_agencies_by_state_tribal_and_other_agencies_2011.xls'), ('\nEmail interview with Mike Litterst, acting chief spokesman for the National Park Service, May 9, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with John Hart, spokesman for Tom Coburn, May 9, 2013', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/id/35484383/ns/us_news-life/t/new-law-allows-loaded-guns-national-parks/#.UYvw4EpKXdV')]",/factchecks/2013/may/09/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-says-after-national-park-gun-ban-lifted/

Maryellen O'Shaughnessy cites Jon Husted's election history in counter to professional politician claim
","
Professional experience in politics, unlike many professions, can be viewed as a negative. Current political ads – whether tapping into voter unrest over the economy or local corruption – are warning voters that supporting experienced candidates will not solve their problems.

Maryellen O’Shaughnessy, the Democratic candidate for secretary of state, recently felt the sting of being labeled a ""professional politician"" in a TV commercial paid for by her opponent, Jon Husted. So O’Shaughnessy responded, calling Husted, a Republican, a ""perpetual candidate.""

""Since 2000, when he entered politics, Jon Husted has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices,"" O'Shaughnessy said in a news release posted on her campaign website in late September.

Because Husted decided to make political experience an issue in the race, we decided to check O’Shaughnessy’s counterclaim about his experience.

Husted is currently a state senator representing the Dayton area. Before that, he was a state representative for eight years. For four of those years he was Ohio Speaker of the House. He worked for the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce before arriving in Columbus as a state legislator.

O’Shaughnessy, by comparison, was a member of Columbus City Council from 1998 to 2008. She was elected Franklin County clerk of courts in 2008. She also ran unsuccessfully for Franklin County commissioner in 1992 and 2002 and for Congress in 2000.

The Ohio secretary of state, the job Husted and O’Shaughnessy are seeking, is in charge of elections in Ohio and keeps records of candidates and election results. So we checked the secretary of state’s website to see how many times Husted has been on the ballot. We also asked O’Shaughnessy’s campaign to explain its count of instances Husted appeared on a ballot.

The secretary of state’s office confirmed O’Shaughnessy’s claim that Husted has been on the ballot six times.

He ran for state representative – and won each time – in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. Husted was term-limited after his fourth win, so he ran for state senate, and won, in 2008, according to the secretary of state’s website. In Ohio, state representatives serve two-year terms and senators serve four-year terms. His candidacy this year for secretary of state marks his sixth appearance on the ballot for his third different political office.

We find O’Shaughnessy’s statement True.","[('\nJon Husted, video attacking Maryellen O’Shaughnessy\n\nMaryellen O’Shaughnessy, news release response to the Husted video, posted to her campaign website Sept. 27, 2010\n\nOhio secretary of state, Ohio election results posted online\n\nInterview with Heidi Hubmann, spokeswoman for Maryellen O’Shaughnessy\n\nInterview with Ryan Frazee, spokesman for Jon Husted', 'http://www.maryellenforohio.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=41:fact-check&catid=3:latest-news&Itemid=4')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/22/maryellen-oshaughnessy/maryellen-oshaughnessy-cites-jon-husteds-election-/

Rick Scott says Alex Sink practices 'Obama math' on budget plans
","
Rick Scott says he's running against a woman for governor in Alex Sink who is lock-step in line with the policies of President Barack Obama, and has become fluent in what Scott calls ""Obama math.""

Scott said during an hour-long debate on Oct. 20, 2010, that Sink's policy proposals don't add up unless she's prepared to raise taxes. Yet somehow, she is saying on the campaign she'll be able save taxpayer dollars.

""My opponent talks about how she can save $700 million. That's Obama math,"" Scott said during the debate, which was sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association. ""Because on the other side of that ... how are you are going to pay for the $12.5 billion in new spending your proposals are going to cost us?""

Sink dismissed Scott's spending allegation as ""outlandish."" But Scott pressed again.

""You have big promises. What is the number (in dollars) you're proposing?"" Scott asked. ""Obama math doesn't work here -- (to) say I'm going to save $700 million and spend $12.5 billion.""

Sink asked the moderator for a chance to respond.

""I don't know what 'Obama math' is,"" Sink said. ""What I do know, I was a 4.0 math major at Wake Forest University and I do know how to add numbers.""

With less than two weeks until the Nov. 2 election, we're not going to spend time tracking down Sink's Calculus II grades -- though if someone has a transcript, feel free to send us a fax. Instead, we're going to take a look at Scott's claim that Sink is proposing $12.5 billion in new state spending programs.

The genesis for this claim actually comes from incoming Republican state Senate President Mike Haridopolos. On Oct. 11, 2010, Haridpolos wrote Sink and said that after studying Sink's campaign positions on her website, he discovered an alarming trend.

""Florida's current budget estimates reveal a shortfall of approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion,"" Haridopolos wrote. ""Instead of spending less to stem the tide, it appears that you would propose a staggering $12.5 billion in additional spending on everything from higher pay for state workers to high-speed rail and other areas of government spending. The consequences of these proposed increases in spending would yield nothing short of a crippling $14 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall.""

Haripodolos never heard back from Sink, and after she deflected the charge during the debate, he responded almost instantly via Twitter.

""Just go to Alex Sink's website,"" he wrote. ""$9b for rail from Orlando to Miami, $2b more for schools, and $575m increase in state workers $."" The Scott campaign said it's actually $9.2 billion for rail, plus another $350 million for pre-K funding and $302 million in additional student aid, or $12.43 billion overall.

Sink's website doesn't list the expenditures as Haridopolos suggests, PolitiFact Florida found out. The math comes from Republicans interpreting Sink's policy positions. Let's quickly walk through them.

$9.2 billion for rail -- What Sink says: ""Florida's high-speed passenger rail line from Tampa to Orlando is just the first phase of a multi-city rail project. Continued enhancement of Florida's rail system will be a boon to our economy by employing thousands of Floridians over a 20-year period. Alex supports plans for future high-speed and commuter rail lines, and will partner with the Florida Rail Enterprise to fulfill and extend Florida's comprehensive rail vision.""

How Scott interprets it: Florida received $1.25 billion in federal money to begin constructing a Tampa to Orlando high-speed rail line. But that money will only cover about half the total cost of construction. It's unclear where the other half will come from. The next phase of the high-speed rail project would then link Orlando to Miami. That line is longer and anticipated to cost another $8 billion. Again, no funding has been identified.

$2 billion more for schools -- What Sink says: ""When Florida voters approved a state lottery in 1986, supporters promised it would be used to supplement existing state dollars dedicated to education. In reality, lottery funds have actually replaced general revenue (GR) dollars. Prior to 1986, education received almost 61 percent of GR; since then, it has received only 53 percent. The proportion devoted to public schools dropped between 1988 and 2005 from about 70 percent to only 40 percent ... As Florida's economy recovers, Alex Sink will work to reverse the shrinking proportion of Florida's GR investment in education funding. She also will seek to use lottery funding to enhance educational programs as originally intended.""

How Scott interprets it: Lawmakers spend about $12.5 billion in general revenues on education. If the state increases spending levels as Sink describes, to 61 percent of general revenue, the new cost would be about $14.5 billion.

$575 million for pay raises -- What Sink says: ""State government employees have not had a general pay raise in the past five years. In 2008, the average annual state employee salary of $38,839 was 4.5 percent below Florida's average wage for all industries. Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident. As Governor, Alex Sink will push to ensure that state employees are recognized for high performance by receiving fair and competitive compensation."" (PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked the payroll comparison to other states).

How Scott interprets it: Raising state employee expenditures per resident from $38 to the national average of $69 will cost the state $575 million.

$350 million for pre-K funding -- What Sink says: ""Florida was one of the first states to make pre-Kindergarten available to all four-year-olds, but our investment in the program ranks us toward the bottom: the state averages less than $2,500 per child while the national average is more than $4,700.""

How Scott interprets it: Scott says there are 160,000 kids in pre-K. To reach the national average in per-child spending, the state would have to spend an additional $350 million.

$302 million in needs-based student aid -- What Sink says: ""Florida is one of only a dozen states that spends more on merit-based scholarships than needs-based aid -- comprising only 20 percent of the state's overall student financial aid. Alex Sink will work to strike a fairer balance with merit-based scholarships."" 
How Scott interprets it: Scott says merit-based aid will cost the state $437.3 million in fiscal year 2010-2011. The state will spend $135 million on needs-based aid, Scott says. To make them equal, the state will need to spend $302 million more on needs-based aid.

That's how Scott and Haridopolos get to $12.5 billion. We find it a stretch.

In some cases, Scott takes Sink's proposed actions -- ""will work,"" ""will push,"" or ""will partner"" -- and casts them as written in blood promises. But Sink's words are mushy -- probably on purpose. Sink needs the Republican-led Legislature to approve any new spending progams. In other cases, Scott uses Sink's discussions of the national average and extrapolates that she plans to meet national averages when it comes to pre-K funding and state employee pay. But she doesn't say that. In fact, when we pressed Sink's campaign about pay raises for state employees, she didn't lay out any specific proposal and instead highlighted a plan to reduce the state workforce.

And there are other caveats Scott fails to mention.

The biggest chunk of that $12.5 billion -- nearly three-fourths -- comes from funding high-speed rail. But that money wouldn't come in one year, or even one term. And Sink doesn't say it will come out of the state budget. Any rail expansion likely would include more federal money, or local taxes approved by voters. State money, too, probably. But how much and when? That's a guessing game.

Sink prefaces any increased education spending plan with an introductory clause -- ""as Florida's economy recovers."" Scott ignores that.

And Scott hypothesizes that Sink wants to add funding for needs-based student aid rather than simply reallocate existing funding.

We think it's certainly fair for Scott to question Sink on how she proposes to pay for something like high-speed rail in Florida (since she hasn't offered a plan), but it's disingenuous to suggest her plan is to simply add that $9.2 billion cost to a $70 billion state budget in one lump sum.

SEIU blasts Indiana GOP challenger Todd Young over 'Fair Tax' stance
","
We've written before about a conservative proposal called the ""Fair Tax,"" which would eliminate the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes and replace them with a 23 percent national sales tax. Supporters say it would reduce the cost of compliance and close loopholes. Critics counter that it would be regressive and would actually require a higher rate than the advertised 23 percent.

Whatever the truth of these claims, Democrats clearly consider it a winning issue: They've used the Fair Tax as the basis for many ads against Republicans this year, one of which we recently rated Half True.

We noticed the issue crop up once again in a close House contest between incumbent Democratic Rep. Baron Hill and Republican attorney Todd Young to represent a swing district in southern Indiana. Here's what caught our eye in an Oct. 20, 2010, ad placed by the political arm of the Service Employees International Union.

The ad says Young, ""supports a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy -- food and clothing, even medicine. You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it. Attacking Social Security and taxing seniors twice? Indiana can't afford Todd Young.""

Let's start by exploring the evidence that Young supports the Fair Tax, or something like it.

The issues page of Young's campaign website urges Congress to ""immediately simplify our complicated tax code — and reward work, savings, and investment — by replacing the current code with either a consumption-based tax or a flatter tax."" Democrats have also pointed to instances in which Young cited the Fair Tax by name, including in a North Vernon Republican debate on April 10, 2010.

When we asked the Young campaign for his official position, they pointed us to an Oct. 21, 2010, article in the Jeffersonville News and Tribune in which Young said he is flexible on which tax system to use.

""Young said a better approach than the Fair Tax would be a system that would give options where people could choose to stay with what they’re familiar with or go for a simpler tax code,"" the newspaper reported. ""Whatever tax reform proposal we move towards, I have to ensure in order to get my support that it doesn’t involve raising taxes.""

Still, even if Young is backing off specific support for the Fair Tax, we do think there's enough evidence that he once supported it, or supported something very similar to it, to make it fair game for the SEIU.

Now to the substance of the ad's charges.

One issue is the ad's reference to taxing ""food and clothing, even medicine."" This statement is largely correct, but there's an important caveat. While the Fair Tax would indeed tax such items, it would also include a ""prebate"" -- an advance refund intended to cover the costs of such basic purposes. Still, the prebate would be a flat amount pegged to family size, and would not directly exempt purchases of food, clothing or medicine but would rather compensate families indirectly for a portion of the sales tax they pay. So we think the SEIU's wording is justified.

But the issue in the ad that most intrigued us is the notion of double taxation. After watching a variety of ads about the Fair Tax, we had yet to see one that explicitly called the Fair Tax double taxation. And that set off alarm bells for us, since the Fair Tax, whatever you think of it as a policy, is definitely not designed to be layered on top of the current tax code. It is explicitly designed to replace the current tax code.

Both PolitiFact and our friends at FactCheck.org have criticized ads that gloss over the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the current tax code. In a previous Truth-O-Meter item, we said that the absence of such context in an ad by Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., amounted to ""a very deceptive omission."" But not even Lincoln's ad went so far as to say, pure and simple, that the 23 percent sales tax amounted to double taxation. So we approached this ad thinking it might earn a Pants on Fire.

Then we checked with the SEIU. They acknowledged that the Fair Tax would be a replacement for the current tax system. But they made an interesting point -- that for seniors, the explicit target audience for the ad, there is something that you might call double taxation. For many years, seniors paid taxes on their income when they earned it. Whatever they didn't spend, they saved, and in their retirement years, when they aren't earning fresh income that would be tax-free under the Fair Tax, those accumulated savings would be spent -- and thus taxed at 23 percent. Voila -- double taxation.

To see whether this argument holds any water, we checked in with an ideological cross-section of economists. In general, they agreed that SEIU had a point.

When we contacted Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, he referred us to a 2007 article he wrote in the journal Tax Notes titled, ""Why the Fair Tax Won't Work."" Bartlett said the proposal ""penalizes those who are older who have saved for their retirement during an era when saving was heavily penalized by the income tax. But rather than being able to spend their savings tax free, as they anticipated, they will now have to pay sales taxes on everything they buy, including health care. It will be hard for them to avoid seeing this as a double tax.

Bob Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that the Fair Tax double-taxes savings. ""It's a transition issue that would disappear in time, once all savings held at the time of transition have been spent,"" Williams said. ""The ad is clearly aimed at seniors, for whom the issue is definitely valid."" Williams added that seniors would also fail to get much of a benefit from the Fair Tax's elimination of income tax because ""most Social Security income is not subject to income tax.""

Dan Mitchell, a tax policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized the ad for leaving out the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the income tax. But he acknowledged that ""there is potentially an element of truth to the secondary point about taxing seniors who earned money while young, paid income tax, saved some of the after-tax money, and now want to spend that money."" Mitchell added that not all seniors would be affected equally -- it would more heavily affect seniors who had substantial savings outside of 401(k)s or other plans in which income is not taxed initially.

So where does this leave us? We think SEIU makes a legitimate point that seniors -- the group that is specifically singled out for mentions in the ad's narration and in its visuals -- would face what amounts to double taxation of their savings if the Fair Tax were to pass. But we're also wary of giving this a full True rating, because we think that most viewers watching the ad would assume that the 23 percent tax would be levied on top of the existing income tax (which, we'll point out, is referenced at one point by a visual of someone filling out an IRS Form 1040). And it's simply not part of the plan for Americans to be hit by both the current tax code and the Fair Tax simultaneously. On balance, we give the ad a rating of Half True.","[('\nSEIU COPE, ""Indiana Can\'t Afford Todd Young"" (ad), Oct. 20, 2010\n\nSEIU COPE, background document on ""Indiana Can\'t Afford Todd Young"" ad, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nTodd Young for Congress, issues web page, accessed Oct. 21, 2010\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, ""Todd Young Supports Imposing A 23 Percent Sales Tax On Almost Everything Hoosier Families Buy,"" Oct. 15, 2010\n\nBruce Bartlett, ""Why the Fair Tax Won\'t Work"" (article in Tax Notes), Dec 24, 2007\n\nJeffersonville News and Tribune, ""23 percent sales tax focus of 9th District advertisements,"" Oct. 21, 2010\n\nFairTax.org, ""The Fair Tax Basics"" (web page), accessed Oct. 21, 2010\n\nFairTax.org, ""Executive Summary: The Fair Tax,"" accessed Oct. 21, 2010\n\nFairTax.org, ""The Fair Tax Prebate Explained,"" accessed Oct. 21, 2010\n\nPolitiFact, ""Blanche Lincoln Ad highlights 23 percent sales tax in ""Fair Tax"" supported by John Boozman,"" Sept. 20, 2010\n\nFactCheck.org, ""Sales Tax Spin,"" Oct. 20, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Bob Williams, senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, Oct. 21, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Daniel Mitchell, senior fellow with the Cato Institute, Oct. 21, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Oct. 21, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Bruce Bartlett, columnist for Forbes.com, Oct. 21, 2010\n\nInterview with Ryan Cole, communications director with the Todd Young for Congress campaign, Oct. 21, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrikKHO4e3U')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/21/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/seiu-blasts-indiana-gop-challenger-todd-young-over/

Barbara Boxer says Carly Fiorina is against banning assault weapons
","A new ad from California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer takes a broad-brush approach in painting Republican opponent Carly Fiorina as extreme.

""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons, and that's reckless and dangerous. She's for risky new oil drilling that could threaten our jobs. Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors. And she'd make abortion a crime. No wonder Fiorina is endorsed by Sarah Palin. Carly Fiorina, just too extreme for California.""

The Fiorina campaign blasted the ad. ""We demand that she immediately remove this ad from the airwaves and apologize to Carly, and California voters, for not only this deliberate and blatant distortion of reality, but also for her refusal to have an honest and serious debate about the issues during this crucial time for our nation,"" said campaign manager Marty Wilson in a written statement.

The Boxer campaign said they're standing by the ad. Both campaigns invited us to fact-check it.

Here, we wanted to look at whether Fiorina is against banning assault weapons. Generally speaking, Fiorina supports gun rights; she says on her web site that she is ""a strong proponent of protecting Americans' Second Amendment rights."" She's also received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. She received an ''AQ'' rating from the group, which the NRA Political Victory Fund says means she is ""a pro-gun candidate whose rating is based solely on the candidate's responses to the NRA-PVF Candidate Questionnaire and who does not have a voting record on Second Amendment issues."" (Fiorina was previously the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard Co.; this is the first time she has sought elective office.)

The Boxer campaign pointed out that Fiorina has said she opposed a measure passed under the Clinton administration that banned assault weapons for 10 years. The ban started in 1994 and expired in 2004. It has not been renewed.

The Fiorina campaign acknowledges that she opposed the 1994 ban. ""Fiorina agrees with opponents of the 1994 semi-automatic gun ban that various provisions of the bill outlawing guns with military appearance characteristics such as conspicuous grip, bayonet mount and a folding or telescoping stock do not make those guns any more dangerous,"" said campaign press secretary Andrea Saul in a statement.

But the campaign said Fiorina is not taking a stand on any future bans until she sees specific legislation.

We searched to see if there was any current legislation under consideration and couldn't find any. Though President Barack Obama campaigned on an assault weapons ban, it doesn't appear to be a legislative priority for his administration.

Still, it seems fair to think that Fiorina would oppose a ban that was the same as the 1994 ban. The NRA said it endorses her because she ""opposes re-enacting the Clinton gun and magazine ban.""

In ruling on the statement ""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons,"" we find it compelling that she opposed the 1994 ban and that the NRA said she told them she would oppose re-enacting it. Is it possible some sort of new compromise bill might win Fiorina's support? It's possible, but there's little to indicate that's likely. Based on her previous opposition and the NRA endorsement, we rate Boxer's statement Mostly True.","[('Barbara Boxer campaign, Carly Fiorina: ""Out of Touch,"" Oct. 15, 2010\n\nCarly Fiorina campaign, Fiorina Campaign Calls On Barbara Boxer To Remove False Advertisement and Apologize, Oct. 15, 2010\n\nCarly Fiorina campaign, ""Carly Supports the Second Amendment"", accessed Oct. 20, 2010\n\nNational Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, Carly Fiorina endorsement, accessed Oct. 21, 2010\n\nThomas, Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (assault weapons ban), became law Sept. 13, 1994\n\nABC News, President Obama Suggests Pushing for ""Assault Weapon"" Ban Not In the Cards, April 16, 2009\n\nSan Jose Mercury News, Fiorina opposes assault weapons ban, praises Supreme Court ruling, June 29, 2010, accessed via Nexis\n\nDailyBreeze.com, Giuliani stumps for Fiorina, Van Tran in Little Saigon, Oct. 11, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C21iWn1sU7o')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/21/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-carly-fiorina-against-banning-a/

Democrats target Tom Ganley, citing Better Business Bureau ratings and complaints
","
Republican congressional candidate Tom Ganley is an auto giant and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation and finance companies.

His success enhanced his stature as a candidate. And, it made him rich enough to help finance his campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District.

Sutton, with help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has countered by questioning the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire.

Sutton's TV advertising has cited lawsuits filed against Ganley dealerships. PolitiFact Ohio examined those claims and noted that while her numbers were correct, the information was presented without context. Specifically, the ad cited large numbers of lawsuits filed against Ganley without noting that he’s been in business four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer.

""Buyer Beware,"" a TV ad from the DCCC, added the claims that Ganley has ""two F's from the Better Business Bureau"" and ""over 160 complaints in just three years.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine these assertions and, again, tried to put them in perspective.

We started with the letter grades from the Better Business Bureau.

The BBB called them ""another tool to use"" in choosing a business, and said that the grades are based on 17 different factors that include the time a business has been in operation and how it has handled complaints. An especially important factor is a business's responsive to complaints cited by the BBB.

The BBB did give F ratings to two Ganley dealerships, primarily for failing to respond to six complaints filed against them during the bureau's ""standard reporting period"" of three years, and for false claims in advertising.

But in the BBB’s online listings, the average grade for the 20 Ganley dealerships was a B+. That rating compared favorably to the per-store average of four other dealer groups we surveyed (Spitzer, Classic, Liberty and Cincinnati-based Joseph).

The grades undergo continuing review and revision, and they have changed since the DCCC's ad. One F grade was upgraded to a B-. The second was withdrawn, replaced with ""no rating"" and is listed as under review. A third dealership, not rated earlier, was given an F.

As for complaints, the BBB says, ""There is no known industry standard for the number of complaints a business can expect. The volume of business and number of transactions may have a bearing on the number of complaints received by the BBB.""

Over 42 years in business, Ganley has sold 585,211 cars and served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, said Meghan Snyder, a spokeswoman for Ganley's campaign. ""He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades.""

We found that its average of almost nine complaints per store, about three per year, was slightly higher than the average for the four other groups we looked at, and that a larger number of complaints involved ""selling practices.""

Warning consumers about one practice, the BBB's website says that several of the dealerships may offer a ""conditional delivery agreement"" or ""spot delivery agreement"" to car buyers.

Signing such an agreement permits the consumer to take the new vehicle home before financing has been approved,"" the BBB warns. ""Although offered as a 'convenience' to consumers, these agreements can often create problems if the consumer interprets them to mean the final terms of the car purchase will be as originally promised.""

Those agreements led to several of the lawsuits against Ganley dealerships, such as one filed by a couple who said they took a new car home after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent.

So let’s check the scorecard.

"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says scientists agree that adult stem cell research holds more promise than embryonic
","Stem cell research has emerged as a bright line separating the 2010 candidates for governor in Wisconsin.

Democrat Tom Barrett supports both adult and embryonic stem cell research and sought to portray Republican rival Scott Walker as extreme with a TV ad that claimed Walker wants to ban stem cell research.

We rated that claim False, since it made no distinction between adult stem cell research, which Walker supports, and embryonic stem cell research, which he opposes.

In the wake of the ad, Walker refused to say whether he supports an outright ban on embryonic stem cell research, though he told a pro-life group in the spring he would sign such a bill. In explaining his views at an Oct. 12, 2010 news conference, Walker made this  pronouncement about stem cell research:

""Scientists have shown us (that) the greater possibilities, the real science movement, has been with adult stem cell research. It has not been with embryonic,"" Walker said.

He then added for emphasis: ""That’s not a political statement; that’s a statement of scientific fact out there.""

We went to the lab -- and several experts on stem cell research -- to see if Walker’s claim on the merits of both sorts of research is true.

First, we’ll note two things: 1) There is great hope that stem cell research, which has been used to treat some blood diseases and cancers, may one day treat and cure many diseases. 2) Adult stem cell research is older and generally not controversial, while embryonic is newer and controversial because it involves the destruction of a human embryo.  

In this item, we are not trying to settle the debate over what is morally right or ethically responsible. We are strictly looking at Walker’s statement.

Asked to support Walker’s claim that adult stem cell research is considered by scientists to be superior to embryonic, his campaign cited statements by a federal agency -- the National Institutes of Health -- that differentiate the two: Walker quotes the National Institutes of Health accurately -- but selectively.

The NIH also says adult and embryonic stem cells each have advantages and disadvantages -- and that there is a major difference between them: Embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body, while adult stem cells ""are thought to be limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin.""

Momentum for embryonic stem cell research connected with the National Institutes of Health grew with an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in March 2009. It lifted restrictions on the work that had been imposed by President George W. Bush.

Obama’s order said in part: ""Advances over the past decade in this promising scientific field have been encouraging, leading to broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by federal funds.""

The future of federally funded embryonic stem cell work has been uncertain since a judge in August 2010 blocked Obama’s order; that ruling is being appealed. But experts we consulted said, as Obama’s order did, that there is broad agreement among scientists about the potential of embryonic stem cell research.

International Society for Stem Cell Research: Lawrence Goldstein, a member of the society’s board and director of the stem cell program at the University of California, San Diego, told PolitiFact Wisconsin ""there is no scientific basis"" for Walker’s statement.

""While adult stem cells show promise in some therapeutic settings, there are many therapeutic needs that adult stem cells do not appear likely to meet,"" said Goldstein, who has testified before Congress on National Institutes of Health funding and stem cell research. ""In particular, for neurodegenerative diseases such as (Lou Gehrig’s disease) and other related disorders, embryonic stem cells and related stem cell types show great promise both for therapy and for teaching us what is going wrong in these disorders so that we may develop better therapies in the future.   

""Thus, based on scientific considerations and data, it is far too early to conclude that one stem cell type or another will solve all the medical problems we seek to solve, so research with all types must proceed so that we can find out what is best for each type of disease.""

National Academies of Science: In September 2008, the academies noted developments in efforts to reprogram adult stem cells to an embryonic stem cell-like state. But ""it is far from clear at this point which cell types will prove to be the most useful for regenerative medicine,"" the academies said, ""and it is likely that each will have some utility.""

Earlier this year, the academies again said it is important to not cut off some areas of stem cell research.

Medical College of Wisconsin: Stephen Duncan, director of the college’s stem cell biology program, said no one knows whether embryonic or adult stem cells hold the most promise because research is ongoing. ""We just can’t answer whether embryonic or adult stem cells are the best,"" he said. ""The tests haven’t been done.""

We’ve done enough research, however, to draw a conclusion about Walker’s claim.

In supporting his views, Walker said scientists agree the most promising research is focused on adult stem cells, not embryonic stem cells. In supporting that claim, he selectively cites part of a statement by the National Institutes of Health. A broader look at the evidence shows the consensus among scientists is that embryonic stem cells hold great promise in treating diseases, in some ways may be superior to adult stem cells and are deserving of more research.

Chuck Riley says Bruce Starr broke the law by taking a free trip to Maui
","
PolitiFact Oregon remembers 2006 all too well. Leggings made a fashion comeback. Democrats took back the Oregon House. And that fall, The Oregonian reported on a bunch of state legislators for accepting lavish trips to Maui courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association.

One of those legislators was state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, who faces Rep. Chuck Riley, D-Hillsboro, in the Nov. 2 general election. To no one’s surprise, Riley is bringing up Starr’s stay at the palatial Grand Wailea Hotel in May 2002 to attend the distributors’ conference.

Riley’s ad, ""On Our Side,"" starts with a photo of Starr and a pretty Hawaiian view in the background. A female announcer, backed by a breezy ukulele, says: ""What’s not pretty? The ethics commission ruled he broke the law by letting lobbyists foot the bill.""  (There also appears to be a pork chop dressed up to resemble a pineapple on the table.)  

But it’s not true.

The state ethics commission did fine Starr in 2007 -- but not for going to Hawaii on the dime of a lobbying group. Rather, Starr was fined for failing to disclose the 2002 conference on annual disclosure forms filed with the state. At the time, it was perfectly legal for lobbyists to treat legislators to such trips and for legislators to accept them. The distributors, led by lobbyist Paul Romain, paid about $18,000 in 2002 and in 2004 to fly, feed, shelter and entertain a total of seven state legislators at two conferences.

Starr attended the four-day conference with his wife. The ethics commission fined him $300 for not disclosing that trip and another education trip to Israel paid by another organization.

Starr said at the time that he didn’t report the trip because the lobbyist, Romain, told him he didn’t have to. He amended his reports, showing that the beer and wine distributors paid $961 for airfare, $1,007 for his hotel room, $300 for food and beverages and $250 for golf.

Molly Woon, a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats, defends the statement. Perhaps PolitiFact Oregon is overthinking the issue?  ""He broke the law for taking a lobbyist-paid trip; you can say more, but that's the basic fact,"" she said.

We have to disagree. Starr broke no laws or ethics rules by taking the trip at a lobbyist’s expense, which is what the Democrats’ ad claims. What Starr did wrong was fail to report the trip. The statement is False.

Chain e-mail says voters should beware of Texas propositions affecting property taxes on homesteads
","
""TRUE OR FALSE?"" a reader wrote us Oct. 7, though he wasn't talking about a candidate's pronouncement.

Instead, the reader was forwarding an e-mail titled ""State Propositions on Ballot to Tax Homesteads / November."" It warns that there are three propositions on the November ballot ""allowing the state of Texas to start taxing residential homeowners. So if you own a home, and these laws are passed, you will be taxed by the state.""

The e-mail goes on: ""I received a flyer from the (Texas) Secretary of State, Hope Andrade, listing the propositions that are up for election. I called to question them before sending this message out to my homeowner friends.""

Whoa, Nellie. Stop the presses.

We are certain that there are no propositions on the statewide ballot Nov. 2. We figure too that Andrade, the state's chief elections officer, knows this and would have told a caller so.

Still, it's our duty at PolitiFact Texas to check stuff out. So we left Andrade a message and began our research.

Our first find: The Longview News-Journal had beat us to it. In an Oct. 14 news article, the newspaper found the same e-mail misleading.

""This is a good example of why we should approach the random e-mails that make it to our in boxes with a big question mark,"" the newspaper reminded readers. ""There are no statewide propositions on the Nov. 2 ballot. Texas voted on these propositions in 2009, and that's why the date in this e-mail was wrong if you're living in 2010.""

Oh, right. On Nov. 3, 2009, Texas voters approved 11 proposed constitutional amendments including Propositions 1, 2 and 3. Proposition 1 related to tax increment financing by cities and counties, Proposition 2 permitted state lawmakers to tie property taxes on a residence homestead solely to the property's value as a homestead and Proposition 3 provided for uniform standards and procedures for the appraisal of property for property tax purposes, according to summaries placed online by the secretary of state's office.

As the Longview newspaper noted, the propositions ""did not create state property taxes as the e-mail claimed.""

The newspaper quotes Randall Dillard, Andrade's spokesman, saying that the same e-mail circulated before the 2009 election, and it's apparently still making the rounds. ""It was inaccurate in 2009,"" Dillard said, ""and it's inaccurate for the November 2010 election as well.""

Four days after the Longview article was published, Andrade posted a press release online stating there are no statewide propositions on the 2010 ballot.

Crist attacks Rubio's ethics over house deal and insurance vote
","
By now, religious watchers of Florida's U.S. Senate debates can almost predict the script.

No-party Gov. Charlie Crist attacks Republican former House Speaker Marco Rubio over Rubio's proposal to make changes to Social Security. Rubio attacks Crist for false attacks. Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek attacks Crist for flip-flopping on issues like oil drilling and abortion. Someone attacks somebody about health care. Somebody else attacks the other guys about the federal stimulus and its impact.

Oh, and Crist agrees with Rubio on extending the Bush-era tax cuts for all. Meek doesn't.

The first three Senate debates played out almost identically, and the fourth of six debates Oct. 19, 2010, in South Florida was heading down the same worn path.

Then, boom, something new.

More than halfway through the debate, Crist implied -- without saying, of course -- that Rubio might have sold a vote on automobile insurance legislation to a chiropractor in 2007 whose mother bought his house.

""There's an expression in Washington called pay to play,"" Crist said, after pivoting away from a question about Jim Greer, the former Republican Party of Florida chairman whom Crist supported and who is now indicted on fraud and grand theft charges. ""When (Rubio) was speaker of the Florida House, he had a home, here in Miami in South Florida. It was for sale. And before that sale took place, he was on the other side of a personal injury protection issue. It was a Dr. Cereceda he ended up selling the home to that had an interest in that issue. Once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speaker's position on the issue changed. And all the sudden, miraculously, that bill went through.""

Returning to the script, Rubio called the allegations untrue.

""What the governor said about the sale is categorically false,"" Rubio said. ""If you want the gory details you can go on our website marcorubio.com. It's all outlined there. The house was an arms-length transaction. The gentleman's mom still lives in the home. We actually reduced the price of the home. It had been for sale for months. And my position did not change. Subsequent to the sale of that property, the PIP legislation the governor's talking about failed to pass the Florida House, and it didn't pass until months later when a deal was cut with the Senate to fix it.""

Since Crist launched the attack, we've decided to analyze his statement. This fact check has two complicated topics -- home sales and auto insurance legislation -- rolled into one.

The back story

In 2007, in Crist's first year as governor and Rubio's first of two years as House speaker, a state-mandated type of automobile insurance coverage called personal injury protection, or PIP, was set to expire. The mandated $10,000 coverage pays for accident injuries to a driver and passengers regardless of who is at fault and costs the average driver $100 to $200 a year.

Crist and the Republican-led Senate wanted to extend the mandated coverage during the spring 2007 session, arguing that the additional coverage protected drivers. Health insurers also supported the extension of PIP because they worried health care would become expensive. Hospitals liked the additional coverage because it helped defray their costs on behalf of patients.

But Rubio and some members of the Florida House weren't sold. They believed the current system encouraged too much fraud, and Rubio made clear that without real fraud reforms he would not support extending PIP coverage. The Senate proposal to extend PIP ordered a review of its effectiveness and allocated $2.4 million to fund 30 fraud investigators. That wasn't enough for Rubio.

""We have to wipe out fraud. The current PIP system has so much fraud built into it,"" Rubio said during the 2007 session. ""An entire fraud industry has been created and unless that's addressed, there's no need to do anything.""

What's clear is that Rubio was the key impediment to extending PIP coverage as is or even with minor fraud protections, a position that made him a target of doctors and chiropractors lobbying to support PIP. One of those chiropractors was West Miami's Dr. Mark Cereceda.

In the spring and summer of 2007, Cereceda mounted a campaign to pressure Rubio to allow PIP to continue, according to CBS 4 in Miami. Cereceda and other chiropractors met with Rubio in Tallahassee, and Cereceda also helped organize demonstrations in front of Rubio's West Miami office. In June, he rented planes to fly banners over Rubio's home and office urging him to keep PIP alive. (Rubio told a newspaper reporter that the people who hired the airplane ""run the fraud industry."")

At around the same time, Cereceda was also dealing with Rubio on a personal level, it turns out.

Cereceda was his neighbor. And his mother, Nora Cereceda, was buying Rubio's West Miami house.

Rubio had purchased the three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,340-square-foot home for $175,000 in February 2003. He sold it in April 2007 for $380,000, all in cash. Nora Cereceda bought the home to live near her son after the death of her husband, Rubio and Cereceda said.

PolitiFact Florida examined home sales within a half square mile. As expected there weren't many true comparable sales. A three-bedroom, two-bathroom home totaling 1,413 square feet sold for $332,500 in June 2007. A bigger three-bedroom, two-bathroom home totaling 1,960 square feet three blocks away sold in May 2007 for $373,000. Both homes were about four blocks from Rubio's property.

Rubio's sale is listed on the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser as a ""qualified"" sale, meaning it met the property appraiser's definition of an arms-length transaction. That's jargon that notes that the sale involved a willing seller and a willing buyer, neither under special pressure or incentives, such as selling a home to a family member.

PolitiFact Florida left a message for Cereceda that wasn't returned, but previously he told reporters that the home sale was a coincidence and unrelated to his efforts to lobby Rubio to extend PIP coverage. Rubio says the same thing.

""She wanted to buy it because she wanted to live across the street from her son,"" Rubio said.

The sale was finalized on April 13.

The regular session of the Legislature ended three weeks later on May 4, without an agreement to extend PIP beyond the sunset date of Oct. 1, or any shift in position from Rubio. In the hours after the session ended, Rubio reiterated his primary complaint about fraud. ""'I have said all along that we had to have significant fraud reforms,"" Rubio said. Otherwise he would prefer to let the law sunset. 
So where does the pay to play accusation/suggestion come in?

On Sept. 28, it was Rubio writing to Crist asking that the governor call a special session to address automobile insurance protections. In the letter, Rubio said the House had worked tirelessly to craft sensible and comprehensive anti-fraud legislation.

Crist agreed to add personal injury protection laws to an Oct. 3 special session regarding the state budget.

On Oct. 5, a PIP compromise was struck and the bill extending the mandatory coverage passed. The final bill, which passed the House 105-4 (Rubio voted yes) and the Senate 37-0, included three measures meant to cut down on fraud. The legislation limited prices some medical facilities and doctors can charge insurers for nonemergency care. It also required that PIP clinics be owned or overseen by licensed doctors.

Lawmakers also agreed to add $2 million to the state budget to hire more anti-fraud prosecutors.

Rubio said the compromise better guarded against fraud. But to be sure, PIP fraud remains a major problem.

The Division of Insurance Fraud received more than 5,500 complaints of PIP fraud during fiscal year 2009-2010, more than 40 percent of all fraud complaints. Investigators made 337 arrests that resulted in 240 convictions. In 2006-2007, the final full year before the reforms, the state received 3,600 complaints of PIP fraud, made 316 arrests and received 204 convictions.

Our ruling

This is an interesting case study in politics. Let's start by stating the obvious. Rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection. It seems odd. But, other than perception, there are no obvious glaring red flags about the sale. He got a good price, it seems, but not an outrageous one based on the comparable sales we examined.

Also, the cash sale doesn't bother us particularly. This is a retiree who had money from a life insurance policy.

As for Rubio's position on the PIP laws, he initially said he would let the mandate expire unless fraud reforms were included. Some were included in the legislation proposed by the Senate, but apparently not enough to sway Rubio. So the session ended in May 2007 without action, despite the house sale.

Rubio and House leaders then worked to include additional fraud protections and were able to reach a deal more to their liking. Rubio, in fact, called to include PIP legislation during a special session. The ultimate bill that passed included a few more anti-fraud measures, but seems not to have stopped much fraud, according to state statistics. We're not sure why it took five extra months to include the minor changes to the PIP legislation, or why House leaders didn't propose the changes during the session.

Crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying Rubio bought the house. It was the chiropractor's mother who made the purchase. He also condensed the timeline and slightly manipulated the chain of events when he said, ""once he sold the home ... the speaker's position on the issue changed."" We think there's at least a debate on whether he changed his position at all. Rubio never said he opposed extending PIP. He said he opposed extending it without proper protections against fraud. A version of the bill proposed during a 2007 special legislative session emerged that included fraud protections he wanted. We rate the claim Barely True.","[('\nCharlie Crist campaign, e-mail interview with Danny Kanner, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nMarco Rubio campaign, e-mail interview with Albert Martinez, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nSarasota Herald-Tribune, ""Senate hopeful Rubio plagued by money problems,"" Sept. 18, 2010\n\nMiami-Dade Property Appraiser, discussion of arms length transactions\n\nMiami-Dade Property Appraiser, Sales map\n\nMiami-Dade Clerk of the Court, Rubio/Cereceda sale official records\n\nCBS 4 Miami, ""Examining Rubio\'s Home Sale,"" May 18, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Drivers, it could be your fault,"" April 28, 2007\n\nMarco Rubio campaign, ""Crist false attacks on Marco\'s finances""\n\nSarasota Herald-Tribune, ""Fly-by lobbyists leave Rubio unamused,"" June 10, 2007\n\nMiami Herald, ""Senate: Keep no-fault law,"" April 28, 2007\n\n Florida Times-Union, ""No-fault law is in jeopardy,"" April 29, 2007\n\nMiami Herald, ""Many plans, but no more no-fault law,"" May 5, 2007\n\nOrlando Sentinel, ""PIP law may not disappear after all,"" Sept. 15, 2007\n\nOrlando Sentinel, ""No-fault bounces back on Jan. 1,"" Oct. 6, 2007\n\nPalm Beach Post, ""No-fault deal stalls as leader rejects limits on attorney fees,"" Oct. 5, 2007\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Compromise may save PIP,"" Sept. 2, 2007\n\nMarco Rubio letter to Charlie Crist regarding PIP, Sept. 28, 2007\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Legislature revives no-fault insurance,"" Oct. 6, 2007\n\nFlorida House, HB 13C, PIP bill\n\nFlorida Division of Insurance Fraud, 2006-2007 annual report\n\nFlorida Division of Insurance Fraud, 2009-2010 annual report\n\nThe Ledger, ""Pro-PIP groups lobby Rubio all over,"" June 10, 2007', 'http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100919/ARTICLE/9191024?p=6&tc=pg&tc=ar')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/20/charlie-crist/crist-attacks-rubios-ethics-over-house-deal-and-in/

Joe Sestak says Pat Toomey ""still supports privatizing Social Security""
","
In what's becoming a close Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic Rep. Joe Sestak is hammering former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey over Social Security.

Here's an ad unveiled Oct. 11, 2010. ""The stock market crash,"" a narrator somberly intones, as video and audio clips of the 2008 Wall Street tumble stream by. ""If Social Security had been privatized, seniors would have seen their retirement wiped out."" (Video shows four images of seniors.) ""Congressman Pat Toomey still supports privatizing Social Security. See, Toomey has represented Wall Street his entire life, so Toomey puts Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniors."" (Video shows images of Toomey and newspaper clips referring to his stance on privatizing Social Security.)

We wondered how accurate Sestak's ad was, since it echoed other Democratic ads on Social Security that we've rated either Barely True or Half True.

First, a little background on the idea of privatizing Social Security. Conservatives have long embraced the idea of turning Social Security as we know it -- in which younger workers' payroll taxes fund retired Americans' monthly payments -- into a system where workers may invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is that retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given the historical rates of return from private investments.

Of course, critics note a major downside -- the possibility of loss. Social Security may be invested more conservatively than some private investments, but that protects retirees from market losses. And, because it's a legal entitlement, retirees can count on Social Security, unless the law is changed. While Republicans have emphasized possible gains from personal investing, many Democrats have focused on potential losses, leading many Republicans to distance themselves from the word they once used to describe the idea -- ""privatization.""

Understanding that many seniors have deep concerns about changing the way Social Security works -- and knowing that seniors turn out to vote in comparatively high numbers -- few Republican politicians today advocate a full-blown privatization of Social Security. Rather, those who take up the issue at all propose a gradual transition in which current Social Security beneficiaries and those within a decade or so of entering the program will undergo no changes. Instead, the changes made would only affect those a decade or more away from retirement, and in most proposals, these younger workers would only divert a portion of their payroll taxes to private accounts (rather than 100 percent in the purest version) and would do so on a voluntary basis (instead of the shift being mandatory).

This model is pretty close to what Toomey said represents his current view during a recent meeting with the editorial board of the Scranton Times-Tribune.

""Under Mr. Toomey's proposal, the government would guarantee the Social Security benefits of people currently at or approaching retirement age,"" wrote staff writer Borys Krawczeniuk in his Oct. 8 report on the meeting. ""'Any change for those folks would be outrageous and unreasonable. Those people who have worked a lifetime paying into a system with a promised set of benefits need to get what they were promised,' Mr. Toomey said. 'But if we're going to be honest about it, we know the program can't continue in its current form.'""

The article added that Toomey's plan would allow ""younger workers to voluntarily divert a portion of their Social Security payroll tax into private savings accounts they would control and invest any way they want. A young worker who did not want to do that could stay with the current system of a guaranteed benefit.""

So, back to the ad. We see two areas worth a closer look.

• Is it ""privatization"" if it's partial, voluntary privatization? In our previous analyses, we have been critical of ads that fudge the difference. This one doesn't explicitly say that Toomey wants to privatize the whole program, but it doesn't disabuse viewers of that notion either.

• Does the ad go too far in directing its message toward seniors, even though Toomey's plan specifically exempts them from any changes? As we've noted in an earlier fact-check of the Sestak-Toomey race, focusing on seniors makes good sense in Pennsylvania: It's the fourth oldest state in the union, with 15.5 percent of its residents over 65, trailing only Florida, West Virginia and Maine. Sestak's ad uses four images of senior citizens, and it specifically cites older Americans in its closing line by saying that ""Toomey puts Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniors.""

Yet Toomey makes a point of saying that his plan won't affect those currently in Social Security or those entering the program in the next few years. He even said that any effort to change the rules for older Americans would be ""outrageous"" and ""unreasonable.""

So wouldn't that qualify as misleading? Not so fast, says the Sestak camp. They argue that even though the seniors are nominally protected by Toomey's pledge, they wouldn't be kept safe in reality.

When you drain Social Security revenue by allowing younger workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes privately, you increase the fiscal pressure on Social Security in its role delivering benefits to current retirees. Since retirees are still promised full benefits under the Toomey plan, the revenue shortfall will eventually have to be made up somehow, whether it's through new taxes or increased borrowing -- or reduced benefits. If benefits are to be reduced, then even retirees supposedly protected under Toomey's plan could suffer.

We ran this line of thinking by a variety of policy experts. They agreed that there's a legitimate policy concern with the transition to a partially privatized system, but they added that it may not provide full justification for the ad's focus on today's seniors.

For one thing, you could just as easily make the argument that current benefit levels are under fiscal threat due to demographic trends, yet the ad doesn't acknowledge that risk. In addition, the amount of immediate fiscal pressure will ultimately depend on how big a portion of their payroll taxes participants are allowed to invest privately, and whether the option proves widely popular or not.

Finally, Social Security has a trust fund that is predicted to remain solvent through 2037, meaning that revenue replenishment might not have to take place immediately. This latter fact is relevant in judging the ad's atmospherics, because if the replenishment is delayed long enough, no one who's a senior today -- or who's going to be one any time soon -- would face the possibility of a cut in retirement benefits. And that would undercut the ad's focus on seniors.

Paul Van de Water of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities does note that seniors may oppose even a partial privatization because they want their grandchildren to have a solid Social Security benefit when they reach retirement. ""Since we don’t have pictures of what (their grandchildren) will look like 30 or 40 years from now, I don’t think that it’s misleading to use pictures of today’s elderly to illustrate the point,"" he said.

We see his argument, but we still think the ad overplays its hand. The ad is correct that Toomey supports a type of privatization -- in fact, he's been quite open about it -- but that privatization proposal is limited and optional. The Toomey plan also wouldn't directly affect today's seniors, and it may or may not affect any of today's seniors who are still alive years down the road. This clashes with the ad's visuals, which seem directly targeted at older voters, not younger ones. On balance, we rate the ad Half True.","[('\nJoe Sestak for Senate, ""Security"" (ad), Oct. 11, 2010\n\nScranton Times-Tribune, ""Toomey defends plan to ensure form of Social Security privatization,"" Oct. 8, 2010\n\nPolitiFact, ""Democratic exaggerations about \'privatizing Social Security,\'"" Sept. 2, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Paul Van de Water, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Andrew Biggs, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Inistitute, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nInterview with Jonathon Dworkin, spokesman for the Joe Sestak for Senate campaign, Oct. 20, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzBco3V8_8')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/20/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-says-pat-toomey-still-supports-privatiz/

Ohio Republican Party flier tries to tie Maryellen O'Shaughnessy to Cuyahoga County corruption scandal
","
A massive federal public corruption investigation into Cuyahoga County is center stage in races for the county’s first county executive and 11-member county council, with reform-minded candidates pledging to restore integrity to government and doing everything to distance themselves from two prominent Democrats: County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora and former Auditor Frank Russo. 
Dimora, known as Public Official No. 1 has been charged with 26 federal crimes and has pleaded not guilty; Russo is Public Official No. 2 and has already pleaded guilty to 23 charges and will serve more than 20 years in federal prison.

The federal probe, which is more than 2 years old, inspired Cuyahoga County voters last year to change how the county operates. So it’s not surprising that the probe has played a prominent role in campaign literature and TV ads of the candidates promising to deliver a more honest, open government to Cuyahoga County residents.

But the scandal also has become a useful weapon for those seeking state offices, including Republicans who want to see State Sen. and former Ohio House Speaker Jon Husted become the next Secretary of State.

The Ohio Republican Party is distributing a piece of campaign literature for Husted that juxtaposes the now iconic photo of federal agents leading Dimora from his home in chains last month with an unflattering image of Husted’s Democratic opponent, Maryellen O’Shaughnessy. 
Even without words, the ad is playing the guilt-by-association game. (Democrats mastered the game four years ago, tying every Republican they could to the now infamous coin dealer and Republican fund-raiser Tom Noe, who ended up behind bars for theft and corruption charges.)

The ORP literature claims O’Shaughnessy ""accepted campaign cash from indicted politician Jimmy Dimora.""

That charge could certainly resonate with voters, especially in Northeast Ohio, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to test its truthfulness.

Dimora’s campaign in fact did give money - $100 - to O’Shaughnessy’s campaign. And Dimora has been indicted on 23 federal charges. 

However the two facts don’t fit together as neatly in reality as they do on the flier. 

O’Shaughnessy received the donation on June 25, 2008, a month before the federal investigation became public and agents raided Dimora’s home and office. At the time, O’Shaughnessy was not a candidate for secretary of state, but was running for her current job, Franklin County clerk of courts.

By using the term ""indicted politician,"" the ad implies that O’Shaughnessy accepted money from Dimora after he was indicted. Dimora, who maintains his innocence, wasn’t indicted until September 2010. And it's worth noting again, the federal investigation was not public when the donation was made.

The GOP flier restates the claim with more dramatic flare on the back. ""O’Shaughnessy took campaign cash from corrupt politician Jimmy Dimora,"" a point illustrated by a close up of a thick stack of $100 bills passing between two hands. 

Husted, though not directly responsible for distributing the advertisement, supports its messaging and believes the ad is fair description of the facts.

The ORP also stands by the claim argues that even after O’Shaughnessy learned of the indictments, she never returned the money or donated an equal amount to charity as other Democrats in a similar predicament have done. (O’Shaughnessy argues her campaign account is closed and therefore can’t do anything. But that doesn’t preclude her from donating an equal amount from her current campaign to charity.)

Turning back to the claim at hand, O’Shaughnessy did accept a campaign contribution from Dimora. And Dimora has been indicted in a federal corruption probe. Separately those are correct.

But the flier’s combines the two facts to make the underlying suggestion that O’Shaughnessy took the money from a politician under federal indicted at the time of the contribution. That underlying message qualifies the claim for a rating of False.

Earmark attack on Patty Murray rings mostly true
","
The race for the Senate in Washington pits Republican businessman Dino Rossi against Democratic incumbent Patty Murray. Rossi says he wants to reduce government spending and debt, and he's issued an attack ad against Murray on that point.

""Has Washington, D.C., changed Patty Murray? She said she was elected to cut the budget. But now the Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'""

The ad also attacked her votes on bailing out the financial system and voting for President Barack Obama's health care law. Murray did vote for those bills.

What we wanted to fact-check was whether the charges against Murray on earmarks are accurate. We'll take them in order.

• ""The Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.'""

We often find that campaign ads take newspaper quotes out of context to present a misleading impression. But that's not the case here. The quote comes from a reported profile of Murray that ran on the newspaper's front page on Oct. 3, 2010.

The article describes Murray as a hard worker who presents issues in common terms that people can understand and a congenial legislator who is willing to work with Republicans to get things done. But she is not known for authoring major legislation or giving lofty speeches. Instead, her seat on the Appropriations Committee has been the springboard for her accomplishments, according to the story.

""Her keenest impact has come from tapping federal coffers to benefit workers and programs.

""She has helped direct federal money to build Sound Transit light rail, clean up the Hanford nuclear reservation, repair the Howard Hanson Dam, pay for ferries and construct and repair countless miles of roads. She also has funneled billions of dollars to veterans, who have few better advocates in Congress.""

The story concludes by noting Murray's penchant for earmarks.

""Perhaps Murray's starkest transformation has been her emergence as an unapologetic -- at times even defiant -- dispenser of federal dollars.

""During her first year in the Senate, she defended her frequent votes to reduce the Clinton administration's spending requests by saying, 'I wasn't elected to bring home the bacon. I was elected to cut the budget.'

""Murray since has become a prolific sponsor of earmarks, grants awarded at the behest of individual lawmakers to favored groups and companies. Her office churns out seemingly ceaseless news releases touting millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars she helped win for projects in Washington state.

""The question for Murray now is how her brand of purse-string politics will play out with an electorate squeezed by the worst recession in 80 years.""

So Rossi's use of the quote in his ad is a fair excerpt of news coverage.

Additionally, we checked with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that works to publicize and reduce earmarks, on Murray's record. Its 2010 database of earmarks showed Murray won or helped win 187 earmarks worth $219.5 million. Out of 100 senators ranked for the amount of earmark money they garnered, Murray ranked ninth.

• ""Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'""

Ah, the Bridge to Nowhere. It was a 2005 project that brought infamy to earmarks: The Alaska bridge was intended to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport, at a cost of nearly $400 million. Taxpayers for Common Sense derisively nicknamed the earmark the Bridge to Nowhere, and it became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.

Faced with an uproar, a congressional committee directed that the $225 million earmarked for the bridge be sent to the Alaska Department of Transportation without stipulating that it be used for the bridge. It didn't get built, but the bridge was still an issue in the 2008 election. (We reported fact-checks about how Barack Obama voted on it as a senator and how Sarah Palin handled it as Alaska governor.)

The question for us now is, did Murray defend the bridge earmark? News stories led us to the Congressional Record and a series of debates that took place on the Senate floor on Oct. 20, 2005.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., an opponent of the earmark process, decided to highlight the bridge and other earmarks by proposing a series of amendments that would send the money for those projects to other projects intended to help the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. One of the projects was the Alaska bridge; another was an earmark for a sculpture park for Seattle, Wash.

""Let us find our will,"" Coburn said. ""No more low-priority projects in the face of half-trillion-dollar deficits, no more exorbitant bridges to nowhere.  Speaking of bridges, that is where this Congress will be, on a bridge to nowhere if we do not gain control of ourselves.""

Murray responded on the Senate floor to oppose all of Coburn's amendments, offering a no-holds-barred defense.

Murray said that senators knew better than ""bureaucrats sitting in Washington, D.C."" about what projects needed funding in states around the country.  ""I am out in every community, talking to people, listening to them,"" Murray said. ""It is my job to be their partner in that. I tell them that all the time. You get it going on the ground here, you develop the projects, you get the consensus within your own communities, and I will do what I can to get some small part of help from the federal government. That is how I, like most senators in the Senate, am sent projects. ...

""Today, the senator from Oklahoma has targeted another project that I sat down and discussed with local community leaders. I didn't come up with this. This came from the heart of my local community because they are working very hard in an urban core in the city of Seattle to turn a brownfield into a hub of activity. It is a project that is stimulating jobs and investments,"" Murray said.

""If the senator from Oklahoma wants to look for a culprit for the fiscal situation in this country, he should look into the billions and billions of dollars in tax cuts that have been granted to multimillionaires in this country, and he should look at additional tax cuts his party wants to implement in future years if he wants to find incredible savings.""

Murray didn't mention the Alaska bridge, but she said she opposed his amendment for the Seattle project as well as ""the numerous other amendments he has filed with the same type of philosophy, as he calls it, in the Senate."" That would logically include the Alaska bridge project, which was being discussed.

""I hope the Senate will not go down the road of cherry-picking individual projects that senators have come to us and have championed on behalf of their constituents who do not live here in Washington, D.C.,"" Murray said. ""I hope we do not go down the road deciding we know better than home state senators about the merits of the projects they bring to us.""

Coburn, we should note, disagreed with Murray's logic that earmarks are a needed corrective for too much bureaucracy. ""If we have a problem with the bureaucracy, we have all the power in the world to change that. We have the power right here to change that,"" Coburn said. ""So we can either change the bureaucracy so it reflects the views of the people of this country, or we can go about it the wrong way and have to control it by taking a very small percentage of the budget. We get two bad results from that. We get poor priorities. And, No. 2, we are not doing our job in controlling the bureaucracy.""

We should note that we called and e-mailed both the Rossi and Murray campaigns about this ad, but didn't hear back from either campaign.

Getting back to our ruling, we're checking two points here about earmarks. Rossi's ad said that the Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' "" That comes from a reported story and is a fair summary of one of the points in the story, and it's a fair summary of the newspaper's findings on Murray's record on earmarks. The ad also said Murray ""even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'"" Murray didn't specifically defend that project, although it was very clear that she felt like the bridge and other earmarks being discussed on the Senate floor should be left alone. We find Rossi's statements Mostly True.","[('\nDino Rossi campaign, ""Changed"" ad, Oct. 12, 2010\n\nU.S. Senate, Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Oct. 1, 2008\n\nU.S. Senate, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Dec. 24, 2009\n\nU.S. Senate, Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n\nThe Seattle Times, Sen.

Mark Kirk campaign ads say Alexi Giannoulias lost $73 million in our kids’ college savings
","The latest attack ad in the Illinois Senate race beats a well-worn path. Republican Congressman Mark Kirk accuses Democratic opponent Alexi Giannoulias of lending money to mobsters when he was a senior loan officer at his family's now-defunct bank and brands Giannoulias as a tax-and-spend liberal.

It also accuses Giannoulias of mismanaging oversight of a college savings program as state treasurer.

Here's the text of the ad, which is titled ""You must be kidding"":

What do you call someone who lent $20 million to convicted felons and mobsters? Senior Loan Officer… Alexi Giannoulias.

What do you call a man who lost $73 million in our kids’ college savings? State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias.

What do you call someone who wants the government to spend more, and raise your taxes to pay for it? Senator Alexi Giannoulias? You must be kidding.

Again, these accusations are nothing new. In June, PolitiFact looked into a Kirk ad that claimed, ""At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed."" We rated that claim Half True. The loans-to-mobsters claim is slightly different this time around, but we think you'll get the gist of things if you read that previous PolitiFact item.

In this item, we'll explore the claim that as state treasurer, Giannoulias ""lost $73 million in our kids’ college savings.""

When he was running to be Illinois state treasurer, Giannoulias promised to revitalize the state's 529 college savings plan, called Bright Start. But a year after taking office in 2007, one of the funds in the program -- one that was supposed to be relatively conservative -- took a nosedive, losing more than 35 percent of its value. The bond market took a beating in 2008 with the collapse of the housing market. Lots of people lost a lot of money on investments. But the fund in question did much worse than its peers. That the fund lost big is undisputed, but what's murkier is whether it's fair to tag Giannoulias with responsibility for some, all, or any, of those losses.

First, a bit of background and context. The fund in question here is the Core Plus Fixed Income Strategy Fund, a fund managed by OppenheimerFunds Inc. that was supposed to provide a conservative investment option for parents whose children were close to college age. The fund represented about 15 percent of the money invested in Bright Start.

In April 2009, Morningstar, an investment research firm, called OppenheimerFunds ""the poster child for how badly some 529 players went awry in 2008.""

The Core Plus fund ""lost more than 35 percent in 2008 due to management's bets on nonagency mortgages. In particular, management gained exposure to the battered commercial mortgage-backed securities market through derivatives that had a leveraging effect on the fund, amplifying losses,"" according to the Morningstar report. Nonagency mortgages are mortgages that are not backed by the government.

Giannoulias has consistently blamed Oppenheimer managers for the losses -- as did Kirk back in October 2009.

But an Oct. 13, 2010, Chicago Tribune story by reporters Jeff Coen and Todd Lightly raises new questions about Giannoulias' culpability.

According to the story, ""Documents and e-mails recently obtained by the Tribune under the state's open records law show the rookie treasurer and his staff were concerned early on about the aggressive move by OppenheimerFunds Inc. in what was supposed to be a more conservative fund in the Bright Start program.

""But at each turn Giannoulias stuck with the firm's strategy, even as the housing market soured and losses accelerated,"" the article said.

In an interview with the Tribune, Giannoulias ""reiterated that he was one of the first officials to confront Oppenheimer about the losses. He said he stayed the course based on advice from Oppenheimer managers, his own staff and an outside financial consultant.""

Financial analysts interviewed for the story noted that the ""volatility of the market in 2008 caught many financial professionals off-guard"" and that, among the many states with similar funds managed by Oppenheimer, ""none reacted faster than Illinois.""

Together with the state attorney general, Giannoulias' office helped get a $77 million settlement from Oppenheimer -- recovering about half the estimated $150 million in losses suffered by the fund. And in December 2008, Giannoulias' office directed all new contributions to the fund to U.S. Treasury bonds. By then, the Tribune story notes, ""Core Plus had lost 38 percent of its value for the year. Over the same period, other funds of its type showed about a 5 percent return.""

In his interview with the Tribune, Giannoulias said, ""It breaks my heart to hear that people have lost money in any fund. But what took place with the markets was devastating to a lot of individuals and a lot of businesses.""

Giannoulias' campaign further notes that in June, Kiplinger's named Bright Start among the top five college savings programs in the country, praising the index portfolios of mostly Vanguard funds for charging ""rock bottom fees.""

Again, there's no dispute that the Core Plus fund lost $73 million, which likely caused a great hardship for many parents whose children were just about to enter college. And as state treasurer, it was Giannoulias' job to oversee the Bright Start program. It's less clear, though, that it's accurate to claim Giannoulias lost that money. Yes, the Tribune story suggests Giannoulias had concerns early on about the aggressive investment strategy in the fund -- but that he opted to stick with the firm's strategy on the advice of Oppenheimer managers and an outside consultant. But analysts also credited Illinois with reacting more quickly to the issues than other states, and Giannoulias helped get a settlement with Oppenheimer to recoup half the losses. There's a lot of context to consider here on both sides of the equation. Having done that, we rate the ad's claim Half True.","[('Mark Kirk campaign, Campaign video: ""Kidding,"" Oct. 18, 2010\n\nMark Kirk campaign, Backup material for\xa0 campaign ad, ""Kidding,"" Oct. 18, 2010\n\nChicago Tribune, ""Inside Bright Start fund\'s flameout,"" by Jeff Coen and Todd Lighty, Oct. 13, 2010\n\nKiplinger\'s, ""The Top College Savings Plans,"" by Thomas M.

Democratic group says Republican U.S. House candidate Reid Ribble’s roofing company made almost $300,000 off stimulus-funded projects
","
If you can’t trust a candidate’s own official campaign biography, just what can you trust?

That’s a question that popped up as we tried to determine the accuracy of a television ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attacking Reid Ribble, the Republican challenging two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Appleton).

No, Ribble is not one of those wannabes who claimed he was a decorated war hero when the closest he came to action was watching a Rambo movie. This is more mundane -- until recently, Ribble’s bio posted on his own campaign website said he owned a roofing company.

That ownership claim helped give the DCCC -- whose aim is to win or hold seats for Democrats -- an opening to air an attack ad portraying Ribble as a hypocrite on stimulus money.

The 8th Congressional District, which includes Green Bay and the Fox Valley, has long been considered a swing seat. Both sides have targeted it this year. And with jobs on the mind of voters, it’s little surprise Democrats would tag Ribble as looking out for himself instead of others.

The ad starts with newsreel-style black and white footage, with an announcer loudly proclaiming, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Politician says one thing, does another!"" It goes on to say Ribble has criticized the stimulus plan, which Kagen supported, saying it failed to ""jumpstart"" the economy, but his ""roofing company made almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects.""

That was just the first of the finger pointing: The Ribble campaign responded by calling the Democrats liars, saying the candidate sold the family business in December 2009 and, besides, the jobs in question weren’t worth anywhere near $300,000.

Charges of lies and hypocrisy. That’s our cue.

Let’s try to sort this all out.

It should be an easy job -- either Ribble’s roofing company got the contracts or it didn’t; either he owned it at the time or it had been sold. But, as reporters and roofers know, looks can be deceiving. Sometimes you just have to look under a couple of shingles to see what’s what.

For its backup, spokeswoman Gabby Adler said the DCCC found references to Reid Ribble owning the company on his campaign website and the roofing company’s website. Though not mentioned in the ad, the Democrats are citing a contract awarded by the Kaukauna School District to Security Roofing -- a division of The Ribble Group -- to renovate the roof of Haen Elementary School. The contract was awarded in October 2009, but the work was done in 2010.

Let’s start with the ownership question.

Brandon Moody, Ribble campaign manager, said The Ribble Group was sold to Ribble’s nephew, Troy Ribble, in December 2009. Ribble, Moody said, had no ownership stake when the project was done and the company was paid.

""It’s a timeline issue and it’s a lie,"" Moody said.

Then we peeked under the shingle.

We found it’s the Ribble campaign that has a timeline problem.

The roofing job was awarded by the school district in October 2009, said Robert Schafer, district financial officer for the Kaukauna schools. That’s before the company was sold. Not only that, Schafer said, when the bids were sought, Reid Ribble was the contact person for the company. Troy Ribble, confirmed his uncle handled the bid for the project.

In our search, we came across paperwork filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in February 2010 that lists Reid Ribble as chairman of the company. They had done some work in Virginia earlier this year.

What gives?

""He is the chairman of the board of directors,"" Troy Ribble told PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Troy said his uncle, however, does not own stock in the 52-year-old company and is not involved as an executive in day-to-day operations. Reid Ribble remains a consultant, Troy said. The acquisition makes him the third generation of Ribbles to own the firm.

What’s more, on Oct. 13, 2010 -- some 10 months after Ribble said he sold the company -- we found his campaign website read: ""Reid owns and operates one of the most successful roof construction and consulting companies in the United States."" Ribble’s Facebook page is even clearer: It lists him as the president of the Ribble Group Inc.

Even the company site still listed him as president until at least early October. Like the campaign site, that website has since been changed.

For his part, Moody referred to the out-of-date campaign website as ""minutia.""

But for a first-time candidate, one promising to bring his business acumen to Washington, that life story -- and how it’s presented to the public -- strikes us as important.

Meanwhile, we asked repeatedly for documentation that the firm had been sold, but the campaign did not provide it. The campaign sent us a copy of a June 14, 2010, letter from attorney Roy Fine to Troy Ribble that refers to the sale of the company.

The letter asks Troy to sign ""Resolutions by you as the sole remaining shareholder dated effective Dec. 10,"" as well as forms for the redemption of Reid Ribble’s stock and his employment agreement.

So, regardless of whether the company was sold, Reid Ribble still has strong ties to the company. He is chairman, receives a monthly consulting fee and was active when the company bid on the school district work.

Now let’s look into the $300,000 figure the Democrats use as the price tag.

To back up the claim, Adler produced a letter from the school district to the state Department of Public Instruction outlining $1 million worth of projects that it hoped to finance with the no-interest bonds issued as a result of the stimulus. The list included $700,000 worth of roofing projects.

But asking is different than receiving.  

Only $500,000 worth of bonding authority was granted, said Natalie Rew, auditor for the state Department of Public Instruction. Of that, only about $133,000 was paid to The Ribble Group, Schafer said, noting the remainder went to other projects. (The Ribble Group has done other large projects for the district, work not funded with stimulus dollars.)

That’s a long way from making ""almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects.""

That’s laying the shingles on a little thick.

So, what do we know?

Ribble says he sold his company in December 2009, but has not shown us a definitive document to prove it, instead offering a ""trust me"" response. That’s hard to do when the campaign’s own website, which the Democrats relied on in making their claim, until recently, touted Ribble’s ownership. Besides, Ribble remains involved as chairman.

As for the project itself, the school district said the job was awarded while Reid Ribble was in charge, even if the work was done later. But the $300,000 figure the Democrats cite is also off, way off -- the actual amount received was about $133,000.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Casey Cagle']","
Cagle ad sparks debate on education cuts
","
The television ad begins with the smiling faces of several children.

The next image is of Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle standing in a classroom.

""Children are our priority,"" Cagle says. ""That's why we refused to balance the budget on the backs of our children.""

""Cut!"" some said. Didn't Georgia cut education funding this fiscal year? Aren't many school districts furloughing teachers? Didn't former Georgia Schools Superintendent Kathy Cox say the cuts are so deep that the state is now paying for only 147 of the 180 mandated days in the school year?

Cagle's camp directed us to his campaign website, which has a point-by-point defense of virtually each sentence in the ad. Its explanation for saying state leaders refused to ""balance the budget on the backs of our children"" includes a bill passed earlier this year that gives school districts greater spending flexibility. As lieutenant governor, Cagle presides over the Georgia Senate and is one of the most powerful politicians under the Gold Dome.

Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint was among those who didn't buy Cagle's argument. Cagle's main opponent in the Nov. 2 primary, Democrat Carol Porter, posted the professor's beef on her campaign website.

""To say you preserved education funding is pretty hollow,"" Swint told AJC PolitiFact Georgia.

Over two years, state spending has dropped from $21 billion to $18 billion. State leaders blame the Great Recession.

""We don't have a choice,"" Cox said in May during a discussion on lifting the limits on classroom sizes. ""We didn't give them enough money.""

Cagle's campaign argues the cuts could have been worse, which is partly why it put together the ad. The lieutenant governor notes the Legislature's effort to restore funding for the school nurse program. In the fiscal year 2010 budget, which was adopted in 2009, Gov. Sonny Perdue proposed removing all $30 million the state provides for the program. The Legislature kept $29.1 million in the budget for the nurse program. In the fiscal year 2011 budget adopted earlier this year, Perdue proposed cutting the school nurse budget again, to about $27.5 million. The Senate proposed cutting the budget to about $26.8 million but eventually kept it at $27.5 million.

Cagle pointed to the state's Regional Educational Service Agency as another example of the Legislature's resistance to balancing the budget on the backs of children. The RESA allows local school systems and colleges to share resources for planning, staff development, curriculum and other categories. Perdue proposed cutting all $12.1 million from the budget for that program. The Legislature kept $9.3 million.

The lieutenant governor also mentioned House Bill 908, which gives school systems the flexibility to spend more money on some instructional programs, media centers and professional development. School systems can also increase class sizes.

Cagle campaign manager Ryan Cassin said education spending was cut by a smaller percentage than other departments.

Some state education experts say what Cagle mentioned on his website pales in comparison with the overall state cuts.

""Flexibility is no substitute when you lose $1 billion,"" said Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association.

Garrett said the cuts have resulted in some districts delaying buying new textbooks. Another consequence is larger class sizes, which many experts believe hurts students because the pupils get less attention from their teacher. Tim Callahan, a spokesman for the nonpartisan, 80,000-member Professional Association of Georgia Educators, said some schools are operating four days a week, there's less time for teachers to prepare lesson plans and they have fewer supplies.

""I've really got to scratch my head when they say they shielded education and [are] not balancing the budget on the backs of our children,"" he said.

Cagle correctly points out that the Legislature did restore education funding in some areas and the school systems have more spending flexibility. However, the state cuts have been, as Garrett told us, some of the largest in recent memory. The cuts have had an impact on children and instruction.

Cagle's statement has some element of truth, but it ignores critical facts such as overall state budget cuts and their impact on the classroom.

That rates as Barely True in our book.","[('\nCasey Cagle for Georgia television ad, Oct. 11, 2010\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, ""I just feel demoralized; General Assembly ends supplements,"" May 9, 2010\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Re-enact overreact,"" May 31, 2010\n\nGeorgia FY 2010 budget conference committee substitute to House Bill 119\n\nGeorgia FY 2011 budget tracking sheet\n\nTelephone interview with Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint, Oct. 14, 2010\n\nTelephone interview with Cagle campaign manager Ryan Cassin, Oct. 19, 2010\n\nTelephone interview with Georgia School Superintendents Association executive director Herb Garrett, Oct. 18-19, 2010\n\nTelephone interview with Professional Association of Georgia Educators spokesman Tim Callahan, Oct. 18-19, 2010', 'http://caseycagle.com/?p=1921')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/20/casey-cagle/cagle-ad-says/

In race for Metro, Bob Stacey says Tom Hughes wants to turn paradise into a parking lot
","
Tom Hughes and Bob Stacey are both Democrats in their 60s running for president of Metro, the regional tri-county government best known for deciding what’s inside of the urban growth boundary and for running the Oregon Zoo. Hughes served as Hillsboro’s mayor from 2001 to January 2009. Stacey served as executive director of conservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon from 2002 to September 2009.

Stacey’s latest TV ad flashes a picture of Tom Hughes (in a crooked collar) with this voice-over: ""Bob’s opponent? Lobbyist Tom Hughes is backed by developers, because he supports paving over thousands of acres of farmland with over-development and sprawl."" Then it lists a number of donations to Hughes: Metropolitan Land Group, $7,500; Maletis Brothers and Langdon Farms, $5,500; Stimson Lumber, $5,000.  

Woah. Parking lots instead of precious farmland? That’s bad. A lobbyist? Even worse.

But wait. 1000 Friends of Oregon -- isn’t that a lobbying group? Clearly, PolitiFact Oregon needs to ferret out the truth.

Hughes is in fact a business lobbyist. He works part time at the law firm Tonkon Torp LLP. ""He assists the group in government relations, the development of public policy and lobbying,"" according to the company’s website. Guilty as charged.  

Before he joined Tonkon Torp early last year, he was Hillsboro’s mayor. Hughes also taught at Aloha High School for nearly 30 years. He was elected to the Hillsboro City Council in 1976, a seat he held until 2000 before segueing into the mayor’s office. Calling him a lobbyist is like identifying Bristol Palin as a ballroom dance contestant.

In PolitiFact Oregon’s view, the label of professional lobbyist in this race belongs to Stacey. He has devoted a good chunk of his career at 1000 Friends of Oregon, first as a longtime staff attorney and then as executive director. In 2007 the advocacy group fought to shore up looser land-use laws approved by voters in 2004. In 2009, he was able to squelch some legislative votes for a major transportation and jobs package because 1000 Friends didn’t think the plan friendly enough to public transit and the climate.

But what about the broader charge, that Hughes is determined to turn thousands of acres of beatific farmland into strip malls, new subdivisions and other supposed horrors?

Stacey’s campaign points to Hughes’ contribution list, to one of his lobbying clients and to statements he has made to the press to conclude that the former mayor is indeed in bed with developers. (Developers generally want to expand the boundary so they can build more, and environmentalists want to keep it tight.)

Let’s dissect.

It’s true Hughes has endorsements and cash contributions from assorted groups interested in work and growth: labor unions, Realtors, business lobbies, garbage haulers and oil companies. But he also has the backing of small city mayors, Gov. Ted Kulongoski, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian and state House Speaker Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone. And Stacey’s the one with deep pockets in this race: having raised $639,000 this year compared with $408,000 for Hughes. Yamhill County vintner Eric Lemelson has given Stacey’s campaign at least $70,000.

It’s true that Tonkon Torp, Hughes’ firm, represented brothers Chris and Tom Maletis in their attempt to turn farmland south of Wilsonville into urban land fit for a golf club. The effort failed.

It’s true that Hughes, as mayor, signed on to a proposal to ask Metro to add 34,300 acres of new land for future houses, stores and factories in Washington County -- which is way more than the 28,000 acres eventually added for all three counties. But it’s not true that he pushed for 47,000 acres as the Stacey camp alleges -- and that’s because the county committee set to recommend a figure dropped the number from 47,000 acres to 34,300 acres in September 2009. (See nifty timeline here.)

Both Hughes and Stacey support the current long-range Metro plan approved in February 2010, which adds 28,000 acres into urban reserves over the next 40 to 50 years in the three counties. That includes more than 13,000 acres for Washington County, and preserves 272,000 acres for farms and natural areas. 1000 Friends of Oregon has protested the designation as too much for industry.

Hughes has stated repeatedly that he wants to keep the boundary tight. He would, however, consider a run at adding industrial land if the possible payoff was lots of jobs for people. Stacey, on the other hand, wants to focus primarily on developing urban infill that developers say isn’t easy to build on -- like brown sites.

Stacey’s campaign director Brian Rae pointed to a story in The Hillsboro Argus to highlight Hughes’ pro-development stance:
  
Still, he thinks the urban reserves designations earlier this year were too conservative — not in terms of land for jobs, but in terms of the jobs projected. 
""I kind of hope we don't (have enough land in urban reserves) because that projects a job growth that is not very robust,"" he said. 
Hughes is clearly talking about jobs -- not land -- as the reporter notes.

PolitiFact Oregon offers another quote from Hughes, from a 2002 story by The Oregonian, in which Metro proposes adding nearly 200 acres in Hillsboro for high-tech industry.   
Hillsboro risks harming the regional economy if it can't provide new industrial sites, Mayor Tom Hughes said. ""It has to be done carefully, it has to be done thoughtfully, and it doesn't have to be a lot of it,"" he said. ""But it's clear from the case we've made that it has to happen."" 

Does that sound like a man hooked on suburban sprawl?

The claim that Hughes would pave over thousands of farmland with over-development and sprawl is False.

Texas Rep. Dwayne Bohac says Annie's List supports ""third-trimester abortion on demand""
","
Lies, truth, honesty: Anytime campaign literature shows up peppered with these words, we perk up. So it was when a reader, Randall Horton, passed along a recent mailer from state Rep. Dwayne Bohac, R-Houston, which opens: ""Honesty matters, especially in politics."" 
The Truth-O-Meter kicked in at Bohac's reference to Annie's List, a Texas group dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women. His leaflet calls the group ""a liberal special-interest group who supports third-trimester abortion on demand."" 
Is that so? 
Some background: Annie's List was founded in 2003, its website says. According to Robert Jones, its political director, the group was modeled on the nationally established EMILY's List, which describes itself as ""dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office."" EMILY is an acronym: Early Money Is Like Yeast. 
And, as Bohac's mailer says, Annie's List backs Bohac's Democratic challenger, Kendra Yarbrough Camarena. Through Sept. 23, state records show, Camarena had received about $77,000 from Annie's List, accounting for about 26 percent percent of her contributions since March 2009. 
UPDATE, 10:45 a.m. Oct. 21, 2010: After we published this article, a Bohac campaign consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed to information backing up another Bohac claim that Annie's List has contributed more than $100,000 to Camarena's cause. His figure takes into account both the group's direct contributions to Camarena's campaign, which we tallied for our original article, and indirect contributions that to date have been reported only by Annie's List; these include expenditures for pro-Camarena direct mail, campaign staff and software. Also, the reader who forwarded Bohac's mailer gave us permission to include his name in this article. 
How to regulate late-term abortions has proved to be a simmering national issue. 
In 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act outlawing a procedure known medically as ""intact dilation and extraction."" The U.S. Supreme Court later upheld the law, which had been challenged by physicians and abortion-rights activists who said the procedure is often the safest to use late in a pregnancy because it ""minimizes the chances of injury to the uterus,"" according to an April 2007 recap by The New York Times. 
When does a pregnancy become ""late-term""? Elizabeth Nash — a public policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health — told us that the term ""is more of a political or layperson term"" and that ""people have all sorts of ideas about its definition."" Generally speaking, she said, any point past the 18th week of pregnancy, counting from the last menstrual period, could be considered ""late term."" The third trimester is typically thought to begin at the 28-week mark. 
Late-term abortions are rare. Nationally, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 1.5 percent of U.S. abortions in 2006 occurred at the 21st week or later. According to the most recent data available from the Texas Department of State Health Services, 13 out of 81,591 Texas abortions (about 0.02 percent) in 2008 occurred in the 25th week or later. 
When we asked Bohac's campaign officials for evidence that Annie's List supports third-trimester abortion ""on demand,"" it referred us to his political consultant, Keats Norfleet. Norfleet told us that Annie's List only supports ""pro-choice, progressive Democratic women candidates who favor late-term abortions."" 
Norfleet sent us several news articles describing Annie's List as backing Democratic women candidates who are ""pro-choice,"" though none explicitly mentions third-trimester or late-term abortions. 
We wondered if Annie's List had clearly stated its position on third-trimester abortions anywhere. The group's website says it wants to elect more women who are ""pro-choice"" and who favor ""reproductive rights,"" without mention of third-trimester abortions. 
In an e-mail, Jones said Annie's List doesn't advocate specific stands on issues. ""We don't advocate for late-term procedures 'on demand,' "" Jones said. ""We simply provide resources to progressive Democratic women candidates to help them get elected. And one of the many tenets of what we consider to be progressive is to be pro-choice."" 
Generally, Jones said, the group backs Democratic women who ""support things like funding for sexual assault and domestic violence prevention, fully funded public schools, clear air and water, access to quality health care, and a woman’s right to choose."" 
As for a candidate's position on third-trimester abortions, Jones said: ""If there was a bill in Texas to ban so-called partial-birth or late-term abortions, we wouldn't kick a woman off our list just because she supported it"" as long as she also supported an exclusion for the health and safety of the woman. 
Jones told us that the group assumes that a candidate's ""pro-choice"" position means that she's aligned with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade and subsequent case law. That ruling established a constitutional right to an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. 
According to a report issued this month by the Guttmacher Institute, the court held in Roe that ""a woman’s right to an abortion is not absolute and that states could restrict or ban abortions after fetal viability, provided their policies meet certain requirements,"" including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. 
Texas has two laws restricting third-trimester abortions — one enacted in 1987 and the other in 2005. According to an Austin American-Statesman report, the 2005 law — attached as an amendment to a proposal maintaining the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, now the Texas Medical Board — made it so that serious risk ""to a woman's mental and physical health would no longer be a reason for an abortion in the last few months of pregnancy. An abortion could still be performed to prevent her death, but otherwise could not be performed unless she is diagnosed with a significant likelihood of suffering imminent severe, irreversible brain damage or paralysis. In addition, a fetus' abnormalities, other than severe, irreversible brain damage, would no longer be an acceptable factor."" 
Mindful that Annie's List is supportive of pro-choice Democratic women but doesn't spell out a position on third-trimester abortions, we looked at what ""pro-choice"" means to others who work on abortion-related issues. Nash called that ""a toughie,"" adding that ""sometimes organizations still support a legislator if they vote for a 'partial-birth' abortion ban but are otherwise supportive of abortion rights and work to increase access to family planning and other reproductive health services."" 
Sara Cleveland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, told us that the group defines ""pro-choice"" as ""the original vision of Roe v. Wade,"" under which ""states are permitted to ban abortion in the third trimester as long as there are exceptions to the ban for cases of a woman’s life or health endangerment."" 
But Joe Pojman, executive director of an anti-abortion group, Texas Alliance for Life, said he would define ""pro-choice"" based on the positions taken by groups that use the term to describe themselves. He used NARAL Pro-Choice Texas as an example, saying correctly that it opposed the 2005 third-trimester measure as well as parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortions. 
Pojman said Annie's List backs candidates who support ""abortions rights without limits,"" singling out state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, who voted against the 2005 amendment increasing restrictions on third-trimester abortions as well as the final version of the bill containing the ban. 
We took a closer look at the vote on that amendment, which passed 118-16. We determined that Reps. Alma Allen of Houston and Yvonne Gonzales Toureilles of Alice, both backed this year by Annie's List, voted for the amendment, while Rep. Veronica Gonzales of McAllen, also supported by the group, voted against the amendment. 
So how about truth, lies and honesty? 
It's true that Annie's List backs ""pro-choice"" Democratic women. And Bohac's politically potent statement rests on the assumption that ""pro-choice"" means ""supports third-trimester abortion on demand."" That's a premise that he fails to back up. 
Annie's List makes no bones about being comfortable with candidates who oppose further restrictions on late-term abortions. Then again, this year it’s backing two House candidates who voted for more limits. 
Honestly? Bohac's sweeping, unsupported statement is False.","[(""\nRep.
