Kai Degner falsely says Declaration of Independence was penned on hemp
","The substance of The Declaration of Independence can get you into trouble if Kai Degner, a Democratic congressional candidate, has it right. ""The Declaration of Independence was written on paper made out of hemp,"" he said during an Oct. 17 debate with Republican Bob Goodlatte, the longtime incumbent in Virginia’s 6th congressional district. Holy smokes! We wondered if Degner was right. Hemp comes cannabis plants like marijuana, but it doesn’t contain the same level of tetrahydrocannabinol - THC, for short - that gets people high. Degner said keeping cannabis on a federal list of prohibited drugs is stifling an opportunity for farmers wanting to grow hemp that can be used to make clothes, rope, twine and other stuff. Thirty-one states, including Virginia, have passed laws to allow hemp cultivation for commercial or research purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But federal regulations limit who can cultivate it. In Virginia, farmers may only grow it to sell to universities for research examining issues like how it fares in the state’s climate and hemp’s economic viability, said Elaine Lidholm, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. This brings us back to The Declaration of Independence, one of Virginia’s most acclaimed products. Rampant rumors that the actual document - the one on display at the National Archives - was written on hemp paper are untrue. Officials at Monticello - the home of Thomas Jefferson, the main author of the Declaration - say the document was penned on parchment, which is made from animal skin. ""A number of sites on the Internet claim that the Declaration of Independence was written on paper made from hemp. As far as we know, this is not true,"" Monticello says on its website. Degner told us he misspoke; what he’d heard was that the founding document was drafted on hemp paper. He sent us a couple of sources from pro-hemp organizations making that qualified claim. Degner referred us to Chase Milner, the Shenandoah Valley regional director of the Virginia Industrial Hemp Coalition. Milner sent us a copy of a 2010 book by Jack Herer, whom he said was ""kind of the godfather of the hemp reform movement."" Herer, now deceased, wrote this passage in his book: ""The first draft of the Declaration of Independence (June 28, 1776) was written on Dutch (hemp) paper, as was the second draft completed on July 2, 1776. This was the document actually agreed to on that day and announced and released on July 4, 1776. On July 19, 1776, Congress ordered the Declaration be copied and engrossed on parchment (a prepared animal skin) and this was the document actually signed by the delegates on August 2, 1776."" There are no footnotes in Herer’s book or any other indication about where the information for that passage came from. But there’s reason to be skeptical of the qualified claim the Declaration was drafted on hemp. Monticello says that analysis of Jefferson’s original draft,  kept at the Library of Congress, was most likely written on Dutch paper. ""While hemp was commonly used to make paper in Southern Europe during this time, the Dutch were much more likely to use flax or linen rags,"" Monticello says. For more insight, we reached out to The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University initiative that has been been compiling and publishing volumes of Jefferson’s writings for decades. ""We concur with the information on the Monticello website, that the paper for the drafts of the Declaration would have most likely derived from linen rags, with the primary component being flax, not hemp,"" W. Bland Whitley, the associate editor of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, wrote us in an email. Whitley added that Julian Boyd, the founding editor of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, found that watermarks on the paper used for various drafts indicated they came from Holland. Whitley also pointed us to a 2012 University of Iowa article about early European papermaking technology. Whitley said the takeaway from the  article is that centuries ago, coarse rags and roping made from hemp mostly would have been used to make wrapping paper, rather than writing paper. The article notes early European paper-making methods from the 14th to 19th centuries included mixing hemp and flax together to make paper. So Whitley added he couldn’t completely dismiss the possibility that some hemp was used to make the paper bearing the draft Declaration. ""In short, we can’t totally rule out that some small amount of hemp went into the manufacture of the rags that produced the paper Jefferson used for the Declaration but would argue against a definitive statement that it was hemp paper,"" Whitley wrote. A final note. During the debate, Goodlatte says he opposes legalizing marijuana because he feels it’s a dangerous drug. But he says he’s intrigued by hemp’s value as economic commodity and has supported hemp research. Our ruling Degner said, ""The Declaration of Independence was written on paper made out of hemp."" He’s wrong; the actual, signed version of the Declaration was written on parchment made of animal skin. Degner told us he meant to say that the early drafts of the Declaration were on hemp paper. But even on this, experts are highly skeptical. We rate Degner’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2016/nov/07/kai-degner/kai-degners-falsely-says-declaration-independence-/

Gingrich: Hillary Clinton broke law with foreign Clinton Foundation donations
","Trump supporter Newt Gingrich says the elite media has ""refused to tell the truth"" about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. As an example, Gingrich told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that every foreign gift received or foreign speech made by Hillary or Bill Clinton violates the Constitution. ""There’s a section in the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause that says no one, nor their spouse, can take money from foreigners,"" Gingrich said. ""She has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge."" We previously rated a similar claim by Gingrich Mostly False in large part because of the fact that this is a relatively unexplored area of constitutional law. In fact, the clause has never been litigated in the courts. And experts in the field disagree over whether Clinton’s situation is a violation. We’ll tell the truth The Emoluments Clause was designed to prevent the government and its leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free from external influence. The clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads: ""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" The clause does ban U.S. government employees from accepting presents or emoluments (salary or compensation) from foreign governments, but it doesn’t say anything about spouses or ""foreigners"" generally, as Gingrich said in his claim. In terms of gifts, the Clinton Foundation did accept millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state. The money was to be used for charitable work. But there is no proven evidence that she, as a person holding office, personally solicited or received such gifts. Hillary Clinton has never received a salary from the foundation, nor did she have an official role in the organization while she was secretary of state. (It does appear that some of her aides, at least, mixed department and foundation business.) ""Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing,"" said University of Texas Law professor Stephen Vladeck. ""Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they’re formally — and, thus, legally — distinct."" Whether Clinton violated the Emoluments Clause through her association with the Clinton Foundation is ambiguous because there are no specific instructions for how to handle foreign government donations to a charity that has ties to a State Department employee. The department’s own rules don’t address this scenario, either. Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute, said he believed the clause’s intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of ""any kind whatever,"" would cover indirect gifts via the foundation. But Gingrich argued it as a certainty, which it most certainly is not. What about Bill Clinton? Gingrich is also wrong to say the Emoluments Clause speaks of spouses. It does not. But there is a corresponding law to the Emoluments Clause, the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act, that says federal government employees and their spouses can face a civil penalty if they accept gifts from foreign governments. But it’s also unproven that Bill Clinton received such gifts. Bill Clinton does not take a salary from the foundation. There are some companies and organizations that have paid him six-figure speaking fees and have also donated to the foundation — including companies with ties to foreign governments. But a government employee’s spouse receiving income from a foreign entity is not directly covered under the Emoluments Clause, nor the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act. A spokesman for Gingrich sent us a Defense Department memo about the Emoluments Clause, but it was directed at employees of that department, not the State Department.    Our ruling Gingrich said, ""There’s a section in the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause that says no one, nor their spouses, can take money from foreigners. (Hillary Clinton) has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge."" The Emoluments Clause talks about foreign governments, not foreigners, and doesn’t speak of spouses. Whether Hillary Clinton is guilty of violating the Emoluments Clause is unproven. Some experts say the layers of separation between Hillary Clinton and the foundation mean she likely did not violate the Constitution. Others say the clause is so vague that it could be broadly interpreted to include a scenario like the Clinton Foundation. A case has never been argued in court. Gingrich’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cf33ef1-87bf-4133-8c29-44928f7b5ef7",/factchecks/2016/nov/06/newt-gingrich/gingrich-hillary-clinton-broke-law-foreign-clinton/

Would 51% of single parents see taxes rise under Donald Trump's tax plan?
","Campaigning in the final stretch of the presidential election, Hillary Clinton took a brief break from knocking Donald Trump’s character to hammer his tax plan. ""He's taking care of himself, he's taking care of his family, he's taking care of the super wealthy and corporations,"" Clinton said at a rally in Pittsburgh on Nov. 4, 2016, adding that under Trump, ""51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up."" Briefly, Trump’s tax plan would collapse the seven federal income tax brackets into three (12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent). He would also raise the standard deduction (the amount everyone can deduct from taxable income) but repeal personal exemptions and head of household filing status.   Tax analysts have found that Trump’s plan would deliver, on average, tax cuts across all income brackets. So how is it possible that single parents would pay more? The Clinton campaign referred us to analysis of Trump’s tax plan from the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the left-leaning Urban Institute. According to the report, authored by New York University professor Lily Batchelder, about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would wind up paying more in federal taxes. How? First, Trump’s proposal to increase the standard deduction wouldn’t be enough to offset the amount many single parents could have deducted with personal exemptions (which Trump would take away). For example, a single mother with one child can take a $9,350 standard deduction and two $4,050 exemptions, one for herself and one for her child in 2017 under the current system — or $17,450 in exemptions in total. Under Trump’s plan, she would be able to take just a $15,000 standard deduction. The end result? That mother would have to pay income tax on an additional $2,450 under Trump’s plan. Second, the head of household filing status currently applies to unmarried filers with dependents, and their standard deduction and tax rates are between those of married filers and single filers. Repealing this provision as Trump proposes would require single parents to file as individuals with higher tax rates.   Third, Trump’s three brackets would increase taxes for many head of household filers. For example, the current lowest bracket is 10 percent, but Trump’s lowest bracket is 12 percent. ""For example, in 2017 a single parent with one child who claims the standard deduction would face a 25 percent tax rate on adjusted gross income between $53,050 and $68,550, compared with just a 15 percent rate under current law,"" Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in Forbes. Put it altogether, 51 percent of single parents or about 5.8 million households would see a tax increase under Trump’s plan, Batchelder calculated. As our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted, ""single parents tend to do worse under Trump’s plan than under current law."" For example, a single parent with an income of $75,000 and two school-age children would see his or her taxes increase by $2,440 or by $1,640 if the family had child care costs that could be deducted under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder. Similarly, a single parent making $50,000 and who had three children would face an increase of $1,188. The Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank, has not released similar analysis. But its director of federal projects, Kyle Pomerleau, found no faults with Batchelder’s report. .@lilybatch We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report. The results seem reasonable to me. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Clinton said, under Trump's tax plan, ""51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up."" Trump’s proposal would simplify the federal tax code and provide tax cuts for many. But, analysts say, Trump’s plan would make changes that would affect some people negatively. Trump’s proposal to eliminate the head of household filing status and personal exemptions would raise federal income taxes for many single parents. We rate Clinton’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/45507710-0102-420f-8e0b-4b12522480ce",/factchecks/2016/nov/06/hillary-clinton/would-51-single-parents-see-taxes-rise-under-donal/

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Obama 'screamed' at protester
","Donald Trump attacked President Barack Obama for yelling at a pro-Trump protester during the president’s rally for Hillary Clinton on Friday in Fayetteville, N.C. ""You have to go back and look and study and see what happened,"" Trump said at a rally in Hershey, Pa., later that evening. ""They never moved the camera and (Obama) spent so much time screaming at a protester, and frankly it was a disgrace."" We decided to take Trump’s advice and ""look and study"" what happened. It turns out Trump’s depiction of the situation is flat-out wrong. Obama actually defended the protester's freedom of speech.

Obama tried to calm the situation, repeatedly yelling at the crowd to ""hold up,"" ""listen,"" and ""sit down and be quiet for a second."" When the noise settled a bit, Obama defended the protester's right to speak out. ""You’ve got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate, "" Obama said. ""He’s not doing nothing.

""First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military and we ought to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly and we got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, don't boo. Vote. Don’t boo. Vote."" Obama doesn’t yell at the protester. In fact, most of his defense is directed at the Clinton supporters. Our friends at Deadspin did a great job showing Obama’s comments opposite of Trump's. ""I want you to pay attention because if we lose focus we could have problems,"" Obama continued. ""It’s part of what’s happened here during this election season. We just get stirred up for all kinds of reasons that are unnecessary."" We reached out to the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that at a campaign rally President Barack Obama ""spent so much time screaming at a protester, and frankly it was a disgrace."" Trump got this all wrong.

Kander ad accusing Blunt of voting to raise his pay is misleading
","Jason Kander, a Democrat running against Republican Roy Blunt for one of Missouri’s U.S. Senate seats, says his opponent ""voted to raise his own pay 12 times"" while in Congress. What are the facts behind this claim? Kander provides sources in this document on his website and even provides quotations from the Congressional Research Service. But providing a source doesn’t necessarily make a claim factual. So we took a deeper look into the legislation itself, and how congressional pay raises occur. In 1989, Congress approved an annual cost-of-living adjustment to member’s pay as part of an ethics reform bill. The yearly adjustment percentage is based on private-sector wage changes and is applied automatically unless denied by a congressional statute. This created a system in which members of Congress can receive pay raises without explicitly voting for them on the record. What Blunt did was vote against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring. Each of the times Blunt is alleged to have increased his pay came between 1997 and 2010, when Blunt was still a member of the House of Representatives for Missouri’s 7th District. Here’s how it breaks down year by year. 1997 Blunt’s first year in Washington was preceded by five consecutive years of Congress voting to not adjust their pay, but that streak would not continue. The Senate and House versions of the 1998 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill (S. 1023 and H.R. 2378, respectively) differed on the inclusion of a pay freeze, with the Senate version supporting no raise. The two chambers agreed to a conference to iron out the differences, with the House voting 229-199 to ""order the previous question,"" which is legalese for ending debate and bringing the measure to an immediate vote. The vote, which Blunt supported, meant that no pay freeze could be added to the bill and sent H.R. 2378 to conference without instructions to stop the automatic pay increase. This led to the Senate wording being dropped from the final bill, which was signed into law on Oct. 10, 1997. Members of Congress’ pay increased 2.3 percent to $136,700. On Oct. 2, 1997, Blunt told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ""I believe keeping the current salary of Congress equal with the rate of inflation is the right thing, and a necessary thing to do to be able to attract people to seek congressional office in the future."" 1999 through 2007 From 1999 through 2007, similar actions to those in 1997 were taken in the House to order the previous question before an amendment to stop the pay increase could be proposed. For some of these years, the Congressional Research Service said ""it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that Members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity,"" as amendments other than the pay freeze were suggested before the House voted to order the previous question. Some years, however, Representatives made clear their intention to introduce a pay freeze before the vote to order the previous question was taken. Every year from 1999 through 2007, Blunt voted in favor of ordering the previous question. As a result of the automatic increases, the pay of members of Congress increased from $136,700 in 1999 to $169,300 at the start of 2008. 2009 On Feb. 25, 2009, the House voted to add a provision to an omnibus appropriations act that would prohibit the automatic pay adjustment for 2010. Blunt was one of only 24 members of the House to oppose this, with 398 members voting in favor of it. Blunt also voted against the omnibus appropriations act as a whole, but this time was joined by 178 members of the House, with 245 members voting in favor of it. As a result, congressional salaries, including Blunt’s, did not increase. 2010 Well into the recession, bills were being proposed to stop pay adjustments for 2011, instead of just tacking the legislation on as an amendment to a larger bill. Blunt voted in favor of one of these bills, which passed the House 402-15 and went on to become law. So Blunt actually voted against the automatic pay increase in 2010. The vote Kander claims is a vote to increase Blunt’s pay this year comes from the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, which froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years. While this isn’t a direct vote on his own pay, the 1989 ethics reform bill, which began the automatic pay increases for members of Congress, specifies that their pay cannot be increased by a higher percentage in a year than that of general schedule employees. So a vote against this could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases, though it may be even more of a stretch than Kander’s prior claims. While Blunt actually voted in favor of this bill when it was passed in the House 415-3, Kander points to Blunt’s vote against the conference bill, which resolved the differences between the House’s and Senate’s versions of the bill as a vote to increase his own pay. This final version of the bill passed the house 193-165 on Dec. 21, 2010. Our ruling Kander said ""Blunt voted to raise his own pay 12 times"" while in Congress. This is a misleading attack. Blunt did not literally vote to increase his pay 12 times. He voted in support of measures that could have blocked or limited automatic cost-of-living increases from taking effect. Even all of those cases aren’t clear-cut, as sometimes Blunt sided with efforts to stop the automatic pay increase. Kander’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbb9976c-3393-4a9a-aade-aed04f05f843",/factchecks/2016/nov/06/jason-kander/kander-ad-accusing-blunt-voting-raise-his-pay-misl/

Rowden claim of Webber's votes don't account for bill's changes
","In October, Republican Caleb Rowden’s campaign uploaded a video to its YouTube channel attacking Democrat Stephen Webber for voting against a bill that would ban sex offenders from playgrounds and child care centers and from coaching children under the age of 17. The Missouri Republican Party also sent out mailers advertising the same claim. Webber ""voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches,"" the video said. Rowden and Webber, both former state representatives, face each other in a battle to fill the 19th Senate District seat vacated by Kurt Schaefer, who couldn’t seek re-election because of term limits. The bill in question, Missouri House Bill 62 from 2009, was a lengthy crime bill that changed a number of laws. Among these were the introduction of laws banning child sex offenders from knowingly being within 500 feet of a public park with a playground or swimming pool, or from a child care facility when those under the age of 18 are present, and from serving as a coach, manager or athletic trainer for a sports team with children under 17 years of age. History of the bill Rowden is correct that Webber voted against the final version of this bill when it came back from the state Senate. But Webber voted in favor of the bill before the House sent it to the Senate. So what made him change his vote between April 16 and May 15, 2009? Webber’s campaign manager, Emily Waggoner, explained the reasoning in a phone interview. ""Stephen voted for the original version of the bill that they’re talking about that prevents all those things from happening, and then it came back from the Senate with this weird exemption language allowing people to exempt themselves from sex offender registries. So he voted for the strongest version of that bill; it came back and it was a bill that had a new exemption in it and he refused to support a weaker version of that bill."" So we took a look into the actual legislation to confirm these changes between the version of the bill that was sent to the Senate and final bill, and found that those changes did exist. The specific part the Webber campaign cites as the reason for voting against the final version of the bill is explained in the bill summary this way: ""Allows an offender of certain misdemeanor sexual offenses to petition to exempt his or her name from the sexual offender registry if he or she meets current qualifications for the removal or exemption and was younger than 19 years of age at the time of the offense."" This text did not exist in the summary of the bill prior to it going to the Senate. Webber wasn’t the only member of the House to change his vote after the bill came back from the Senate. The bill that was sent to the Senate was agreed to in the House by a margin of 141 to 9. The final version of the bill was passed in the House by a slightly tighter margin of 124 to 34.  Our ruling Rowden said Webber ""voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches."" That’s a misleading version of events. Webber actually supported the House version of the legislation in question. But the bill was amended in the Senate to include a provision that allowed some sexual offenders to have their names removed from the sexual offender registry. Webber opposed that addition, his campaign said, and voted against the final bill. There is an element of truth to this claim but not much more. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/nov/06/caleb-rowden/rowden-claim-webbers-votes-dont-account-bills-chan/

Roy Blunt wrong about Kander manipulating elections
","Want a claim about the election being rigged? Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is accusing his Democratic opponent Jason Kander of trying to manipulate elections while Kander served as Missouri’s secretary of state. ""On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections,"" Blunt's ad said.  Manipulating elections sounds bad. But as we found, the reality is not nearly as simple  as Blunt makes it seem. Ballot language The ad cites three cases from the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals as evidence of the manipulation. The appellate court decided the most recent of the three in July. It deals with raising Missouri’s current 17-cent cigarette tax, which appears on this November’s ballot as Amendment 3. In January, Jim Boeving filed suit against Kander and challenged the wording of the measure on the ballot. As the secretary of state, Kander is tasked with crafting the summary statements of ballot measures. This is the summary statement Kander filed: ""Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to: The appellate court determined that the second bullet point of Kander’s statement was misleading. In his language, Kander doesn’t mention that although the fee would begin at 67 cents, it would increase annually by 3 percent or more, depending on the rate of inflation. ""Nothing in the summary statement would . . . alert a voter to this mandatory, perpetual increase,"" the court said in its ruling. The ad cites another case about ballot language, which was decided in November 2015. The appeals court reviewed an initiative petition that sought to require in-home service providers receiving reimbursement from the state through MO HealthNet, Missouri’s Medicaid provider, to pay a percentage of their revenue to the workers who provide the services. That compensation would be through wages and benefits. The court determined Kander’s ballot language to be insufficient because Kander did not reference MO HealthNet by name. The court also said Kander erred because he categorized ""personal care attendants"" as ""employees"" in his language. Unqualified candidate The third case relates to the qualifications of a state House candidate. In March 2014, Natalie Vowell filed a declaration with the secretary of state’s office to run as a state House candidate in the 78th District in the August primary election. Kander’s office initially approved the request. But in May, Kander’s office sent a letter to Vowell questioning her ability to run. In the letter, Kander said voter registration records indicated Vowell had not been a qualified Missouri voter in the two years leading to the election, as required by law. The letter said Vowell would not be on the ballot unless she provided documents proving she was a registered Missouri voter during those two years. Vowell filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief and said Kander’s office did not have the authority to evaluate a candidate’s qualifications for office. The trial court determined that Vowell was indeed ineligible to run for office and dismissed her petition. But the appellate court said Vowell’s eligibility was irrelevant. Instead, the case was a matter of whether the secretary of state had the authority to investigate the qualifications of candidates.   The court said in its ruling that Missouri statutes do not grant the secretary of state the power to investigate.  Kander’s role was ministerial, the court said. He was only responsible for making sure the potential candidate’s ""paperwork is in proper order and was timely filed."" Was it manipulation? Blunt claims judges had to stop Kander from ""manipulating"" elections. ""Manipulating"" is a strong word, especially when it is used to characterize the nuances and brevity of language the Missouri secretary of state must use to summarize lengthy legislation and constitutional amendments for voters. We consulted experts who noted that crafting ballot language is part of Kander’s job as the secretary of state. Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California Davis, said Kander ""was exercising a governmental function that he had every right to exercise, though he may have  ‘crossed the line’ between permissible and misleading ballot titles."" But Elmendorf said Kander’s actions ""are very different than accepting bribes, stuffing ballot boxes, or trying to prevent people from voting by threatening them or giving them misleading information about the location of polling places."" Richard Reuben, an MU law professor, said though it’s possible Kander purposely tried to mislead voters, the court’s rejection of his ballot language ""does not necessarily imply ... malevolent intent."" ""It would not be surprising for an opposing politician in a close race call to get hyperbolic in calling such error manipulation,"" Reuben said. ""Such is the nature of politics."" Our ruling Blunt claimed, ""On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections."" This claim is misleading. Courts did object in three cases to decisions Kander made as secretary of state. But the specifics of those cases are much more nuanced than Blunt lets on. And the claim that Kander tried to manipulate the election is, at best, unproven. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2016/nov/06/roy-blunt/roy-blunt-wrong-about-kander-manipulating-election/

The Mission Continues paid FleishmanHillard $619,599 for its services in 2014 and 2015, according to public filings required by the charity. This $619,599 made up approximately 5.2 percent of the organization’s total expenses for each fiscal year. News of the rebranding effort ran as a story in PR Week, an international trade publication for the public relations field. What they paid for Greitens’ charity launched its new image to the public ""at a food bank event that brought veterans together with President (Barack) Obama, as they served meals to dozens of underprivileged families,"" according to the PR Week article. The crown jewel of the nonprofit’s new image was a new logo. It features a shield-shaped patch with a two-sided bird: an eagle to represent patriotism, and a dove to illustrate a commitment to service, as explained by a video on the group’s website. The logo won a Silver Anvil Award of Excellence from the Public Relations Society of America, a top trade organization for the industry. The campaign also introduced a new website and introduced the branding into designs for community service projects. Clearly, FleishmanHillard’s campaign was designed to rebrand The Mission Continues as a charity, not Greitens himself. This rebranding was covered by several major news outlets, including ABCNews.com and Bloomberg News. Charities have to market themselves so the people they want to help know about their services, said Daniel Borochoff, president and founder of Charity Watch. ""It’s a legitimate expense,"" Borochoff said. ""They can’t do it in the dark."" A representative from the Greitens campaign said the ad was a blatant misrepresentation of the reality of the expense. Our ruling In a TV ad, Koster said Greitens’ charity The Mission Continues spent $600,000 on image consultants. This amount was well-supported by non-profit Form 990s, which listed $619,599 in payment to PR firm FleishmanHillard. The ad was misleading, however, when it suggested that the image consultants were used to craft Greiten’s personal image, instead of The Mission Continues. Furthermore, it implied that a charity spending money on branding is wasteful. An expert who monitors charities said it was a legitimate expense.

Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte voted to cut $90 billion from Pell Grants
","As Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan traded barbs in their last debate before Tuesday’s election, the subject once again turned to the rising cost of higher education. Ayotte was asked why she had voted for ""budget bills"" that would have cut money for Pell Grants, the federal subsidy for needy undergraduates. ""That’s just not true,"" she said. Ayotte said she voted to make ""sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants."" A little later, Hassan, who is running to unseat Ayotte, encouraged people to ""check for themselves"" regarding Ayotte’s votes. ""On March 27, 2015, she voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion,"" Hassan said. PolitiFact decided to check it out -- did Ayotte, who often trumpets her support of Pell Grants, in fact vote to cut funding for the program? We reached out to both campaigns, as well as a couple federal budget policy experts. Hassan’s campaign pointed to Ayotte’s votes on a budget resolution conference agreement in 2015 -- in the Congressional Record, S. Con. Res. 11 -- and a proposed amendment to it. The first thing to note is that on March 27, 2015, Ayotte voted on a budget resolution -- which is a document that sets guidelines for the appropriations committees. It’s not a  binding spending outline and does not initiate cuts itself. ""It doesn’t have the effect of law, it doesn’t go to the President for signature. It’s also a broad ranging document that covers a ton of issues, so you could oppose a provision but support the package,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. It’s a packet of suggestions -- and, crucially, vague ones at that. Budget resolutions only set ""top-line"" numbers in broad spending categories the next budget shouldn’t go over. They never get so detailed as to discuss appropriations to individual programs -- including Pell Grants. And again, it’s non-binding. ""You can’t really say it cuts a program or it doesn’t cut a program. That’s pretty impossible,"" said Jason Delisle, of the American Enterprise Institute. So where did the $90 billion figure come from? Hassan’s campaign pointed to remarks made by Shaun Donovan, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote on April 30, 2015, that the Republican’s budget resolution ""eliminates roughly $90 billion in mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program. That would either require significant cuts in other domestic priorities to make up for lost funding or result in deep cuts to the Pell program."" But there’s something important to note about Donovan’s statement. It refers to ""mandatory"" funding. If a budget resolution suggests taking away a program’s ""mandatory"" spending, that still means the program can recover those funds through discretionary spending -- spending that Congress reviews every year. This is what Ayotte was referring to when she said she wanted to ""make sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants."" Of course, making a program’s spending subject to Congressional approval each year certainly makes it more vulnerable to actual cuts -- especially if total discretionary spending targets go down by $759 billion -- because it would compete for those other dollars in a smaller pool. And that’s why several higher education advocacy groups denounced the Republican budget plan. But strictly speaking, making a program’s funding discretionary doesn’t actually cut its spending. As noted by the Hassan campaign, Ayotte did vote against an amendment to the budget resolution, put forward by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. According to its statement of purpose, that amendment ""(restored) the $89,000,000,000 in cuts to Federal Pell Grants in the Republican budget."" Republicans, who objected to the assumption their budget resolution would cut Pell Grants, universally voted against it, and Democrats universally voted for it. But Delisle also notes that while statement of purpose for Franken’s amendment made explicit mention of Pell Grants, the text of the amendment itself didn’t. Instead, it simply noted top-line budget categories in the resolution and increased the amount assigned to them. In short, the amendment made the assumption that by reducing or increasingly certain overall top-line spending targets, a certain amount would or wouldn’t trickle down to Pell Grants. But it didn’t actually point to a spot in the budget resolution where a certain amount of money was allocated to Pell Grants and assign more dollars to the program -- because that spot doesn’t exist. Our ruling Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte ""voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion."" What Ayotte voted on was a budget resolution, a broad outline for spending, which is non-specific and non-binding. It’s not the same as a vote for an actual budget, which dictates federal spending. Moreover, the resolution didn’t call for a cut to Pell Grants. It made the spending discretionary, rather than mandatory. The change would have made the grants more vulnerable, but it’s not the same as a cut .

Republican candidate for governor Chris Sununu says Mass. voters bused across border to vote in NH
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu became the latest politician to question the integrity of the voting process this week. As a guest on the Howie Carr Show on Monday, Sununu responded to a question about New Hampshire’s long run of Democratic governors by accusing New Hampshire Democrats of changing election laws and participating in voter fraud using same-day registration. ""The Democrats are very sly,"" Sununu said, before saying state Democrats changed election laws in the late 1990s or early 2000s to accommodate same-day voter registration. He then alleged that when elections in neighboring Massachusetts are not close, Democrats are ""busing them in all over the place"" and picking a phony address for people to use for same-day registration. ""There’s no doubt there’s election fraud,"" he said. ""I don’t want to use ‘rigged’ -- that’s the word you’re not supposed to use anymore -- but they have really gamed the system to their advantage."" At a time when many people, including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are warning about ""rigged elections"" well before the votes are counted, we thought we’d check whether Sununu’s allegation was accurate. We found that while New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale, the state’s top election official says. And crucially for Sununu’s charge, he was unable to produce any evidence of buses of out-of-state voters coming into the state. ""In every election since 2000, there’s been someone prosecuted for election fraud,"" said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Some out-of-state residents have voted in the state’s elections, while others have been New Hampshire residents voting in more than one town. Since 2012, the attorney general’s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases and one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said. Gardner emphasized that fraud has not proven to be a widespread problem. ""I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,"" he said. Gardner said he used to have more qualms about out-of-state voters sneaking past election workers, but the state’s Voter ID law has reassured him. The law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don’t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State’s office will send out confirmation letters to those people. ""I said that three or four years ago; I wouldn’t say that now based on the safeguards that we have included in the process,"" he said. Sununu walked back his comments on Tuesday. ""No, I don’t want to imply I see buses coming over,"" he said, when asked if he could name a specific instance of Democrats busing voters in to vote in New Hampshire elections. ""It’s more a figure of speech that people are coming over, they’re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave."" Sununu said he was referring to an incident over Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark allowing Democratic staffers to live at her house in the 2008 and 2012 elections. Those staffers voted in New Hampshire elections using Fuller Clark’s address, which is not illegal, as they were living in the state at least 3 months before the election, the Attorney General later ruled. Sununu said he would like to tighten the state’s election laws to ""make sure that our votes, the true residents of NH are not being diluted by out of staters."" We should also note that Sununu’s point about same-day registration being passed by Democrats was also incorrect. The same-day registration law was signed by Republican Gov. Steve Merrill in 1994. Gardner said Republicans at the time were far more supportive of same-day registration, which they saw as a preferable local alternative to the federal ""Motor Voter"" law that required state governments to offer voter registration opportunities when they applied for a driver’s license. Our ruling Sununu said Democrats take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration laws to bus voters in from out of state. While New Hampshire has experienced instances of voter fraud, the state’s top election official says they have been isolated and amount to one or two cases a year. More to the point, neither Sununu nor election officials could point to any instances of Massachusetts residents being bused across the border to vote on election day. The one piece of evidence Sununu pointed to was an instance of staffers of a Democratic politician registering to vote at the politician’s home -- but that practice was legal, and it did not involve Massachusetts residents being bused across the border en masse on Election Day. Sununu’s claim is ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2016/nov/05/chris-sununu/republican-candidate-governor-chris-sununu-says-ma/

Did Deborah Ross defend the right to burn the American flag and also decline to represent a veteran?
","Deborah Ross, a former executive director of the North Carolina ACLU, has taken some flak for the positions that group took and legal decisions it made with her at the helm. Now that Ross, a Democrat, is running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, some of those past decisions are coming up in attack ads targeting her. One ad, released last month by the GOP group Senate Leadership Fund, attempts to paint Ross as unpatriotic. ""Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag,"" the ad states. There are three parts to this claim, so we examined each one individually to see how accurate the ad is. Defended flag-burning The first part of the claim is that ""Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag."" In a way, this is both right and wrong, depending on how someone who hears the ad interprets it. Ross has defended people’s right to burn the flag, although she has said she does not defend the act itself. ""Flag burning is plain wrong, and I’ll stand up for free speech – even speech I don’t like,"" she told McClatchy in an interview last month. Her stance is in keeping with nearly three decades of Supreme Court precedent that Americans cannot be punished by the government for burning the U.S. flag. Doing so is a valid form of protest and free speech that’s protected by the First Amendment, the court ruled in its 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. That 5-4 decision came about in large part thanks to conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who was the swing vote. The 1989 case applied only to Texas, but in 1990 Congress passed a law banning flag-burning – and the Supreme Court then struck it down as unconstitutional, applying the standard nationwide. So Ross did defend flag-burning, taking the side of the Supreme Court. Derided efforts to ban flag-burning Next is the claim that Ross called attempts to ban flag-burning ""ridiculous."" Seeing as she sided with the Supreme Court precedent on defending flag-burning, it’s not too surprising that this part of the claim is correct as well. ""We have a First Amendment right to burn the flag as symbolic speech,"" Ross said in 1995, while leading the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, regarding a proposal to circumvent the Supreme Court rulings by passing a new constitutional amendment. ""The Constitution protects that right. To spend time and effort on this is ridiculous."" Refused to help a veteran This is the part that gets tricky. In 2001, a veteran living in Caldwell County wrote the North Carolina ACLU for help in a neighborhood dispute. Robert McClure, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army, had been flying an American flag at his home. But the company that owned the mobile home park where he lived asked him to take it down; a neighborhood covenant said that, among other rules, flag poles weren’t allowed. McClure wrote to the ACLU asking for a lawyer to fight the company and win him the right to fly the flag. The ACLU declined. Ross didn’t personally write the letter declining to take his case, but she was the boss at the time, so the claim seems to be accurate on its face. However, it ignores a few key facts. The Constitution protects people from the government infringing on their rights. It doesn’t apply to interactions with private companies. That’s why you don’t have a First Amendment right to cuss out your boss, and why businesses are allowed to ban firearms on their premises. And McClure was not just trying to bring a constitutional claim against a private company. According to the company, he had actually agreed to the covenants that banned flag poles when he purchased his property. The letter from the ACLU turning him down said that the group received more requests every year than it could possibly handle, and thus ""we can offer legal assistance in only a small number of cases with the maximum possibility of success."" According to news reports, the veteran’s dispute was nevertheless settled quickly, and he was allowed to fly the flag. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund’s anti-Ross ad said she ""defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag."" The first part of the claim, about defending flag-burning, is a bit vague. Ross has said she does not support the act of flag-burning but does defend people’s right to do so. The ad is right that she said it was ridiculous to try to ban flag-burning. But where the ad diverges further from the truth is on the matter of the ACLU declining to represent a veteran when Ross was in charge. While technically correct, the group refused because the man was attempting to bring a claim that was not the type of legal battle the ACLU typically fights.

Deborah Ross says Richard Burr voted against a ban on insider trading in Congress, called it brave
","Deborah Ross, the Democratic challenger for Republican Sen. Richard Burr’s seat representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said Burr is a consummate Washington insider. This summer she claimed that Burr ""took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."" We rated that Half True. More recently, she has been claiming Burr voted against a bill that would’ve banned members of Congress from insider trading. ""It is a fact that Sen. Burr was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress,"" Ross said in their recent debate. ""And he called that vote brave."" Burr doesn’t deny the vote in question, but he repeatedly said it’s being blown way out of proportion. He defended his actions in 2012 after the vote, and again last month at his debate with Ross. We wondered what the real story was. Insider trading Insider trading is when someone uses non-public information to buy or sell stocks to maximize profit. Depending on the circumstances, it can be legal or illegal. In April 2012, the STOCK Act – which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge – specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs. President Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts. Burr said insider trading was already illegal, so there was no need to pass another law singling out members of Congress. ""It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading,"" Burr said in response to Ross’ barb at their debate. ""That’s the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and that’s in fact what the STOCK Act did."" Burr, however, is wrong to speak so definitively about that claim. Legal confusion There is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so it’s often up to individual judges or investigators to decide. While Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldn’t do. If you’re in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions, read this 2011 paper. Or, here’s a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. Some said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law. Former SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers ""benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesn’t benefit from. They’re immune from insider trading laws."" However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzami said in 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were ""exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions."" So the STOCK Act at least cleared up confusion from 2012 onward. And at best, it made real changes. Congressional suspicions Regardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions. One 2004 paper found that senators who made stock trades outperformed the market by an impressive 12 percent, on average. ""Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information,"" Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011. Zingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, ""despite the potential cost to their reputations."" In 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated allegations of insider trading by congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens of thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bosses’ policy decisions. One aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it. Another aide bought thousands of dollars worth of Bank Of America stock just before a report – which her boss was involved in – found in the bank’s favor and sent stock prices surging. Other parts of the STOCK Act Yet even if Burr is right that insider trading laws applied to Congress that whole time – and it appears no one knows the real answer to that – he’s still not correct that the law was purely duplicative. The STOCK Act also strengthened the power of ethics investigators in Congress and expanded transparency requirements – although Congress quietly rolled back the transparency requirements within a year of passing the original bill. But is Ross also right that Burr called himself brave for voting against the STOCK Act? Yes, and we found the transcript of his remarks on Burr’s own website. ""It's ludicrous,"" Burr said in a February 2012 radio interview, while discussions over the bill were still ongoing. ""That's why Dr. Tom Coburn (a Republican senator from Oklahoma) and I were the two brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn't be doing this."" Burr and Coburn joined with Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico in casting the only ‘no’ votes when the bill passed the Senate 96-3. Our ruling Ross said Burr ""was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave."" She’s right about Burr’s vote and the fact that Burr called it brave. What’s less clear is whether the STOCK Act simply clarified the law regarding insider trading in Congress, or made actual changes. Regardless, the law did make other changes that Burr ignores when he says his opposition was because the bill was totally duplicative.

Safe roads backers' tax claim defies reality
","Illinois voters are being asked whether they want to amend their state constitution to create a kind of lockbox to prevent lawmakers from raiding the proceeds from gas taxes, vehicle registration fees and other transportation-related surcharges that make up the state’s road fund. A coalition called Citizens to Protect Transportation Funding -- comprised of groups including the state’s road construction industry, business and transportation advocates -- has collected $3.75 million and spent more than $2.05 million on TV ads, a website and airtime to promote ""yes"" votes for the ""Safe Roads"" constitutional amendment this fall. One of the group’s oft-repeated claims in its ads and campaign materials is that the state’s infrastructure can be repaired without raising taxes if the amendment is approved. ""Now we can regain control. Vote to require politicians to spend those transportation fees on transportation only. We can fix our roads without raising taxes,"" a narrator says in one of the ads. Given the state has operated without a budget since mid 2015 and leads the nation in unpaid general and pension funds’ debt, we wanted to examine whether that was true. A taxing situation The move by the coalition was prompted by a history of Illinois governors and lawmakers borrowing from the state’s road fund when budget gaps arise. Indeed, Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic majority lawmakers agreed to sweep $350 million from the road fund last year. A few months later, those same lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to put the amendment to voters -- only four lawmakers out of 177 opposed it. For the current fiscal year, the road fund and the motor fuel tax fund combined have collected $1.62 billion, but transportation advocates have said the state will need $43 billion over the next 10 years to address needs, or $4.3 billion per year. A search of the language in the amendment did not find any references to locking in current tax rates or fees. However, a section explaining reasons to oppose the amendment suggests other areas of the budget may need to be cut in order to prioritize transportation: ""As a result, elected officials may be asked to reduce funding for other priorities, such as education or social service programs."" Many Democratic majority lawmakers have argued Illinois needs to increase taxes to help erase its bill backlog and to correct what they say is a perennially underfunded state government. Illinois does not collect enough revenue to cover all the services citizens expect, they argue. At the same time, they allowed a temporary income tax increase approved in 2011 to expire at the end of 2014. Several attempts to tax the state’s millionaires at a higher rate have failed, but no other votes to raise taxes have occurred as Rauner and Democratic majority leaders remain at war and in the midst of a budget impasse. Charlie Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting Program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and a former reporter who covered the state budget for decades, said he believes it will be practically impossible to avoid a tax increase if road funds are off limits. He noted Rauner’s budget office says the state’s budget is operating $4 billion in the red while its Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability says the figure is more like $7 billion. The state began November with more than $9 billion in overdue bills to pay, according to the Illinois Comptroller’s Office. When the next fiscal year begins next July, Wheeler said, the figures above mean it’s likely the state will be $14 billion to $15 billion behind in paying its bills. The state generates only between $30 billion to $32 billion annually for general spending. ""If they say generically taxes won’t go up they’re flat out wrong. Taxes will go up and everybody concedes it,"" Wheeler said. ""Now if they’re saying if we do this, we won’t have to increase the gasoline tax, I’d say that’s pretty dubious."" If history is a predictor, then the past would seem to suggest fixing the state’s infrastructure will mean more money from residents. Wheeler noted that major state construction programs launched by three previous Democrat and Republican governors all contained provisions to raise new revenue in one or multiple forms. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn enacted video gambling with tax proceeds going to construction. GOP Gov. George Ryan launched Illinois First by raising vehicle registration fees and alcohol taxes. Before him, former GOP Gov. Jim Thompson oversaw a program called Build Illinois that included a new tax on the private sale of used cars. Taxes and fees that go into the road fund are trending downward as well, Wheeler noted, as vehicles become more fuel efficient. At the same time, costs to build roads and bridges are increasing. ""I don’t think it’s accurate at all. It’s not as inaccurate as many campaign ads, but it’s disingenuous,"" Wheeler said of the safe roads ad. ""You have to pay for the things you want."" Additionally, some of the people pushing for passage of the amendment have alluded to the need to generate more tax revenue, if not for roads, then elsewhere if the road fund is off limits. Doug Whitley, past president and CEO of the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, recently wrote: ""Unabated raids upon funds financed by user fees has been precipitated by elected officials’ unwillingness to assume responsibility for raising taxes to assure the General Fund is capable of meeting the state’s fundamental obligations to education, healthcare, human services, public safety and pension payments. Shutting off the fund raids will help force the issue."" James R. Reilly, a senior fellow focusing on transportation policy at the Metropolitan Planning Council, wrote that to ""get our transportation infrastructure in good shape again, Illinois needs to invest an additional $43 billion over the next ten years. ""One thing we must do is make a significant investment in our transportation network. It’s hard to ask voters to make that investment, though, without the assurance that the money will actually be spent on transportation."" Laurence Msall, president of the government finance watchdog Civic Federation, said his organization found the state only has diverted about $520 million from road funds between 2004 and 2015, but Illinois’ needs are far greater than what now is collected for road and bridge and other transportation-related expenses. ""To say that you’d be able to fix roads without raising taxes fails to recognize the condition the state is already in without this constitutional amendment,"" Msall said. ""This will likely make it harder to stabilize the state’s finances. ""A constitutional amendment to lockbox road funds is likely to do for our roads what the lottery did for the state’s education needs,"" Msall added, ""which was an easy answer to a complicated problem but did not fix it."" Our ruling Ads created and paid for by Citizens to Protect Transportation Funding say ""we can fix our roads without raising taxes."" But government budget experts say the state’s road needs already are far greater than what is collected in gas taxes and related fees. Illinois leads the nation in unpaid bills and has not had a budget since mid 2015. And some of those backing the amendment themselves have written that the state is not generating enough revenue to cover needs and current spending.

Joe Morrissey's timeline on Richmond protests is wrong
","State Sen. Joe Morrissey says all the vandalism that’s hit downtown Richmond during the past four weeks of protest can be traced to ""horrible"" leadership by Mayor Levar Stoney. Morrissey, D-Richmond, lost to Stoney, also a Democrat, in the 2016 mayoral election. On June 18, Morrissey appeared on the conservative John Fredericks radio show and blamed Stoney for creating friction between the city police department and demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd underneath a policeman’s knee in Minneapolis. Another guest on the radio show, Republican strategist Martha Boneta, said she had stayed in a downtown Richmond hotel the previous night and heard horns, yelling and fireworks or gunshots that reminded her of being on Israel’s contentious Gaza Strip. ""This morning, we drove through Richmond,"" she said. ""I hadn’t been here in quite some time and I was amazed to see just the F-word written everywhere, all the graffiti on the walls, things boarded up."" Morrissey said, replied, ""This all started two weeks ago when Mayor Stoney’s police gassed - tear gassed - a peaceful crowd of protestors, moms and children, at 7:30 p.m. sharp."" Morrissey is referring to a June 1 occurrence at the Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue. While the tear-gassing provoked outrage and an apology from Stoney, Morrissey is wrong in saying that recent protest vandalism and graffiti were ""all started"" by the incident. It started three days earlier. Timeline Floyd, a black man, died on May 25. Richmond, like many cities, was calm for several days. The first flash point Richmond came on Friday night, May 29, and carried early into next morning. A patrol car was set on fire outside police headquarters, a Pulse bus was torched and windows were shattered in several downtown buildings. Police sprayed a caustic substance at demonstrators, according to news accounts, and some protesters hurled water bottles and other objects at the police. At night on May 30, protesters set fire to the United Daughters of the Confederacy headquarters on Arthur Ashe Boulevard. They sprayed graffiti on the Confederate statues on Monument Ave., including the Lee Statue. Dumpsters were set on fire, windows were shattered on Broad St. and some businesses were looted. Police in riot gear sprayed tear gas at demonstrators. An 8 p.m. curfew went into effect May 31 and helped bring a quieter night of protest. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported police ""used tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators, who started marching downtown from the defaced Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue shortly after the curfew took effect."" On June 1, several hundred peaceful demonstrators were assembled by the Lee statue when, shortly before curfew, Richmond police lined up and tear gassed the crowd. Video shows the base of the statue had been sprayed with graffiti before the assault, again, disproving Morrissey’s claim that protest vandalism ""all started"" in response to the incident. The police department apologized for its action a few hours later, as did Stoney the next day before an estimated 1,000 protesters outside City Hall. On June 15, Stoney forced the resignation of Police Chief William Smith. Morrissey’s Response Morrissey acknowledged to us that there had been rioting before the Lee statue incident, and said Richmond police - under Stoney’s purview - exacerbated it with aggressive actions. He said the Lee statue tear gassing further incensed protesters and noted that Richmond has seen demonstrations every night after the incident. As for his statement of the John Fredericks show, Morrissey said, ""I stand by it, 100%."" Our ruling Morrissey says Richmond vandalism in protest of George Floyd’s death ""all started"" when Richmond police tear gassed a peaceful demonstrators at the Lee statue on June 1. He stressed that the police fall under Mayor Stoney - a political rival who’s facing reelection this year. The demonstrations may bring the removal of Confederate monuments and other changes to Richmond, so it’s important to keep the record straight. The defacing of Richmond’s confederate statues began May 30. The monuments were already marked with graffiti when the police sprayed the Lee protesters on June 1. And buildings had been broken into, windows smashed and small fires were set several days before the Lee statue incident.

How many states have reopened gyms?
","Gov. Roy Cooper has kept gyms and fitness centers closed during the coronavirus outbreak, drawing criticism from his Republican challenger. The number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations has been steadily rising in the Tar Heel state, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Cooper has said he worries that the heavy breathing associated with exercise could increase the spread of the virus. But Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, the Republican who hopes to unseat Cooper in November, criticized the governor for picking pandemic ""winners and losers."" On Monday, Forest said North Carolina is one of only a fraction of states keeping gyms closed. ""Now, 46 states have gyms/fitness centers open - North Carolina is one of four states that does not,"" Forest tweeted.  Is that true? Generally speaking, yes. Some states are taking a regional approach to reopening gyms. In those states, gyms are allowed to open in some counties but not others. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina are the only states where governors are keeping gyms closed across the board. Our review of virus-related executive orders tracked by CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the National Governors Association backs up Forest’s assessment. Our review of these websites found that Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina are the only states keeping gyms closed across the board. Most other states have either reopened gyms with restrictions, or reopened gyms in some areas but not others. For example, in California, gyms are allowed to reopen in all but seven counties. In Pennsylvania, 54 of the state’s 67 counties had entered a ""green phase"" by June 19, meaning gyms could reopen at reduced capacity. But 13 counties remained in the ""yellow phase,"" meaning their gyms were still closed. Things are moving a little slower in Washington, where less than half of the state’s 39 counties have entered Phase 3. That’s the phase when gyms can reopen at less than 50% capacity, according to the Seattle Times. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer allowed some gyms to open on June 10, while others remained closed because they didn’t meet the state’s qualifications to reopen. But a federal judge recently halted the order, allowing all gyms to open on June 25. They’ll remain closed if Whitmer’s appeal is successful. A similar situation happened in Wisconsin, too. Gov. Tony Evers didn’t lift his ban on gym operations. The ban was dissolved after the state Supreme Court struck down his stay-at-home order. Forest tweeted that ""46 states have gyms/fitness centers open"" and that ""North Carolina is one of four states that does not."" Our review found that North Carolina, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts are the only states where gyms remain closed across the state. It’s worth noting that, in other states, government leaders are opening gyms in some counties, but not others.

Donald Trump accurate that deaths from coronavirus are falling
","With an increasing number of coronavirus cases across the country, President Donald Trump pointed to a metric that reflects more favorably on his administration’s pandemic response. On June 23, Trump tweeted, ""Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!!"" Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!! https://t.co/bKFmgOLEGZ His argument that tests are the only reason for rising cases is not accurate. But on the trend for mortality, Trump has a point. Epidemiologists told PolitiFact that due to wide variations in testing patterns, the data doesn’t offer a clear look at how likely someone is to die from the virus if they are infected with it. Gaps in testing leave too many undiagnosed cases to reliably determine a person’s likelihood of dying from the coronavirus, much less whether the likelihood of dying has risen or fallen over time. Instead, researchers say, the most solid metric for assessing Trump’s statement is the number of new coronavirus deaths reported per day. The number of daily deaths from coronavirus has been falling consistently since peaking in late April. In fact, even as infections have risen since early June, deaths have not. (The orange line in the following chart shows the seven-day rolling average of coronavirus deaths, which smooths out data variations.)   At the peak in late April, more than 2,000 were dying from coronavirus on a typical day. In late June, it’s less than 600. That’s still a large number of deaths every day. All told, roughly 115,000 have died from COVID-19 to date. The White House told PolitiFact that the per-capita number of deaths in the United States is also lower than it is in several advanced industrialized countries in Europe that were hard hit by the virus. According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of coronavirus deaths per 100,000 population is about 37 for the United States, compared with 65 in the United Kingdom, 61 in Spain, and 57 in Italy. But other European countries have lower death rates for COVID-19 than the United States does, including the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark.  So why are deaths falling? There may be several reasons, and for now, they’re somewhat speculative. One possibility is that the initial wave of infections disproportionately reached more patients with weaker immune systems, including those in nursing homes, or more vulnerable Americans who hadn’t yet taken up effective social distancing. By contrast, more recent waves of infections may be reaching younger and healthier people who are better able to survive an infection. Another possibility is that we’re ""getting better at treatment and keeping people alive,"" said Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University’s College of Public Health. Still, epidemiologists caution that deaths are a lagging indicator. The disease often takes two to three weeks to run its course, meaning that one day’s crop of new infections tends to drive the deaths that occur two to three weeks later. ""We might not expect an increase in the death rate until approximately 21 days from when we started to see an increase in cases,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. So far, the age breakdown for deaths has been fairly consistent — people older than 65 accounted for 81% of coronavirus deaths at the mortality peak in mid-April, and that age group still accounted for 82% of in mid-July, a time when the total number of deaths had fallen significantly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since we’re about two weeks into the national rise in infections, scientists will be watching to see if deaths start increasing a week from now. Trump said that mortality from coronavirus is ""way down."" This is one of the few coronavirus measurements that Trump can point to with optimism. The number of deaths has remained substantial, at a bit below 600 per day by mid-to-late June, but that’s more than two-thirds lower than the peak of about 2,000 daily deaths in late April. The number of coronavirus deaths per day has continued to fall in June even as the number of cases has risen.  Trump’s statement is accurate for now, though it’s too soon to know whether the recent rise in new cases will produce an uptick in deaths by early July.

Donald Trump wrong that greater testing is driving coronavirus case load
","President Donald Trump’s explanation for rising counts of U.S. coronavirus cases is that we’re testing more people for the virus. On June 23, Trump tweeted, ""Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!!"" Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!! https://t.co/bKFmgOLEGZ We’ll look at his statement on mortality in a separate fact-check. In this article we’ll focus on his mistaken connection between increased testing and increased cases. While the number of coronavirus tests being conducted is rising over time, the positivity rate — which is the percentage of tests that come up positive for the virus — has also been rising since early June. And that undermines Trump’s argument. The following chart shows that the number of tests across the country has risen steadily since late March. The orange line shows how the positivity rate has changed over time.   Initially, the rise in tests did show the pattern Trump touted: As more tests were conducted, the percentage of positive results declined. After peaking above 20% positive in early April, the positivity rate fell to about 4% in early June.  A likely reason for this pattern is that early in the pandemic, tests were scarce and were reserved for people who showed visible symptoms. As testing kits became more widely accessible for people without obvious symptoms, a wider cross-section of the population was tested, with a resulting decline in tests showing the patient was infected. The problem for Trump’s assertion is that the decline in the positive rate reversed itself in early June. The positivity rate bottomed out around June 10 at about 4.3%. By June 22, it had risen to about 5.3%. That may not sound like a big increase, but if more infections are being tallied simply because more tests are being given, as Trump suggested, the positivity rate should be going down, or at least staying about the same, not rising. ""The up-turn in positive rate is sufficient to debunk"" what Trump said about testing, ""particularly given that the total number tests conducted is at its highest yet, and still we see an increase in the seven-day rolling positive rate,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. The rise in the positivity rate appears to be driven by a handful of states. Early coronavirus hot spots, notably New York, have seen a decline in new infections despite widespread testing. But other states are seeing both an increase in infections and an increase in the percentage of positive tests. In Arizona, Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, the positivity rate has increased consistently since late May.   The White House told PolitiFact that anecdotally, the increased testing has uncovered a growing number of people who are asymptomatic or who have mild or moderate cases than earlier in the pandemic, when tests were hard to get.  However, an increase in the number of infections also means the potential for accelerated spread. Trump said that the coronavirus case count is ""up only because of our big number testing."" Testing has increased nationally, but epidemiologists say that if this were the only reason that new cases were rising, the percentage of positive tests should be dropping or at least remaining about the same. That pattern did occur from early April to early June, a period when the availability of testing expanded significantly. However, that’s no longer the case. Since early June, the amount of testing being conducted has continued to reach new highs, yet the positivity rate has risen by a full percentage point.

Yes, Trump said positive COVID-19 tests are making the U.S. “look bad,” referenced slowing testing
","Months into the coronavirus pandemic, much remains unknown about the virus’ origins, transmission and longevity. But the need for more testing is a point of near unanimous agreement among health officials, scientists and members of both political parties. It’s the pathway to better understanding how far the disease has spread, how common severe cases are and how best to address it. So is the president pushing to limit testing? A new attack ad from Priorities USA targeting Wisconsin and other battleground states makes that claim with a series of quotes from President Donald Trump. Over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four Trump quotes asserting testing is making America look bad, so we should slow it down. Ads in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative. That didn’t happen here. America has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world — with 2.3 million as of June 24, 2020 — and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers. Across the nation we are conducting about 500,000 tests per day now, double where we were in early May, according to covidtracking.com. That said, many countries have done more testing on a per-capita basis, as detailed by Johns Hopkins University. Throughout the pandemic the U.S. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia have all tested at a higher rate, and Russia and Qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people. Trump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying America’s testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a ""badge of honor."" But since May, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it ""overrated"" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts. He took that line of reasoning a step farther in his latest comments, as detailed in the ad. Here are the four quotes in context. Trump said this May 6, 2020, during a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds. The quote ""The media likes to say we have the most cases, but we do, by far, the most testing.  If we did very little testing, we wouldn’t have the most cases. So, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad."" The context Reynolds — a Republican — responded to Trump by highlighting the importance of testing: ""That really provides us the data we need to understand the virus activity better."" Trump, meanwhile, has made numerous similar comments, including a June 19, 2020, Wall Street Journal interview where he called testing ""overrated"" and said ""in many ways, it makes us look bad."" Trump said this May 14, 2020, during an appearance in Pennsylvania. The quote ""Don’t forget, we have more cases than anyone in the world, but why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases."" The context Trump asserts there would be fewer cases if there were less testing. Of course, less testing would simply mean officials are aware of less cases, or there would be fewer identified cases — it wouldn’t mean fewer cases exist.  But this line of thinking is consistent with other comments from the president, including a May 15, 2020, event where Trump said, ""If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases,"" and ""Maybe it (testing) is overrated."" These statements, used separately in the ad, are both from a June 20, 2020, rally in Oklahoma. The quote ""You know, testing is a double-edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. German’s done a lot. South Korea’s done a lot. They called me, they said the job you’re doing (trails off). Here’s the bad part. When you’re testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’"" (Note: The U.S. has conducted more tests than any other country in terms of raw numbers, but the ""20 million … more than anybody else"" is wrong. Russia has conducted more than 17 million tests, according to tallies from Our World in Data) The context Various White House officials claimed Trump was speaking in ""jest"", was ""obviously kidding"" or was speaking ""tongue in cheek"" about slowing down testing. Trump himself has responded to this assertion multiple ways. On June 23, 2020, he was asked specifically if he was kidding about slowing down testing. He responded, ""I don’t kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear,"" then went on to talk about America having ""the greatest testing program anywhere."" But in an interview that day with FOX News, Trump responded to a question  — ""But you don’t mean, do you mean slow down testing?""  —  by backing away from the statement and reiterating the idea that the U.S. would look better if it tested less.  ""No I don’t mean slow down, but if we did slow down … let’s say instead of 25 million tests we did 5 million tests, we’d be very low in cases right now, and everyone would say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’"" Trump told ""Fox & Friends."" Dr. Anthony Fauci — part of the national coronavirus task force — said that day in testimony before Congress the federal government is trying to expand coronavirus testing, not slow it down. Fauci told the House Energy and Commerce Committee, ""None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing."" An attack ad targeting various battleground states quotes Trump as saying testing makes the U.S. look bad, ""so I said to my people slow the testing down."" Video recordings show he did indeed say these lines, and in the order presented. And the overall impression created by the ad is consistent with Trump’s messaging over the preceding month and a half. As health officials and politicians alike have pushed for more testing, Trump has expressed increasing doubts as to its importance, progressing from calling it ""overrated"" to calling for the slow down. Though White House officials defended that as a joke, Trump at one point contradicted that, while at another saying he didn’t mean it.

No, police officer is not the job with highest rate of suicide

An annual study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that five industries and six occupational groups had significantly higher suicide rates than than the overal population. Police officers don’t register on the study when it is examined by industry. When the data is divided up by ""occupational group,"" women involved in ""protective services"" were shown to have the fifth highest rate of suicide compared with the overall population. That group includes police officers, but it also includes prison guards, firefighters and others. The latest study was produced in January 2020 and is based on data from 2016. Data from 32 states that participate in the National Violent Death Reporting System were used to calculate suicide rates.  Five major industry groups had significantly higher suicide rates than did the overall study population: Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (men) Construction (men) Other services (e.g., automotive repair) (men) Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting (men) Transportation and warehousing (men and women) Six major occupational groups had significantly higher suicide rates than did the overall study population: Construction and extraction (men and women) Installation, maintenance, and repair (men) Arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media (men) Transportation and material moving (men and women) Protective service, which includes police officers, prison guards, firefighters and others. (women) Health care support (women) The suicide rate for women in protective service occupations was 14.0 per 100,000 working population, higher than the rate among females in all occupations (7.7). The suicide rate for women in protective service occupations was 14.0 per 100,000 working population, higher than the rate among females in all occupations (7.7). But the suicide rate for men in protective service occupations was 26.4 per 100,000 working population, lower than the rate among men in all occupations (27.4). Overall, the study determined that suicide risk is associated with ""low-skilled work, lower education, lower absolute and relative socioeconomic status, work-related access to lethal means, and job stress, including poor supervisory and colleague support, low job control and job insecurity."" A nonprofit called Blue HELP tracks police officer suicides via internet searching and other means. According to Blue HELP, while police officer is not the occupation with the highest suicide rate, its unofficial figures show a somewhat highter rate than the CDC report, although for a different time period. There are indications of an increase, Steven Hough, a co-founder of the group, told PolitiFact. There have been 787 officer suicides since 2016, according to Blue HELP. For 2019, the group calculated the officer suicide rate at 22.4 per 100,000 population. That’s higher than the average rate among all occupations in the CDC study, but the CDC’s figures are for 2016. The group has counted 10 officer suicides since June 8, Hough said June 22.  There is no official central repository for information about how many suicides take place among law enforcement officers and under what circumstances, according to the Police Executive Research Forum and other research groups. The forum says research shows that factors affecting suicide by officers include exposure to trauma, alcohol use, availability of firearms and the strains of shift work; and that post-traumatic stress disorder among police officers is five times more prevalent than in the general population. A February 2020 report National Officer Safety Initiatives, said suicide risk factors specific to law enforcement officers include exposure to suicide and other traumatic events, easy access to firearms and skills in their use, and organizational stressors such as shift work.  A Facebook post claims police officer is ""the occupation with the highest suicide rate of any profession.""

Claim about violence in Democratic cities overreaches
","Are areas populated by Democrats more violent?  That’s the fundamental claim in a viral Facebook post connecting murder rates and partisan leanings in America’s largest cities. The June 16, 2020, post lists ""America’s deadliest cities,"" including Milwaukee, citing FBI crime data. It then labels each as having a ""Democrat majority"" before concluding with this: ""We don’t need gun control, we need Democrat control!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The claim raises two questions on the accuracy of the ""deadliest"" label and the partisan leanings. But the third — bigger — question is whether it’s reasonable to connect the two. Let’s dive in. The graphic’s ""deadliest"" label is attributed to the FBI Uniform Crime Report. We’ll take that to refer to the ""murder and non-negligent manslaughter"" data the FBI compiles annually for every city in the US. There are a few issues here. First, the varied demographic and cultural factors at play in each city make comparing raw data like this a questionable exercise. The FBI explicitly warns against this type of ranking: These rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state, tribal area, or region. Consequently, they lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction In addition, the ranking compiled here is out of date. Eight of the cities listed in the graphic — including Atlanta, Cincinnati and Oakland — are no longer among the 25 with the highest per-capita rate of murder and manslaughter, based on the 2018 FBI crime data, which is the latest available. The second element of the claim, the party affiliation, is trickier to pin down. We’re taking this claim to refer to the politics of the city as a whole, rather than the leadership, since the ""majority"" reference and the adaptation of the gun control phrase both seem to refer to a general group more than those in authority. We would typically use a recent national election such as the 2016 presidential race to compare communities around the country. But election results are traditionally reported at state and county levels, not the city level. We did find an analysis that looked at Metropolitan Statistical Areas around cities. But these areas include surrounding counties that are more suburban (and Republican), so it wouldn’t be reasonable to compare voting data from that larger area to crime data from within city limits. But suffice it to say, urban areas vote Democratic. The New York Times broke down 2016 results at the precinct level, and the maps show a clear pattern across the country of concentrated Democratic voting in densely-populated urban centers, with increasing Republican support in the outlying areas. The pattern applies for cities throughout the list in the Facebook post: St. Louis, Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, even smaller cities like Dayton, Ohio. Elected leadership skews heavily Democratic in these cities as well. Among the 25 cities with the highest murder/manslaughter rate in 2018, three had Republican mayors, according to Ballotpedia and our research. (But again, the FBI discourages ranking cities in this way.) Some of those cities, like Milwaukee, are led by a Democrat even if the office is officially nonpartisan. All of which brings us to the core question: is it reasonable to connect the violence and partisanship? In short: no. ""I don’t think there’s any data that would allow us to draw a causal conclusion here,"" said David Weisburd, executive director of the Center for Evidence Based Crime Policy at George Mason University. ""Somehow arguing that Democrats cause crime or something of that sort just doesn’t fit the history of crime prevention in the U.S.""  If you interpret the claim as referring to Democratic leadership, Weisburd notes President Bill Clinton had one of the strongest recent administrations in terms of funding the criminal justice system. But more broadly, linking crime and votes simply doesn’t reflect how crime works. Studies have repeatedly found that urban crime is not a widespread phenomenon — like voting is — but a product of small groups of people in small areas.  One 2015 study examined crime networks in Chicago and found 70% of nonfatal gun injuries occur within networks that contain just 6% of the city’s population. Another study that year found crime across a number of cities was concentrated in ""microgeographic hot spots."" Weisburd said his research revealed a ""law of crime concentration"": Across an array of large cities, 1% of city streets account for about 25% of the crime, and 5% of streets account for about 50% of the crime. An array of local socioeconomic and cultural factors play a role in which areas yield that concentrated crime. But it’s a lot more than politics. A 2018 study from Boston University found racial segregation is a key risk factor for firearm homicide. An array of other local factors skew homicide rates and make a raw ranking a poor tool for understanding what’s happening, said David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for a 2019 series on homicides. ""You get a number. It’s completely accurate. And it’s deeply unrepresentative of what’s going on,"" Kennedy told the Journal Sentinel. ""Many American cities are the product of a long, long historical reality of white supremacy and racial violence and disproportionate action by the criminal justice system."" A viral Facebook post links ""America’s deadliest cities"" with having a ""Democrat majority,"" implying a causal connection. The data cited has some fundamental issues, notably that it uses out-of-date FBI data and ranks cities by crime rate when the FBI specifically warns against doing so.  This glosses over the array of intensely local factors that influence crime. Violent crime in particular stems from a limited group of people in a limited area, so assuming that segment has a particular political bent based on the city at large — and that their violence stems from those politics — is a stretch at best. Large cities do have more crime. And they do have more Democrats — both in terms of general voting and local leadership. But it’s a classic example of correlation without evidence of causality.

Yes, Gov. Newsom has the authority to make masks mandatory In California, legal experts say
","Following Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement last week that all Californians must wear face coverings in certain public settings, some local government officials and viral social media posts alleged the governor has no legal authority to make masks mandatory.  One Facebook post viewed more than 80,000 times on the day of Newsom’s order claimed the governor hadn’t really made such a requirement and has no power to do so.  ‼️GREAT NEWS!‼️ Contrary to the LA Times story, Newsom did NOT issue any mandatory mask orders in CA! (He has no legal authority to do so.) This was new GUIDANCE (not a public health order) from the CA State Dept of Health, and it is a RELAXATION of the previous orders!!! It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook). The claim was made by a woman in Orange County who heads a group that also claims healthy people should not wear masks. PolitiFact in May found there’s no evidence that wearing standard masks, such as surgical masks or ones made of fabric, is harmful to the general public.  In Northern California, Nevada City Mayor Reinette Senum claimed on Facebook ""Our Governor does NOT have that unilateral power to make such orders."" She linked to a YouTube video of the Orange County woman.   While the act of wearing a mask, or choosing not to, has become politicized nationwide, leading public health officials and recent studies say wearing a face covering is an effective measure for reducing the spread of COVID-19 when people gather.  Newsom’s requirement is lauded by some and seen as an intrusion by others. For this fact check, we wanted to know whether it rests on solid legal footing.  What Does Newsom’s Face Covering Requirement Say? The governor announced new rules through a California Department of Public Health press release on June 18. ""Simply put, we are seeing too many people with faces uncovered – putting at risk the real progress we have made in fighting the disease,"" Newsom said in the release. There’s been some confusion about whether the announcement makes wearing a mask mandatory because the new CDPH requirements are technically termed ""guidance.""  But as the Sacramento Bee explained, a previous executive order issued by Newsom that required Californians to follow public health guidelines grants the state the ability to enforce CDPH rules. The governor's office also made the announcement on social media:   Here’s what’s mandatory under the new rules:  People in California must wear face coverings when they are in the ""high-risk situations,"" including:  Inside of, or in line to enter, any indoor public space  Visiting a hospital, pharmacy, medical clinic, laboratory, physician or dental office, veterinary clinic, or blood bank  Waiting for or riding on public transportation or paratransit or while in a taxi, private car service, or ride-sharing vehicle Some law enforcement agencies across the state have said they will not enforce the mandate, but will encourage residents to voluntarily comply with it.  Is The Requirement Legal?  We asked both the Newsom administration and two constitutional law experts about this issue.  A spokesperson for the administration cited the California Emergency Services Act as giving the governor the power to make masks mandatory. Through that law, ""the State Legislature has given the Governor broad authority to respond to state emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Kate Folmar, a spokesperson for the state’s Health and Human Services Agency, said in an email. Leslie Jacobs, who teaches constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, agreed that the act along with the state’s broad public health authority gives Newsom extensive power to address the pandemic, including requiring face coverings. It’s the same law he used to justify his statewide stay-at-home order in March.  ""That’s the authority under which the governor declared an emergency on March 4,"" Jacobs said. ""That transfers all the authority of the state to the governor, to the extent necessary, to address the COVID emergency."" Jessica Levinson, who teaches at Loyola Law School, also said Newsom has the legal authority to require face coverings. ""Short answer – He does. Medium answer – He sure does. Longer answer – He sure as hell does,"" she wrote in an email.  Levinson added in a phone interview that the state has ""broad authority when it comes to health and welfare measures.""  Both law professors said they believe Newsom’s order would stand up to a legal challenge, unless new and credible studies show face coverings are not effective. ""Based on what we know now, I believe this would stand up,"" Levinson added.  The professors said Newsom’s position would be strengthened should the Legislature pass a bill requiring face-coverings. But, they said, because Newsom’s requirement is so closely tied to an immediate public health issue, that action is probably unnecessary.  Jacobs added that the governor’s powers during the pandemic are far-reaching. Under his authority, he could go even further to mandate things like temperature checks at sporting events or require face shields in some settings.  Should the mask order or any future measures be challenged in court, she said Newsom would have to show that the state truly needs to require them and that they can only be done in the way prescribed by the state.  Our ruling Some local government leaders and widely-shared facebook posts claim Gov. Gavin Newsom doesn’t have the legal authority to make face coverings mandatory in California.  To justify the move, the Newsom administration pointed to the California Emergency Services Act, the same authority it used to order a statewide stay-at-home requirement in March due to the COVID-19 crisis.  Two constitutional law experts said Newsom, indeed, has broad powers under that law and under the state’s public health authority to make masks mandatory.  Unless face coverings are shown to be ineffective, they said Newsom’s requirement should also hold up against legal challenges. We rate the claim the governor doesn’t have the power to make masks mandatory as False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2020/jun/24/facebook-posts/yes-gov-newsom-has-authority-make-masks-mandatory-/

‘Aunt Jemima’ in chains is modern art, not old picture
","When the company that makes Aunt Jemima products announced it would stop using that created name and image, in the wake of the Minneapolis police death of George Floyd, social media posts criticizing the decision claimed that the first Aunt Jemima model died a millionaire.

Trump wrongly claims Biden wants to prosecute churchgoers
","At a Tulsa, Okla., rally on June 20, President Donald Trump said that presumptive Democratic rival Joe Biden posed a threat to the rights of churchgoers. ""Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church,"" he said. Those claims do not align with statements from Biden or other leading Democrats.  PolitiFact reached out to Trump’s campaign for comment, but got no response.  In efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the spring, Democratic and Republican governors across the country imposed stay-at-home orders and limits on large gatherings, which in some cases restricted the number of people allowed to assemble at churches and other venues. States are now in varying stages of reopening and loosening limits on public gatherings, though some are still requiring or recommending social-distancing practices. Some church leaders have tried to defy states’ social-distancing rules, and lawsuits claiming that these regulations threaten First Amendment rights have been filed in states including California, Louisiana and Virginia.  Such cases have pitted protections for religious freedom against public health concerns. In a 5-4 decision in May, the Supreme Court rejected a California church’s challenge to state rules restricting the number of people who can attend services. The first part of Trump’s claim, that ""Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church,"" is not consistent with Biden’s statements. In a speech in Darby, Pa., on June 17, Biden spoke broadly about the dangers of large gatherings and criticized Trump for not taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously enough.  ""He’s so eager to get back on his campaign, to his campaign rallies, that he’ll put people at risk as everyone’s pointed out, in violation of the CDC guidelines that still warn against large gatherings,"" Biden said. But Biden hasn’t said that churchgoers should be prosecuted. A Pew Research Center study of executive orders in effect on April 24 found that only 10 states prohibited in-person religious gatherings through extensive social-distancing regulations. Three of those states have Republican governors, and six have Democratic governors (Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party). In Florida, religious service gatherings were exempted from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect in April. The order came after a pastor of a Tampa church was arrested for holding services that defied Hillsborough County public health orders. Prosecutors later dropped the misdemeanor charges against the pastor, citing his cooperation with social-distancing rules. We couldn’t find examples of Biden or any other leading Democrats saying they wanted to prosecute churchgoers for disobeying social distancing guidelines. The second part of Trump’s statement claims that Biden and other Democrats don’t want to see people prosecuted for burning churches. During demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality on the night of May 31, a fire was set in the basement nursery of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is near the White House. Earlier that day, Biden condemned the violence occurring at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations. ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response,"" Biden wrote in a statement on Medium. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not."" In a May appearance on ABC News' ""This Week,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is room for peaceful protest in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. ""I do think that there’s a place for protest at the sign of a knee going into the neck of a person who’s not offering resistance,"" Pelosi said. ""When you have a crowd, you will have those who will disrupt, and that is most unfortunate."" Democratic mayors, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, have also condemned destruction that’s taken place at some demonstrations. ""When you burn down this city, you’re burning down our community,"" Bottoms said in May after people set cars on fire during protests. Trump said that Biden and other Democrats were in favor of prosecuting churchgoers, but didn’t want to prosecute people for burning churches.  We didn’t find any leading Democrats who said they wanted to prosecute churchgoers for disobeying social distancing rules.  We also didn’t find statements from Biden or other leading Democrats that people who set fires at churches shouldn’t be prosecuted. In fact, Biden and other leading Democrats spoke out against violence and burnings that took place at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations.

Facebook user posts photo from past Trump rally, wrongly claims it shows packed Tulsa arena
","President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., the first since the coronavirus hit the U.S., drew 6,200 people, the Tulsa fire department said. That’s a far cry from the 19,000 people the city’s BOK Center can fit, and an even farther cry from the 1 million people who the Trump campaign said registered to attend. The campaign hyped the rally as a major event with an expected overflow crowd big enough to cheer on a second speech outside the arena, but organizers canceled the second address when that crowd didn’t materialize. Reporters on site shared photos and videos of empty blue seats and a comparatively sparse crowd, while critics jeered Trump on social media and joked about TikTok users who registered for tickets with no intention of showing. Now, supporters of the president are defending him by flooding social media with photos that they say show a nearly sold-out arena in Tulsa.  One Facebook post shows a packed arena from the vantage point of two people sitting in the venue’s upper deck.

President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the BOK Center on June 20, 2020, in Tulsa, Okla.
