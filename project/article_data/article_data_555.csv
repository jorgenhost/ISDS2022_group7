One Wisconsin Now says Scott Walker and the Legislature have increased spending by $140 million
","
With his first ""state of the state"" address the night of Feb. 1, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker likely will tout some of his early legislative victories.

Among them: Three tax breaks worth an estimated $140 million.

But one of Walker’s political antagonists, Madison-based One Wisconsin Now, has slammed the three bills. In a Jan. 28, 2011, news release, the liberal advocacy group said:

""Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending.""

So, which is it? Tax cuts or spending?

We know that state government folks are pretty crafty. But is it really possible for them to spend money they’ve decided not to tax in the first place?

One Wisconsin Now’s statement cites three of the measures taken up by lawmakers since Walker called them into special session just hours after being inaugurated on Jan. 3, 2011.

Here’s a look at each of the bills and their financial impact as estimated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s non-partisan research agency.

Economic development tax credit

Signed into law Jan. 31, 2011, this bill increases the state’s economic development tax credit fund to $98.1 million, up from $73.1 million. The fund provides a tax credit for job creation, capital investment or related activity. The additional $25 million in credits is not expected to be claimed during the 2011-2013 biennium.

So, if employers create new jobs and claim the credits, they would pay less in taxes to the state. No spending would be involved.

Health Savings Account deduction

Also signed into law, this measure allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Nearly every other state already allows this.

The deductions will reduce state revenue by an estimated $20.7 million in 2011-2012 and $27.3 million in 2012-2013.

Tax deduction for creating jobs

Under this bill, which is awaiting Walker’s signature, employers would receive a tax deduction for each job they create. They would pay an estimated $33.5 million less per year in income and franchise taxes.  

In other words, the bill doesn’t result in any spending, but the state would take in less tax money.

See a pattern here?

The bills in question don’t create any expenditures -- those are done in budget bills, which Walker has yet to introduce. But they do mean the state will take in less money.

One Wisconsin Now says they apply to ""special interests."" They may be targeted for specific purposes, but they also hit a wide range of people, including small business owners and any working person who has an HSA.

We asked Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, how his organization could say the state would be spending $140 million when the effect of the three bills would be that the state would have $140 million less to spend.

His reply: ""When money would otherwise be in the treasury which is no longer going to be there as a result of legislative action, that is the definition of spending.""

Actually, it’s just the Legislature making the treasury smaller. But we decided to ask the question again.

Ross: ""If no action had been taken, this money would have been in the treasury. It will now no longer be in the treasury. We feel that is a form of spending.""

Hmmm.

Ross is no dummy. He has a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.A. from George Washington University, according to a political bio. He’s worked for a number of Democratic politicos, including Wisconsin congressman Ron Kind. He even worked as a journalist.

And Ross isn’t alone with his spending notion.

David Riemer, who was budget director under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, said the concept of a ""tax expenditure"" dates back some 50 years to Stanley Surrey, an assistant U.S. treasury secretary. The idea, Riemer said, is that tax breaks with a particular purpose that could be accomplished by direct spending should be considered expenditures.

""Their way of viewing this,"" Riemer said of One Wisconsin Now, ""is a legitimate, honestly grounded approach. But there’s also legitimate arguments on the other side.""

OK, let’s go to the other side.

George Lightbourn, who was secretary of administration under two Republican Wisconsin governors, said that what One Wisconsin Now is claiming is ""ridiculous"" -- ""there’s nothing being spent, there’s not an appropriation being made.""

""From a political standpoint, I could see where you’d make that argument,"" Lightbourn said, referring to One Wisconsin Now. ""But it wouldn’t hold water with the accountants.""

Or with the average taxpayer.

We decided to try Ross a third time. This time, he tried to make his case by pointing out that Walker had described the federal stimulus bill as spending, even though the bill included tax cuts.

Tax cuts and credits did make up about one-third of the $862 billion stimulus-- but two-thirds was spending.

Three strikes is enough.

One Wisconsin Now called $140 million in state tax breaks ""spending."" It’s estimated that the three bills in question would bring in $140 million less to state coffers. But that’s not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have.

We rate the statement Pants on Fire. 
Update: The day this PolitiFact item, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross modified the way he described the three tax break bills. Rather than calling them spending, he said in a news release issued by the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin that the bills are ""deficit-hiking corporate giveaways.""",/factchecks/2011/feb/01/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-scott-walker-and-legislatur/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Trade', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says U.S. trade lags behind other developed nations
","
When a former United States trade ambassador wins a seat in the U.S. Senate, it’s a sure bet he’ll advance his pro-trade views when talking with constituents.

So Rob Portman, the freshman Republican senator from Ohio, surprised no one when he told the Toledo Regional Chamber of Commerce on Jan. 20 that the United States ""should be aggressively promoting the reduction of barriers overseas to U.S. products."" But Portman, a trade ambassador under President George W. Bush,  added this nugget, according to coverage in the Toledo Blade: ""We don’t trade as much as other developed countries.""

That latter statement struck us as curious since the United States appears to export a massive amount of goods and services -- $1.8 trillion worth in 2008, according to Commerce Department data. Measured in absolute terms, few countries can match the United States when it comes to products shipped abroad, according to the World Trade Organization and the CIA World Factbook, both of which put United States exports of merchandise, the broadest category, behind only Germany and China.

But Portman’s communications director, Jeffrey Sadosky, told us that when Portman was comparing United States trade with that of other countries, he was measuring the value of exports as they relate to each country’s overall economy. Sadosky pointed us to the World Bank, which tracks the value of exports from all countries and rates them as a measure of gross domestic product, or each country’s output of goods and services. By that measure, the United States is a slacker.

World Bank data that we reviewed independently showed the United States to be near rock bottom: This country’s exports represented 13 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, equal to Haiti and barely better than Nepal and Tonga (12 percent) and Ethiopia (11 percent). We chose 2008, as did Portman, because it represented a year before economies were declining rapidly.

To make this easier to understand, consider this analogy about crime. A big city is likely to have more crimes than a small one, so in absolute numbers, the big city will seem a lot more crime-ridden. But if you compare the number of crimes against the number of people living in a small city, you get the crime rate, which can more accurately reflect the safety of a community.

Comparing trade numbers can yield the same kind of distortion. Looking just at absolute numbers, a large country like the United States can appear to be in the top tier of exporting nations. But if you compare exports to the GDP, you get a much different picture.

Here’s how some other nations compare with the U.S. export-to-GDP ratio of 13 percent:
  
Economists say there are logical reasons for this disparity. The United States is rich with resources and largely self-sufficient. It borders only two other countries, whereas cross-border trade in Europe grew out of necessity as well as custom. Germany and China have developed economies that specifically promote and rely on exports. And as the World Trade Organization notes other factors, including the price of fuel and exchange rates, can affect the ratios.

Portman argues the United States could expand its economy and develop a lot more jobs if it followed a more aggressive export path. We’re not here to debate trade policy, but we checked with experts in academia and at the World Bank to see if Portman’s way of measuring trade -- as a percentage of GDP -- was valid.

Yes, they said.

""That way of measuring trade is considered to be appropriate, although, as you recognize, those small relative numbers mask very large absolute numbers,"" Donald Boudreaux,"" a professor and authority on the economics of international trade at George Mason University, told us in an e-mail.

Yet Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, a manufacturers’ group that focuses on domestic growth, took issue with the way Portman uses this export ratio. Portman left out a big part of the equation, Tonelson suggested..

That’s because if the United States accepts more trade agreements in order to expand exports, it is likely to result in more foreign goods coming into the United States, too. That’s the very problem with existing trade agreements, Tonelson and other critics say: The benefits of jobs supporting exports are outweighed by the jobs lost as companies move operations offshore to use their cheaper labor.

""Unfortunately, far too many of these free trade agreements have been structured not to expand net U.S. exports but to boost net U.S. imports,"" Tonelson said in a telephone interview. ""In fact, they have been aimed largely at outsourcing, and we know this because so many of them in the 1990s were signed with very low-income, very export-dependent countries like Mexico and China.""

We’re not going to settle that debate. Plenty of people, including Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also support going slow or applying the brakes on trade. But we’ll note that Portman has a lot fellow travelers, including President Barack Obama, who wants to double U.S. exports in the next five years. Even the administration of Ohio’s former governor, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, described exports as a bright spot in the state’s economy.

So we turn to the Truth-O-Meter.

Portman’s statement was made to bolster of a point of view. But economists say that Portman’s measure -- exports as a percentage of GDP -- is valid and useful. Dispute his goals if you wish, but Portman’s claim about the United States’ export rate is accurate.

"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says there have been 50 million abortions since Roe
","
Gov. Rick Perry marked the 38th anniversary of what he called ""the tragedy"" of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision by speaking to fellow abortion opponents at the Jan. 22 Texas Rally for Life outside the Capitol building. 
Perry said that since the 1973 decision, which established abortion as a constitutional right, ""50 million, 50 million children have lost their chances. That is a catastrophic number."" 
PolitiFact Texas readers asked us to check Perry's statement. 
But before diving in, we noted two issues with Perry's use of ""children"" -- a flash point in the political, moral and scientific national debate over abortion. One, abortion rights supporters dispute calling unborn fetuses ""children."" Second, an unknown share of the 50 million aborted pregnancies referenced by Perry would not have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths. 
For our inquiry, we focused on the number of U.S. abortions since Roe was decided. 
The Roe v. Wade ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and held that the right to privacy ""is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" It said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability ""is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."" 
After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. 
During the early 1960s, every state except Pennsylvania allowed abortions when needed to protect a woman's life, according to a March 2003 article published by the universally respected Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. At the time Roe was decided, 17 states allowed abortions in certain other situations such as when pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. In 1972, the year before the Roe ruling, about 587,000 legal abortions were reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a 2005 CDC report. 
And since 1973? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a January 2010 report from the National Right to Life Committee, a Washington-based group that opposes abortion, that says about 52 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2009. According to the report, the group arrived at the total using figures from the Guttmacher Institute for 1973 through 2005; estimating a number for the next four years; and finally adding 3 percent to account for under-reporting. The National Right to Life publication says 3 percent is the under-reporting rate estimated by Guttmacher. 
Using a similar methodology, National Right to Life has since updated its numbers. The new report says that more than 53 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2010. 
Rachel Jones, a senior research associate at Guttmacher, told us the institute doesn't adjust its numbers — which are estimates based on surveys of facilities where abortions are performed, including hospitals and clinics — for under-reporting. She said a 1994 Guttmacher study had found that some small facilities weren't included in the institute's survey, which indicated that the number of abortions in 1992 was actually 3 percent to 4 percent more than reported. 
Our attempts to reach officials at National Right to Life were unsuccessful. 
Next, we sought the most up-to-date abortion data from Guttmacher. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind provided us with a 2011 report that includes annual data on abortions from 1973 through 2008. The total: 49.3 million. 
We also sought abortion numbers from other sources. Data from the CDC indicate that there were 37.8 million abortions from 1973 through 2006. However, according to the CDC's website, states are not required to report abortion information to the agency, so in some years, the numbers are incomplete. For example, the CDC's 2006 data do not include information on abortions in California, Louisiana or New Hampshire. 
Representatives of abortion rights organizations Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Texas told us that the Guttmacher Institute is the best source for this information. 
Summing up: Perry's statement indicating that there have been 50 million abortions in the United States since 1973 appears to be on target. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that there were 49.3 million abortions in the U.S. through 2008 — 700,000 shy of 50 million. Considering that Guttmacher says there were more than 1 million abortions in both 2007 and 2008, it's reasonable to conclude that the United States has reached the 50 million mark.

Congressman tweets Obama pro- ""amnesty"" during State of the Union
","
Shouting ""you lie"" at President Barack Obama? That’s so 2009.

During 2011’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, lobbed his real-time critiques in the form of tweets, all from his office.

""Mr. President, you don’t believe in the Constitution. You believe in socialism,"" Broun posted on his Twitter account.

""Obama’s policies kill free-enterprise,"" said another.  

Broun made headlines. Critics noted how his tone clashed with the conciliatory one politicians struck after the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Jan. 8.

We took notice because Broun addressed a subject that’s been on our minds: immigration policy.

""President Obama is calling for amnesty,"" Broun tweeted.

We’ve never heard Obama say he supports ""amnesty,"" but we’ve heard his opponents say over and again that he does.

So is the president for or against it?   

Broun spokeswoman Debbee Keller said the tweet responded to a reference Obama made in his speech to the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which failed during last year’s lame-duck session. It would have allowed illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children to become citizens if they attend college or serve in the military.  

The DREAM Act would affect a smaller segment of the country’s roughly 11.1 million illegal immigrants than a Republican effort that failed in 2007 under President George W. Bush. That proposal would have granted temporary legal status to nearly all illegal immigrants in the country while allowing them to apply for residence and eventual citizenship.

By definition, ""amnesty"" means to overlook an offense, Keller said. Since the DREAM Act would have forgiven certain people for immigrating to the U.S. illegally, it counts as amnesty.

Simple enough, right?

Well, maybe. Maybe not.

Opponents to the DREAM Act criticize it by calling it ""amnesty."" Backers of the legislation don’t. They prefer ""legalization"" and ""earned legalization"" because ""amnesty"" has such negative overtones.

Obama doesn’t use ""amnesty"" either. In an official position statement on the broader topic of immigration reform, he says ""the immigration debate has often been portrayed as a false choice between amnesty and mass deportation.""   

We talked to Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. The group believes fewer immigrants should be allowed into the U.S. It thinks the DREAM Act has some merits but needs major revisions.

We also talked to Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that has studied the DREAM Act.

Camarota and Rosenblum noted that under existing DREAM Act proposals, forgiveness comes with strings attached. Rosenblum emphasized that it grants citizenship only under certain conditions that many may be unable to meet.

According to the MPI’s July 2010 analysis, slightly more than 2.1 million youths and young adults could be eligible to apply for legal status if the legislation were enacted. But historical trends indicate that only 38 percent would likely be able to complete the requirements to become permanent, legal residents.  

That’s because the odds are against them. Dropout rates for Hispanic youths are at about 20 percent, vs. 5 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Many live at 200 percent of the poverty rate or lower, a group that tends to complete college associate’s degrees at lower rates.

We found the DREAM Act’s strings are bigger than those in the U.S.’ only major legalization program, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.

That legislation, which was described as ""amnesty"" at the time, had no college education or military service requirement. Illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982; were not felons or convicted of three or more misdemeanors in the U.S.; and demonstrated a basic knowledge of English and American history and government.

Both experts agreed that the term ""amnesty"" is so charged that it complicates the debate. Since 1986, it has become ""a bad word,"" Rosenblum said.

Rosenblum does not describe the DREAM Act as ""amnesty."" Unlike the 1986 bill, the DREAM Act requires that when they apply, they commit to future actions -- such as completing two years of college -- in order to gain legal permanent residence. This means it will be easier to monitor for fraud and compliance.  

Rosenblum also notes it bears significant resemblance to another already-existing ""earned"" path to citizenship. Currently, foreigners under the H1B temporary work visa can petition to earn their green card.

Camarota thinks the DREAM Act amounts to amnesty. He notes that one of the reasons some DREAM Act backers avoid the word is that it doesn’t do well in focus groups.

But more to the point, just because the DREAM Act attaches conditions to forgiveness doesn’t mean it’s not amnesty, he said. Amnesty for offenses such as unpaid taxes or parking tickets typically include conditions.

""This is like a parking tax amnesty or a tax amnesty. ... It’s not that different from 1986,"" Camarota said.

So what does this mean?

We found that people who like elements of the bill, not just its opponents, can make good arguments that ""amnesty"" is appropriate based on the bill’s specifics and past examples. You can also use that information to make a good argument that the label is inaccurate.

And so here we have a case where in the middle of the State of the Union address, and in the midst of a years-long debate on a vexing issue, Broun uses a tweet to label Obama’s policy ""amnesty.""

The tweet was unequivocal and without nuance. But the label is debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation.  

Broun’s statement is accurate but leaves out important details. It meets PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2011/feb/01/paul-broun/congressman-tweets-obama-wants-amnesty-during-stat/

Egyptian ambassador claims Egypt has made ""great strides"" in political and democratic reform
","
Egyptians took to the streets over the weekend to protest the authoritarian rule of President Hosni Mubarak and urge him to step down. The Egyptian ambassador to the United States, Sameh Shoukry, appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour to discuss the situation.

Amanpour, reporting from Cairo, asked the ambassador how long Mubarak would ""continue to tolerate this number of people in the streets?""

Shoukry replied, ""From the outset, the freedom of expression had been guaranteed. Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard. Freedom of expression, freedom of the press had been evolving and advancing with very important strides. I believe, in the president's speech, he indicated that there would be a guarantee of the freedom and ability of all Egyptians to express their points of view in a peaceful manner.""

That didn't answer Amanpour's question, but we were interested in his statement that the country has made ""great strides"" in political and democratic reforms.

That was at odds with reporting we've read, so we decided to dig deeper to see if perhaps the ambassador was correct that Egypt has indeed been moving strongly toward more human rights over the past 20 years.

We found that numerous human rights organizations have given Egypt low marks for political openness and press freedom. We did find a few examples of improvement, particularly among the press and bloggers. But organizations described these positive developments as limited and at times occurring in spite of the government, not because of embraced reforms.

The international press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, for example, ranked Egypt as 127th out of 178 countries for press freedom in 2010. ""Since taking power in 1981, Hosni Mubarak has gone all out to curb not just press freedom but also citizens' rights to freedom of information. The authorities have for several years been tightening control over the Internet, but without excessive use of filtering,"" the group reported.

Freedom House, a nonprofit that monitors democratic freedoms around the world, noted that ""Restrictions on press freedom continued in 2009, as Egyptian reporters tested the boundaries of acceptable coverage but were confronted by arrests, lawsuits and state-sponsored assaults.""

""The Egyptian blogosphere remains extremely lively, with a large range of opinions freely expressed online and a wide breadth of content available to users of the medium. In response, the government has continued to harass and intimidate those who publish online,"" the report added.

In 2009, the Committee to Protect Journalists listed Egypt as one of the 10 worst countries for bloggers. ""Authorities regularly detain critical bloggers for open-ended periods. Local press freedom groups documented the detention of more than 100 bloggers in 2008 alone,"" the committee said in its release.

Human Rights Watch noted widespread instances of police brutality in a 2011 report. ""Police and security forces regularly engaged in torture in police stations, detention centers, and at points of arrest,"" the report said. There also were restrictions on freedom of religion. ""Although Egypt's constitution provides for equal rights without regard to religion, there is widespread discrimination against Egyptian Christians, as well as official intolerance of heterodox Muslim sects,"" the report said.

Diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks show that U.S. State Department officials were equally down on Egypt's human rights record.

""Police brutality in Egypt against common criminals is routine and pervasive,"" said a 2009 report from the U.S. embassy in Cairo. ""Contacts describe the police using force to extract confessions from criminals as a daily event, resulting from poor training and understaffing.""

A cable from 2008 reported, ""Our fundamental political reform goal in Egypt remains democratic transformation, including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism, respect for human rights, and a stable and legitimate transition to the post-Mubarak era. Egyptian democracy and human rights efforts, however, are being suffocated ...Mubarak now makes scant public pretense of advancing a vision for democratic change. An ongoing challenge remains balancing our security interests with our democracy promotion efforts.""

Experts we spoke with had similar comments.

Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told us he saw the ambassador's comments on This Week and thought they were ""deeply misleading and inaccurate.""

""The level of human rights abuses and restrictions on political space have not significantly changed over the past decades, and this stagnation and the daily humiliations that come with it are at the very core of the popular revolt we are seeing today,"" Bouckaert said via e-mail. ""There are two separate realities in Egypt. That seen by the tourists and the ruling elite and that experienced by ordinary Egyptians. The ambassador was doubtlessly hoping that his audience was only familiar with the former.""

We got a concise but telling reply from Steven Cook, a fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""He's a 'bs-er.' You can quote me,"" Cook said via e-mail.

Michael Collins Dunn, editor of The Middle East Journal, said political freedoms might be a little better than they were 20 years ago, particularly in regard to press freedom. But looking at the government, political opposition remains weak, and Mubarak's ruling party has firm control of the government. ""If you're talking about genuine progress to a multiparty democracy, you have to look long and hard,"" Dunn said.

Finally, we should note that Amanpour told the ambassador that the Egyptians protesting in the street didn't seem to agree with his statements. ""As I say, they are saying that what's happening is not enough,"" she said. ""What more should the government do to bring more freedom, political pluralism? There is no meaningful political space here.""

In our ruling, we find little to support the ambassador's statement that ""Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard."" A few things may have improved, particularly in the area of press freedom, but they are hardly ""great strides."" In fact, the government continues to arrest journalists, police brutality is widespread, and the ruling party maintains firm control.

President Obama says veterans can now access their electronic medical records online
","
State of the Union addresses often seem interminably long. But with so much ground to cover and so many members of the public tuned in -- not to mention intense media scrutiny -- economic use of words is crucial. And so, after interest groups hear what's in the speech for them, they are often left to parse the meaning and import of just a few sentences.

There is often a balancing act between brevity and full accuracy.

We'll deal with just such a conflict here.

In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama boasted that his administration has made ""great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste.""

And he used the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs as a prime example. ""Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse,"" Obama said.

Two days later, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) posted a response on their website accusing Obama of ""mischaracterizing"" the VA electronic medical records system.

""This is not true,"" stated IAVA Founder and Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff. ""Contrary to the president’s comment, the only thing a veteran can download from the VA’s system are pharmaceutical records and personal health information that he or she has self-entered. This is a critical distinction.
 
""The president’s comments are misleading to service members, veterans and the American public, who now think that this system is in place and functional, while it is clearly not. In the last 24 hours, IAVA has heard from hundreds of members, who have expressed surprise and outrage that the president could get something so wrong in arguably the most important speech of the year.""

In October, the administration formally launched something called the ""VA Blue Button"" which allows veterans to download and view some medical information online. Primarily, it allows veterans to access self-entered health metrics such as blood pressure, weight and heart rate as well as emergency contact information, test results, family health history, military health history and other health-related information. Using data from the patient’s Veterans Health Administration’s Electronic Health Records (VistA), it also allows vets to access information about their VA prescription histories, wellness reminders and VA appointments (both past and future).

Can a vet get all of his or her medical records via the Blue Button? No. You still can't yet get medical records such as doctors' notes or X-rays.

But more and more medical information will become available via the Blue Button over time, said Peter L. Levin, chief technology officer at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the co-creator of the Blue Button. ""The things they can download today are generally the kinds of things you'd fill in on a clipboard when you go to see a specialist,"" Levin said.

In March, the VA plans to add information on allergies, he said. And soon, the Blue Button will offer access to lab results, including chemistry and hematology. ""We are on a steady path, capturing more and more information from VistA and putting it into MyHealthyVet,"" Levin said.

And vets' requests will drive the information that will be added in the future, he said.

""This is actually a monumental VA initiative,"" said Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense. ""You have to give the VA some credit."" Perhaps, he said, President Obama should have said medical ""information"" rather than ""medical records"" are now available to vets online, because the phrase implies things like doctors' notes and medical test results are online.

""Maybe he didn't get it exactly right,"" Sullivan said. ""It could come down to word choice. Some of your medical records are online. Some, but not all.""

Joe Davis, a spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars, also praised the VA's Blue Button as a ""unique"" feature that puts the VA out front on technology.

But when Obama said, ""Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse,"" was he accurate?

""Yes, kinda, sorta,"" Davis said. ""They can download a part. 'Some' would have been more accurate. It all depends on your interpretation.""

Davis also said the VFW hasn't gotten any calls from veterans confused by the president's statement. Probably, he said, most realize that in a State of the Union address, every word takes up time, and so the president used a bit of short-hand.

In rating this comment, we weighed the fact that many veterans groups have praised the Blue Button as a major step forward. The medical information now available to veterans is an undeniably valuable technological tool and a praiseworthy advance. But Obama's claim that vets ""can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse"" suggests much more availability than exists. One could reasonably assume he meant a vet could access all of his or her medical records online. In fact, most of the information now available to vets is information they self-entered.

Rep. Paul Broun says innovation would flower if government 'would get out of the way'
","
Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., spent the State of the Union address sending a fusillade of tweets critical of President Barack Obama to his 3,000-odd followers. One of them in particular caught our attention.

""If the govt would get out of the way, we could have innovation and development,"" Broun tweeted.

(Since civility was a major issue surrounding the address, we should note that Broun didn’t tweet from the chamber while Obama was speaking. A spokeswoman told Roll Call that he watched the speech from his Capitol Hill office.)

Broun’s office didn’t get back to us to elaborate on the substance of his tweet, but it is based on the assumption that government stands in the way of innovation and development.

We’ve long heard complaints from conservatives like Broun that business is being stifled by over-regulation. Even Obama got into the act during the run-up to his address, issuing an executive order that would, as he described it in an op-ed, help to ""root out regulations that conflict, that are not worth the cost or that are just plain dumb.""

But even if you concede that some deregulation is desirable, we wondered whether Broun was right that government, as a whole, is an impediment to innovation and development. So we looked at statistics and spoke to experts in the field.

First, the statistics.

According to the National Science Foundation, business did account for 67 percent of research-and-development expenditures in 2008. The federal government spent 25 percent, and universities and other nonprofits spent about 3 percent each. Industry dollars are especially important in applied research and the development of technologies for the market.

However, the federal government shoulders the bulk of the burden in one crucial area of research -- basic research. This is the kind of fundamental scientific and medical research that has no immediate payoff.

According to NSF, the federal government funds 57 percent of basic research, compared to less than 18 percent for business, 15 percent for colleges and universities and 11 percent for nonprofits. And business only funds about 6 percent of university-based scientific research -- one-tenth the share paid for by the federal government -- so a retreat by government could have wide collateral damage to university research.

The government has been a major scientific funder for more than half a century. If you add up all the direct research spending in the U.S. since 1953, the federal government has poured in more than $3 trillion. Business has spent an additional $4.5 trillion over that period. (For a quarter century, government expenditures on research exceeded those by industry, but around 1980, the pattern reversed.)

Government also helps support research in other ways. Since 1981, the federal government has given companies a tax break for research and experimentation, which has saved companies about $5 billion per year in recent years. Federal taxpayers fund the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the tune of almost $1 billion a year; among other things, NIST sets technical standards so that industry can work more efficiently. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides archived and ongoing patent information that private companies can access.

And none of this counts the larger, but harder to quantify, investments by federal, state and local governments in elementary and higher education and infrastructure, all of which help set the stage for scientific innovation.

When we showed Broun’s tweet to several historians, they said his view is, at best, incomplete.

""Yes, the U.S. has the most dynamic and entrepreneurial economy in the world because it has less regulation and less top-down planning and micromanagement than other developed nations,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington. ""But the high-tech revolution since 1950, and the United States' central role in it, was the result of unprecedented government investment in science and engineering. The critical thing that government does -- and that private-sector research can't do -- is to provide the start-up capital for innovations that do not yet have a commercial market.""

The funding statistics cited earlier underscore this point. Businesses are much more eager to spend their research dollars on projects that have immediate prospects of earning money. ""Private industry by and large doesn’t do (basic research) because it’s primarily interested in research that has a high likelihood of practical payoff,"" said Daniel Kevles, a historian of science at Yale Law School.

Yet the experts we spoke to said that the biggest conceptual leaps have occurred at the level of basic research, where government is the primary funder, rather than the later stages of refinement, where businesses shoulder most of the cost. In addition, federal research typically gets made public, where it can be used by industry, whereas industry-funded research is often kept for the private use of its sponsor.

The Internet is a good example of a technological innovation that was birthed by the federal government, specifically the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said O’Mara, author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. In 1973, DARPA began to research ways to link geographically scattered computers over a network, eventually coming up with widely used, standardized protocols for information sharing. In 1986, NSF established its own network which has become a major backbone of today’s Internet.

""If we had left it to Lotus and IBM, we would have a couple of tiny, proprietary and fairly useless systems out there,"" added Diana Hicks, a science policy expert who chairs the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Other areas that experienced breakthroughs due to federal support include biotechnology, genomics, nanotechnology, nuclear physics, solid-state physics, organic chemistry and mathematics, said Paul A. David, an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University. Federally funded discoveries ""have become the foundation for whole domains of research from which new industries have arisen,"" David said.

So while ""the key to a vibrant entrepreneurial economy is having the government ‘get out of the way,’"" O’Mara said, ""that can only happen after there has been investment on a huge scale and that does not necessarily have an immediate commercial application. That's something that only the national government can provide.""

Broun could hardly get into the details of his science policy preferences in a 140-character tweet, and it's possible he didn't mean that he wanted government to get out of scientific research entirely.

But we still feel it’s fair to take his comment  to task. For starters, it was not an isolated comment -- the tweet we’re looking at here was just one of several he sent during the State of the Union that addressed the same theme, including ""Entrepreneurship is great -- let's not kill it with taxes and regulations"" and ""Obama's policies kill free-enterprise.""

More broadly, portraying business as good and government as bad has been a consistent Republican talking point. But to base a tweet on the assumption that the federal government is bad for innovation and development ignores that the federal government -- through its direct research spending, its tax credits and its indirect investments that support technological research -- plays a crucial role in pushing it forward, and one that is unlikely to be ever picked up by the private sector alone. So we rate the claim that the government is a barrier to innovation and development False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/31/paul-broun/rep-paul-broun-says-innovation-would-flower-if-gov/

State Sen. Wendy Davis says Texas ranks 44th in education spending per student
","
In a Jan. 19 press release objecting to possible state budget cuts, state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, said ""education funding should be our highest priority."" 
""Under current funding levels, Texas is already near the bottom in education funding per pupil (Texas ranks 44th nationally), "" she said. 
Responding to our request for backup, Davis spokesman Anthony Spangler pointed us to ""Texas on the Brink,"" a 2009 compilation of Texas statistics prepared by then-state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. One entry, citing the National Education Association, ranked Texas 44th in per-student education expenditures. The Legislative Budget Board’s 2010 ""Texas Fact Book"" similarly quotes the analysis placing Texas 44th. 
According to a December report from the association, which describes itself as the nation’s largest teachers union, in 2009-10 Texas ranked 37th among the states and the District of Columbia in state and local funds spent per student in public school, averaging $9,227. 
But the state ranked 44th in 2008-09, according to the report, averaging $8,610. That year, the top-spending state, New Jersey, averaged $16,253, and the lowest-spending state, Arizona, averaged $5,932. The national average: $10,313. 
Spangler told us Davis wasn’t aware of the 2009-10 ranking when she made her statement. 
According to NEA’s report, it bases its rankings on analyzing expenditure and fall enrollment data gathered from each state’s education department. The report, ""Rankings & Estimates,"" has this caveat: ""Each state’s department of education has its own system of accounting and reporting. ... As a result, it is not always possible to obtain completely comparable data for every state.""  
To adjust for such differences, the report says, NEA solicits clarifications from the departments. Texas’ clarification: The number of elementary students includes sixth-graders, while secondary school covers upper grades. 
Next, we looked for other estimates of per-pupil spending. The Federal Education Budget Project, part of the Washington-based New America Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy institute, ranked Texas 43rd in public education spending per student for the 2007-08 school year, averaging $8,350. 
Jennifer Cohen, an education analyst for the foundation, told us the project tapped data from the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education, to build its rankings. 
Among the states, according to the foundation, Utah spent the least per pupil in 2007-08 — $5,978 — while New Jersey spent the most, $17,620, New York was second, followed by Alaska and Connecticut. 
Such rankings fail to reflect all school spending, according to David Guenthner, a spokesman at the conservative Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation. He told us the rankings typically exclude school expenses such as debt service and capital costs, such asconstruction projects, which would drive up per-student expenditures. 
Guenthner pointed us to a March 2010 report by the Washington-based Cato Institute, a Libertarian research foundation. The report reviewed 2008-09 budgets for districts in the nation’s five largest cities, including Houston, concluding that average per-pupil spending was 44 percent higher than is otherwise reported by public schools. 
Separately, Frank Johnson, an NCES statistician, told us the center doesn’t take into account capital outlays in estimating per-pupil spending because such costs can create false assumptions about what’s spent on instructional programs, school supplies and teachers. 
At our request, though, Cohen created a table ranking states by their spending both on school operations and capital costs. In 2007-08, her table shows, Texas spent an average of $10,662 per pupil, ranking 36th nationally. In 2006-07, Texas ranked 39th, spending an average of $9,825. 
All told, it’s clear that rankings vary by year and methodology. Yet Texas has consistently trailed most states in per-pupil education spending. According to the approach cited by the senator, Texas ranked 37th in 2009-10, improving from 44th place the year before. By other measures for recent years, Texas has placed as low as 43rd and, rolling in capital costs, as high as 36th.

Milwaukee County executive candidate Jeff Stone says he’s the only candidate who has voted against increasing government pensions
","
For a scandal that destroyed the political careers of several top Milwaukee County politicians, the 2002 pension deal seems a surprising afterthought in the 2011 county executive campaign.

Have voters forgotten about the whole mess overseen by F. Thomas Ament, who was driven from the county executive’s office by irate voters?

State Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale) hopes not.

He utters the P-word in a radio ad that debuted Feb. 7, 2011. The ad doesn’t mention the Ament scandal directly, but that’s clearly the background for the statement.

""I’m the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive,"" Stone says in the spot, ""that has voted against increasing government pensions.""

Is Stone right about his record and that of the four other candidates in the race?

The five are hoping to replace Scott Walker, who was elected governor in November 2010. The primary election is Feb. 15, 2011.

Let’s start with Stone.

Stone’s ad can’t be talking about the county pension enhancements. He is a former Greenfield alderman and a current state lawmaker. He’s never served on the County Board.

His campaign told us he referred to a 1999 vote in the Legislature on pension sweeteners for nearly 350,000 public employees covered by the Wisconsin Retirement System.

That deal, which estimates at the time said boosted pensions by an average of 10 percent, covered most state and local government workers in Wisconsin, excluding Milwaukee city and county workers who are part of separate pension systems.

Stone did vote against the 1999 state pension package.  

He joined 18 other Republicans (including Walker), and one Democrat, in voting against the enhancements, which passed the Assembly with bipartisan support, 79-20.

Stone told us the sweeteners were too costly and state pensions already were generous enough. However, he has not attempted to waive the benefits for himself; he says the process for doing so is unclear and complicated.

Stone’s radio ad  touched on all the candidates, though, not just his vote.

To our ears, it can be heard two ways.

One: A subtle suggestion that his opponents have cast votes in favor of pension hikes or otherwise favor bigger pensions. Two: Simply underscoring that only Stone faced a tough decision and came down against pension enhancements.

He told us he meant the latter.

""It’s what separates me,"" Stone said. ""It implies they never had the responsibility of making those kinds of decisions"" or voted in favor of increases.

One of Stone’s rivals, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, did face a similar decision. Holloway was a member of the County Board when the sweeping, Ament-sponsored pension deal came before supervisors in 2000 and 2001.

Holloway voted to approve the Ament deal, which passed easily. In the midst of the scandal, he  survived a recall election. He later waived any personal gain from the benefits.

Holloway points out that he has subsequently voted to cut various pension benefits, increase the retirement age and require employees to contribute 2 percent of their salaries into the pension fund.

As for Stone’s two other main rivals, they have not had an opportunity to vote yes or no on pension improvements.

Jim Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator, took state office years after the vote Stone cites. We could find no pension enhancement votes during Sullivan’s tenure as a public official, including time on the Wauwatosa Common Council. Sullivan could not recall any either.

Asked recently about his view of the Ament deal, Sullivan said: ""The 2002 pension deal was irresponsible and wrong. The people of Milwaukee County deserve better than bloated pensions for bureaucrats and elected officials.  As county executive, I will never allow a deal of this sort to occur.""

A footnote: Sullivan has accepted campaign donations from Ament, as the Journal Sentinel reported.

Another candidate for exec, philanthropist Chris Abele, is making his first bid for public office. So he has not had a chance to vote on anything.

Abele did, however, co-author a 2006 report on the county’s finances in the wake of the pension scandal. He acted in his role as a civic activist and donor, working on a panel set up by the Greater Milwaukee Committee.

That report  bemoaned ""a series of irresponsible pension benefit increases (that) quickly turned a modest pension surplus into a huge pension liability."" It called for changes in health care and pension benefits to help reduce the county’s massive unfunded liabilities.

The fifth candidate, paralegal Ieshuh Griffin, has not held public office before.

Let’s wrap up.

Stone claims that he alone voted against pension increases. Some may argue by making a comparison to rival candidates who have never been in a position to cast votes, he adds a slightly misleading touch to the claim. But the context of it is Stone reciting the virtues of his own resume, not attacking others for shortcomings on theirs.

Did Oregon’s worker compensation rate rise a whopping 39 percent?
","

Earlier this month, Oregon Senate Republicans called for a two-year halt on agency rule-making. The thinking is that Oregon businesses, struggling to survive the downturn, don’t need the hassle and expense of burdensome new regulations. The minority caucus gave a number of examples of state agencies trying to strangle employers, including this one:

""In September, the Department of Business and Consumer Services enacted a sudden 39% workers' compensation premium assessment by rule with little notice to the public.""

Lots of facts to check out in that one claim. Was it indeed sudden? Did the increase amount to 39 percent? And was the public shut out of the process? In other words, was this massive insurance increase rammed down our collective throats by a heavy-handed agency gone wild?

To assess that, PolitiFact Oregon delved into the wonky world of workers’ compensation. Almost all employers are required tobuy this insurance, which pays for the medical care and wages of a worker who has been hurt on the job. The Workers' Compensation Division, within the Department of Consumer and Business Services, oversees the program.

In September, as it does every year, DCBS announced new insurance premium costs for 2011. The average cost of $1.48 for every $100 of payroll is the same as last year’s. (It’s an average because costs differ based on type of business.)

There are three components to the cost. The largest portion -- called the ""pure premium"" -- is set by an outside group and the agency usually adopts its recommendation. For this year, the pure premium dropped 1.8 percent to $1.27 per $100 on average. A second, far-smaller portion pays for return-to-work and other worker-benefit programs; this rate is set by the agency and for 2011 remained unchanged at 11 cents per $100.

Now, the third portion is the controversial part. The ""premium assessment"" pays to administer the workers’ compensation system. The agency, which sets the rate, increased the cost from 4.6 percent of premiums last year to 6.4 percent this year -- a 39 percent increase. The increase is from 7.6 cents to 10.4 cents per $100 of payroll.

Republicans don’t like it because it was proposed by the agency director in September and adopted two weeks later with one public hearing. DCBS spokeswoman Lisa Morawski doesn’t dispute the two-week open comment period, but she says stakeholders had earlier notice. Also, she said that DCBS had no choice, given an ongoing decline in revenue.

Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, acknowledged the premium they cited was indeed part of an overall figure -- but argued the size of the increase is so large it deserves to be singled out.  ""Anything that goes up by more than the rate of inflation is killing people who have to pay these fees,"" he said. ""You don’t mark up cars like that; you don’t mark up groceries like that.""

Still, businesses actually saw no overall increase because the extra revenue from the premium assessment -- $17 million -- should balance out the reduction in pure premium.

So how accurate is the statement? The numbers don’t lie. There was a 39 percent increase in the assessment portion. But the money involved is pennies on the dollar, literally: the average goes from 7.6 cents to 10.4 cents per $100. For most people unfamiliar with workers’ compensation lingo, they might think the overall rate went up 39 percent. And that’s not correct. We think the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True.

Johnson says economy better since Obama became president
","
Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson used President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week to give his own state of the American economy.

""There is no doubt that the economy we preside over today is better than the one we inherited,"" the representative said in a one-paragraph statement on his website.

""But we know,"" added Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, who was one of Obama’s earliest supporters when he campaigned for the presidency in 2008, ""we must do more to ensure that America and its workers can compete and win in the 21st century.""

His statement raised an interesting question: Is the economy better now than when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009?

Officially, the nation’s economic recession ended in June 2009, but many Americans are still without jobs and most experts said the recovery is slow. Forty-four states are projecting budget shortfalls this year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Principles.

So how do you measure the economy? As Georgia State University economics expert Rajeev Dhawan noted to us, the economy is like a diamond. There are many facets to it.

Johnson’s spokesman Andy Phelan said the main areas to consider when measuring the economy are the stock market, industrial production, consumer spending and exports. They were comparing the last two full years of George W. Bush’s presidency, 2006 to 2008, to the following two years. (Bush’s presidency ended on Jan. 20, 2009.)

""I think jobs is the most important stat -- as you would probably agree - and we’ve seen 12 straight months of job growth in the private sector,"" Phelan told us in an e-mail. ""In 2010, the private sector gained 1.3 million jobs -- the strongest job growth since 2006.""

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently told a congressional committee that the economy has shown ""hopeful"" signs of growth -- citing increases in consumer spending and private-sector investment in new equipment and software. But Bernanke also said he was troubled by issues such as long-term unemployment and mortgage foreclosures.

Bernanke said that the housing sector ""remains depressed."" RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, last week reported that foreclosure activity jumped in 149 of the nation’s 206 largest metropolitan areas in 2010. Atlanta ranked third, behind Houston and Seattle.

New home construction, though, has slightly increased since the end of 2008, The Associated Press reported,using data from the U.S. Commerce Department. In 2008, builders broke ground on 549,000 homes. Last year, construction began on 587,600 homes.

Some frequently considered economic indicators, like the gross domestic product, which measures the nation’s output and its consumption of goods and services, have remained steady since 2006.

Another popular economic measure, the Dow Jones industrial average, is hovering around 12,000, about a 50 percent increase from 7,949 on Jan. 20, 2009. The Dow decreased by about 50 percent between the beginning of 2007 and the beginning of 2009. Some may argue the drop between 2007 and 2009 was the result of a few extraordinary days on Wall Street. The Dow dropped 504 points on Sept. 15, 2008, the worst one-day decline since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Dow dropped by about 1,400 points during a five-day stretch in October 2008.

On trade, there is some support for Johnson’s case,but clearly room for growth. The federal trade deficit was $38.3 billion in November 2010, according to the most recent figures available from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The $38.3 billion deficit was about 25 percent less than the largest deficit of the Obama presidency, $50.1 billion in June 2010. The deficit was $43.8 billion in November 2008, a 50 percent decline from the high of $66.4 billion in July 2008. Exports increased from the November 2008 total of $141 billion to the November 2010 figure of $159.6 billion.

Unemployment is another trouble point for the congressman’s argument. The nation’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in December 2008. A year later, it was 9.9 percent. In December 2010, the rate was 9.4 percent; lower than at the end of 2009, but still higher than at the same point in 2008. Monthly job losses, which were brutal between July 2008 and June 2009, have stopped, and the data shows there is growth in that area.

However, the number of discouraged workers -- people who’ve stopped looking for a job -- has doubled since the end of 2008, from about 642,000 that December to the December 2010 total of 1.3 million.

Michael Pento, senior economist for Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based brokerage firm, said the economy has improved in the GDP, initial jobless claims and regional manufacturing. But he said it has worsened in the critical areas of housing, unemployment and -- in his greatest concern -- debt.

The gross federal debt -- the amount of money the government owes itself -- has risen since the end of 2008 from slightly more than $10 trillion to its current total of about $14 trillion.

Some economists prefer to use another measurement of debt when measuring the nation’s economic health. They focus on the public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector.The public debt -- which is held by individuals, companies, foreign governments and others -- is higher now than it was at the beginning of 2009. However, it is now a smaller percentage of the nation’s GDP than it was in January 2009.

Some analysts like Pento worry the debt will drive the nation’s economy toward a cliff, without an air safety bag.

""The economy can’t be deemed better now than when George W. Bush left office because the factors that led to the credit crisis exist today, only they have been vastly intensified,"" Pento told us. ""How can anybody claim the economy is getting better?""

Johnson’s office agreed that debt is a serious concern, but argued that job growth, manufacturing growth and improved consumer confidence are more important immediate factors in the economic recovery.

So where does all of this leave us? Matthew Dowd, who worked as a strategist for Bush, argued in December that the economy has ""worsened"" since Obama took office. Our national PolitiFact site rated his statement Half-True.

In many areas, the numbers show the economy has grown. However, there are analysts and members of Congress like Wisconsin’s Paul Ryan, a Republican, who worry the debt problem has grown during the Obama presidency and fear it will be a painful problem in the near future. The worst of the nation’s recent economic troubles began in mid-2008 and continued through much of 2009.

""The growth is very strong,"" says Georgia State’s Dhawan, director of the university’s Economic Forecasting Center,who argues the economy has improved.

In some areas, the economy has improved over the past two years in measurable areas like trade and the Dow. Congressman Johnson is correct about that.

But major components like housing and unemployment are still in the dumps. Until those key areas turn around, it’s hard to argue that the overall economy has improved.

Johnson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give readers a different impression. Under our guidelines, the congressman’s statement rates as Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/31/hank-johnson/johnson-says-economy-better-obama-became-president/

Acting Milwaukee County Executive Lee Holloway says Mitchell International Airport is the busiest in the country
","
One of Lee Holloway’s first acts after becoming acting Milwaukee County executive was to put his name on the monthly press release about passenger counts at Mitchell International Airport.

Holloway, the County Board chairman, is running to fill the job in the spring election and -- like his predecessor, now-Gov. Scott Walker -- touts success at the airport at campaign appearances.

At a Jan. 21, 2011 forum at the Marquette University Law School, he called Mitchell the ""third busiest airport in the world and the number one busiest airport in the country.""

That stopped a few scribbling pens. And some in the audience scratched their heads.

Busier than O’Hare,  Atlanta or LaGuardia? Third busiest in the world?

In the debate appearance -- viewed by a standing room only audience, aired on television and available on YouTube -- Holloway got it wrong. Mitchell is the nation’s fastest growing airport and -- at least for a while last year -- was the third fastest growing airport in the world.

It’s not the busiest.

Holloway has gotten his airport facts right on several other occasions, including a Journal Sentinel editorial board visit, two press releases, and his Jan. 26, 2011 ""State of the County"" speech. Well, close to right -- the world ranking is based on outdated statistics.

The most recent airport stats: 
However, Mitchell’s status as among the fastest growing in the world is waning.

The airport was fourth fastest growing in the world in the first quarter of 2010 and third in the second quarter, but tumbled to 16th in the third quarter, according to Airports Council International, an industry trade group. (Fourth quarter numbers aren’t yet available.)

Milwaukee was the only U.S. airport on the list, and in the second quarter trailed only Istanbul, Turkey and Moscow. In the third quarter, airports in several South American countries surged ahead of Milwaukee -- seven of them landed in the top 15.

""We anticipate that MKE will continue to grow, but that the rate of growth will flatten as we begin comparing to growth rates of 30 - 40 percent"" in the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010, said airport spokeswoman Patricia Rowe.

PolitiFact Wisconsin checked a similar airport statement made in September by Walker, then a candidate for governor. In his victory speech on primary election night, Walker said the airport was the fastest growing airport in the country and responsible for 1,000 jobs.

Airport consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen Colo., told us then that passengers were enjoying more flights and comparatively lower fares because three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are ""trying to kill each other.""
   
""It has nothing to do with county government,"" Boyd said. ""It has to do with airline economics.""

Some of the large increases are the result of the year-to-year comparisons. Midwest Airlines, for instance, dramatically slashed the number of its destinations from Mitchell before it was bought by Republic. The airline now operates as Frontier and has steadily added flights.

Walker’s statement, which mixed in job growth, earned a Half True.

Where does Holloway’s nation’s-busiest statement land?

Holloway has made a more precise airport claim on other occasions. But he was wrong when he said at the candidates’ forum that Mitchell was one of the world’s ""busiest"" airports, and the busiest in the nation. Those rankings relate to passenger growth, not busy-ness. What’s more, the world ranking he used (third) came from the second quarter data from 2010 -- and that’s old data. We’re now No. 17 according to the latest figures.  

Holloway’s incorrect  message went out to a wider audience and was echoed by media outlets covering the event.

Kilmartin says Secure Communities program has proven record of focusing on violent and threatening criminals
","
Just days after he was sworn into office, Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin made news by signing an agreement to implement a federal program called Secure Communities, which the federal government says it created to identify and deport illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes.

The decision came less than a week after Governor Chafee rescinded his predecessor’s executive order targeting undocumented immigrants. Among other things, Chafee’s decision ended a cooperative program between the state police and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to enforce immigration laws.

Under the Secure Communities program, fingerprints of arrested suspects are sent to the Department of Homeland Security, which checks them against a database of immigration violators and others. ICE then prioritizes whom it will take action against, based on the severity of the person’s criminal background and the threat he or she poses to communities.

ICE plans to implement the program nationwide. It is now in use in 37 states, although it’s only statewide in seven.

In a Jan. 11 news release announcing Rhode Island’s intent to join the program, Kilmartin said:  ""Secure Communities is a proactive method of making neighborhoods safe by dealing with individuals who have committed crimes against us. The program has a proven track record of enhancing public safety by focusing on violent offenders and those that pose a threat to our communities and our national security.""

Kilmartin’s announcement triggered complaints from opponents of Secure Communities, and a noisy protest in the lobby of the attorney general’s building. Critics, including Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, say the program has led to thousands of deportations of people with no criminal records.

They also say it leads to racial profiling and deters victims and witnesses of crimes from coming forward if they or family members are undocumented immigrants.

We wondered whether Kilmartin’s assertion -- that the program focuses on ""violent offenders"" and ""threats to our communities and national security"" -- was accurate.

When we called Kilmartin’s office, his spokeswoman, Amy Kempe, said Kilmartin was relying on information from ICE and directed us to that agency.

So we contacted Ross Feinstein, spokesman for ICE in Washington, D.C.  He said in an email that in 2010, ICE ""set a record for overall removals of illegal aliens, with more than 392,000 removals nationwide."" He said more than half of those removed were convicted criminals.

Feinstein said the Secure Communities program alone, from its beginning in October 2008, has identified and led to the ""removal"" of more than 59,300 aliens convicted of crimes.

We also found the program has plenty of critics. Three groups that oppose Secure Communities fought ICE in federal court and won a judgment ordering the agency to reveal data about the program. The groups -- the Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Day Laborer Organization and the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardoza School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City -- are part of a national initiative called ""Uncover the Truth.""

Sarahi Uribe, national coordinator of Uncover the Truth, said the group obtained documents in recent months from ICE that show that the majority of the people picked up in the program are not hardened criminals.

""It’s amazing because they continue marketing the program as targeting serious criminals, even though the numbers don’t support it,"" Uribe said.

Among the records obtained are monthly data for Secure Communities from October 2009 through August 2010.

The records show that during that period, 41,929 people were identified through Secure Communities for deportation, as so-called ""removals and returns.""  

Those people were divided into four categories based on criminal record.

A total of  9,667 -- about 23 percent -- were classified as Level 1 offenders: those convicted of ""aggravated felonies such as murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor.""

Another 16,581 -- about 40 percent -- were labeled as Level 2 offenders: those convicted of any felony, or three or more misdemeanors.

A total of 4,621 -- about 11 percent -- were Level 3 offenders: those convicted of crimes punishable by less than one year in prison, typically misdemeanors.

And 11,060 people -- about 26 percent -- had no criminal record at all.

So ICE’s own data shows that, in the second year of a two-year program, 37 percent of the immigrants deported were either non-criminals or had been convicted of minor crimes.

Asked to respond, ICE’s Feinstein said that the agency’s priority is ""to initiate enforcement against criminal aliens,"" but that doesn’t ""preclude ICE from initiating action against immigration violators and others subject to removal at the time of encounter. In fact, there are classes of non-criminals that are also ICE priorities.""

He said the so-called ""non-criminal aliens"" are ""non-U.S. citizens arrested and booked for a crime who have no recorded conviction but have one or more immigration violations and are priorities for ICE to remove due to various reasons, such as: visa overstay, an illegal entry, an illegal reentry after removal, a final order of removal in place, known gang affiliations, ICE fugitives, etc.""

Kempe, after checking back with ICE officials, said the attorney general believes people convicted of even relatively minor crimes -- selling marijuana, painting graffiti or vandalizing a neighborhood -- are threats to the community.

That may be. But we believe that, in the light of the ICE data, Kilmartin went too far when he said Secure Communities ""has a proven record"" of focusing on ""violent offenders"" and ""threats to communities and our national security.""

That may be the intent, but the numbers show a mixed result. We rule his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/30/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-secure-communities-program-has-prov/

Has the U.S. Supreme Court banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders?
","Florida Sen. Randolph Bracy argues that Gov. Rick Scott overreached when he issued an order removing Orlando-area prosecutor Aramis D. Ayala from a high-profile prosecution of an accused cop killer after she said she would not pursue the death penalty in murder cases. Bracy, an Orange County Democrat and chairman of the Florida Senate criminal justice committee, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that prosecutors have broad discretionary power. ""Although Ms. Ayala’s critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated,"" he wrote in the April 4 op-ed. ""That’s because she hasn’t. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders."" Legal experts told PolitiFact that Bracy is correct. Key court rulings about the death penalty forbid laws that force prosecutors to seek the death penalty. Ayala, a Democrat elected as state attorney state attorney in Orange and Osceola counties in 2016, announced in March that she would no longer seek the death penalty.  Her decision came while handling the case of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton amid a manhunt for Loyd after he allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend. Laws about death penalty prosecutions In 1972 in Furman vs. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty, finding lack of standards in enforcing the death penalty constituted ""cruel and unusual punishment."" In response, many states then changed their laws. In 1976, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of new death sentencing laws in five cases from Georgia, Florida, Texas,  North Carolina, and Louisiana. It was in these cases that the court struck down statutes that mandated death sentences while allowing the statutes to stand that required juries or judges to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Still, some states in the intervening years tried to pass laws that mandated the death penalty. In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court found all such laws unconstitutional, the ""last vestiges of the mandatory death penalty in the United States,"" the New York Times explained. In addition to pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Bracy’s legislative assistant Travaris McCurdy also pointed to Florida cases including an argument by Attorney General Pam Bondi in a death penalty appeal case, State vs. Perry. Bondi argued in a 2016 petition to the court that ""The Florida Supreme Court has recognized that the State has complete discretion in charging decisions, including the determination to charge and prosecute a capital case."" (Bondi has called Ayala’s actions a ""blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law."") Due to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, we have a discretionary system in which prosecutors and juries are supposed to evaluate the use of the death penalty case by case, said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty. And Ayala isn’t doing that, he said. ""For a prosecutor to make a blanket decision to prosecute all cases as capital or none of them is not exercising discretion that is supposed to be part of system,"" he said. ""Prosecutors are supposed to look at each case and decide if it is one of the exceptionally heinous cases that deserve the death penalty."" Spokespersons for Scott and Bondi made some similar points about how prosecutors should evaluate the death penalty case by case. ""Gov. Scott has not said that prosecutors must seek death sentences,"" Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. ""State Attorney Aramis Ayala was removed from the cases in the interest of justice following her public announcement to not consider capital punishment during her time in office, regardless of the individual facts and circumstances in any case."" On April 3, Scott removed Ayala, a Democrat, from 21 additional first-degree murder cases and reassigned them to Brad King, a Republican Ocala-based state attorney. Our ruling Bracy wrote, ""There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders."" Ayala, the Orlando-area prosecutor, has been criticized by some people for refusing to pursue the death penalty in any case. But the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear for decades that it is unconstitutional to require prosecutors to seek the death penalty in any case.

Fact-checking Trump's changing opinion on Syria and the 'red line'
","At least 70 people have died from a vicious chemical weapons attack in Syria, carried out by the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad. President Donald Trump said blame for the attack lies with his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a ‘red line’ against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing,"" Trump said in an official White House statement April 4. Many commentators noted that this was a departure from Trump’s past position on Syria, including Greta Van Susteren, who recently moved from Fox News to MSNBC. ""A few years ago in the midst of the debate whether President Obama should use force in Syria, then Mr. Trump, now President Trump, had a different opinion,"" Susteren said on her show April 4. ""In a tweet, then Mr. Trump said, quote, ‘President Obama, do not attack Syria.’ "" Trump conceded during an April 5, 2017, press conference that his stance on Syria and Assad has shifted, saying he is proud of his willingness to change his position based on current events. ""My attitude on Syria and Assad has changed very much,"" he said, in part because ""that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me."" What Trump said about Syria in 2013 Obama made the ""red line"" comment in August 2012, when he said he would change his calculus on armed intervention in Syria if Assad used or moved chemical weapons. Almost a year later, Assad’s regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack on the city of Damascus. Even though Assad crossed the ""red line,"" Obama chose not to strike Syria and instead looked to Congress to authorize force. Eventually, through a deal with Russia, Syria handed over its chemical weapons, and no strikes were fired in direct retaliation for the chemical attacks. Throughout August and September 2013, as policymakers and pundits debated how to respond to the Syrian chemical attack, Trump lambasted the Obama administration, while simultaneously saying the United States should not intervene. We found more than 20 Trump tweets making that point. Here’s a sample: ""What I am saying is stay out of Syria,"" he wrote Sept. 3, 2013. What I am saying is stay out of Syria. Sept. 5, 2013, he wrote, ""The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A."" The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A. ""AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!"" he tweeted the same day. AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING! Although Trump’s position seems to have changed from 2013, there is an important consistency: his critique of Obama’s decision to set a red line in the first place then ignore it. ""President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!"" he tweeted Sept. 1, 2013. President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria! He reiterated this point in the April 2017 press conference. ""The Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand,"" Trump said. ""And when he didn't cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world because it was a blank threat."" Trump added that the most recent chemical attacks ""crossed a lot of lines,"" yet he declined to say whether he would take military action in retaliation because he doesn’t want to tip off Assad. ""I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not telling you, as much as I respect you,"" Trump said to a reporter. The Trump administration has accelerated airstrikes and other actions in Syria that began at the tail end of the Obama’s second term. In March, the Trump administration said it would send 400 additional troops to Syria to fight the Islamic State. Our ruling Van Susteren said Trump ""had a different opinion"" in 2013 than he does now about whether Obama should have intervened in Syria after Obama’s ""red line"" was crossed. In 2013, Trump said emphatically that the United States should not attack Syria even though the Assad regime crossed the line by using chemical weapons. But in 2017, he criticized the Obama administration for not reacting to the 2013 chemical weapon attack with force. Trump admitted that his position on Assad has changed.

Did the U.S. Education Department introduce an Islamic indoctrination program for public schools?
","The Volusia County Republican Party says that the federal government is promoting Islam to public school children. ""The United States Department of Education has introduced an Islamic indoctrination program for the public schools, called ‘Access Islam,’"" states the mass email sent by the party April 2. The email said that classroom instructions have students learning ""the core duties of Muslims"" and ""what it means to proclaim faith or belief as a Muslim."" ""The Education Department offers no similar learning material for Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism or any other major world religion. Just Islam,"" the email said. This claim earns a failing grade, though. Access Islam is a real program for school teachers looking to offer lesson plans on the religion of Islam. But to say it’s part of an ""indoctrination program"" delivered from the federal government isn’t accurate. Here’s your tutorial on the facts. Teaching Islam To support its claims, the party points to a March 28 video by the Christian Action Network, a group that says its goal is to ""protect America’s religious and moral heritage through educational efforts."" The video, narrated by network founder Martin Mawyer, criticizes Access Islam, a program produced by PBS’ Thirteen/WNET New York. The program received grant money from the federal government about a decade ago. The network recently sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to denounce the program and remove it from any government website. We looked at several of the lesson plans and videos from Access Islam, which draws from the PBS series Religion and Ethics Newsweekly. Much of the content provides educational information about religious traditions and holidays. Other video segments explained the tensions between Somali Muslim immigrants and other residents in Maine; how students learn in a madrassah, and the challenges faced by Muslims to differentiate themselves from terrorists. Lesson plans include facts such as that Muslims pray five times a day, cultural variations and what the First Amendment says about religion. It’s unclear how many schools have used the materials, and there is certainly no requirement that schools do. Mawyer told PolitiFact he found a few examples including the state of Indiana, which listed Access Islam in a resource guide for teachers of world history. The guide includes a disclaimer that the Indiana department hasn’t evaluated the materials which ""are not intended to represent the best or only approach to any particular issue."" In Florida, high school history standards include lessons about Islam such as a comparison of Islam, Judaism and Christianity and key developments in Islamic history. The Florida Department of Education said whether to use Access Islam is a decision for local school districts. Access Islam is not part of the resource list given to Volusia County Schools World History teachers however teachers can choose their own resources as long as they conforms to the standards, a district spokesperson said. Broward, Pinellas and Hillsborough school districts don’t use the Access Islam curriculum, district spokespersons said. The U.S. Education Department granted $166,000 in fiscal year 2005 and $8,000 in fiscal year 2006 for the program, but we could find no recent involvement by the department. In case there was any tinge of partisan politics, the grants came while George W. Bush, a Republican was president. Spokespersons for the department and PBS did not respond to our questions by our deadline. Experts on whether program is ‘indoctrination’ We asked four experts to review the Access Islam materials and all said they did not consider the materials to be ""indoctrination"": Linda K. Wertheimer, journalist and author of the book Faith Ed, Teaching About Religion In An Age of Intolerance; Mark Fowler, Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding deputy chief executive officer; Charles C. Haynes, Vice President of the Newseum Institute’s Religious Freedom Center and Diane Moore director of Harvard Divinity School’s Religious Literacy Project. Haynes said the claim that the lessons are indoctrination is ""completely unfounded."" ""Nothing in these lessons crosses the constitutional line dividing education and indoctrination,"" he said. ""Students learn the basic tenets and practices of Muslims and then are assessed on what they have learned. Students are not asked to affirm or reject any religious teachings. Nor are students required to participate in any religious or devotional activities."" Wertheimer said the lessons are a clear example of teaching ""about"" religion. ""It is not preaching or promoting Islam over other faiths,"" she said. ""In fact, the lesson plans include questions about comparing and contrasting beliefs and practices of Islam to those of other faiths."" Indoctrination has as its motivation having children choose a faith over another, Fowler said. But the lessons he reviewed didn’t ask students to choose a religion or rank them, he said. Moore said that the videos present individual Muslims’ personal experience of their faith. ""When any religious tradition is only represented in its positive light, it can feel like indoctrination to those who don't believe the tradition has merit or has equal credibility to one's own faith,"" she said. ""This is why it is so important to make the distinction between teaching about a religion and teaching religion, and the Access Islam site makes this distinction in its first lesson on the First Amendment.""  Our ruling The Republican Party of Volusia County says ""The United States Department of Education has introduced an Islamic indoctrination program for the public schools, called ‘Access Islam.’ The Access Islam program was created by a New York PBS station about a decade ago and received some funding from the federal education department during the George W.

Early attack ad says Tammy Baldwin backed letting citizens 'withhold funding' from troops
","More than a year and a half before she faces re-election for a second term, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin was hit with a super PAC ad that attacks her on military funding and dealing with the threat of terrorism from Iran. The video from Restoration PAC, posted March 21, 2017, makes a series of attacks. We’ll check its first one, which comes after a photograph of the Wisconsin Democrat appears on the screen.   ""Tammy Baldwin has some interesting ideas on how to keep us safe,"" the female narrator intones. ""She supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops."" Congress, of course, provides funding for the military -- not citizens directly. And couldn’t Congress easily move money collected through taxes from one fund to another? Let’s explore why this attack mostly misses its target. The PAC We rated as Pants on Fire a Restoration PAC ad that supported Wisconsin’s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson, in his 2016 win for a second term. The ad used a fake image to make it appear that President Barack Obama had met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. As a super PAC, the suburban Chicago-based Restoration PAC can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals. And it can spend unlimited money to advocate for or against political candidates. According to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, the group took in $4 million during the 2016 election cycle, with $3.8 million of it contributed by Richard Uihlein, president and CEO of Uline Inc., a packaging supply company based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., near Chicago. Nine days after the Restoration PAC video posted, it was announced that Uihlein had given $2 million to another super PAC that is encouraging Republican businessman Kevin Nicholson to run against Baldwin in 2018. The attack When the attack on Baldwin is made in the Restoration PAC ad, a footnote appears referring to the 2009 version of the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act, which has been introduced perennially but has never become law. The measures would allow citizens to redirect their tax dollars away from the military -- but not actually withhold funds from troops. According to a summary of the 2009 bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: The bill would have applied to conscientious objectors -- people opposed to any participation in war, usually based upon moral, religious or other beliefs, who made their status known to the U.S. Treasury Department. The department would have had to put income, gift and estate taxes paid by those people in a fund ""to be allocated to any appropriation not for a military purpose."" Baldwin, then a member of the House of Representatives, was a co-sponsor of the 2009 version, as she had been in 2003, 2005 and 2007. (She was not a cosponsor in 2011, nor in 2013 or 2015, after being elected to the Senate.) To back the attack on Baldwin, a Restoration PAC spokesman referred us to a 2012 article by Media Trackers, a conservative website. The article claimed that Baldwin’s support of the 2009 bill meant she wanted to ""block funding for body armor and medical supplies for U.S. troops."" But as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice reported at the time, when Baldwin faced attacks over the bill in her first Senate campaign, experts say the measure was a feel-good bill that wouldn't lead to federal defense cuts. What the bill could do As the experts told Bice, if the taxes from conscientious observers could not be used on military items, lawmakers could simply dip into another pot of tax dollars to underwrite war-related expenses. Even the group pushing the legislation said at the time the bill would not ""directly decrease the amount of money spent on war."" And its website now says the bill would ""not immediately impact the level of military spending."" Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, told us the bill’s effect would be ""symbolic at best."" Added Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense: ""It’s a pretty empty piece of legislation; more like an accounting trick. Clearly this is intended for a conscientious objector to feel better about their taxes, but it doesn’t reduce their tax bill or really withhold funding for our troops.’"" Our rating Restoration PAC says Baldwin ""supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops."" Baldwin on four occasions, most recently in 2009, cosponsored a bill that would have allowed conscientious objectors to direct the federal government not to use their income taxes and other tax payments for any military purpose. But the bill would not have restricted Congress’ ability to allocate money to the military; even the organization pushing the legislation acknowledges it would not reduce military funding; and experts agree it is a symbolic measure that would not result in funding being withheld from troops.

Donald Trump's skewed portrayal of Obama's stimulus
","Just over eight years ago, when Barack Obama was just as new to the Oval Office as Donald Trump is now, he signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, more commonly known as the stimulus. Its supporters give it a measure of credit for making the Great Recession milder than it could have been. But critics, including Trump, argue that it was a whole lot of nothing. He said as much at a town hall for CEOs on April 4, 2017. ""You know, there was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, a trillion dollars,"" Trump said. ""Nobody ever saw anything being built. I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built. They used most of that money on social programs, and we want this to be on infrastructure."" We have fact-checked claims about the stimulus from the time it was being proposed, as well as more recent claims on its results. Let’s take another look at the question of what the stimulus did, and didn’t, achieve. The stimulus was not primarily an infrastructure bill In February 2009, Obama signed into law a stimulus package that ultimately cost just over $800 billion. (Earlier estimates had been higher, so we won’t quibble with Trump’s rounding it up to $1 trillion.) The ""shovel-ready"" aspects of the stimulus tended to attract the most attention. But officially, that was only one of the act’s goals, and if you look closely at how the funds were allocated, only a fraction of the total was ever intended to go to infrastructure. According to the Council of Economic Advisers’ final report to Congress on the stimulus, which was current through February 2014, about 35 percent of the expenditures went for tax cuts for individuals and businesses; about 18 percent went for aid to cash-strapped state governments to offset cuts to health and education programs; and about 14 percent went for ""safety net"" expenditures paid to individual Americans, such as added unemployment payments. That leaves 34 percent of expenditures going to ""public investment"" -- hardly a trivial amount in an $804.6 billion bill, but still a distinct minority of the total outlay. And the amount actually spent on metal-and-concrete infrastructure was even smaller than that, since the ""public investment"" category also covers spending on such things as Pell grants, education for disabled students and scientific research.  Michael Grabell, a journalist with the investigative project ProPublica, wrote a book, Money Well Spent? The Truth Behind the Trillion-Dollar Stimulus, the Biggest Economic Recovery Plan in History. In his book, Grabell estimated that only about $80 billion, or roughly one-tenth of the act’s spending, was devoted to what people would normally think of as ""infrastructure,"" and of that, only about $27 billion was spent specifically on roads and bridges. So roads and bridges accounted for just over 3 percent of all spending under the act. By the numbers, then, it would be at least as accurate to call the stimulus a tax cut bill as it would be to call it an infrastructure bill. Meanwhile, saying the bill spent money on ""social programs,"" as Trump did, is an exaggeration at best. Perhaps the safety net expenditures (14 percent of the law’s outlays) and aid to governments for health and education (18 percent) could be considered ""social programs,"" although not all observers would agree on that label. Either way, they would total less than a third of expenditures. It’s wrong to say that nothing was built Even observers who see some value in the act acknowledge that it was far from perfect. For instance, Grabell concluded in a 2012 op-ed that a lesson of the stimulus is that ""government can create jobs — it just doesn’t often do it well."" Grabell wrote that ""money was spread far and wide rather than dedicated to programs with the most bang for the buck. ‘Shovel-ready’ projects, those that would put people to work right away, took too long to break ground. Investments in worthwhile long-term projects, on the other hand, were often rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines, and the resulting shoddy outcomes tarnished the projects’ image."" That said, the infrastructure spending in the stimulus, despite its shortcomings, did build things. ""The notion that the New Deal built bridges and dams while all the stimulus did was fill potholes isn't entirely true,"" Grabell wrote in his book. ""Generations from now, there will be countless projects that communities can point to as the enduring legacy of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The $80 billion for roads, runways, waterworks, rails, federal buildings, and parks was one of the largest investments in the nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower established the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s."" Just to cite a few of the bigger projects, the Recovery Act helped push to completion the $1 billion DFW Connector highway in Dallas-Fort Worth; a $650 million elevated truck route to the Port of Tampa; a new Cleveland Innerbelt Bridge; a tunnel connecting Oakland and Contra Costa County, Calif.; new light rail lines in Salt Lake City and Dallas; a courthouse in Austin; a hospital at Camp Pendleton in California; a veterans' facility at Fort Bliss in Texas; and new headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard. And the list of projects funded by the act runs to nine pages in his book, even though that’s just a partial accounting. Was it worth it? Of course, even though the act produced tangible results, it’s reasonable to question whether it did so in the most efficient way possible. ""Keep in mind that the normal test for a positive outcome involves cost-benefit analysis,"" Dan Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us for an earlier fact-check. ""Dumping a bunch of money into the maws of state and local governments is highly unlikely to generate good results."" And Grabell said it’s important not to oversell the impact of the stimulus’ reach. ""Despite the historic investments and endless list of projects, the Recovery Act in the end created not a crater but a dent in America's overwhelming infrastructure needs,"" he wrote. ""It replaced or repaired more than 1,000 deficient or obsolete bridges, but America has more than 150,000 bridges in such conditions."" Our ruling Trump said, ""There was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, a trillion dollars. Nobody ever saw anything being built."" In practice, the stimulus had a mixed record. Beyond that, though, Trump’s characterization is flawed. The single biggest portion of the law actually consisted of tax cuts. As for the infrastructure portion of the law, it did indeed produce results, even if they were somewhat more underwhelming than its backers had initially hoped.

Caitlyn Jenner gets North Carolina's new HB2 replacement law all wrong
","Joining the national anger over North Carolina’s new law replacing the controversial House Bill 2 was Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner is perhaps the most famous transgender person in America. So when she began criticizing North Carolina’s new law to her 4 million Twitter followers, people took note. A bipartisan deal between legislators and Gov. Roy Cooper last week got rid of some of HB2’s controversial parts, but it retained two parts of HB2 that Democrats and advocates for LGBT rights have criticized for the past year. Jenner has been among those critics, even though she’s a Republican. And she was not pleased about the compromise. ""The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain,"" she said. There have been exaggerations and falsehoods on both sides of the HB2 debate. We’ve fact-checked many of them. And this claim sounded like a stretch, so we took a look at it. We contacted Jenner’s publicist to help us understand what she meant, but have not heard back. Bathroom rules We’ll tackle Jenner’s claims in reverse order. She ended her post by saying that North Carolina’s ""‘bathroom bans’ remain."" That seems to be a reference to the provision of HB2 that had banned transgender people in government facilities from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify – and which instead required everyone to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. But although Jenner said that ban remains on the books, the opposite is true. The most high-profile change this new law made was getting rid of that part of HB2. In fact, that’s precisely why so many conservative politicians and interest groups opposed the new law. Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, said it ""leaves the state without a statewide public policy on privacy and safety in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers."" (As an aside, we previously found there are virtually no instances of sexual predators using transgender-friendly bathroom laws as cover to commit crimes.) North Carolina has now rejoined 48 other states in having no law about who can use which bathroom. The only outlier now is Washington, which is on the other end of the spectrum and has a transgender-friendly bathroom law. It is possible that Jenner meant this part of her claim as a reference to the new law’s prohibition on state agencies, colleges and school districts regulating access to bathrooms and locker rooms -- which blocks them from creating transgender-friendly policies. But no matter how you interpret it, the fact remains that transgender people are no longer banned from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. There is now simply no law at all on bathroom access. Furthermore, any private business that wants to enact its own transgender-friendly bathroom policies has always been able to do so and still can. And that leads us to the other part of her claim. Mandatory discrimination? ""The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020,"" Jenner said. What the law says is that through Dec. 1, 2020, cities and counties can’t pass local anti-discrimination ordinances related to employment or public accommodations. That means LGBT people won’t be protected from discrimination in North Carolina for at least the next three-plus years, unless the legislature makes another change. But that’s a far cry from ordering cities to discriminate, which this law does not do. No, the mayors of North Carolina are not required to engage in anti-gay behavior, nor must they require businesses in their communities to do the same. Similarly, there’s no federal law protecting LGBT people from workplace discrimination. That doesn’t mean Congress is ordering every company in America to discriminate against gay or transgender people. And most other states also lack these protections, as we found in a previous fact-check. Improvements for gay rights And despite widespread condemnation from LGBT activists, the new law did make some concessions to HB2 opponents. For instance, HB2’s bans on local ordinances were indefinite, but the new bans expire in 2020. It rolled back a provision of HB2 that – as we found in a previous fact-check – might have prohibited cities and counties from protecting even their own employees from anti-LGBT discrimination. There’s no more ambiguity now. Under the new law, if local elected officials want to protect their own local government employees from anti-LGBT discrimination, they can. HB2 had also banned local governments from having certain requirements for would-be contractors – including, for example, a mandate that the contractors have discrimination protections for LGBT people. Now, cities and counties are once more allowed to have those requirements for contractors, according to the UNC School of Government’s Norma Houston – who is an expert in public government contracting – as well as Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman, who said the town’s pro-LGBT contractor ordinance is now back in place. Our ruling After North Carolina replaced HB2, pro-LGBT activists said the compromise was not nearly enough. Caitlyn Jenner, one of the country’s most famous transgender celebrities, took that criticism a step further when she tweeted: ""The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair ‘bathroom bans’ remain."" Neither part of that is correct. The bathroom ban was repealed. And while the new law does continue banning cities and counties from giving LGBT people local discrimination protections, that’s not even close to the same as ordering discrimination. Her statement makes two claims. Neither is accurate, and we rate this claim False.  ",/factchecks/2017/apr/04/caitlyn-jenner/caitlyn-jenner-get-north-carolinas-new-hb2-replace/

Donald Trump flubs how unemployment is calculated
","At a town hall with CEOs, President Donald Trump revived some of his longstanding concerns about how the nation’s unemployment statistics are calculated. Appearing to reference the number of Americans out of work, Trump said, ""We have 100 million people if you look. You know, the real number's not 4.6 percent (for the unemployment rate). They told me I had 4.6 percent last month. I'm doing great. I said yeah, but what about the hundred million people? A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people -- a good percentage of them would like to have jobs and they don't. You know, one of the statistics that, to me, is just ridiculous -- so, the 4.6 sounds good. But when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed. But I don't consider those people employed."" Is Trump right that ""when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed""? Not at all. Trump seems to suggest that government statisticians are performing something like medieval alchemy, turning lead (unemployment) into gold (employment) with the flick of a wand. That’s not the case. Broadly speaking, if someone is already considered unemployed and they give up looking for a job, they would be counted as ""not in the labor force"" -- not as ""employed.""   In fact, there is an official statistical category for a person in this situation. If someone wants and looks for a job but then gives up, they are called ""discouraged workers."" Specifically, these people ""want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months"" but are ""not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify."" The problem for Trump is that ""discouraged workers"" are relatively rare -- in the most recent month, there were 522,000 of them. That’s just one-fourteenth the number of unemployed workers, and only about one-half of 1 percent of the ""out of work"" Americans Trump seems to have been referring to. Speaking of which, as we have noted previously, Trump’s 100-million figure of ""out of work"" Americans is highly misleading. This number -- in reality, a bit lower at 94 million -- includes any American age 16 and over who isn’t institutionalized and who isn’t either working or actively looking for work. This means the figure includes retirees, high school students over 16, undergraduate and graduate students, stay-at-home parents, disabled people, adults who are engaged in full-time education or training, and even trust-fund kids and those wealthy enough to be living off investments. In other words, the figure includes a lot of people who wouldn’t be expected to be working, or who are engaged in other pursuits. We have previously estimated that no more than a quarter of the 94 million people not in the labor market are either out of work, looking for a job, or eager to get back in the job hunt if labor-market conditions were to improve. Here's a chart from the jobs site Indeed.com showing one analysis of the reasons that prime-working-age Americans may not be working.   So suggesting that roughly 100 million Americans are out of work ropes in many people who, in fact, have no desire to find paid employment. Our ruling Trump said, ""When you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed."" That’s flat wrong -- someone who stops looking for work would be shifted to the ""out of the labor force"" category, not the ""employed category.""

Doctors' deaths were not connected, as website claims
","A fake news story tried to connect the random deaths of doctors with conspiracy theories around vaccination. Neonnettle.com posted a story headlined,""Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines found murdered,"" on March 2, 2017. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to clear fake news from users' news feeds. The story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public. We reached out to the website but got no response. (Neonnettle later emailed us to say it deleted the post.) Their argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high. That theory lacks scientific evidence, though. The British government has warned against the purchase of GcMAF, since it is not licensed and its production does not adhere to production standards.  Scientific journals where those theories were published have retracted them, because they are not proven. Healthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery.  But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy. Dr. Bruce Hedendal, a 67-year-old doctor in Florida, was found dead in his car in June 2015. The actual cause of his death is not clear, but natural causes have been cited by Florida local TV stations. Hedendal was a chiropractor, and there are no reports that he was involved in challenging the pharma industry in any way. Another doctor from Florida, Dr. Theresa Ann Sievers, 46, was found murdered in her Florida home in 2015. An investigation found that her husband Mark had hired two men, Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Rodgers, to kill her so he could collect insurance money. Again, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry. In a follow-up article, healthnutnews.com broadened the theory to include two additional doctors. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, 63, went missing after a fight with his wife and was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide. Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick,a 74-year-old retired eyedoctor, went missing while hiking in Montana. The police searched but never found him. A officer of the Gallatin County Sheriff’s office told the Bismarck Tribune that Fitzpatrick may have suffered from occasional confusion, due to his advanced age. He also said that they had no reason to believe criminal activity was involved in this case. The only person who was actually involved in the vaccination debate was Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, 61. He became controversial for his claim that vaccines could cause autism, a theory that has been refuted by  several studies. Bradstreet treated his autism patients with the GcMAF protein, which the FDA does not recognize as treatment for autism. According to the Rutherford County, N.C.. Sheriff’s Office, his wounds appear to be self-inflicted. He was not murdered. But his death in 2015 gave way to a wave of conspiracy theories. While the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet’s case even comes close. And even that is a stretch. As for sourcing, neonnettle.com refers to thebigriddle.com, which posted the exact story a year ago. Thebigriddle.com cites conspiracyclub.co as its source, a site that doesn’t exist anymore. Our ruling The article puts forward a conspiracy theory that is based on the actual deaths of American doctors, but there is no information that they worked together on vaccine discoveries, nor were their deaths connected.  The conclusions in the article are pure speculation. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. UPDATE Feb. 12, 2019: Neonnettle said it deleted the post. We've updated this fact-check to reflect that new information and have changed the headline.  ",/factchecks/2017/apr/04/blog-posting/doctors-deaths-were-not-connected-fake-news-websit/

Does Afghanistan grow more opium poppies than before 2001?
","President Donald Trump’s budget puts a number of foreign assistance programs at risk, if not outright elimination. His plan to cut about 30 percent from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development has drawn resistance from both Republicans and Democrats. At a March 28 hearing, Rep Ted Yoho, R-Fla., came to the defense of several prominent projects, including the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and two Obama-era programs aimed at boosting electric capacity in Africa and agriculture globally. But Yoho did agree with cuts in one area -- the war on drugs. He said it was ineffective. ""I look at the poppy fields in Afghanistan,"" Yoho said. ""They have more hectares planted today than they had before we started this war."" Opium poppies produce a key ingredient for heroin and other opioids.  Afghanistan remains the world’s top opium poppy producer, despite the billions of dollars America has put into the country. Since late 2001 when the United States and its allies retaliated against the Taliban and al-Qaida for the 9/11 attacks, America has spent about $25 billion to rebuild Afghanistan’s economy and $8.5 billion to rid it of narcotics. Yoho’s office said he got his information from a United Nations report. The latest survey found that in 2016, farmers were growing poppies on more than 200,000 hectares. In 2002, the number was 74,000 hectares. The U.N.’s chart below shows the pattern over the decades. The black lines show the high and low estimates. In conflict zones, satellite images replaced on-the-ground observations.  Aside from a few years, the land under poppy cultivation has trended up. The actual tons produced has jumped around more, but it too is higher today than in 2002. The big drop in 2001 came after the Taliban banned production in 2000. The Taliban later reversed itself, leading to a rapid spread after 2012. According to the U.N., most of the opium comes from Afghanistan’s southern provinces.  Only in terms of Gross Domestic Product does opium play a smaller role than in the past. The International Monetary Fund reported that in 2004, opium exports were equal to half of the country’s non-opium GDP.  Today, it is closer to about 15 percent. But it still provides about 400,000 jobs, more than the Afghan National Security Forces. Reports from the private research group RAND and the World Bank say the driver is simple economics. Opium offers a better return to farmers than most crops. In a regrettable twist, American-led efforts to make legal crops more lucrative can backfire. In Helmand Province, a project successfully shifted a number of landowners away from poppies, but then they no longer needed the sharecroppers and tenant farmers who had been working the land. World Bank researchers said this ""created a displaced, cheap, and mobile population, skilled in poppy cultivation."" They moved to marginal land and poppy production increased. Our ruling Yoho said Afghanistan has more land producing poppies than before the U.S. war began. U.N. surveys back that up. In 2002, the country had about 74,000 hectares in poppy cultivation. In 2016, the number was over 200,000. The amount of land used for growing poppies has gone up and down, but the long term trend is definitely up.

Jerry Brown’s Mostly True claim about 'tremendous job growth' in Inland Empire, Central Valley
","Gov. Jerry Brown frequently touts California’s overall job growth when telling what he’s called the state’s ‘comeback’ story. He claimed recently on NBC’s Meet the Press that California has added ""2.1 million jobs in the last six or seven years."" We checked the numbers and rated that claim True. Later in the same interview, the show’s host Chuck Todd asked Brown about inland California’s struggles, leading to another claim that caught our attention: Chuck Todd: ""But there are parts of your state that are struggling. You have rural counties, ones that don’t touch the ocean, struggling. Housing prices are up there, while jobs don’t go there.""  Gov. Brown: ""The Inland Empire, the Central Valley, they have a harder time. But they, too, are experiencing tremendous job growth.""   Brown makes his jobs claim at about the 2:05 minute mark in the video above.  California’s job growth is normally associated with coastal hubs like Silicon Valley and San Francisco. So, we wondered whether Brown had his facts right when he said these inland regions had really experienced ""tremendous job growth,"" too. We set out on a fact-check. Inland Empire Home to about 4.5 million people, Riverside and San Bernardino counties make up what’s known as the Inland Empire, a sprawling set of communities east of Los Angeles. The economists we spoke with say Brown’s case for ""tremendous job growth"" here is a strong one. The region’s 3.2 percent job growth rate was the fastest among the state’s large metro areas from February 2016 through February 2017, said John Husing, chief economist for the Inland Empire Economic Partnership. During that year, it added 47,500 jobs, which was more than the 35,700 created in the Santa Clara metro area, considered the heart of Silicon Valley, Husing said.   ""This area is a real growth engine,"" he added, listing construction, logistics and transportation among the growing sectors. Over the past five years, as the region has recovered from the Great Recession, it added jobs at a rate of 22.3 percent. That trailed only the San Francisco-Redwood City-South San Francisco metro area’s 22.7 percent rate among large metros. A spokesman for the Brown Administration cited the same statistics backing up the governor’s claim. Colin Strange of the San Bernardino Area Chamber of Commerce said San Bernardino is seeing job growth, but mainly in ""blue-collar jobs"" that pay about $15 per hour including fork-lift operators and truck drivers. Husing, who has studied the region’s wages, said the Inland Empire has a lower share of high-paying administrative jobs compared with the state as a whole. He said, however, that the region is outperforming the state in its share of middle-class jobs that pay between $45,000 and $60,000. Central Valley The Central Valley stretches about 450 miles from Bakersfield north to Redding. It includes urban cities like Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto and Fresno, vast farmland and a diverse economy, making job growth trends for the overall region more complex. A report by Stanislaus State University in the Central Valley city of Turlock offers some help. That report shows the 8-county San Joaquin Valley, which makes up the central and southern portions of the Central Valley, experienced a 1.56 percent job growth rate in 2016; a 1.86 percent rate in 2015 and 1.80 percent in 2014. Those averages trailed the state’s overall job growth average, which measured 3 percent in 2015 and about 2 percent last year. But it beat the 8-county region’s 1.23 percent historical average job growth rate.  SOURCE: Stanislaus State University, College of Business Administration, 2016 Business Forecast Report, Volume VI, Issue 1 ""Within its own limits, the Valley has consistently grown. But it hasn’t been a home run,"" Gokce Soydemir, an economics professor at Stanislaus State, said of job growth in that portion of the Central Valley. Jeffrey Michael, director of the University of Pacific’s Center for Business and Policy Research in Stockton, added by email: ""Central Valley areas have also done very well in recent years with the exception of Bakersfield, where recent economic fluctuations are tightly connected to the oil industry."" Bakersfield’s job growth rate was flat, at 0.1 percent, over the past year. Meanwhile, Sacramento, the biggest metro area in northern portion of the Central Valley, saw 1.8 percent growth over the past year, close to the statewide average. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California’s Central Valley and Inland Empire ""are experiencing tremendous job growth."" Economists say Brown is right about the Inland Empire. That region experienced the fastest job growth rate among the state’s large metro areas over the past year, and added more jobs than the Santa Clara metro area, the heart of Silicon Valley, during that period. Job growth in the Central Valley, while it’s outperformed its historical benchmark in much of the diverse region, hasn’t kept up with the overall state average.

Vince Foster’s death has not been ruled a homicide after autopsy, despite fake news reports
","A fake news story saying former White House counsel Vince Foster’s body shows evidence that he didn’t die of a suicide is only part of a wide range of false Internet posts that won’t let rest the idea he was killed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. A March 24, 2017, story posted on Liberty-Courier.com carried the headline, ""Breaking: Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!"" The site, which is registered to an address in Utah, uses a name that evokes a newspaper, but is filled with fake news stories and has no immediately apparent contact information. The Foster story was flagged by Facebook users, who reported it as potentially being fake as part of the website’s efforts to push fabricated stories out of its news feeds. Foster, who was deputy counsel to President Bill Clinton and a former Arkansas law colleague of Hillary Clinton, committed suicide in 1993 at age 48, after suffering from depression. He was buried in his hometown of Hope, Ark. Conspiracy theories have raged for years that the Clintons actually had Foster killed for his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or some other insight. President Donald Trump is among those who have questioned whether Foster actually committed suicide, despite five different investigations concluding he suffered a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound. The post, meanwhile, is fake, and has ended up on other fake news websites. It says that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., had ordered Foster’s body exhumed. It cited a U.S. Navy officer as saying the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Va., determined Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, and his death should be reclassified as a homicide. Foster’s body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk — although there is a Naval Medical Center across the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, which used to be known as Naval Hospital Portsmouth. The post is accompanied by a photo that purports to be of naval forensics specialists, but actually is a handout photo from the Sacramento County (Calif.) Coroner’s Office.

Mostly True: Rep. Conyers' claim about border apprehensions down since 1980s
","Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr. urged his colleagues during a recent hearing on immigration to examine measures rooted in fact. One of those facts, he said, is that the southern border is more secure than ever. ""Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s, and apprehensions of Mexicans specifically have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century,"" Conyers, a Michigan representative, said March 28. We know that apprehension rates have been down in recent months. President Donald Trump has taken credit for recent declines in southwest border apprehensions. But is Conyers right that rates have plummeted since the 1980s, and that the number of Mexicans apprehended is at the lowest in nearly 50 years? Border patrol data and research from an independent think tank back up Conyers’ claim. Overall apprehension numbers since the 1980s Apprehension data is commonly regarded as a measure of illegal immigration. When apprehensions are up, it’s often thought that more people have been trying to cross the border. However, apprehensions represent events, not individuals. For example, one immigrant may have been apprehended multiple times and all those instances are added to the totals. Border patrol made 408,870 apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal year 2016, and while that was an increase from 2015, it’s still a fraction of the number of apprehensions routinely observed from the 1980s through 2008, said a December 2016 statement from the Department of Homeland Security. The recession of 2008 is likely to blame for the drop-off that started that year. Conyers' team pointed to that statement and to historical data on apprehensions at the southwest border, specifically years 1986 and 2016. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions – about 1.2 million more than in 2016. But it’s worth noting that there hasn’t been a steady decline since the 1980s. There have been increases and decreases over the years. During the 1980s, there was an average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border a year. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000. Apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border The second part of Conyers’ claim was specifically about Mexican immigrants. He said their apprehension levels have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century, basing his statement on an April 2016 analysis by Pew Research Center. Pew found that in 2015, border patrol conducted 188,122 apprehensions of Mexican nationals, the lowest since 1969, when 159,376 Mexicans were apprehended. ""The decline suggests unauthorized immigration flows from Mexico could be falling,"" Pew research reported. Some reasons for declines in Mexican immigrants during and since the Great Recession according to Pew are: fewer jobs available, particularly in construction; stricter enforcement of immigration laws; and demographic changes in Mexico with decreases in the age of immigrants more likely to migrate. (In 2014, about 25 percent of the population was between 15 and 29 years old. In 1990, that segment was above 29 percent.) DHS also has noted shifts in the demographics of people attempting to cross the border illegally. Over the past 15 years, far fewer Mexicans and single adults are trying to cross illegally, the DHS noted in its December 2016 statement. But more families and children are being stopped at the border as they flee poverty and violence in Central America. In 2014 and 2016, the number of Central Americans apprehended at the southern border outnumbered the number of Mexicans, DHS said.

How extensive was Jon Ossoff's national security background in Congress?
","In Georgia’s closely watched congressional special election, the surprisingly strong Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, has touted his policy experience in national security -- and taken heat for allegedly embellishing it. Ossoff is running to succeed Republican Tom Price in the U.S. House, after Price’s confirmation as secretary of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. Historically, Price’s affluent, suburban Atlanta district has been solidly Republican. However, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the district by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016 -- well below the usual Republican performance -- giving Democrats hope that Ossoff could win the April 18 special election. Polls show Ossoff leading the multi-party field, with Republican candidates splitting the rest of the vote. If he can get to 50 percent, Ossoff could win the seat outright without having to compete in a runoff. That possibility has prompted Democrats from across the country to flood his war chest with donations. The question of Ossoff’s national security background first came up in the news release announcing his campaign on Jan. 5. ""A Georgia native who grew up in the Sixth District, Ossoff served Georgia as a national security staffer in Congress for five years before leaving government for the private sector,"" the release reads. Ossoff, 30, continued to emphasize his experience on the campaign trail, such as in a campaign appearance and on this podcast. However, opponents raised questions about his experience, noting that Ossoff had worked on Capitol Hill between 2007 and 2012 but had only earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 2009. That would make him a pretty junior staffer to be touting his national security experience. We decided to take a closer look. The timeline After the criticism emerged, Ossoff’s campaign released a timeline of his years on Capitol Hill. Here it is: • January 2007: Starts working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., as a part-time legislative correspondent, working 25-30 hours a week while attending Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. • May 2009: Graduates from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. • Summer 2009: Spends the summer traveling before he returns to work as a legislative assistant for Johnson in August 2009. • January 2010: Promoted to senior legislative assistant. • April-July 2010: Runs Johnson's re-election campaign. • September 2010: Returns to Johnson's Capitol Hill office. • March 2012: Receives a top-secret security clearance and staffs Johnson for all work related to the annual National Defense Authorization Act. • Mid August 2012: Leaves Johnson's office. This timeline, which appears to match the congressional staff records we were able to find, confirms that Ossoff did indeed work as a congressional staffer for five years. Why this raises legitimate questions However, it’s important to keep in mind some important context about Ossoff’s first two years on Johnson’s staff. During those two years, Ossoff was working with the office only on a part-time basis and hadn’t received his undergraduate degree yet. Moreover, his title -- legislative correspondent -- is not exactly a lofty one. Here’s how the Congressional Management Foundation describes it: ""Researches and writes legislative correspondence; conducts legislative research; assists legislative assistants as needed."" In other words, the primary job of a legislative correspondent is to answer mail from the lawmaker’s constituents and to backfill for more senior office staffers when necessary. In 2009, one of the years Ossoff held the position, the median salary for a legislative correspondent was $38,875, more than the $37,504 for a staff assistant and well below the next rung up on the ladder -- legislative assistant at $50,500, according to the Congressional Research Service. And what do staff assistants do? According to the Congressional Management Foundation, a staff assistant ""handles word processing, filing, faxing; responds to general constituent requests; processes tour and flag requests; staffs the front reception area, greets visitors and answers telephones."" In other words, a typical legislative correspondent is getting just $1,300 a year more than the (usually equally junior) staffer manning the reception desk. Why Ossoff’s situation may have been different Ossoff’s former supervisors, however, maintain that Ossoff had substantially more responsibility than a typical legislative correspondent. Daraka Satcher, Johnson’s chief of staff from 2007 to 2009, told PolitiFact that the congressman was newly elected to the House and ""was focused more on domestic issues than national security."" Meanwhile, Satcher and Johnson recognized that Ossoff, with his foreign-service school background, was precocious. ""Putting just any college student in that situation would be malpractice, but honestly, Jon was not a typical college student,"" Satcher said. ""He handled the issues, so we felt very comfortable"" with the unusual arrangement. Satcher said that he himself had some experience on national security issues from his previous work on Capitol Hill, so he was able to backstop Ossoff when needed. Johnson, the congressman, backed up Satcher’s description. ""I had no military assets in my district and was not a military guy,"" Johnson told PolitiFact, ""Jon’s level of information on the issue was much deeper than mine at that time. While he was a legislative correspondent, he was learning how to be a legislative assistant."" Johnson’s office added that Ossoff played a key role in the House’s June 18, 2007, passage of H.Con.Res.80, a non-binding resolution about the civil war in northern Uganda. That occurred just a few months after Ossoff joined the office. Johnson said that Ossoff also handled some more mundane duties in the office, such as some information technology assignments. Still, he added, ""to say that Jon staffed me on national security, that’s entirely, 100 percent correct."" Is this version of events credible? Of course, in addition to being Democrats, both Johnson and Satcher have an incentive to see their former staffer win a seat in Congress. So we tried to determine independently whether the scenario they describe is plausible. We reached out to half a dozen staffers who we determined had worked for House co-sponsors of the Uganda resolution, but we did not hear back from anyone who was able to comment either way. We did, however, run everything we had learned past the staff at LegiStorm, a company founded by Jock Friedly, a former investigative and congressional reporter. The company, which is nonpartisan, collects and analyzes data about Congress. They are perhaps best known for collecting publicly available salary information about Capitol Hill staffers. Friedly and a researcher on his staff, Keturah Hetrick, pored over the available information for PolitiFact and concluded that there was nothing to contradict Ossoff’s version of events. They said that ""it’s not a stretch"" for Ossoff to have handled substantive foreign-policy issues despite his low-level position. ""Legislative correspondents are rarely going to be the primary staffer handling a given legislative issue, but they will also handle some policy work,"" Hetrick said. What Johnson and Satcher said ""sounds totally plausible,"" she said. At the same time, she added, official documentation is silent on whether Ossoff was officially Johnson’s primary foreign affairs staffer between 2007 and 2009. Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress-watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said Ossoff’s statement amounts to ""resume inflation,"" though, in his opinion, a ""rather benign"" example. ""Legislative correspondent is a junior staff position, but it at least requires that the staffer know enough about his boss's policy positions that he can write letters, both to constituents and executive agencies, that are accurate and in some cases nuanced,"" he said. A better phrasing, Ornstein said, would have been that he spent ""five years as a staffer in the U.S. Congress, including work on national security."" Our ruling Ossoff said, ""I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress."" This description certainly applies to his final three years on Capitol Hill, which were spent in middle- to senior-level foreign policy posts. Whether it applies to his first two years working for the lawmaker is less clear cut. His former supervisors insist that due to unusual circumstances within the office, Ossoff handled foreign-policy duties above his pay grade during that time. An independent expert told us that the explanation is plausible. That said, Ossoff at the time was an undergraduate student holding a part-time position that, in the Capitol Hill pecking order, was entry-level. That adds relevant context, and he left it out.

How New York state treats 16- and 17-year-olds in the criminal justice system
","New York remains one of two states that can prosecute 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal courts. Some Albany lawmakers want all of them treated as children in Family Court instead. They're pressing to include a measure to accomplish that as part of state budget negotiations. They want separate facilities for those sentenced to serve time, saying that separating them from criminals 18 and over in prison would lower the recidivism rate for the younger offenders. Lowering the age of criminal responsibility would lead to shorter sentences for the younger offenders. Opponents of the measure, however, warn about a blanket policy that treats every 16- and 17-year-old offender as a child. They want judges to be able to decide who to treat as adults in cases involving serious crimes like murder or sexual assault. The two sides are still negotiating. State Sen. Pat Gallivan, a Republican from Elma, says such a broad proposal may not be necessary because New York state usually treats 16- and 17-year-old defendants differently than adults. ""When you have roughly 30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction,""Gallivan said at a news conference. ""Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison. So, I would make an argument that we are already treating them differently."" Is Gallivan right on the numbers? A commission's report The senator’s data comes from a 2014 report by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s Commission on Youth, Public Safety, and Justice. The commission convened to make recommendations on raising the age of criminal responsibility. The report shows about 33,000 cases resolved in 2013, with almost 2.7 percent receiving a sentence to state prison. That data has since been updated by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services, which reported close to 35,000 resolved cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2013. Only 1,689 cases, or 4.8 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction, according to the data. Some 5,215 other cases resulted in a youth offender adjudication, given when someone is found guilty but a judge seals the record at sentencing. In all, 838 cases resulted in a state prison sentence, 2.4 percent of the cases resolved that year. Some 1,808 cases, about 5 percent, resulted in a jail sentence for lesser convictions. Defendants in the remaining cases were either found not guilty or received different sentences like probation or a fine. Or else they received a conditional discharge, allowing them to avoid incarceration or other punishment as long as they complied with conditions set by the court. More recent data There were 24,572 cases resolved involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants in 2016. Only 1,012 cases, or 4.1 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction. Some 3,802 resulted in a youthful offender adjudication. The state said 581 cases, or 2.4 percent of all cases, resulted in a state prison sentence, while 1,072 cases resulted in a local jail sentence. Our ruling Gallivan, a former Erie County sheriff and captain in the State Police, said of ""30,000 individuals arrested a year for crimes that are 16 or 17, over 95 percent of them do not result in a criminal conviction. Only 1.5 percent of them ultimately go to state prison."" State data shows close to 96 percent of cases involving 16- and 17-year-old defendants did not result in a criminal conviction last year. Only 2.4 percent of these cases received sentences to state prison. That drops to less than 1.5 percent if you exclude youth offender adjudications. The state says both categories of offenders should be included in sentencing data. Gallivan is slightly off on the numbers, but his claim that few of these cases result in a conviction - and even fewer receive a state prison sentence - is correct. His statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/apr/03/patrick-gallivan/how-does-new-york-treat-16-and-17-year-olds-crimin/

Fake news claims Muslims can wear burqas in driver's license photos
","We came across a headline and provocative photo on the truetrumpers.com website that suggested Illinois officials would permit Muslims to have photo IDs taken for driver’s licenses with their faces completely covered by burqas. We decided to check out the claim as part of International Fact-Checking Day. ""Muslims get their way--Illinois will permit wearing burqas in driving licenses photos,"" the headline reads. PolitiFact Illinois examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as ""not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life."" Dave Druker, spokesman for Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, whose office administers driver’s license testing and issues Illinois IDs, quickly dismissed the claim. ""That is not the case and the face must be exposed,"" he said. In fact, Druker noted, it’s now standard procedure, whenever a resident seeks to renew their driver’s license, that their old license picture is scanned and run through facial recognition software in an attempt to determine they are who they say they are and that they are not wanted for any serious crimes or listed on any terrorism watch lists. Muslims may cover the tops of their heads when their pictures are taken for state IDs, Druker said, but faces must be exposed. ""The face has to be exposed,"" he said. ""You can have your head covered. The top of your head. The face must be exposed. An orthodox Jew could wear a skull cap. A nun could wear the habit, but the face must be exposed."" Druker said he was asked about the same fake news claim from a site about a year ago. This claim came from a website called TrueTrumpers.com that is not a credible news media site. It includes several posts that fuel fake claims about President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama and Muslims, in particular, as well as click-baiting claims about porn stars and secret tricks for weight loss and whiter teeth.
