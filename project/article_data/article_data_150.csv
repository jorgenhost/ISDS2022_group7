Economist: Immigrants have taken all new jobs created since 2000
","President Barack Obama’s decision to defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants has stirred fear that a tough job market just got tougher. The concern is that if these people can now work in the country legally, it will take opportunities away from the people who were born here. In a newspaper op-ed, Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, faulted loose immigration policies for what he called the economy’s ""lackluster performance."" Morici cited a number of factors, including this striking statement about immigrants. ""(They) have captured all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000,"" Morici wrote. ""Illegal immigrants hold many of these positions, and now the president threatens to legalize their status by executive action if the Republican Congress won't cave to his demands."" A reader wondered if Morici was right about immigrants scoring all of the new jobs. Morici’s statement that ""illegal immigrants hold many of these positions"" is a bit vague, so this fact-check focuses only on his claim about immigrants, both legal and illegal, capturing ""all of the nearly 9 million jobs created since 2000."" Morici told PunditFact he got his numbers from a recent report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration. ""The total number of working-age (16 to 65) immigrants (legal and illegal) holding a job increased 5.7 million from the first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2014, while declining 127,000 for natives,"" the report said. While the report didn’t spell out how many jobs the economy gained since 2000, it provided a link to a table that showed a growth of about 5.5 million jobs. These numbers largely match data provided by the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. So it might look as though Morici is on firm ground. The center’s study found that the number of jobs gained by the foreign-born was pretty much the same as the number of new jobs added to the economy. But there are a few hitches. First, that study focused on workers between 16 and 65 years old. In a footnote, the authors acknowledge that the results would look quite different if they had included older workers. Using the study’s table, we did that and saw that while foreign-born workers did better than those born in the United States, they didn’t account for all of the gains. For workers 16 years old and up, the total change in employment was about 8.8 million. Of that, the number of foreign-born workers grew about 6.2 million and for native-born, the number was 2.6 million. As this chart shows, the percentages change a lot.  If you parse Morici’s statement, you can see where these numbers get him into trouble. If he wants to speak of nearly 9 million new jobs, then he has to accept that about 70 percent, not 100 percent, went to immigrants. If he wants to assert that all the new jobs went to immigrants, then he should have talked about 5.5 million new jobs in the 16-65 age range. As it stands, the two parts of his statement don’t fit together. The center’s study also noted that the time period you pick will change what the data show. The report said, ""Since the jobs recovery began in 2010, 43 percent of employment growth has gone to immigrants."" That, obviously, is much less than ""all"" of the new jobs. It is worth noting that the study lumped legal and illegal immigrants together. Morici made a passing reference to illegal immigrants taking ""many"" of the new jobs. That claim is difficult to verify one way or the other because within the group of foreign-born workers, the ratio of American citizens to noncitizens has changed greatly in the past 15 years. In 2000, noncitizens outnumbered citizens by about 60 percent. In 2014, the difference was just 10 percent. Furthermore, it would be a mistake to treat all of the noncitizen workers as illegal immigrants. All these data show is that they were not born in this country and have not become citizens. They could have proper work permits, so their legal status is unknown. We told Morici about the issues we found in the data and didn’t hear back. Pia Orrenius is vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Orrenius said that foreign-born workers have found work faster than people born in America for many reasons. The demand for certain jobs has changed greatly, most likely thanks to new technology, she said. ""Labor markets are polarizing and middle-skill jobs are disappearing,"" Orrenius said. ""Natives tend to be middle-skilled compared to immigrants who are concentrated mostly on the low-skill end but also on the high-skill end."" Orrenius also said that native-born workers face different choices than newcomers when looking for work. They might be able to take advantage of government programs (such as Social Security disability), or they might have more savings that allow them to get by without a job longer than an immigrant. Also, immigrants tend to move to parts of the country where growth is faster, while native-born workers tend to stay put. Our ruling Morici said that all of the nearly 9 million new jobs created since 2000 went to immigrants. His numbers don’t add up. The study he cited linked to numbers that showed that immigrants accounted for about 70 percent of the net job growth. While that study’s headline was that all of the new jobs went to immigrants, that only held true for a certain age range, which Morici misapplied to all workers. Morici is correct that foreign-born workers, both citizens and noncitizens, do disproportionately well in the job market. But the actual numbers fall well short of the 100 percent that he said. ""All"" is an overstatement. There is an element of truth in the claim, but it ignores certain critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097210480>],/factchecks/2014/dec/02/peter-morici/economist-immigrants-have-taken-all-new-jobs-creat/

Viral meme says Constitution 'owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois'
","Shortly before Thanksgiving, a reader sent us a social media meme of the type that sends you scrambling back to your high school history textbook wondering, ""Did my teacher mention this?"" The meme features the following claim: ""The U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes, including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and separation of powers in government. Only difference is the Iroquois included women and non-whites."" It’s accompanied by a reproduction of Junius Brutus Stearns’ 1856 painting of the founding fathers signing the United States Constitution in 1787. We zeroed in on the meme’s underlying premise, that ""the U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes."" As it turns out, this topic has inspired a passionate debate among historians for more than three decades. But we did find agreement among historians that the meme oversells its central point.  The historical background Some four centuries ago, the nations of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, people united in a confederacy to establish peace in what is now upstate New York. The system of unified governance between the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and eventually the Tuscarora people enabled the Iroquois to become arguably the predominant Native American tribe in the northeastern United States prior to the arrival of European colonists. The similarity between the Iroquois federal-style government and the one the American colonists settled on after they wrote the Constitution has long intrigued historians. Could the Iroquois system of governance have been the inspiration for the United States’ newborn republic? Interest in this question crescendoed around the time of the 1987 bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. Historians held conferences to sift through the evidence, and the U.S. Senate passed a resolution saying that ""the confederation of the original 13 colonies into one republic was influenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy, as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the constitution itself."" The topic has proven to be a polarizing one. Some supporters of the notion of Iroquois influence say that the historical establishment is reluctant to give Native Americans credit where credit is due. Skeptics counter that the evidence is largely circumstantial. ""On balance, the consensus appears to be that although British North Americans were certainly aware of the confederal nature of the Iroquois government, the case for causation has not been made,"" wrote Alison LaCroix, a law professor at the University of Chicago, in The Ideological Origins of American Federalism, published in 2010. The case for Iroquois influence Scholars told PolitiFact that there are two broad areas of support for the notion that the Iroquois had a degree of influence on the Constitution. • Similarities in government structure. The Iroquois system, like the United States government of the past 200-plus years, was federal in nature -- the five or six individual tribes handled their own affairs, as the American states eventually would, and those tribes came together to form an overarching government to address issues of common importance. The Iroquois system also had aspects of representational democracy. ""It is highly probable that Anglo-Americans during the revolutionary era looked to Haudenosaunee governance as a model of a successful collective polity, and borrowed elements of Haudenosaunee practice in developing revolutionary American constitutional governments,"" said Jon W. Parmenter, a Cornell University historian and author of The Edge of the Woods: Iroquoia, 1534-1701. • The colonists and members of the founding generation were aware of the Iroquois. The colonists knew about the Iroquois from holding diplomatic talks with them, and the revolutionary generation admiringly adopted some of their symbols, such as the Mohawk Indian costumes worn by participants in the Boston Tea Party. We know that in 1744, Canassatego, an Onondaga chief, addressed representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia at a treaty conference in Lancaster, Pa. ""We heartily recommend Union and a good Agreement between you our Brethren,"" he said. ""Never disagree, but preserve a strict Friendship for one another, and thereby you, as well as we, will become the stronger. Our wise Forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations; this has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight and Authority with our neighbouring Nations. We are a powerful Confederacy; and, by your observing the same Methods our wise Forefathers have taken, you will acquire fresh Strength and Power; therefore whatever befalls you, never fall out one with another."" Benjamin Franklin noticed and published these remarks, and they were ""noticed by patriots,"" wrote the late Temple University anthropologist Elisabeth Tooker, generally a skeptic on the idea of Iroquois influence. Franklin, for his part, remarked at one point that if ""six Nations of ignorant Savages"" were ""capable of forming a Scheme for such a Union,"" then the new nation of European origin should be able to as well. This is none too flattering a reference, but it does provide additional evidence that the founding generation was aware of the Iroquois example. About a decade after Canassatego’s speech, Franklin was involved in crafting the Albany plan, an early, pre-revolution attempt to unify the colonies that in some ways mirrors the Iroquois example. The structure of Iroquois government was also heard periodically during the debates over the Constitution in the 1780s, according to Donald A. Grinde, Jr., a historian at the University of Buffalo and co-author, with Bruce E. Johansen, of Exemplar of Liberty: Native America and the Evolution of Democracy. Grinde writes that James Wilson's notes on the constitutional convention mention Indian governance, as does John Adams’ 1787 volume, Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States, which was published on the eve of the convention. Adams, who would later become the second president elected under the current Constitution, was less enamored of the Indian example than Franklin was, but he nonetheless thought Indian governance worthy of study and consideration. The case against Iroquois influence Despite this, many scholars have concluded that the evidence is short of convincing. • The Iroquois government is in some ways radically different than the U.S. government. For starters, the Iroquois’ federal system arguably bears more resemblance to the United Nations than the American federal system, focusing primarily on diplomacy. The Iroquois council ""was particularly concerned with matters of alliance, with the continuing firm alliance of the five member nations and alliances with other nations. It did not concern itself with the internal relations of the constituent nations,"" Tooker noted in a 1988 paper. More important, the Iroquois system is based on hereditary positions and clan-based leadership -- elements that are entirely foreign to the United States’ system (and arguably seem more similar to the British system the colonists were trying to escape). The Iroquois League’s governmental power was vested in a council of 50 chiefs known as sachems. Each sachem had a title that was essentially hereditary, and each of these titles belonged to a particular clan within a particular tribe. (The meme does have a point about the role of women: The successor to a League chief was chosen by the ""clan mother,"" the senior woman of the clan.) The division of council seats was fixed, but without any relation to the member nation’s population size. Meanwhile, as the council’s ""firekeepers,"" the Onondagas had the the responsibility of presenting the matter to be discussed, Tooker wrote. And the council acted based on consensus, rather than by majority rule, as became the system under the Constitution of 1787. ""There is little in this system of governance the Founding Fathers might have been expected to copy,"" Tooker wrote. ""It is doubtful, for example, that the delegates to the Constitutional Convention meeting during the legendary long, hot Philadelphia summer of 1787 would have proposed a system under which only their relatives could become members of Congress, and a system under which each legislator was chosen by a close female relative of the previous holder of the office. Nor does it seem likely -- even if John Adams had heeded his wife's admonition to ‘remember the ladies’ -- that if such a hereditary system had been adopted, the Constitutional Convention would have opted for matrilineal inheritance of office, which by its very nature excludes a son from succeeding to his father's position."" • Even if there was some Iroquois influence, it wasn’t the primary shaper of the Constitution. This is where the Facebook meme really overplays its hand. You don’t have to be a total denier of Iroquois influence to acknowledge that the meme goes too far when it says ""the U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes."" The traditionally cited sources of inspiration for the drafters, including ancient Greek and prior European thought, played a significant role -- almost certainly a decisive one. ""Even if the Iroquois Confederation was similar to the Constitution, which it was not, and even if some Americans admired aspects of Indian culture, that does not mean the Framers emulated Native American systems,"" said Stewart Jay, a University of Washington law professor and author of Mortal Words: A History of the U.S. Constitution: Volume 1, Origins to World War II. Jay added that more broadly, the democratic nature of the U.S. Constitution was greatly refined and extended by the civil rights amendments adopted after the Civil War, which were hardly conceived with Iroquois principles in mind. Gautham Rao, an American University historian and author of the forthcoming At The Water’s Edge: Commerce, Governance and the Origins of the American State, concurred. ""It is a fairly important idea that a great many societies and networks influenced American constitutional thought, the Iroquois among them,"" Rao said. ""But it is not true that the concept of ‘democracy’ embodied in the U.S. Constitution was directly suggested by the Iroquois."" Our ruling The Facebook meme said ""the U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes."" There’s a grain of truth here: The Iroquois system of government was known to 18th century leaders in the colonies and the new republic, and it shared some similarities with post-revolutionary attempts at governance. However, the meme overstates the consensus among historians. Major elements of the Iroquois system are altogether absent in the U.S. government, including hereditary, clan-based governance, and the meme focuses on Iroquois influences to the exclusion of European precedents that are at least as important, and likely more so. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972EB580>],/factchecks/2014/dec/02/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-constitution-owes-its-notion-democ/
"['Poverty', 'Virginia', 'Jim Webb']","
Jim Webb says poorest U.S. counties are in Appalachia and 90 percent white
","Former Sen. Jim Webb recently announced he’s considering a 2016 presidential run and placed economic fairness high on his agenda. In his video announcement, Webb urged people to travel to inner cities to view the ""poverty, crime and lack of opportunity that still affects so many African Americans."" ""Or travel to the Appalachian mountains, where my own ancestors settled and whose cultural values I still share, and view the poorest counties in America -- who happen to be more than 90 percent white, and who live in the reality that ‘if you’re poor and white, you’re out of sight,’"" Webb said.   Are the poorest counties in the U.S. located in Appalachia and more than 90 percent white? We asked Webb for proof. Amy Hogan, Webb’s daughter and occasional spokesperson, sent us links to the WikiPedia pages for Clay County, Ky. and Leslie County, Ky.  -- two Appalachian counties located in the economically-distressed eastern portion of that state. But Hogan didn’t point to any information that indicates those counties are the poorest in the U.S., although the Clay County WikiPedia page says its per capita income and median household income make it one of the poorest counties in the country. So we set out on our own search for the poorest counties, relying on data by the U.S. Census Bureau measuring the average yearly wealth from 2008-2012. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National noted in a July story, there are several ways to gauge the poorest counties. We compiled Bottom 10 lists based on three criteria. Lowest Median Household Income: Owsley County, Ky., $19,624 Jefferson County, Miss., $20,281 Wolfe County, Ky., $21,168 Brooks County, Texas, $21,445 McCreary County, Ky., $21,758 Hudspeth County, Texas, $22,083 Hancock County, Tenn., $22,205 Jackson County, Ky., $22,213 Clay County, Ky., $22,296 Holmes County, Miss., $22,335 Six of these counties are in Appalachia, according to a listing by the congressionally-funded Appalachian Regional Commission -- the five in Kentucky and Hancock County, Tenn. All six have populations that are more than 90 percent white. The two counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black and the two in Texas are more than 77 percent Hispanic and Latino. Highest percentage of people below the poverty line: Shannon County, S.D., 49.5 percent Clay County, Ga., 47.7 percent East Carroll Parish, La.,  44.9 percent Sioux County, N.D., 44.8 percent Todd County, S.D., 44.6 percent Hudspeth County, Texas, 42.7 percent Holmes County, Miss., 42.6 percent Corson County, S.D., 41.7 percent Wolfe County, Ky., 41.4 percent Humphreys County, Miss., 41.2 percent The only Appalachian county on that list is Wolfe County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hudspeth County, Texas is 78 percent Hispanic and Latino. Of the other eight counties, the ones in North and South Dakota are mostly Native American and the ones in Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi are at least two-thirds black. Lowest per capita income: Wheeler County, Ga., $8,809 Shannon County, S.D., $9,136 Hancock County, Ga., $11,225 Todd County, S.D., $11,417 Starr County, Texas, $11,537 Jefferson County,  Miss., $11,771 Willacy County, Texas, $11,895 Zavala County, Texas, $11,919 McCreary County, Ky., $12,213 Holmes County, Miss., $12,278 There’s one Appalachian locality on this list: McCreary County, Ky., which is 90 percent white.  Hancock County, Ga. is 60 percent white.The counties in  Mississippi are about 85 percent black, the ones in South Dakota are about 90 percent Native American, and those in Texas are at least 87 percent Hispanic and Latino. In sharing these lists, we don’t mean to downplay the very real existence of poverty in Appalachian counties that span 13 states, including Virginia. The Appalachian Regional Commission says there are 311 U.S. counties that are economically distressed based on measurements of unemployment, poverty and per capita market income. About 10 percent of all U.S. counties fall into this category. Ninety of the 420 counties in Appalachia are economically distressed. In other words, 21 percent of the counties in the region fall into the category -- more than twice the national average. Louis Segesvary, a spokesman for the commission, told us the major issue facing these Appalachian communities are their geographic isolation in the mountain range. Our ruling Webb said that the poorest U.S. counties are in Appalachia and ""happen to be more than 90 percent white."" No doubt, some of the poorest are in Appalachia, particularly eastern Kentucky. But looking at several different measures of county poverty results in a more complex picture than Webb suggests.   Measured by median household income, overwhelmingly white Appalachian counties comprise six of the 10 U.S. counties with the lowest median household income. But measured by the poverty rate, only one mostly-white Appalachian county ranks in the 10 poorest. The other nine -- in the South, the Dakotas or Texas -- have larger majorities that are either black, Native American, or Hispanic and Latino. That pattern pretty much holds up when you rank the poorest counties by lowest per capita income. So Webb’s statement is partially accurate, but needs context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809704FFC0>],/factchecks/2014/dec/01/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-poorest-us-counties-are-appalachia-a/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Mario Loyola']","
Mario Loyola says even with cuts, Wisconsin spending and taxing tops Texas
","Some conservatives are pushing Gov. Scott Walker to use his second term to enact much deeper changes in Wisconsin government. ""When Walker got to office, Wisconsin was one of the worst states in the country in which to do business, with one of the highest regulatory and tax burdens,"" Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote in the conservative National Review on Nov. 5, 2014. ""Some estimates now rate it as number 14 for doing business, but don’t be deceived,"" Loyola wrote under the headline, ""Walker’s Win: Why it was the most important GOP win in the country."" He added: ""Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden."" As Walker ramps up exploration of a 2016 presidential campaign, let’s check the claim about spending and taxation in the Badger state. We’ll take the easy part first. Taxes Walker and Republican legislators have approved a variety of tax freezes and cuts. In March 2014, we rated True a Walker claim that he’s delivered $2 billion in tax cuts, mainly by reducing income tax rates and limiting local property tax hikes. But an Oct. 14, 2014 report by the Tax Foundation ranked Wisconsin among the highest 10 states for business taxes on a scale that included corporate, individual income, sales, unemployment insurance and property taxes. Census figures on tax collections lag by two years, so they don’t account for all of Walker’s cuts. But the latest figures showed that property-tax and income-tax collections in Wisconsin run more than 25 percent above the national average, we reported. There’s ample evidence that Wisconsin is among the middle group of states when all sources of revenue are considered. But on taxes alone, the state remains closer to the top. Spending To back up his claim, Loyola, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, pointed us to the state expenditure study done in 2013 by the National Association of State Budget Officers. That report doesn’t compute per-capita spending, but based on a survey of budget officials it shows a total spending figure from state revenues, federal aid and other sources. We did the math and it backs up the claim: In 2013, Wisconsin ""state budget"" spending was about $7,500 per capita compared to about $3,600 in Texas. The study comes from a respected trade group and other organizations refer to its findings. The study cautions, however: ""State governments have specific functional responsibilities that vary among states depending on the role of local governments in providing services. For example, in many states, the funding of elementary and secondary education is considered primarily a local function."" We could not replicate the study’s findings using U.S. Census surveys of state and local government finances. That Census data is preferred by researchers, though one drawback is that reporting of the data lags about two years. One researcher, Dale Knapp with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the census figures are better because the Budget Officers’ study ""includes some things that we generally don’t consider part of the state budget -- the biggest of which is state retirement payments. They also include unemployment payments, lottery prizes, and capital expenditures, which can vary from year to year."" When looking just at state spending (and excluding transfers to local governments), Wisconsin state government spends 27.1% more per capita than Texas in 2011, Knapp found. We also asked the Wisconsin Budget Project to run comparisons. Tamarine Cornelius and Jon Peacock of the group told us that Wisconsin per capita ""direct general expenditures"" were $1,114 above that of Texas, or 15 percent. That was for state and local expenditures. Wisconsin ranked #21 among the states; Texas was #38. So neither group backs up the claim that Wisconsin state government spends 100% more -- twice as much -- as Wisconsin on a per-capita basis. Still, we found that the numbers in the study cited by Loyola were drawn from the annual financial reports published by Texas and Wisconsin. On a topic where various definitions of ""state budget"" are fair game, that gives his claim a reasonable basis. Our rating ""Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden."" Loyola’s on target on taxes, and cites a credible study on spending that is open to challenge but generally defensible. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772CB80>],/factchecks/2014/dec/01/mario-loyola/mario-loyola-says-even-cuts-wisconsin-spending-and/
"['Immigration', 'History', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Kaine says all presidents since Eisenhower have taken executive action on immigration
","U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine was quick to defend President Barack Obama’s recent decision to bypass Congress and unilaterally extend legal status to many illegal immigrants. Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he would delay deportation for immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, he could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which will open for applications in the spring. Kaine, in a news release on the night of the president’s announcement, said Obama’s action was necessary because the House of Representatives has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Kaine, a Democrat, made a fleeting reference to Republican claims that the president’s executive action is unconstitutional. ""Every president since Eisenhower has taken executive action to address immigration issues,"" he said. We checked whether Kaine’s history is correct. Amy Dudley, Kaine’s spokeswoman, sent us an October report from the American Immigration Council that’s being circulated by the White House and its allies to defend the president’s action. Although the council is pro-immigration, a number of experts say the raw data in the report is solid. The council cited 39 instances in which a president used executive authority to defer deportation of certain immigrants. The list starts with an action by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 and does indeed include actions taken by every president since then. Many of the actions were designed to keep families together or to shield illegal immigrants from returning to repressive nations where they might face punishment. The report, however, does not settle a broader question: Were any of the past presidential actions equivalent to what Obama is doing? Let’s take a look: Size. With more than 4 million potential beneficiaries, Obama’s is easily the biggest such action ever taken by a president, at least in raw numbers. The second largest action -- by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 -- forestalled deportations of what the White House then estimated to be 1.5 million illegal immigrants. It was a consequence of a 1986 law that offered legal status to unauthorized immigrants who been living continuously in the U.S. since 1982. The problem was that many spouses and children of eligible immigrants had not been in the country long enough to qualify. Bush’s action was designed to prevent families from being split. When Congress failed to extend the law to ineligible spouses and children, Bush did so on his own. It’s worth noting that Bush’s action and Obama’s affected the same proportion of the undocumented population at the time each was announced, about 40 percent. Other presidential actions that had a potential affect on more than 100,000 people included extended asylum to: Cubans who fled their nation’s communist revolution, offered from 1957 to 1972 by Presidents Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Southeast Asians, most of whom were evacuated at the end of the Vietnam War, offered between 1975 and 1979 by Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Nicaraguans fleeing the Sandinista revolution, offered by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.   Scope. Most of the past presidential actions affected small, specific populations that were experiencing humanitarian or political crises in their home country. For instance: About 15,000 Ethiopians who fled a Marxist regime in their nation were allowed to stay in the U.S. under an order made by Carter in 1977 and extended by Reagan in 1982. 2,227 Kuwaiti evacuees during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 were given four-year extensions of their temporary visas under orders by George H.W. Bush. About 10,000 Liberians fleeing civil war in their nation received extended permission to stay in the U.S. by President Bill Clinton in 1999. President George W. Bush extended it again to 3,600 Liberians in 2009. What undocumented immigrants could receive. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that Obama has not just deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants but gone a step further, allowing them to receive work permits and other related benefits, such as Social Security numbers. There’s at least one precedent for this: the George H.W. Bush action in 1990, which included a pathway to receiving green cards. Some of the other previous actions may have as well, but experts said allowing work permits are the exception rather than the rule. We should note that PolitiFact National recently rated as Half True this statement by Obama: ""The actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kind of actions taken by every single Republican and president for the past half century."" Kaine’s statement is narrower in scope. Our ruling Kaine, in backing Obama, said, ""Every president since Eisenhower has taken executive action to address immigration issues."" Historical records back Kaine. But Kaine’s compact claim omits important context: Obama’s immigration actions can be viewed as much more sweeping than those of his predecessors. So Kaine’s statement is accurate but needs more information.

Gov. Lincoln Chafee says R.I. legislature is strongest in U.S
","It’s a statement often heard in the Ocean State: Rhode Island’s state legislature is the strongest in the nation. And it was recently repeated by Governor Lincoln Chafee as he doled out advice to his successor, Governor-elect Gina Raimondo. Chafee was one of several people who were asked by The Journal what advice they would give to Raimondo as she prepares to take office Jan. 6. Their comments were published Nov. 17 in The Journal’s Political Scene column. ""The only [advice] I would add is we all know ... that Rhode Island constitutionally has a very strong legislature,"" Chafee said. ""That’s a fact, the strongest in the country … And it’s critical, to move your agenda forward, to have relationships ... build those relationships."" Since this claim has been made so often, we decided to check whether Rhode Island’s General Assembly really ranks as the strongest in the nation.

Its author, Margaret R. Ferguson, a political science professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, measured the institutional power of governors in each of the 50 states, based on various factors. Those included  term limits; power to appoint without the involvement of the legislature; control over the budget; veto power; and whether the governor is the same political affiliation that controls the state legislature. Rhode Island placed dead last overall in Ferguson’s list for executive power, while Massachusetts placed at the top. The book also noted that Chafee was the only governor in the country in 2011 to face a legislature controlled by an opposing party. At the time, Chafee was registered as an independent; he changed his affiliation to Democrat in May 2013. We also looked to Rhode Island’s Constitution. It limits governors to two terms and specifies that the governor’s appointments of state officers be subject to Senate advice and consent. Pardons, too, need Senate approval. A veto by the governor can be overridden  by a vote of three-fifths of members present in the House and Senate. One of the key provisions limiting a Rhode Island governor’s power concerns the state budget. Governors are required to submit budgets, but the documents are then subject to legislative cuts and additions, before the General Assembly passes its own version. In 44 other states, governors have so-called line-item veto authority, the power to reject individual items, while keeping the rest of the budget intact. In Rhode Island, the governor can only approve or veto the final budget, which usually prompts the Assembly to override a veto.   When Chafee’s office got back to us, it shared emails sent to the governor’s staff by Peverill Squire, a University of Missouri political science professor who is widely known for his study of state legislatures. The email exchanges were part of the preparations for last year’s 350th anniversary of the Rhode Island Colonial Charter of 1663. ""We can always quibble about rankings, but every accounting puts the power of Rhode Island’s governor at or near the bottom in terms of institutional powers,"" Squire said in an email to Jonathan Stevens, Chafee’s director of special projects. ""Rhode Island’s governor enjoys only moderate appointment powers. The governor also has a weak veto and relatively little ability to influence the budget.  A line-item veto and greater control over appointments would greatly strengthen the governor."" ""On a constitutional power metric, Rhode Island is among the most powerful state legislatures,""  Squire’s wrote. Squire confirmed the statements to PolitiFact Rhode Island via email and cited his book ""The Evolution of American Legislatures, Colonies, Territories and States, 1619-2009,""  as well as an earlier book, ""101 Chambers."" We also heard from Jay S. Goodman, a political science professor at Wheaton College, who noted that the Rhode Island legislature had given up a certain degree of power over the past 20 years, including the appointment of Supreme Court justices, the revolving door limitations on jobs, ethics rules, and the ""separation of powers amendment."" Voters approved the separation  of  powers constitutional amendment in 2004 to curb legislative powers and remove lawmakers from state boards and commissions. ""Those changes certainly strengthened the governorship,"" Goodman said via email. ""But the overwhelming one-party rule coupled with iron discipline still makes the Speaker [of the House] the most powerful single person [in Rhode Island].""   While the strength of the governorship might appear to be inversely proportional to the General Assembly’s power, Maureen Moakley, a political science professor at the University of Rhode Island, observed that a governor’s force of personality also factors in. She used the late Governor Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, as an example. ""He was a very forceful personality. The day he took office he faced a crisis. [The collapse of Rhode Island’s credit unions.] That gave him a lot of leverage through his administration, especially his first administration,"" Moakley said. ""If a governor has the political savvy to be able to take the bully pulpit and turn [it] into a political force, it can go a long way to mitigating the limitations of the office,"" Moakley said. Their initial presentation of their agenda is critical, she said. Our ruling Governor Chafee said the Rhode Island state legislature is ""the strongest in the country… "" Our research found that Rhode Island’s governor has the least institutional power in the nation under the state Constitution. That would make the Rhode Island General Assembly the most powerful, supporting the governor’s point. We rule his claim True.

Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin lags U.S. in wage, job growth, 'Meet the Press' host Chuck Todd says
","Five days after Scott Walker won re-election by a five-point margin, inciting speculation about whether he’ll run for president in 2016, the Republican governor appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""   Several minutes into the Nov. 9, 2014 show, Walker was asked by host Chuck Todd about Wisconsin’s economic record and whether it is ""something that translates nationally."" Walker responded with statistics about how jobs have increased during his first term and unemployment has decreased. (He also went on to make a number of claims that we’ve previously fact-checked). Todd interjected by returning to the national perspective and making a claim of his own. ""But I’ve got to show you,"" he told Walker, as a graphic with figures appeared on the screen, ""compared to the national average, when it comes to wage growth, it's below the national average, Wisconsin is. When it comes to job growth, it's below the national average."" How Wisconsin's economy compares nationally could bear on Walker’s viability as a presidential contender, a prospect he has readily encouraged. So let’s check both sets of figures. Federal statistics The graphic that flashed on the screen cited figures from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report, which compared March 2013 to March 2014. On job growth, the ""Meet the Press"" graphic said Wisconsin’s rate from increased 1 percent, less than the national average of 1.7 percent. The so-called QCEW numbers are considered the most accurate source for jobs numbers, but lag behind real time by six to nine months. The graphic quoted the figures accurately, according to a news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker’s office didn’t dispute this part of Todd’s claim, but said most states had job growth during the period that was at or below the national average. The graphic also accurately cited the average changes in wage growth from March 2013 to March 2014 -- 2.9 percent in Wisconsin, which was behind the national average of 3.8 percent. It doesn’t affect the accuracy of Todd’s statement, but we decided to use the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ database to take a longer view on both job and wage growth to see how Wisconsin and the United States have compared during Walker’s nearly four years as governor. The quarterly time frames don’t match up precisely with Walker’s time in office because, as we noted, there is a lag of several months in reporting the figures. But when compared March 2011 to March 2014, and December 2010 to December 2013, the results were essentially the same: Wisconsin has lagged the national average on job growth, but was slightly higher on wage growth. Our rating Citing statistics for the most recent year, Todd said Wisconsin is below the national average in wage growth and job growth. The latest federal figures, comparing March 2013 to March 2014, show Wisconsin’s job growth rate at 1 percent, below the national average of 1.7 percent, and its wage growth rate at 2.9 percent, behind the national average of 3.8 percent.

Austin-area activist says Austin has fastest-growing taxes of any major U.S. city
","An activist expressed elation after Austin voters rejected a $1 billion rail-and-roads proposition, going on to say the rail part of the plan would have been a financial headache. Jim Skaggs, founder of Citizens Against Rail Taxes, told the Austin Monitor for a Nov. 5, 2014, news story, that the rail costs would have been imposed ""on a community already burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation."" Mark Nathan, a consultant to Let’s Go Austin, which advocated for the proposition, asked us to check Skaggs’ claim. All aboard! To our inquiry, Skaggs said by email he believes he learned of Austin’s dubious status from an Austin Business Journal story. ""I do not have time to research it at the moment,"" Skaggs wrote Nov. 5, 2014. City spokeswoman: Mild rate changes We hunted unsuccessfully for such a story while to our nudge, a city spokeswoman, Melissa Alvarado, said by email the city does not track taxes in other jurisdictions. Alvarado also pointed us to a city chart showing its property tax rate mostly sliding from 1993 through 2009 and increasing or holding steady since:  Source: ""Austin, Texas, Approved Budget 2013-14, Volume 1,"" page 19 (downloaded Nov. 24, 2014) Alvarado continued: ""Please keep in mind the city is only one taxing jurisdiction. There’s also the county, school district, health district and then more, depending on where exactly someone lives."" Also, she said, appraisals ""are a factor for taxes, not just the tax rate."" (She noted the 2015 tax rate is the same as the 2014 rate.) Indeed, surging property values are a driver in local government revenues, the Austin American-Statesman has noted; of late, an April 2014 news story quoted Travis County’s chief appraiser, Marya Crigler, saying taxable residential values — a home’s market value minus property-tax exemptions — were up an average of 8 percent for 2014. Changes in those values, the story said, influence government spending plans. Austin versus other big Texas cities Our search for a breakdown of changes in taxes among U.S. cities led us to analyst James Quintero of the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, who pointed out by email that since 2008, according to a graph in the city of Austin’s proposed fiscal 2015 budget, Austin residents have experienced a bigger burst in their share of income paid in city property taxes than residents of Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio or Houston. Specifically, Quintero said, the percentage of median family income spent on property tax bills for median-value homes in the Austin area represented a little less than 1.1 percent in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2014, that figure had increased to just under 1.5 percent, representing an increase of 0.4 percent. The other big Texas cities demonstrated smaller increases over the period. National comparisons Then again, Skaggs said Austin’s tax increases were No. 1 among major cities nationally. We turned to Beverly Kerr, lead researcher for the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, who sifted information compiled by the Cambridge, Mass.-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. The institute, which focuses on property valuation and taxation policy, urban planning and development, land economics and property rights, annually issues a 50-state property-tax comparison study. Kerr, drawing from the latest study, issued in March 2014 by the center and the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, emailed us charts indicating numerous cities had significant property tax hikes in recent years and also that by one gauge, Austin ranked close to No. 1 nationally in its increases compared with the most-populous cities. One institute analysis looked at how much revenue per resident different cities have taken in. Our takeaways: From 2006 to 2011, per-person property tax revenue collected in Austin by all local government units (including school districts, the city and the county) decreased 4 percent, as measured in constant 2011 dollars. Then again, per-person revenue from city property taxes alone went up 6 percent; Austin ranked 35th among the 50 largest cities for that rate of increase. Higher rates of increase were recorded by cities including Philadelphia, Houston, Dallas, New York, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and Chicago, which had a 60 percent spike in per-person property tax revenue. Over a longer span, 2001 to 2011, Austin ranked 27th nationally for its 26 percent increase in per-person revenue from city property taxes. The Texas capital was outpaced in percentage growth by cities including San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, New York and Los Angeles. Austin experienced a 2 percent increase in per-person revenue from all taxes from 2006 to 2011, ranking 25th in this way. Its increase trailed hikes occurring in the more populous cities of San Jose, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Another institute breakdown highlighted by Kerr shows Austin ranking among cities with the greatest increases in taxes on a median-valued home. Our snapshots: From 2009 to 2013, Austin’s effective tax rate on a median-priced home increased from 1.93 percent to 2.22 percent; that bump amounted to the 11th-greatest increase (0.29 points) in the 50 biggest cities. As of that year, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Chicago were the cities more populous than Austin that ranked higher by this indicator. In this instance, the effective rate is not the rate by which a government unit can generate the revenue it raised the year before. Rather, the study defines the effective rate as the total tax on a median-priced home divided by its total value, which takes into account variations in assessment rates and value exemptions across localities. While Austin’s effective tax rate in 2013 was ahead of its rate in 2009, it was less than the 2.44 percent rate of 2005. In 2013, property taxes on a median-value Austin home ran $1,049 ahead of those taxes on such a home in 2005, up nearly 26 percent. That percentage increase placed Austin 10th nationally in this way behind Portland, San Jose, Denver, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Albuquerque, Columbus and Cleveland -- and only San Jose, Portland and Philadelphia had greater dollar increases than Austin. Among, say, the 15 largest cities as of that time, Austin ranked third behind San Jose and Philadelphia for the percent change in net tax 2005-2013. Over a shorter period, 2009-2013, Phoenix, San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego, New York and Jacksonville experienced greater increases in net property tax on a median-value home. (Dallas, Chicago, San Antonio, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Houston and Indianapolis had smaller increases.) Our ruling Skaggs said Austin has the fastest-growing tax increases of any major U.S. city. Among the nation’s largest cities, Austin appears to have had the third-fastest growth in its property-tax bite on a median-valued home from 2005 to 2013. It seems reasonable to speculate local taxpayers feel the pinch. However, Skaggs didn’t provide nor did we find a sign of Austin ranking first in tax growth among the country’s major cities. We rate the statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Mayor-elect Jorge Elorza says Providence has same median income as Mississippi
","In the days following the Nov. 4, 2014 election, Providence Mayor-elect Jorge Elorza reflected on his priorities ahead in interviews with various media outlets. He shared one such reflection Nov. 9, with reporter Bill Rappleye on WJAR-Channel 10’s ""News Conference,"" saying his top priority is seeking more economic justice in Providence. To make his point, he compared the city to what he referred to as the nation’s poorest state. ""Our median income here in Providence is the same as the median income in Mississippi,"" he said. Elorza noted that  Providence ""is a very poor city"" that lacks an adequate tax base to provide the services people want and need. We wondered whether the mayor-elect got his facts right.. We asked Elorza spokeswoman Marisa O’Gara where Elorza got his information. While waiting for her response, we plumbed U.S. Census Bureau data to see what we could find on our own. There, we learned that that the 2008-2012 American Community Survey five-year estimates placed the median household income in Providence at $38,243 and the median household income in Mississippi slightly higher, at $38,882. We also reached out to Rhode Island Kids Count and its Mississippi counterpart. The two nonprofit research groups confirmed the figures. But researchers at both agencies urged us to further differentiate between median household income and median family income. (Elorza didn’t say whether he was talking about household or family income.) The Census Bureau defines family as a group of two or more people who are related. A household, meanwhile, is defined as all the people occupying a housing unit, including family members as well as those who are unrelated. The same  American Community Survey reported that the median family income in Providence was $43,378.  In Mississippi, it was substantially higher,  at $48,300. We also asked the state Department of Labor and Training to weigh in. Spokesman Michael Healey provided figures from its labor market information division based on Census data for 2010 through 2013. Those figures also showed the median family income in Mississippi eclipsing that in Providence for each given year. In 2013, for example, the median family income in Mississippi was $47,615, compared to $45,122 in Providence. Kids Count researchers cautioned that the five-year estimates were more reliable. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that the median income in Providence ""is the same as the median income in Mississippi."" He made the comparison to illustrate how poor the capital city really is. In fact, Providence’s median income, both for households and for families, is actually lower than Mississippi’s, not equal to it. While Elorza’s comparison is slightly off, it supports his overall point. We rule his claim Mostly True.

Giuliani: Black and white people who commit murder are convicted at the same rate
","In the run-up to a grand jury’s decision not to indict Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of African-American teenager Michael Brown, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani stirred controversy with a number of comments about race, crime and law enforcement. Following his appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press on Nov. 23, 2014, Giuliani faced backlash for questioning why the same Americans protesting Brown's fatal shooting are not voicing similar outrage about black-on-black crime. The following day -- hours before the grand jury decision was announced -- Giuliani stood by his argument during an appearance on Fox and Friends. He reiterated that the vast majority of black murder victims are killed by other black people, not by white police officers. (We rated this Mostly True, noting that the same pattern of intraracial homicide holds for for all races, not just for African-Americans.) Giuliani also sought to counter the perception that white people don’t go to jail for killing black people. ""And the idea that whites do not go to jail for killing blacks,"" he said. ""First of all, only about 3 percent of whites kill blacks. They go to jail at approximately the same percentage as blacks go to jail. The conviction rate is almost exactly the same. The difference is, it’s a very rare exception when a white kills a black."" His claim about even conviction rates surprised us, given the widespread perception that black Americans are disadvantaged in the criminal justice system. So we decided to take a closer look at Giuliani’s claim that ""the conviction rate is almost exactly the same"" for whites and blacks who commit murder. Sentencing statistics Giuliani’s comment in whole is fragmented and difficult to parse, and he didn’t get back to us with further explanation. That being said, we scoured available data that might shed light on his claim about conviction rates. We couldn’t find a single report detailing the nationwide percentage of people who are charged with homicide and are ultimately convicted -- let alone a racial breakdown for that question. The most recent and comprehensive report we could find comes from the the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. The report, published in 2009, looks at 2006 data on felony sentences in state courts, where the vast majority of murder cases are tried. It found that of all people convicted of murder or non-negligent manslaughter in 2006, 46 percent were white, and 51 percent were black. But this is not too helpful for checking Giuliani’s claim. For starters, this data does not separate out people who identify as Hispanic or Latino. And this finding means that African-Americans account for a grossly disproportionate percentage of murder convictions, since whites and Hispanics currently make up about 80 percent of the nation’s population, compared to just 13 percent for blacks. That undercuts Giuliani’s underlying premise of minimizing racial disparities in jurisprudence. We also found a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report that looked at felony defendants -- that is, people who are charged but not yet convicted -- in the 75 largest counties in the United States in 2009. That report showed that African-Americans also make up a disproportionate number of murder defendants. Of all people charged with murder, 12 percent were white, 30 percent were Hispanic, and 57 percent were black. Either way, these statistics don’t back up Giuliani’s claim, because they do not show the likelihood that someone of either race will be convicted if they are charged with murder. We also reached out to criminal justice experts, and they weren’t familiar with a statistic that matched the specific claim. The big picture It’s important to remember a few bits of context. The conviction rate for homicide represents only a sliver of criminal justice cases and are not necessarily representative of the deep disparity between black and white defendants. For example, the Justice Department has estimated that one in three black males will go to prison at some point in their lifetime, compared to 1 in 17 for a white male. And out of all 1.5 million sentenced prisoners in the United States in 2013, black people made up the largest racial demographic, at about 36 percent -- well above their share of the population as a whole. ""I do not know why (Giuliani) would limit his comments to murder,"" said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""When all offenses are taken into consideration, especially drug crimes, the black incarceration rate is substantially higher than that of whites."" Nearly half of all people charged with felonies in 2009 were non-Hispanic blacks. They made up more than half of all people charged with murder, robbery, drug trafficking and weapons-related offenses. And Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a researcher at the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, pointed us to several additional studies that show racial disparities, such as a 1998 study that found that offenders who are young, black, and male are subject to the harshest sentences, after controlling for factors such as the nature of the crime. Our ruling Giuliani said, ""the conviction rate is almost exactly the same"" for whites and blacks who commit murder. We couldn't find any statistical evidence to support Giuliani’s claim, and experts said they weren't aware of any, either. We found some related data, but that data only serves to highlight some of the racial disproportion in the justice system. And when you take a step back, Giuliani’s comment -- even if supported by statistical evidence -- would amount to cherry-picking data to shed the most benign light on racial disparities of the American justice system. Jurisprudence in general does not reflect this pattern. Without statistical data to back up his claim, we rate it False. Update, Nov. 26, 2014, 2:00 p.m.: Soon after we published this item, the Bureau of Justice Statistics officially confirmed to PolitiFact that they do not have nationally representative data on conviction rates by race.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097320580>],/factchecks/2014/nov/26/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-black-and-white-people-charged-murder-are/

Giuliani: 93 percent of black murders committed by blacks
","This is a case where a statistic is accurate, but it doesn't address key elements in the bigger picture. The turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., has spurred a lot of talk about what has gone wrong in America. Some say it reveals core problems in the criminal justice system and policing. Others believe it points to problems in the black community itself. One vocal spokesman for the second approach is former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani. When NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd brought up the number of cities where the police departments are mainly white while the communities they serve are mainly minority (as in Ferguson), Giuliani aimed to take the conversation in a different direction. ""I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,"" Giuliani said in his Nov. 23, 2014, appearance on the show. His point was that the death of a black teenager at the hands of a white cop was ""the exception,"" and if the country is concerned about black homicides, then it would do better to focus on African Americans. We will set the larger questions aside and deal simply with Giuliani’s statistic about black homicides. He accurately recites a federal statistic, but he would almost equally be right if he were talking about white homicides at the hands of other whites. On the other hand, blacks do suffer from higher murder rates than whites. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 93 percent of black homicides were indeed committed by other blacks between 1980 and 2008. In 2012, the most recent data posted on the web, the figure was 91 percent. This overlooks many deaths because it’s only possible to gather this information when a crime leads to a conviction and some cases are never solved. It’s important to note that whites were almost equally likely to be killed by other whites. According to government data, 84 percent of white homicides were committed by whites. This was true between 1980 and 2008 and in 2012. The last time we looked at this topic, we asked Professor David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, why this might be. ""Homicides overwhelmingly happen among people who know each other,"" Kennedy said. ""There are relatively few absolutely straight-up stranger homicides. Homicide is a phenomenon of social networks. ... Most peoples’ relationships are primarily with someone of their own race or ethnicity. As long as anybody has studied homicide, this has been the pattern."" So Giuliani’s point about black-on-black homicide doesn’t carry us very far in exploring murder in America. The percentage is higher for blacks than for whites, but only by seven to nine percentage points, depending on the time period you use. We did find that young black men, ages 14 to 24, suffer disproportionately from murder. While the numbers have been falling since the mid-1990s, in 2008 about 16 percent of homicide victims were young and black. As a group, they represented just 1 percent of the population. Young white men were also disproportionately at risk, but the situation was not quite as dire. They comprised about 6 percent of the population and 10 percent of murder victims. On the offender side, young black men accounted for 27 percent of everyone who committed murder in 2008. Young white men accounted for 16 percent. Our ruling Giuliani said that 93 percent of blacks are murdered by blacks. That’s in line with federal statistics. However, it actually tells us little about violence in black communities. The percentage of whites killed by whites is only about seven percentage points lower. The strong historical trend is that in a society with persistent pockets of segregation, most homicide occurs within each ethnic group. Giuliani’s claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FE85C0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/25/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-93-black-murders-committed-blacks/

Obama says illegal border crossing attempts are at lowest point since 1970s
","During his speech to the nation about his executive action on immigration, President Barack Obama talked up his efforts to secure the border. Obama argued that those efforts paid off as the numbers of illegal border crossings are the lowest they have been in decades. ""When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history,"" Obama said Nov. 20. Then Obama reeled off a few statistics, including this one: ""Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts."" We decided to check if those are indeed the facts regarding the number of illegal crossings. Number of illegal immigrants apprehended We can’t know for certain how many illegal immigrants have tried to cross the border. We can only examine data that show how many have been apprehended or managed to settle here. As PunditFact explained earlier this year, there is more than one way to measure the pressure at the border. You can look at total apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol, or you can look at changes in the estimates of the undocumented population in the country. Neither is perfect, but the first option of using apprehension numbers has the advantage of at least being based on actual reports of people detained by federal agents rather than surveys by the Census Bureau. Also, we can’t use the Census to evaluate Obama’s comparison to 1970 because it wasn’t until the 1980s that the Census began to track the number of undocumented immigrants. Another potential source is Homeland Security data, which combines apprehensions at the border and interior. Because Obama’s statement was specifically about the border, we will start by looking at Border Patrol data. The White House also directed us to these statistics. Year Border apprehensions 1970 231,116 1971 302,517 1972 396,495 1973 498,123 1974 634,777 1975 596,796 1976 696,039 1977 812,541 1978 862,837 1979 888,729 Source: U.S. Border Patrol As you can see in the chart, the number of annual apprehensions was 231,116 in 1970 and climbed throughout the decade, ending at just shy of 900,000 apprehensions in 1979. From 1983 through 2006, the number of border apprehensions exceeded 1 million nearly every year. The numbers began to dip before Obama’s first term. In 2007, the Border Patrol apprehended 876,704 people. That figure dropped over the next four years, but there was an uptick starting in 2012, with border apprehensions hitting 420,789 in 2013. 2009 556,041 2010 463,382 2011 340,252 2012 364,768 2013 420,789 Source: U.S. Border Patrol The AP reported that the number rose to 486,651 in 2014, but a Border Patrol spokesman could not confirm that number because the agency has not yet released its number for the 2013-14 fiscal year. It’s possible that the number for 2014 will be higher than 2013, but we’re going to hold Obama to the confirmed 2013 figure for now. By that measure, the number of people trying to cross the border is the lowest it has been since part of the 1970s. The last time it was lower than the apprehensions in 2013 was 1972. The numbers don’t tell the full story There are some caveats about the data, particularly comparing more recent years to the 1970s. In the 1970s, there were far fewer Border Patrol agents and no barriers, such as fences, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. That led to a lot of people crossing or attempting to cross multiple times. ""Agents frequently reported catching the same people several times each shift,"" she said. ""People would cross illegally just to go shopping and return home. Some would work for brief periods and come home for awhile and then go back."" Why is that important? It means we have no idea, when using 1970s numbers, how many different people were apprehended, as some could have been apprehended multiple times. ""So, 10 apprehensions might mean 10 people entering once or 1 person apprehended 10 times,"" Georgetown professor Susan Martin told PolitiFact. With the addition of fencing and more agents in more recent years, people use smugglers to cross the border, which is more expensive and results in less traffic. In the 1990s, the strategy changed from trying to apprehend as many people as possible to trying to deter them from entering in the first place, Martin said. Federal officials used sensors, cameras and other technology to identify recidivists and get a better sense of the actual numbers. Vaughan argued that the border situation is so different now from the 1970s that ""the comparison is pointless."" However, some of the professors we interviewed said we can still draw comparisons over time despite shortcomings about the data or changes in border strategy. In the 1970s, the country did not have have criminal penalties for those who were deported and then re-entered illegally, Cornell University law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr told PolitiFact. However, it is hard to know whether those penalties have a deterrent effect. ""No historical comparison is perfect, in immigration or elsewhere,"" Yale-Loehr said. ""In short, it is hard to compare apprehension statistics between one year and another to measure their effectiveness. In the absence of any other yardstick, however, I can’t fault a president for trying."" University of Virginia law Professor David Martin said cross-decade comparisons are okay even though they are imprecise. ""I feel pretty confident that the level of crossings is lower now than at any time since the 1970s – a great deal more of the border is under tighter surveillance and control, owing to a far larger Border Patrol, changed control strategies, and deployment of all sorts of technology,"" he told PolitiFact. Another thing to note is that enforcement isn’t the only factor in the number of apprehensions each year. In recent years, illegal immigration has declined from Mexico in part due to improved job prospects there and the recession here. Meanwhile, apprehensions of immigrants from countries other than Mexico are on the rise. ""Moreover, the rate of apprehensions can’t be measured just by the number of Border Patrol agents at the border,"" Martin said. ""Sometimes economic factors, such as the Great Recession of 2009, may play a large role in a decline in apprehensions."" Our ruling Obama said, ""Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is the lowest it has been since the 1970s."" We cannot directly check Obama's literal claim -- which would include the number of people who failed and succeeeded to cross the border -- because those statistics are not maintained by the federal government.  Instead, we turned to the data that most closely aligned with what he was trying to say. Using Border Patrol data, we found Obama is correct on the sheer numbers for the number of people caught trying to cross the border. In 2013, about 420,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at the border. The last time it was lower than that was 1972. After that year, apprehensions steadily rose throughout the 1970s, ending at just shy of 900,000 in 1979. Experts noted, however, that Obama is creating an imperfect comparison because the border situation was far different in 1970 than it is in more recent years. In the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple attempts or excursions illegally across the border. On a final note, it's problematic for Obama to assume credit for the low numbers, as the trend started before he took office and the flows of immigrants across the border tends to correlate with economic conditions at least partially outside of the president's control. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFEF940>],/factchecks/2014/nov/25/barack-obama/obama-says-illegal-border-crossings-lowest-it-has-/

Democratic consultant says Texas had nation's 'worst voter participation' in November 2014
","A Democratic strategist partly attributed his party’s worse-than-expected loss in the Texas governor’s race to low voter turnout. Jason Stanford, a political consultant, researcher and former gubernatorial campaign manager, said in a commentary in the Nov. 17, 2014, Austin American-Statesman that millions of Texans had ""slept through the election."" In fact, Stanford declared, ""Texas had the worst voter participation in the country."" The Lone Star State has a reputation for light voter interest, but did it sport the worst turnout in the nation in 2014? It very likely may have, we discovered, but it’s too early to know for sure. Weak track record In recent years, the percentage of Texans turning out to vote in statewide elections was among the lowest in the country. According to a 2013 Texas Civic Health Index report by the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas, Texas ranked last in voter turnout in the 2010 election. Citing U.S. Census Bureau information based on voter surveys every even-numbered year, the report said Texas ranked 48th in turnout in 2012, 47th in 2008 and 49th in 2006. The 2014 survey results are yet to be reported. It’s not just Texas that’s experienced low voter turnout. According to a Nov. 11, 2014, editorial in the New York Times, the November 2014 election saw the smallest share of eligible-to-vote Americans turn out to vote--36.3 percent--since the mid-term election year of 1942. Stanford’s backup Stanford, asked where his numbers came from, directed us to a Nov. 6, 2014, news blog post by the Dallas Observer, an alternative news weekly. Its story, titled ""Texas Had the Worst Voter Turnout in the Country, and the Rain in Dallas Didn’t Help,"" posted data from the Florida-based United States Elections Project, a one-man operation from University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald that’s reported voter turnout by state since 2000. According to the Elections Project, Texas sustained the nation’s second-lowest turnout rate of 28.5 percent, trailing only Indiana, which landed at 28 percent. In contrast, numbers from the Texas Secretary of State suggest nearly 34 percent turnout in Texas. What explains the difference? McDonald’s project looks at the share of voters eligible to vote, registered or not, as its base, while the state presents the share of registered voters (a smaller group) as its base. By phone, McDonald said many states base announced turnout percentages on the registered voter population because that number is easily accessible and doesn’t require calculations based on estimates by the Census Bureau. On the Elections Project website, McDonald calls turnout rates for registered voters alone ""uninformative for comparison purposes"" because voter registration practices vary across states (North Dakota, for instance, requires no voter registration). Also, McDonald writes, voter registration rolls include double entries because the records don’t always catch up to voters changing residences and they often list voters who have left the state. Many Americans could vote but don’t bother to register. Al Jazeera America reported on Nov. 5, 2014, that 70 million Americans who qualified to vote did not register for the 2014 election and, hence, were excluded from voter turnout calculations based on the share of registered voters who cast ballots. For his analysis of each state, McDonald said, he reached his turnout estimates by considering the number of votes cast in the statewide race generating the highest participation -- which in Texas was the governor’s race (also the race used by the Texas Secretary of State to calculate turnout, office spokeswoman Alicia Pierce told us by phone). By phone, Observer reporter Stephen Young told us he declared Texas’ voter turnout the nation’s lowest for the year because that appears to hold for the 36 states that had gubernatorial elections, which he said draw more voters in non-presidential election years than balloting in states lacking those marquee races. Indiana (the state with lower turnout than Texas) was among the 14 states lacking a vote for governor. Calculating voter turnout Our research showed there is no universally agreed-upon method of calculating voter turnout. Some groups use a state’s voting-age population to determine turnout; others, like the Elections Project and the Census Bureau, start from adults eligible to vote by estimating and subtracting adults legally ineligible to vote including felons and non-citizens. Others, like many state governments, calculate the portion of registered voters who voted in a given race. In a 2012 survey, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent clearinghouse of elections information, asked each state to report its voting statistics. The EAC compiled the responses and ranked Texas 47th in turnout among voting-age citizens (ahead of West Virginia, Hawaii, New Mexico and Mississippi). A wrinkle to consider when talking turnout is that voters participate in voting for some offices more than others. Of Texas’ 14,025,441 registered voters as of November 2014, about 4.7 million voters participated in the gubernatorial election while about 4.6 million made a choice in the race for U.S. senator (even though it topped the ballot); down the ballot, a little more than 3.7 million votes were cast for one of the Texas Supreme Court seats, according to unofficial results. Historically, the Texas Secretary of State reports the turnout of registered voters and turnout of the voting-age population, though the state has yet to calculate the latter figure for the 2014 elections. The Strauss Institute report was based on census bureau data gathered by a phone survey in which residents were asked questions to determine if they were eligible to vote, then were asked if they’d voted. The report said: ""While other ways of measuring voting rates are available, each calculates the ‘eligible’ population—the denominator in the fraction—differently."" We asked McDonald precisely how he whittles Census Bureau population estimates down to the estimated number of adults eligible to vote in each state and then how he quickly establishes turnout percentages. By phone, McDonald said: -He begins with the voting-age population and subtracts population estimates for demographics that are ineligible to vote, like felons and non-citizens. -He calculates each state’s number of eligible voters in the months before an election, then uses vote counts reported by the Associated Press after election night and historical data from past elections to call voter turnout before all votes are counted. -He cautions that no turnout numbers will be official until states report total ballots cast to the Election Assistance Commission--probably by late 2015--so for now, the Texas numbers are an estimate. Independent confirmation We sought to compare the Elections Project estimates of voter turnout with other analyses, nearly coming up empty. Officials with groups we queried--the Pew Research Center, the Voter Participation Project, the Election Assistance Commission and the Texas Tribune--said they relied on the project’s figures. By phone, Curtis Gans, who has led the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University in Washington, D.C, since at least 1976, told us preliminary data collected by the center for 2014 didn’t conclusively show Texas, which hasn’t yet finished counting ballots, would have the nation’s worst voter turnout. ""Texas has been near the bottom for many years, but I’m not sure if it’s at the bottom this year,"" Gans said. ""In any case, it will be near the bottom."" He said the center would release its voter turnout data within weeks. He said other states with historically low turnout, like New York and California, also haven’t finished counting ballots. As of Nov. 7, 2014, three days after the elections, the Elections Project said, 31.8 percent of California’s 24,408,163 eligible-to-vote citizens had turned out for the 2014 election, while 28.8 percent of New York’s 13,563,172 had voted. Our ruling  Stanford said that in November 2014, ""Texas had the worst voter participation in the country."" According to the respected Elections Project, Texas appears to have had the lowest voter participation among states with a governor’s race. Among all states, though, Indiana appears to have had lower turnout--and besides, voting statistics aren’t final. We rate Stanford’s statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Lawyer in Ferguson case: 99% of the time police not charged in death of young person of color
","Even before the grand jury in Ferguson, Mo., announced its decision in the police shooting death of teenager Michael Brown, the lead lawyer for the Brown family challenged the grand jury process. Attorney Benjamin Crump said the ground rules were skewed in favor of police officer Darren Wilson. All one needed for proof, Crump said, was to look at the statistics. ""The process is completely unfair,"" Crump said on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 23, 2014. ""Ninety-nine percent of the time police officers aren't charged when they kill young people of color."" We called Crump’s office to learn what statistics he relied on to back up his claim about 99 percent of police killings of minority youth. We did not hear back. We contacted a number of criminologists and other experts in fatalities at the hands of law enforcement officials. All of them told PunditFact that the data don’t exist to prove Crump right or wrong. At the same time, they said his number probably has a measure of accuracy, even if it doesn’t show what he thinks it does in terms of racial bias. Criminologist Candace McCoy at City University of New York said a simple fact dominates any assessment of Crump’s statement. ""It is very rare for an officer to get indicted at all, no matter what the race of a victim,"" McCoy said. How rare is hard to pin down Ideally, we would know the number of police officers indicted for homicide of a person of color and the total number of people killed by police. We lack accurate figures for both. The closest we can get to the number of officers charged with homicide comes from Philip Stinson, a criminal justice researcher at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Stinson looked at records from 2005 to 2011 and found that in those years, there were a total of 81 cases where at least one officer was charged with murder, nonnegligent manslaughter or negligent manslaughter. It’s important to note that this is a count of cases, not officers. You could imagine that a single death might involve more than one person from a law enforcement agency. While we could take 81 as a minimum figure, Stinson also told PunditFact he has no information on the race of the person who died. ""I understand his (Crump’s) sentiment, and perhaps that is true historically,"" Stinson said. ""But I don’t think there is any empirical research that would support his summary statistic of 99 percent."" But let’s just say we took the 81 figure and compared it to the total number of deaths at the hands of law enforcement. That would give us some idea of how often an officer is charged when they kill someone. Unfortunately, we hit another data problem. There are two sources, the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and both undercount the number of people killed by police. There are many reasons. Top among them: Some reporting is voluntary, and often the person recording the death doesn’t even know whether an officer was involved. The consensus among experts is that the numbers are too low, but it’s unclear by how much. With that in mind, we find that the FBI’s Supplemental Homicide Reports show 2,695 justifiable homicides by law enforcement from 2005 to 2011. By definition, those are deaths in which officers followed the rules in using lethal force. If we add to that the 81 deaths to approximate the deaths that were not justified, we get 2,776. That would mean that officers are charged in about 3 percent of the cases when someone is killed. We went through a similar process with the CDC’s National Vital Statistics data and wound up with pretty much the same result. So when Crump said 99 percent of the time police are not charged in the killing of a person of color, he might have been in the ballpark. To flip his approach, he would be saying police are charged 1 percent of the time, while the flawed numbers we have say 3 percent -- regardless of race -- might be closer to the truth. But criminologist David Klinger at the University of Missouri-St. Louis said Crump’s claim about race is misleading. ""Because it doesn’t include the all-important question, ‘Compared to what?’ "" Klinger said. ""If cops were routinely indicted in the wake of shooting old white guys, and they were only rarely getting indicted for shooting young people of color, he would be making a valuable point. That, however, is not that case."" Criminologist Lorie Fridell at the University of South Florida echoes the thoughts of her peers. ""Since officers are rarely charged in deadly force situations, that statistic, although not documented, is probably not too far off and would probably hold true for non-minority victims of police deadly force as well,"" Fridell said. The question of how often law enforcement officers are charged in the death of a young person of color is distinct from the debate over whether police are more likely to kill minorities than whites. There is a body of evidence that says blacks are more likely to be victims of lethal force than whites, but other analyses find a more complicated set of connections involving race, income, serious crime and policing strategies that make violent encounters between blacks and police more likely. Our ruling Crump said 99 percent of the time police officers aren’t charged when they kill a young person of color. With the caveat that police officers are rarely charged at all, the limited data and the opinions of criminologists back up Crump’s claim. But there is no hard data for either the number of police officers indicted for homicide of a person of color or for the total number of people killed by police, so we cannot say with certainty whether this happens 99 percent of the time. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975BB740>],/factchecks/2014/nov/25/benjamin-crump/lawyer-ferguson-case-99-time-police-not-charged-de/

Turkeys today are more than twice as fat as they were in the 1930s, Mother Jones says
","On one of our regular cruises of political websites, we came across this from Mother Jones: ""Turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds,"" the liberal magazine stated on its Facebook page. ""In the ‘30s, they weighed 13.2 pounds."" The claim was posted Nov. 24, 2014, three days before Thanksgiving. It made our mouths water and, well, whet our appetite for some holiday fact-checking. The Facebook post linked to an article posted the same day on Mother Jones’ website. The article, in turn, linked to a November 2013 report from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economics & Statistics Administration. That report contained the figures Mother Jones cited, saying turkeys have more than doubled in weight -- from an average of 13.2 pounds in 1929 to 29.8 pounds in 2012. We found that, if anything, Mother Jones might be light on its claim. The average weight for 2013 is actually a half-pound higher, at 30.3 pounds, according to Michael Klamm, an agricultural statistician at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, the 2012 figure cited by Mother Jones is considered final, whereas the 2013 figure is still subject to revision, Klamm told us. So, how’d turkeys get so fat? Mother Jones reported that the size of turkeys has grown, particularly since the 1950s, as the nation’s poultry operations began to breed turkeys for size in order to meet Americans’ demand for meat. In government-speak, the Department of Commerce said the increase ""is a result of large increases in turkey industry productivity due to technological innovations in turkey breeding and specialization in turkey raising methods."" Among the key factors: artificial insemination. ""The modern bird is too heavy and misshapen to procreate the old-fashioned way,"" The Atlantic magazine reported the day before Thanksgiving 2013. ""And A.I. means that good genetic material can be easily spread around."" But it’s almost Thanksgiving Day. Is turkey OK to eat? ""If you are looking for a lean cut of meat, turkey is hard to beat,"" according to Harvard Medical School. ""A 3-ounce serving of skinless white meat contains 26 grams of protein, barely 2 grams of fat, and under 1 gram of saturated fat,"" and ""it’s healthy on the heart."" Phew. Now don’t call us late for dinner. Our rating Mother Jones magazine said: ""Turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds. In the ‘30s, they weighed 13.2 pounds."" Those, in fact, are the latest-available federal figures. ""Today"" is actually a reference to 2012, but the preliminary figure for 2013 is even higher, at 30.3 pounds. We rate the statement True.

Rachel Maddow says Obama's proposed immigration action on 'same scale' as one by George H.W. Bush
","Editor’s note: After reviewing new information about differing estimates of the scale of President George H.W. Bush’s 1990 immigration order, we have changed the rating of this fact-check from True to Mostly True. Our original fact-check is archived here. President Barack Obama’s unilateral move to lift the risk of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants has so incensed rank-and-file Republicans, their leaders are actively tamping down potential cries for impeachment. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said that sort of outrage is ""bogus,"" and she went to the history of the immigration debate to prove it. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush, a Republican, by executive action forestalled deportations for about 1.5 million illegal immigrants -- or, at least, that was a widely reported estimate at the time of the announcement. Maddow said that represented about 40 percent of the total undocumented population in 1990. ""The executive action that president Obama is contemplating would also apply to about 40 percent of the undocumented population in this country,"" Maddow said on Nov. 17, 2014. ""So it’s roughly on the same scale."" (The quotation used in our initial fact-check had slightly different wording but the same meaning.) We know there’s a vigorous debate about whether the current move has the same legal standing as the executive actions taken by Bush, and by President Ronald Reagan, for that matter. Our focus here is simply on the numbers that shaped the debate at the time the two policies were announced. (A hat tip here to Vox for their work on this.) The count for Obama According to reports at the time Maddow made her claim, Obama planned to announce plans to stop deporting the parents of children who are U.S. citizens. We saw a couple of estimates of how many people that would affect. The Pew Research Center said about 3.5 million. The New York Times put the figure at 4 million. Citing White House sources, the New York Times said an additional 1 million people would be touched by other facets of the new policy, giving a total of 5 million. That’s very close to the Migration Policy Institute’s estimate of 5.2 million. Since there are about 11.4 million undocumented immigrants, Obama’s order was expected to change the rules for between 30 and 40 percent of total population. Again, this is based on reports. But that’s all that Maddow would have had to go on when she made her comments. The count for Bush For an apples-to-apples comparison, we wanted to look at the number of immigrants who were expected to benefit from Bush’s action. Bush’s order aimed to ease a predicament created by a 1986 immigration reform law. The law took people who had been in the country for at least five years and put them on a path to legal status. But it did nothing for parents, children or spouses who didn’t qualify, even if someone else in the immediate family did. That created a scenario where families could be split up. When Congress failed to change the law, Bush did it on his own in 1990 under the banner of ""family fairness."" A few days after this fact-check initially appeared, the Washington Post Fact Checker cast doubt on the 1.5 million figure, to the claim by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest that Bush ""expanded the family fairness program to cover more than 1.5 million unauthorized spouses and children. This represented about 40 percent of the undocumented population at the time."" (See the Fact Checker’s article here.) To recap what the Fact Checker reported, on the day of the policy announcement Feb. 1, 1990, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said it could affect as many as 100,000 people. The article then noted how the estimate grew over the ensuing weeks. This suggested the 1.5 million figure was wildly inflated. However, on Feb. 21, 1990, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Gene McNary testified before a House committee that the number could reach and even exceed 1.5 million Here’s the exchange between McNary and then-Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn. Morrison: Mr. McNary, you used the 1.5 million IRCA relatives who are undocumented but who would be covered by your family fairness policy. Do I have that number right? McNary: Yes Morrison: Under your recent administrative order, these people essentially are here to stay, with work and travel privileges. Isn’t that right? McNary: We think you are right as to the 1.5 million being here. There’s an estimate of another 1.5 million that would come as a result of this change in definition. The New York Times, quoting McNary, reported that the move would affect about 1.5 million people. In 1990, there were about 3.5 million undocumented immigrants. By these numbers, being bruited about in the popular press, Bush’s policy would potentially touch the lives of about 40 percent of the total. It’s important to note that the Fact Checker was looking at a different question than we were. The Fact Checker looked solely at the numbers for Bush, not a comparison of scale between Bush and Obama. What we see when we look at these reported estimates is a range, from 100,000 to 1.5 million. Marc Rosenblum is deputy director for immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute. Rosenblum said that while there was some confusion about the projected impact, the larger figure carried a great deal of weight. ""Administration officials at the time testified that the 1.5 million number was in play at the time the family fairness policy was implemented,"" Rosenblum said. He noted that the actual number never reached that level because Congress later changed the law, which made it unnecessary for people to apply for special treatment. By the way, Reagan also used executive action to address the same problem, but it wasn’t as far-reaching as Bush’s. To be clear, Obama’s proposal would affect more people overall, but Maddow was clearly talking about scale. Also, Maddow was comparing the political response to the numbers that appeared in the mainstream press at the time. Those numbers may have been wrong in retrospect, but they were what politicians back then were likely to read. Our ruling Maddow said Obama’s proposed executive action on immigration policy is roughly on the same scale as one taken by Bush. Both measures unilaterally lifted or would lift the risk of deportation for certain undocumented immigrants. Current estimates of the impact of Obama’s policy are that it would touch about 40 percent of the undocumented population. In 1990, administration estimates of how many people might be affected by Bush’s policy were also in the neighborhood of 40 percent. Estimates at the low end of the scale would have pushed it well below 40 percent. There is some uncertainty here because the 1.5 million number, though widely reported at the time, did bounce around. But the Bush administration seemed to think it was offering a significant, wide-scale program at the time. So we rate Maddow’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DFD280>],/factchecks/2014/nov/24/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-obamas-proposed-immigration-act/
"['Guns', 'Virginia', 'Kathleen Murphy']","
Kathleen Murphy has rosy memory of NRA's past support for background checks
","Fairfax County voters next month will replace Republican Del. Barbara Comstock, who won the 10th District congressional seat this fall. Democrat Kathleen Murphy recently launched a bid for the seat Comstock will leave in the state legislature. In a three-page platform, Murphy calls for ""reasonable"" gun regulations and explains her position in personal terms. ""I lost my brother to gun violence,"" she wrote. ""Two gunmen robbed and murdered him. He was the father of five young children..."" Murphy said she wants to close the ""gun show loophole"" through which people can buy guns from private gun sellers without a background check. She suggested that even the National Rifle Association could back that proposal. ""The NRA supported background checks after the tragedy of 9-11,"" she wrote on her website. We wondered if Murphy’s statement was correct. After we asked, Morgan Finkelstein, spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, told us Murphy made a mistake. The candidate had meant to say the NRA supported background checks after the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Co. that killed 13. That was two years before the World Trade Center attack. Murphy promptly took down the statement from her website. A few days later, she replaced it with the statement, ""The NRA supported background checks after the tragedy at Columbine High School."" Rather than haggle over when the NRA might have supported background checks, we decided to examine the key issue raised by Murphy: Did the NRA ever support background checks? Our colleagues at PolitiFact national looked at similar claims that were made last year by President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The statements were based on congressional testimony by NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre on May 27, 1999 -- five weeks after the Columbine shootings. ""We think it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone,"" LaPierre told the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. ""That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn’t new, or a change of position, or a concession. I’ve been on the record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and positions papers, to news interviews and press appearances."" At the time, Congress was considering legislation to expand background checks. LaPierre outlined a series of proposals that the NRA found ""reasonable,"" including ""instant background checks."" But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the bill defined a gun show, how it allowed a three-business day period for background checks of potential gun buyers, and that the instant background check system didn’t destroy records of guns sales immediately. The NRA eventually backed a substitute proposal that would have expanded background checks. The bill extended the requirement, which affected only licensed firearm dealers, to individuals selling their personally-owned weapons at gun shows. But in return for closing the loophole, the NRA-backed bill shortened the time for completing background checks to 24 hours. That led to the death of the bill, with opponents saying the 24-hour deadline would drastically weaken the checks. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote last year that the NRA’s background check proposal was so limited that many control advocates concluded it was a ""sham."" LaPierre’s testimony came up again last year amid the gun control debate that unfolded after shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. that killed 26. In a January 2013 interview, CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper read LaPierre’s testimony and asked Sandy Froman, an NRA board member, whether the group had changed its mind on background checks. ""Yes, the NRA has changed its position, and the reason it changed its position is because the system doesn’t work. The (National Instant Criminal Background Check) system is not working now. We have to get that working before we can add any more checks to that system. It’s already overburdened,"" Froman said. ""Let’s get it working. Let’s make sure that the 23 states that aren’t reporting the names of people who are mentally ill and have violent tendencies, let’s get those reported and into the system and then we can take a look."" Our ruling Murphy said the NRA once supported background checks. It’s correct that LaPierre, the group’s executive director, did testify after the 1999 Columbine tragedy that the NRA supported ""mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale."" But Murphy’s version of that event is rosy. There were caveats to LaPierre’s statement and many gun control advocates later that year would accuse the NRA of scuttling legislation to expand background tests. So Murphy’s statement is accurate, but needs more information.

Viral meme says Islamic group posted threat to kill Americans on sign in Dearborn, Mich.
","A reader recently sent us a meme circulating on social media that purports to be a threat by radical Muslims to mass-murder Americans. The meme was pasted into an email with the subject line, ""A sign in Dearborn, Michigan.""  (Dearborn has an unusually large Muslim population.) Headlined, ""This is what liberalism will buy you,"" the meme features a photograph of a sign with removable letters, purportedly advertising a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America. The sign reads, ""Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it. Allah be praised."" The meme concludes with the line, ""Still think they are kidding."" (The question mark for that last sentence was mysteriously missing.) A pretty scary sign if true. But is it? Hardly. We searched for a group called Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America on the Web and found no trace of it. More importantly, the sign comes from a template on the website Church Sign Maker. The site allows people to create photos of church signs conveying any message they choose. The site allows users to ""create your own funny photos and graphics -- simply type in some text and choose from a few simple options. You can create your own church sign, make an official seal, have your own fire or police badge, and more."" In this particular meme, the threat is a custom message that uses the site’s ""Classic Design #5."" The backgrounds of the template and the Facebook meme are identical. (Snopes.com has also debunked this claim.) Some notable text on the main page of the Church Sign Maker page: ""Note: these church signs aren't real, they don't exist in the real world."" Our ruling The meme claims that a sign in Dearborn, Mich., purportedly hung by a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America says, ""Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it."" However, nothing about this sign is true. It doesn’t exist; it was created using a freely available web tool.

Those who poll well early don't become presidential nominee, potential contender Scott Walker says
","When we examined what Gov. Scott Walker said on national talk shows following his re-election, we promised to fact-check one particular statement he uttered. Walker made the claim Nov. 11, 2014 on Fox & Friends, as speculation built that he would seek the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Walker was asked about his relatively low score, in an exit poll of Wisconsin voters, about whether he would make a good president. In replying, he changed the focus, making what is essentially a definitive claim about national polls on possible presidential contenders. ""No, I mean, in the end, any poll right now is ridiculous,"" the governor said. ""You look over the past four or five elections, people who poll high at the beginning are not the people who end up being the nominees."" Given that Walker ranks ninth out of 11 potential GOP presidential candidates, according to Real Clear Politics’ polling averages, such a claim, if true, could mean a run isn’t necessarily a lost cause. Of course, the 2016 election is still two years away, most voters aren’t paying close attention and the potential candidates will do plenty of jockeying in the meantime. ""Campaigns certainly matter,"" pollster Gary Langer, who directs ABC News polling, told us. ""However, being an early leader has its advantages."" Wisconsin poll The poll alluded to by the Fox interviewer was an exit poll of Wisconsin voters who had just cast ballots in the Nov. 4, 2014 mid-term elections. Amid a wave of GOP wins nationwide, Walker was re-elected that day by a margin of 52 percent to 47 percent. But only 42 percent of the state voters in the exit poll, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said Walker would make a good president. Walker’s evidence We asked Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick for evidence to back Walker’s  statement about early polling in presidential races. She noted some instances in which an early front-runner did not get nominated for president, including two in 2008. Hillary Clinton, who held a big lead in early polling, lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama; and Rudy Giuliani, who dueled with John McCain in early polling, lost the GOP nomination to McCain. But Walker’s claim takes us all the way back to the 1996 presidential election. So let’s get a fuller account of early polling and who the nominees turned out to be. Early presidential-preference surveys To avoid comparing apples and oranges, we looked at polling only for open seats; in other words, polls for nomination races in which an incumbent president was not seeking his party’s nomination for another term. In 2016, that’s the playing field for both parties. We relied primarily on polling data provided by researcher Kathleen Weldon from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research and work that FiveThirtyEight.com blogger Nate Silver did in 2011 for the New York Times. Both assembled data from major national polls. As we’ll see, despite Walker's sweeping claim, there are a number of examples that don’t support him. 1996: Kansas Sen. Bob Dole was the clear Republican front-runner and he won the GOP nomination. Roper data showed him well in the lead in nearly every early poll. And Silver’s measure found Dole had a 39-point edge over Texas Sen. Phil Gramm in polls taken from January to June of 1995. Dole lost the election to Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton. 2000: Both parties had clear early front-runners and both of those candidates became the nominees. Roper said George W. Bush led all other Republican contenders by September 1997 and Vice President Al Gore was well ahead of other Democratic contenders five months earlier. In Silver’s averaging -- for polling done from January to June 1999 -- Bush led Dole’s wife, North Carolina Sen. Elizabeth Dole, by 28 points while Gore led his nearest rival, New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, by 33 points. Bush edged Gore in the election. 2004: Gore was the clear front-runner in early polls, well ahead of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, but he decided nearly two years before the election not to run. Later, in early 2003, Kerry and Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman were tied in the polls, according to the Pew Research Center. Kerry eventually claimed the Democratic nomination. Kerry lost the election to Bush, who won a second term. 2008: The results in this election were mixed. As we noted, Hillary Clinton was the clear front-runner, initially polling well ahead of Kerry and North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, before losing the Democratic nomination to Obama. Later, she led Obama by 15 points in Silver's averaging of the poll results from January through June 2007. On the Republican side, as we noted, Guiliani and McCain polled well early. Roper said Giuliani, the former New York mayor, led McCain, the Arizona senator, in most polls in 2005, but only by a few points.. McCain lost the election to Obama. 2012: One of the candidates who polled well early won the GOP nomination. Roper said polls from 2009 revealed a tight race among former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, before Romney claimed the Republican nomination. Romney lost to Obama, who won a second term. So how does this all shake out? Five contenders -- Bob Dole in 1996, Bush and Gore in 2000, McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 -- all scored high in the earliest polls and went on to win their party’s nomination. Our rating Walker said that in ""the past four or five"" presidential elections, ""people who poll high at the beginning are not the people who end up being the nominees."" Some who polled high since 1996 didn’t become the nominee, of course, but that isn’t enough evidence to back Walker’s flat statement. Indeed, five contenders who polled well early did, in fact, become the presidential nominee. For a statement that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097198CC0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/24/scott-walker/those-who-poll-well-early-dont-become-presidential/

Rick Santorum: Foreign-born residents living in United States at historic high
","America’s foreign-born population is already high, and President Barack Obama wants it to grow, former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum said Sunday. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Santorum criticized Obama’s recently announced executive action on immigration. Obama’s plan could affect about 4 million immigrants currently living in the United States illegally out of an estimated 11 million total. Under the plan, if illegal immigrants meet certain requirements, they will be able to qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for a limited number of years. Santorum warned Obama’s plan will entice more undocumented immigrants, hurting the American-born population that he said is struggling for better employment and wages. ""The last 20 years have been the largest wave of immigration in the history of this country,"" Santorum said. ""There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of the country. And what the president is saying is, ‘We need more.’ And working men and women are saying, ‘Hold on, what about us?’ "" Obama’s plan only applies to illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, not those who come illegally in the future. Still, we wondered about Santorum’s claim that America’s foreign-born population is the highest it’s ever been. We found that he is correct in terms of raw numbers, but experts say it’s not the best measure to use when comparing America’s foreign-born population over the years. By the numbers We tried to reach Santorum through his PAC, Patriot Voices, but did not hear back. The U.S. Census Bureau provides data for the foreign-born population going back to 1850. As of 2012, the most recent year for which there is data, the foreign-born population of the United States was about 40 million, which factors in the estimated number of immigrants in the country illegally. In terms of raw numbers, that’s the highest it’s been since the Census started tracking it. However, the total U.S. population has grown significantly in the past 160 years. As of 2012, foreign-born residents make up 12.9 percent of the total population. In this respect, today’s foreign-born population is not the highest it’s ever been -- in fact, it was higher from 1860 through the 1920s. Since 1970, when the foreign-born population was 4.7 percent, the trend has been increasing numbers of foreign-born residents. The 2010 percentage of almost 13 percent is the highest it’s been since 1920 and is less than 2 percentage points shy of the all-time high in the 1890s. The following chart, taken from a Census slide presentation, shows the growth of the foreign-born population from 1850 to 2010 in pink bars. The blue line shows their share of the country’s population.  Several experts said it is much more useful to measure the foreign-born population as a percentage of the total population rather than absolute numbers. The percentage better reflects the country’s ability to accommodate immigrants. ""As a historian, there is no reason whatsoever to focus on the absolute number over the percentage,"" said Kenyon Zimmer, an immigration historian at the University of Texas Arlington. ""The absolute number tells us nothing useful about the impact of immigration on the United States -- an impact that is, today, less than it was during the age of ‘mass immigration’ around the turn of the (20th) century."" The percentage measurement gives some context and shows how much of an impact immigrants can have on American society compared to native-born Americans, said Susan Carter, an expert in economics and immigration at University of California Riverside. The higher the percentage of the foreign-born population, the higher their impact on things like labor markets, housing, schools, elections and culture. Thus, immigrants’ impact on American society is lower today than in 1890, when the foreign-born population as a share of the total population peaked at 14.8 percent. The total population was 63 million, compared to 319 million today (with immigrants making up 12.9 percent). ""The (total) U.S. population is bigger now than at any time in U.S. history, which means that it has greater capacity to absorb new flows of immigration without adverse impacts,"" said Madeleine Sumption, research director of international programs at the Migration Policy Institute. Of course, differences in the economic and political situations of 100 years ago and today make it difficult to compare immigrants’ impact in any measure, Sumption said. For example, she noted that government was smaller 100 years ago, so people had lower expectations for a government-funded social safety net for people at risk of poverty, as immigrants often are. Additionally, the United States had few immigration restrictions before 1921, with a notable exception of limiting Asian immigrants, making it difficult to compare immigration trends, Zimmer said. Zimmer added that he believes the number of foreign-born individuals living in the United States is irrelevant to the current immigration debate. As long as there are jobs available, immigrants will come, legally or not. The estimated number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has gone down by about 1 million over the past decade, and that reflects fewer available jobs following the 2008 recession, he said. Carter noted that Americans’ attitude toward immigrants sometimes depends on the economic well-being of the native-born population. She compared Americans’ pessimistic outlook today to that of Americans in the late 1800s. Then, Chinese immigrants were seen as a welcome source of cheap labor, until an economic depression struck in the 1870s, bringing widespread unemployment. At that point, many native-born Americans decided they wanted the Chinese out. ""Under such depressing conditions, immigrants become a convenient scapegoat,"" she said. Our ruling Santorum said, ""There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of country."" In terms of the absolute number of foreign-born individuals living in the United States, Santorum is correct. However, in terms of the number of immigrants as a percentage of the total population, he’s not. Immigrants made up a bigger share of the total population from 1860 to 1920 than they do today. This measurement is by far the more useful of the two, experts said, as it accounts for total population growth. Whether it’s even worthwhile to compare immigration levels of today with other points in U.S. history is up for debate given drastic economic and political shifts over time. As for Santorum’s claim, it is partially accurate but missing important caveats. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3C1C0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/23/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-foreign-born-residents-living-united/

Crossroads head Anne Nolan says long-term homeless in R.I. cost Medicaid $60,000 per person annually
","The head of Rhode Island's largest homeless shelter argued in a Nov. 12, 2014 Providence Journal commentary that the costs of not finding someone a home can be very high. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, reported that, ""In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person, which is far higher than the typical $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults on Medicaid and $9,240 per person per year for the average Medicaid recipient."" That's a huge difference. We were curious about whether those numbers were accurate and why the gap was so large. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government health-care program for the very poor. Nolan’s commentary referenced the 2013 ""Rhode Island Annual Medicaid Expenditure Report,"" developed by the state's office of Health and Human Services. We located the report, but we couldn't find any numbers that matched Nolan’s. So we emailed her to make sure that was really her source. She replied that the information actually came from a June 1, 2014, report by Providence College sociologist Eric Hirsch, in which he identified 5,986 Rhode Islanders who had spent at least one night in an emergency shelter over a 28-month period and discovered that 2,308 were covered by Medicaid. Their Medicaid expenses totaled $58 million. Hirsch doesn't calculate the cost per person, so we did. It's $10,795 per person per year. That's pretty close to the average for all Medicaid recipients and a far cry from $60,000. So where did Nolan get her $60,000 figure? In his report, Hirsch wanted to make the point that those costs were not evenly distributed among the homeless. ""In fact,"" he wrote, ""the 67 individuals who were homeless for one year or more and had the highest Medicaid bills had total charges of $9,325,375."" That's $139,185 per person for these 67 people"" over 28 months. ""The corresponding annual charge was just under $60,000 per person,"" Hirsch wrote. But we immediately noticed a problem -- $60,000 isn't the average for all long-term homeless people. It's only for the 67 people who racked up the highest Medicaid bills, a distinction Nolan didn't make in her commentary. When we contacted Hirsch, he explained that, ""We do want to be able to argue that it would be most cost effective to house the most vulnerable."" In other words, finding housing for 'high cost' homeless are going to save the most money. He said he used an arbitrary cutoff -- expenses of $47,000 or more -- to identify the high-cost users. Because Nolan was talking about all long-term homeless on Medicaid -- not just the 67 with the highest bills --  we asked Hirsh for the information on the larger group. He went back to his data and reported to us that there were 442 long-term homeless people who had, on average, $23,650 in Medicaid charges per person per year. Although that's double the amount for the typical person who was homeless for at least one night, it's dramatically less than $60,000. When we wrote back to Nolan asking if she was aware that the $60,000 figure only applied to homeless Medicaid patients with the biggest bills, she said she had misinterpreted the report. Finally, for the record, Hirsch and Nolan erred when they said the average Medicaid cost is $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults. As Hirsch reported when we questioned the figure based on the state Medicaid report, the correct amount is $21,696. Our ruling Anne Nolan said Rhode Islanders who have been homeless for at least a year cost Medicaid an average of $60,000 per person per year. But the $60,000 cost she cites applied only to the 67 homeless people with the highest medical bills, a major caveat she didn't mention in her commentary. The annual dollar amount for all Medicaid recipients in the study who were homeless for at least a year was $23,650 -- a substantial cost to taxpayers, but far less than what Nolan indicated. Because Nolan's statement makes it sound like it applies to all long-term homeless people on Medicaid when, in fact, it only focuses on the most-expensive subset, we rate it False.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Legal Issues', 'Barack Obama']","
Are Barack Obama's immigration moves 'the kinds of actions' taken by presidents for 50 years?
","On Nov. 20, 2014, President Barack Obama announced a landmark executive action on immigration. The policy change would primarily affect more than 4 million immigrants who have lived illegally in the United States for more than five years but who have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, they could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. The program will open for applications in the spring. In addition, Obama announced that he would expand by about 300,000 the number of people able to benefit from an existing order from 2012. That order deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants who had initially entered the United States as children. Obama took these actions despite longstanding concerns from critics that they were of questionable legality. Obama sought to preempt these criticisms in his speech from the White House. ""The actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century,"" Obama said. There is a robust debate under way about whether any president has the power under the Constitution to take the kind of action Obama just announced. We won’t referee that debate. Here, we’ll look at whether there is as much historical precedent as Obama claims and whether the examples are comparable. Did each president over the past 50 years take executive action on immigration? The answer appears to be yes. The White House and its allies have circulated a paper from the American Immigration Council titled, ""Executive Grants of Temporary Immigration Relief, 1956-Present."" The council is pro-immigration -- its motto is, ""honoring our immigrant past; shaping our immigrant future"" -- but experts we checked with didn’t quarrel with the raw data the council assembled in the paper. In a multi-page table, the council cited 39 examples since 1956 in which a president ""granted temporary immigration relief to one or more groups in need of assistance."" Every president since (and including) Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, took at least one such action. Readers can skim the full list here. In a prior fact check, we addressed one of the more prominent examples -- in 1990, when President George H. W. Bush forestalled deportations for about 1.5 million illegal immigrants through executive action. It was a consequence of a 1986 immigration overhaul that granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants. Bush’s action was designed to prevent families from being split up based on differences in legal status. When Congress failed to change the law, Bush did it on his own in 1990. Another prominent example: President Ronald Reagan legalized the status of some unauthorized children after passage of the 1986 law. This affected an estimated 100,000 families. Obama’s claim is ""true in the sense that presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes ‘unlawful presence’ or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action,"" said Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And Obama could have actually used a longer time frame, said Mae Ngai, a Columbia University professor of history and Asian-American studies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, adjusted the legal status of Europeans in the 1930s, she said. Are the past examples equivalent to what Obama is doing? The answer to this question is somewhat murkier. In general, experts said each case shares similarities in legal grounding but also had differences in scope and substance. Here are some of the differences: • Size. At between 4 million and 5 million potential beneficiaries, Obama’s is easily the biggest such action ever taken by a president, at least in raw numbers. Actions with a potential six-figure reach included reprieves for Cubans in the 1960s, Southeast Asians in the 1970s and Nicaraguans in the 1980s. But most were much smaller. Even the second-largest legalization -- the Bush action -- may have affected far fewer than the 1.5 million figure that is usually attached to it, writes Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally favors tighter immigration policies. He has written that the number taking advantage may have been as small as 140,000. However, it’s worth noting that -- if you take the 1.5 million figure from George H.W. Bush’s action at face value -- both that action and Obama’s affected the same proportion of the undocumented population, about 40 percent. • Scope. Many of the past presidential actions were targeted at specific populations that were experiencing humanitarian or political crises in their home country. For instance, immigration orders affected 15,000 Ethiopians in the late 1970s and early 1980s; 2,227 Persian Gulf evacuees in the 1990s; and 10,000 Liberians under President George W. Bush. ""The list reads like a study guide of post-war foreign crises,"" Krikorian writes. Obama’s, by contrast, targets broad classes of people of any nationality. Broader, less country-specific actions are not unprecedented -- the Reagan and George H.W. Bush actions were roughly similar in design. But numerically, they account for a distinct minority of the 39 examples in the American Immigration Council’s report. • What undocumented immigrants could receive. Krikorian notes that Obama has not just deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants but gone a step further, allowing them to receive work permits and other related benefits, such as Social Security numbers. Obama’s 2012 action, for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, did the same. There is at least one precedent for this: the George H.W. Bush action in 1990, which included the possibility of receiving work permits. Some of the other previous actions may have as well, but experts said allowing work permits are the exception rather than the rule. • What was Congress’ role? Critics argue that Obama’s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas the Reagan and Bush orders were largely undertaken to fix ""loose ends,"" as Krikorian characterizes them, from a specific immigration law. The American Immigration Council cites several examples in which legislation was pending at the time the presidents took their action, including parole for orphans (under Eisenhower), Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro (presidents Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson) and deferred action for battered immigrants (President Clinton). Still, there’s broad agreement that the degree of tension between Congress and the president was unusually large under Obama. Our ruling Obama said, ""the actions I’m taking"" are ""the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half-century."" He has a point that every president since Eisenhower, Republican and Democratic alike, has taken executive action on immigration. However, Obama’s action can be viewed as more sweeping than any of those taken earlier. The clearest parallel is Bush’s action in 1990: The percentage of the undocumented population potentially affected was similar, both actions were structured without regard to a specific nationality, and beneficiaries could qualify for a work permit. Still, most of the actions taken by prior presidents were more limited in size, scope and benefits than the one in 1990. So, even if you accept that the 1990 action is a pretty close precedent, that’s a much more limited claim than the one Obama made. In other words, it’s an exaggeration to say that Obama’s actions are ""the kinds of actions taken"" by every single president of the past half century. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1BEF40>],/factchecks/2014/nov/21/barack-obama/are-barack-obamas-immigration-moves-kinds-actions-/

Mark Warner adviser overstates rural vote for senator
","Plenty of Monday morning quarterbacks attended a recent seminar where a political adviser to Democratic incumbent Mark Warner and one for Republican Ed Gillespie looked back on Virginia’s surprisingly close U.S. Senate election. A woman in the audience at George Mason University asked if Warner’s margin of victory -- less than 18,000 votes out of almost 2.2 million cast -- would have been greater if the senator had spent less time campaigning in rural areas and more time stumping in populous Northern Virginia, a haven for statewide Democratic candidates. The woman was echoing a question raised by many pundits after the election. David Hallock, a Warner adviser, replied that rural votes helped Warner win. ""You look at the kind of Republican areas, the rural areas, Senator Warner ran 8-10 points ahead of a traditional Democrat -- ahead of Senator Kaine, ahead of Governor McAuliffe in those areas -- which is more than the margin of victory at the end of the day,"" he said. Warner has long prided himself as a vote-getter in rural Virginia, pursuing a so-called ""Bubba strategy,"" attending NASCAR races and even commissioning a blue-grass campaign song during his successful 2001 run for governor. We examined whether Warner this year really did top the past rural vote performances of two stalwarts in his party -- Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe -- by the 8-10 percent margin Hallock cited. The first step was to define rural Virginia. We relied on a state map highlighting 52 localities that the federal government defines as rural. Then, we compared Warner’s 2014 votes in those places to the results from McAuliffe’s 2013 gubernatorial election and Kaine’s 2012 Senate contest.  Here’s how the statewide rural vote broke down: Warner, 2014: 39 percent McAuliffe, 2013: 35.6 percent Kaine, 2012: 41.4 percent The rural localities form six regions. Here’s how Warner’s performance compared to the other Democrats in each of those areas: Eastern Shore: Warner, 44.2 percent; McAuliffe, 42.8 percent; Kaine, 50.3 percent. Northern Neck: Warner, 41.2 percent; McAuliffe, 39.1 percent; Kaine, 45.8 percent. Shenandoah: Warner, 33.3 percent, McAuliffe, 34 percent; Kaine, 39.9 percent. Alleghany: Warner, 37.1 percent; McAuliffe, 33.4 percent; Kaine, 38.5 percent. Southside: Warner, 48.5 percent; McAuliffe, 45.3 percent; Kaine, 51.3 percent. Southwest: Warner, 35.9 percent; McAuliffe, 29.7 percent; Kaine, 35.3 percent. The 39 percent overall rural vote for Warner this fall was considerably below the level he achieved during his other successful campaigns. Warner got 61.2 percent of the rural vote in his 2008 landslide victory for the U.S. Senate over Republican Jim Gilmore; he got 51.2 percent in his 2001 gubernatorial win over Republican Mark Earley.  Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the decline in Warner’s vote percentages this year -- not just in rural areas but across Virginia -- may be due to the senator’s positioning as a centrist. ""The moderate strategy that worked so well for Warner back in the day, just doesn’t work as well today,"" Farnsworth said. ""The real polarization of politics means there’s just not as many people interested in a moderate politician. The strategy of winning over moderate rural voters doesn’t work well when there aren’t many moderate rural voters."" As we mentioned, a number of pundits question whether some of Warner’s time courting rural voters would have been better spent wooing Northern Virginians. We’re not taking sides in this debate, but thought we’d offer a few statistics to put it in perspective. Unofficially, Warner won by 17,723 votes. The State Board of Elections is scheduled the certify the final results on Monday. In rural Virginia, Gillespie got 163,608 votes and Warner received 108,772. Gillespie won a 54,386-vote edge. In Northern Virginia, Warner gained 358,878 votes, 57.4 percent, and Gillespie got 252,584 votes, 40.4 percent. Warner won a 106,294-vote advantage in the region. Our ruling Hallock said Warner, in this fall’s Senate election, ran ""8-10 points ahead"" of past performances by fellow Democrats McAuliffe and Kaine in rural Virginia. He’s flat out wrong. McAuliffe’s portion of the rural vote, in his 2013 gubernatorial victory, was 3.6 percentage points below Warner’s. Kaine’s slice of the rural vote, in his 2012 Senate win, was 2.4 percentage points above Warner’s. We rate Hallock’s statement False. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said Hallock did not respond to three emails seeking data for his claim. Our requests were sent to an incorrect email address for Hallock.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0FC780>],/factchecks/2014/nov/21/david-hallock/mark-warner-got-more-rural-votes-other-democratic-/

Steve Adler represented store trying to build over aquifer; fight didn't begin over dumping oil
","UPDATE, 5:30 p.m., Nov. 25, 2014: After hearing from Rockwell, we removed parts of our original story: testimony about whether mechanical systems could cause the project to meet anti-pollution standards – an element that didn’t speak to Rockwell’s claim – and a comment by a lawyer that workers took care of spilled gasoline, an action we didn’t confirm. We also took out our reference to a wave of litigation. While several judges considered the Lowe’s conflict in 2004, environmentalist groups filed only one lawsuit, Rockwell told us. We also made it clear Rockwell does not believe his statement was an exaggeration. These changes did not affect our rating of the claim. Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) ""I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance,"" Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: ""Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: ""There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process."" Specifically, Ross said, she saw ""clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock"" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s ""no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site."" She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was ""being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature"" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and ""any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location."" Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: ""There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail."" She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called ""well underway,"" was ""going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue."" His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, ""an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features."" Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to ""ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property."" In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was ""totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer,"" Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. ""To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral,"" Adler said in an interview. ""Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer."" The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: ""Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer."" Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t ""purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect."" Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: ""Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?"" Young added: ""It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed"" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: ""The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage."" We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Facebook meme: Fox News topped opposite-sex marriage article with same-sex photo
","No meme should ever be taken at face value, so when a reader asked us to look at one that slammed Fox News, we read it with a skeptical eye.  The meme shows two women -- one in a bridal gown and the other in a suit -- kissing. It reads, ""That special moment when Foxnews.com uses a photo of a married couple promoting ‘traditional marriage’ and the photo is actually of a same-sex couple."" There are two key elements to check. Did the Fox News website use this image at all, and did it appear in the context of an article that favored hetereosexual marriage? And we suppose you could ask if the people in the photo above are both women. That last one is easy. Yes. The picture was taken on Valentine’s Day 2012 by an Associated Press photographer. This was the first same-sex couple to be married at the Empire State Building. So did the photo (not the snarky words of course) appear on Foxnews.com? Fox News said it had. Through a spokeswoman, Jeff Misenti, Fox’s chief digital officer, said that when the photo was pointed out to Fox, they pulled it and replaced it with one that fit the context of the article it accompanied. The image also showed up on a segment of Fox and Friends. Cue Google So who tipped off Fox? Google conveniently includes a feature to spot all the occurrences of a particular image. Through that, we found a blog post from Feb. 6, 2013, by Jessica Valenti, a columnist with the Guardian. Valenti is credited by other bloggers for being the first to spot Fox’s faux pas. Valenti wrote, ""Shhhh … no one tell Fox News that the ‘wedding kiss’ picture they’re using to accompany a piece about traditional gender roles is actually of a same sex couple."" Valenti told PunditFact it seemed pretty obvious to her that the picture was of two women. She recognized that it was shot atop the Empire State Building and did her own image search to find the original. Valenti included the image of the couple kissing in her post, but there was no logo or other sign that it had appeared on Foxnews.com. And Valenti updated her post to say, ""Fox News has taken the image down :( "" But Valenti’s item inspired much repetition in the blogosphere, and Gawker’s post had a complete screenshot. Traditional marriage It’s safe to say that when people talk about traditional marriage, they mean heterosexual couples. The article on Fox’s website that included the photo did not directly say that opposite-sex marriages were superior to same-sex unions. It simply did not make the comparison. However, it did target the values it saw as being thrust upon American women. Society, said the writer Suzanne Venker, ""eschews marriage."" Women have ""been taught instead to honor sex, singlehood and female empowerment,"" Venker wrote. Venker advocated a code that struck a definite chord of traditionalism. It was based on accepting the validity of norms from times gone by. ""Prior to the 1970s, people viewed gender roles as as (sic) equally valuable,"" Venker wrote. ""Many would argue women had the better end of the deal! It’s hard to claim women were oppressed in a nation in which men were expected to stand up when a lady enters the room or to lay down their lives to spare a woman’s life."" Venker also happens to be the niece of Phyllis Schlafly, a long-time social conservative activist who opposes same-sex marriage. The two co-wrote a book attacking feminism. It is fair to characterize Venker’s article on Fox as supporting traditional marriage. Our ruling A Facebook meme said Fox News used a photo of a same-sex couple in an article that promoted traditional marriage. Fox News agrees that it used the photo and the story presented a case for marriage based on men and women adopting traditional gender roles.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Corporations', 'Elections', 'Small Business', 'Unions', 'Wisconsin', 'Robin Vos']","
In Wisconsin, unions can give unlimited funds to political parties, but business can give none?
","Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos sounded euphoric on Milwaukee radio on Nov. 5, 2014, the morning after the mid-term elections. ""How are you?"" he was asked by conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. ""Charlie, I literally could not be better,"" Vos replied. Not only had Republican Gov. Scott Walker won re-election, but gains in the Assembly meant Republicans would enjoy their largest majority in that chamber since 1957.   In the interview, Vos laid out a number of his priorities for the next legislative session, which starts in January 2015. One proposal would allow business contributions to the political parties. ""Right now, if you are the Democratic Party, you can take unlimited union money, in many ways, but there's a prohibition on business being able to give to a political party,"" Vos claimed. ""I’d like to get rid of that and create a level playing field."" Vos presumably was singling out the Democratic Party because it typically gets more support from unions than the GOP does. We’ll check both parts of his claim -- that in Wisconsin, unions can essentially make unlimited contributions to political parties, while businesses can’t make any. Unions State law allows unions to contribute directly to political parties (and to candidates, for that matter). But since at least 2008, no union has used its ""treasury"" funds to directly make a contribution to a political party, according to the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections. There is a strong disincentive to contribute that way. If they did, unions would have to register with the state as a political committee and would have to disclose all their sources of revenue and all their disbursements. Instead, what unions typically do is create political action committees, which in turn make contributions to political parties (and candidates). A union can give a PAC the equivalent of $20 per union member per year without having to disclose the names of the union members. Or, the union can give unlimited amounts to PACs, as long as the union members’ names are disclosed. PACs, though, are limited to contributing $6,000 per year to a political party. So, unions are allowed to contribute directly to political parties -- but, in practice, they don’t. They are allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to a political action committee, but a PAC is limited to how much it can give to a party. Business The second part of Vos’ claim is that ""there's a prohibition on business being able to give to a political party."" In Wisconsin, campaign contributions must originate from individuals. That means business owners -- those who own sole proprietorships or partnerships -- can make contributions to political parties (as well as to candidates and political action committees). That is, as long as the source is personal funds and not funds from the business -- and as long as they follow the limit for a particular race. But Wisconsin prohibits corporations, including limited liability companies, from making contributions to parties, candidates or PACs. Like unions, corporations can form political action committees to solicit campaign contributions from individuals. But as we’ve noted, unlike unions, corporations can’t make contributions to PACs. Vos told us he’d like to see state law changed so that it treats corporations like unions -- in other words, allowing corporations to make the same kind of political contributions as unions do. Our rating Vos said that in Wisconsin, unions can essentially give ""unlimited"" contributions to political parties, but business can't give any. The law allows unions to make unlimited contributions to the parties, but in practice, they make no such direct contributions at all. Rather, they give to political action committees, which in turn are limited in what they can give to parties. Business owners using their personal funds can contribute to political parties, within limits, but corporations can't make any such contributions. We rate  the claim Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1C240>],/factchecks/2014/nov/21/robin-vos/wisconsin-unions-can-give-unlimited-funds-politica/

Ted Cruz says in 2014 elections, voters made clear their opposition to Obamacare, 'amnesty'
","The night before President Barack Obama was scheduled to announce that he was removing the threat of deportation from up to 5 million undocumented immigrants, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, launched a preemptive strike during an appearance on Fox News. Cruz told Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that ""it's incumbent on Republicans in Congress to use every single constitutional tool we have to defend the rule of law to rein in"" Obama so that the president ""does not become an unaccountable monarch imposing his own policies in defiance of the American people."" Cruz went on to say that the election results demonstrated that on two issues -- health care and immigration -- the American public delivered a resounding blow in favor of the Republican position. He said: ""You know, in elections that he liked, the president was fond of saying elections have consequences. Well, this last election there was no ambiguity. There were two issues that dominated this last election. Number one, Obamacare. And number two, amnesty. This was a referendum on amnesty. And the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare. It's a disaster. It's hurting the American people. And we don't want amnesty. And I'm sorry to say the president is behaving in an unprecedented way. There is not in recent times any parallel for a president repudiated by the voters standing up and essentially telling the voters go jump in a lake, he's going to force his powers."" We wondered: Is there data to back up Cruz’s contention that in the 2014 elections, ""the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare … and we don't want amnesty""? No one would question that the Republicans delivered a massive electoral victory in the 2014 midterm elections, and the party’s dominant position against both Obamacare and legalized status for illegal immigrants was hardly a state secret. ""The poll that counts is at the ballot box,"" said Phil Novack, deputy press secretary for Cruz. ""In 2015 Republicans will control more legislative seats nationwide than anytime since the 1920s. Across the country, Republican candidates were united with a message to stop Obamacare, to stop its continuing damage to our economy, and to stop Obama’s amnesty, and the American people delivered a clear mandate on these priorities."" This was especially true in the competitive Senate races. We rated Mostly True the claim that every new Republican member of the U.S. Senate said they ""will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare."" So voters undeniably rewarded the party which plainly advocated the views Cruz highlights. Still, the evidence that voters cast ballots as they did because of those policy positions is a lot less clear. Novack said that ""polls published before and after the election showed a majority of Americans in opposition to both Obamacare and Obama’s executive action on amnesty."" However, the best way to measure how voters on election day actually felt -- which is what Cruz's claim refers to -- is to use responses to the national exit poll. Every two years, a consortium of media outlets collectively samples opinion across the country on Election Day, either as voters leave the polls or through a supplemental phone survey of those who voted early or by absentee ballot. The 2014 exit poll results are summarized here. Fortuitously for this fact-check, the exit poll asked about both Obamacare and illegal immigration. Did the American people say ""overwhelmingly"" that ""we don't want Obamacare""? Exit poll respondents were asked to complete the sentence, ""Do you think the 2010 federal health care law…,"" with one of three options. The most common answer -- 49 percent -- was that the law ""went too far."" But the other two options -- that the law ""was about right,"" or that it ""did not go far enough"" -- collectively totaled 46 percent. That’s a pretty tight split -- so tight, in fact, that it’s within the margin of error. This question had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that, due to imperfect sampling techniques, there actually may have been slightly more Americans who think the law is ""about right"" or ""did not go far enough."" Either way, Cruz is wrong to say that the ""American people overwhelmingly"" opposed Obamacare on Election Day. At most, a small plurality opposed the law -- and maybe not even that. Did Americans on Election Day say ""we don't want amnesty""? The term ""amnesty"" is one open to some debate. Many Republicans use it to describe any process that ultimately leads to legal status for the undocumented, while Democrats counter that Obama’s preferred course -- allowing illegal immigrants to apply for legal status only after certain hurdles such as fines and waiting periods are imposed -- is much more rigorous than no-fault ""amnesty."" We won’t referee this debate here, but the exit poll asked a question that sheds some light on the electorate’s view. The exit poll asked respondents to complete this sentence: ""Should most illegal immigrants working in the United States be. …"" with one of two options. ""Offered a chance to apply for legal status"" was chosen by 57 percent of respondents, while ""deported to the country they came from"" was the choice of 39 percent. (This question also had a 3-percentage-point sampling error margin, but the gap was so big that the error margin doesn’t come into play.) What this means is that voters in Election 2014 didn’t reject ""amnesty."" If you take the term to mean what Republicans say it means -- a path to legal status -- then voters actually supported that option by an 18-point margin. What is the most important issue facing the country? One more question sheds some light on Cruz’s claim. The exit poll asked respondents to choose the ""most important issue facing the country today"" from among four choices: foreign policy, health care, the economy and illegal immigration. Health care was the choice of 25 percent, and illegal immigration was named by 14 percent. Both of these options trailed the top choice -- the economy, named by 45 percent of respondents -- by a substantial margin. Even among the 25 percent who cited health care as their top issue, these voters were more likely to be Democrats -- 59 percent to 39 percent. This further weakens Cruz’s case that opposition to Obamacare drove the electorate. (Just 14 percent of Democrats in the exit poll said Obamacare went too far.) In other words, not only was Cruz incorrect in describing the voters’ policy preferences in Election 2014, but he was also off-base in saying that Obamacare and illegal immigration ""dominated this last election."" If anything dominated the minds of voters, it was the economy. Our ruling Cruz said that in the 2014 elections, ""the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare … and we don't want amnesty."" Exit poll data shows that, at most, Americans were slightly -- not ""overwhelmingly"" -- against Obamacare, and even that edge is in doubt because the lead for the anti-Obamacare side is within the margin of error. Meanwhile, exit poll data also shows that voters, by a 3-to-2 margin, actually favored offering the possibility of legal status to illegal immigrants.

Joy Pullmann says Scott Walker couldn’t get legislature to significantly expand school choice
","Gov. Scott Walker’s re-election on Nov. 4, 2014, drew plenty of love from conservative commentators bullish about his chances to make a splash in the 2016 presidential race. ""The Nation Needs President Scott Walker in 2016,"" shouted a headline over a story by Richard Cromwell in The Federalist, an online magazine. But not everyone on the right was leading cheers. Same magazine, different take: ""Winning Re-Election Doesn’t Mean Scott Walker Is Ready For 2016."" The author of that Nov. 11 piece is the managing editor of the magazine, Joy Pullmann, an education researcher at the conservative Heartland Institute based in Chicago. Pullmann has dogged Walker on several issues, including what she views as his belated shift to oppose the Common Core state standards for schools. One week after Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke, Pullmann -- a former teacher and self-described ""born and raised Wisconsin farm girl"" -- again was talking down Walker’s accomplishments. She argued his moves to boost private schools with public money, cut taxes and all but end public-sector collective bargaining were half measures. Aside from going after public employee unions, she argued, Walker has been too nice and too passive. In particular she cited ""a pitiful 500-student increase to Milwaukee’s voucher program, the nation’s oldest, because Walker couldn’t get his own party members to back a real expansion despite full control of Wisconsin’s legislative and executive branches."" She added: ""Whoop de doo. In Indiana, Mitch Daniels’ voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening. He knew how to work with his legislature — and they ain’t any less ornery and squishy than Wisconsin Republicans."" Did Daniels -- a Walker favorite who served two terms as governor ending in 2013 -- spectacularly outdo Walker on school vouchers despite favorable political conditions for the GOP in Madison? At first glance, the programs appear pretty similar. Wisconsin currently pays for 29,683 students to attend non-public schools. In Indiana, the figure also tops 29,000. But most of the growth in the Wisconsin program long pre-dates Walker, while Indiana has surged to Wisconsin’s level in just four years. Daniels won passage of the program in 2011, the same year Walker’s first term began in Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, vouchers were born 25 years ago through a Milwaukee-only program. It was a pioneering effort nationally in the use of public tax dollars to enable parents to send their children to private and/or religious schools. It was under Walker that the program expanded beyond Milwaukee, to more than 25 municipalities. But Pullmann alludes, accurately, to the fact Daniels was able to get vouchers approved statewide right from the get-go, while Walker settled for a gradual and limited expansion even with a Republican-controlled Legislature and a 2012 recall win under his belt. She misstates some facts and undersells Walker’s record on vouchers, though, in saying he won a mere ""500-student increase to Milwaukee’s voucher program."" Walker did cap the increase at 500 additional students in 2013-’14. But that cap of 500 students is old news; the statewide limit went up to 1,000 new students for 2014-’15. Also left out of the equation are earlier expansions on Walker’s watch. Walker lifted Milwaukee’s 22,500 enrollment limit in 2011. He also signed the expansion of the program to Racine in 2011-’12. All these moves combined to allow more than 5,000 new students into the program annually, 10 times the amount Pullmann credits him for. By contrast, Indiana went from 0 to more than 29,000 in four years. The program there was capped at 7,500 its first year and at 15,000 in its second, but now has no cap. Wisconsin’s program outside Milwaukee and Racine is still capped at 1,000 students, though Walker and legislators have signalled they want to raise that limit in the next term. Voucher advocate Kara Kerwin, president of the Center for Education Reform, said Pullmann was right to describe Walker’s approach as incrementalism compared to the Indiana experience. But ""Indiana was in a different position because others had already paved the road,"" Kerwin said. Both states fared very well in the Center’s 2014 state scorecard on voucher plans. Indiana ranked #1 (""a universal voucher program open to all students across the state and no limit on the number of vouchers that can be awarded."") Wisconsin tied for #2 (""a much-restricted statewide program, both in terms of income eligibility and number of available vouchers."") Finally, the political front. Walker faced the reality that some GOP senators balked at expanding the program beyond Milwaukee and Racine. He proposed a cap, but one that would expire; legislators made the 1,000-student limit indefinite.

Barack Obama: Position on immigration action through executive orders 'hasn't changed'
","President Barack Obama is on the verge of announcing significant executive actions that could affect at least a portion of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. As is often the case these days, rumors and pieces of the plan have floated through the media for a couple weeks now, and Obama appears ready to announce the full details Thursday night in an address to the nation. The decision to act unilaterally without going through Congress is not only controversial, but could it also be a change in direction for the Obama administration? Obama doesn’t see it that way. The Democratic leader was asked about his immigration plan during his trip to Australia for the G20 Summit on Nov. 16. Jim Avila of ABC asked, ""In 2010, when asked by immigration reform advocates to stop deportations and act alone on providing legal status for the undocumented, you said, ‘I’m president, I’m not king. I can’t do these things just by myself.’ In 2013, you said, ‘I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.’ Mr. President, what has changed since then?"" Obama replied: ""Well, actually, my position hasn’t changed. When I was talking to the advocates, their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress. And getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities. There are certain things I cannot do. There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws."" First, Obama is revising history. While at one point he used the ""I am not a king"" line to rebut those who asked why his administration wasn’t doing enough to address comprehensive reform, as you’ll see, he continued to use it when asked about other, more limited uses with his executive powers. Second, taking any additional executive actions, no matter how limited, is still a reversal from his positions over the past few years. Revising history Let’s go to the first interview Avila mentions, a 2010 exchange with Eddie Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision station. This interview took place well before the Senate passed an immigration overhaul that stalled in the House. Sotelo: ""Mr. President, you were able to pass a health care plan and you worked a lot for that. And most of my listeners, they haven't seen that, the same way that you worked for health care for immigration reform. The same effort."" Obama: ""My cabinet has been working very hard on trying to get it done, but ultimately, I think somebody said the other day, I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I'm committed to making it happen, but I've gotta have some partners to do it."" The second conversation Avila references was from a Google Hangout town hall that Obama conducted in February 2013. Obama was asked by a participant what he was going to do until immigration reform was passed ""to ensure that more people aren’t being deported, and families aren’t being broken apart."" Obama replied: ""This is something that I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that, you know, I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. The question wasn’t a request for ""duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress,"" as Obama characterized it this week. The bipartisan Senate bill involved billions of dollars in border security measures and a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Instead, he was asked what he can do as executive to slow deportations and keep families together, a much more limited request (and, according to reports, exactly what he will address tonight). Similarly, a month earlier, Obama was asked why he couldn’t do for an undocumented mother of three what he did for DREAMers. Obama replied, ""I’m not a king.  You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. ... But to sort through all the possible cases — of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell — is very difficult to do."" Change in position In the absence of a comprehensive bill passed by Congress, Obama on Nov. 19 said what he is ""going to be laying out is things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better"" during tonight’s national address. According to various media reports, that will include a plan to remove the threat of deportation for up to 5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The bulk of those affected would be individuals who are parents of children born in the United States that are currently living in the country illegally. That provision could expand further if the parents of the so-called DREAMers — undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children — were allowed to remain as well. We’ll see if that comes to fruition. Regardless, that Obama is promising to take any steps to address undocumented immigrants still represents a significant change. As Obama told Avila this week, his announcement will address, ""what’s within our authority to do in reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we can’t do everything."" Earlier this month, Obama told reporters that when House Republicans expressed they would not take up an immigration bill this year, ""What I indicated to him is I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse."" Juxtapose that with his previous statements. In the 2013 Google town hall, Obama said, ""we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can."" Similarly, in March 2011, as pointed out in fact-checks by the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org, Obama was asked in a Univision town hall whether he could grant temporary protective status to undocumented students. He first explained why he could not, and then he addressed the idea of immigration through executive action more broadly. ""With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed,"" Obama said. ""Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. ""There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president."" In September 2013, Obama was asked during an interview with Noticias Telemundo whether he could consider freezing deportations for parents of deferred-action kids. Not only does Obama say he cannot, but he throws cold water on the idea of having ""the president sign something."" ""What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. We're not going to have them operate under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option."" On Nov. 18, White House press secretary Josh Earnest was asked about this interview and told reporters, ""Since this interview aired, the president did direct the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the law to determine what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address."" Our ruling When asked to explain why he suddenly feels he can use executive action to address immigration issues, Obama said, ""My position hasn’t changed.""  Obama has been asked about his ability to use his office to change immigration rules in the U.S. in many ways throughout the years. Sometimes, he has been asked broadly, but other times, he was asked about very specific measures, such as not splitting up families or freezing deportations for parents of DREAMers. In answering those questions, Obama’s position has clearly changed. Whereas he used to say his ability to take action ended at deferring action on DREAMers, he now is saying there are at least some things he can do and intends to do. Even absent the specifics of his plan, it’s very clear his tune is much different now. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096682400>],/factchecks/2014/nov/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-position-immigration-action-through-e/

Jeb Bush says Orange County schools made it impossible for students to receive below a 50
","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a speech that we shouldn’t worry so much about students’ self-esteem when it comes to setting grades. And he wagged his finger at Orange County, Florida. ""This morning, over 213 million Chinese students went to school and nobody debated whether academic expectations should be lowered in order to protect their students’ self esteem,"" he said in his keynote to the National Summit on Education Reform on Nov. 20, 2014. ""Yet in Orange County, Fla., last week I read that debate actually did occur at a school board meeting. The school board voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50. You get 50 out of 100 just for showing up and signing your name. This was done  -- and I quote here from a local official -- ‘so that the students do not lose all hope.’ "" Bush went on to cite statistics that showed students in Shanghai far outranking their peers in the United States in reading and math. ""An overriding concern for self-esteem instead of high expectations does not get you to No. 1,"" he said. ""It gets you to No. 21."" So is 50 the new zero in Orange County schools? We went in search of answers. Orange County On Nov. 11, the Orange County school board took a vote on grading policies for middle and high school students that has received widespread attention. The vote was part of changes to the district’s ""student progression plan,"" which outlines instructional goals and policies for the year. One piece of that plan related to a new grading policy. Superintendent Barbara Jenkins told the board that one provision would ban grades lower than a 50 when grades for the nine-week quarter or semester are determined. However, grades below a 50 would still be possible on individual assignments. In other words, students could still get lower than a 50 on a specific test, but no longer for the entire grading period. The district already started the policy last year; the purpose of the board’s vote was to codify the practice. The goal is to give students some hope that if they are failing early in the year, they can catch up and ultimately pass the class. Last year, 43 percent of students in the county who got an ""F"" the first quarter ended up failing the class. However the remainder of students were able to recover, with the majority getting a ""D."" ""It is still very difficult for children to recover if that nine-week grade is an F,"" Jenkins told the school board. ""However, stopping them at 50 does not bury them so deep that they lose all hope and have no reason to continue for the rest of year."" Some teachers told the school board they opposed the policy. ""Are we really helping students by inflating grades, or are we harming them?"" asked high school teacher Wendy Doromal. ""I say we are harming them by conditioning them to think they can skate by with little effort."" Most of the board members supported the plan as a way to give students one last chance to pull their grades out of a failing mark. ""It’s just to help kids dig themselves out of a hole,"" school board member Daryl Flynn said. The school board voted in favor of the plan, 7-1, with member Rick Roach dissenting. (Board chair Bill Sublette said he opposed the 50 percent rule, however he said was voting ""yes"" for the overall plan which included several policies related to student assessment.) Orange County school officials determined that their grading plan follows state law -- however the state Department of Education hasn’t weighed in on whether it agress with that assessment. However, the state’s public schools chancellor wrote a memo to superintendents in 2009 raising concerns that some were not using the 0-59 scale set in state law. Florida statute sets grade ranges as follows: 90 – 100 = A 80 – 89 = B 70 – 79 = C 60 – 69 = D 0 – 59 = Failure Many districts, including Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas, follow those guidelines and haven’t added any rules setting 50 as a minimum standard for report cards. ""We give kids the grade they earn,"" Hillsborough spokesman Stephen Hegarty told PolitiFact. ""If it's below 50, then you get a 30 or a zero, or whatever score you earn."" The topic of setting a minimum number for an ""F"" grade has been hotly contested nationwide, including in New York, Oregon and Texas. After a Texas school district proposed a minimum F grade, the state Legislature passed a Truth-In-Grading law. A judge upheld the law in 2010, ruling against school districts that argued they could require teachers to give minimum grades such as a 50 on report cards. Experts weigh in Is what Orange County’s doing tantamount to grade inflation? Not necessarily. The main concern about grade inflation hasn’t been about making F students into D students -- it has been about making A the most common grade in high schools and colleges, said Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University geology professor who has done research on grading. ""The impact of even a nationwide policy of ‘no less than 50’ on GPAs would be tiny,"" he told PolitiFact. ""We're taking Joe and Jane Averages and making their parents believe they are Joe and Jane Geniuses. The Joe and Jane Flunkers are still flunking out of school."" As for Bush’s statement, Rojstaczer said ""A ‘no less than 50’ policy isn't about self esteem. It's about trying to make it possible for a small percentage of students to barely cross over the bar and graduate."" Thomas Guskey, a University of Kentucky Education professor, made the case against percentage grades in a 2013 article in Educational Leadership, a publication of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Guskey wrote that ""although some have suggested minimum grade policies promote grade inflation and social promotion in schools, well-designed, longitudinal studies show this is not the case,"" he wrote. ""Rather, school districts implement minimum-grade policies simply to eliminate the confounding effects of a zero in a percentage grading system."" Our ruling Bush said that the Orange County school board ""voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50. You get 50 out of 100 just for showing up and signing your name."" The school board voted that 50 is the minimum number for quarter and semester grades, though it’s still possible to get a lower grade on an individual assignment or test.
