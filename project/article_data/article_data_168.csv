Clayton officials say housing program has employed 1,300 people
","
Clayton County got a boost from the federal government in April 2009 in its effort to combat the ongoing crisis of mortgage foreclosures.

The south metro Atlanta county received a $9.7 million grant through the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program to buy foreclosed homes, fix them up and resell them to new buyers.

County officials say they've noticed another benefit of the federal program -- the effort is keeping people employed and helping others get hired. Clayton's NSP manager, Mickie Williams, told county commissioners at a Sept. 7 meeting that about 1,300 people have been employed through the program over the past seven months. That sounds like good news when you consider that the most recent unemployment rate is 10.2 percent in Clayton and the nine other counties that are part of the Atlanta Regional Commission.

Williams repeated the claim she made to commissioners in a telephone interview with AJC PolitiFact Georgia. She said she may be underestimating the total.

""We're keeping the doors open on some of the small businesses,"" Williams said.

So how did Clayton County come to this conclusion?

Williams said the county had 114 homes under contract in the past seven months. She said the county hires at least 12 people to work on the purchase, renovation and selling of each home. That adds up to 1,368. The workers include contractors, loan officers, appraisers, inspectors, real estate agents, asset management, construction workers and the cleaning crew.

John Adams, a longtime real estate investor who writes a weekly column for the AJC's Homefinder section, called Clayton County's methodology to come up with the number of people employed through the program ""loose.""

Adams wondered how long was each person employed and about the significance of the work they performed.

""I don't doubt the number, but I question its meaning,"" he said.

Adams directed us to a 2008 study by the National Association of Home Builders. The study found 1.1 construction jobs are created when you spend $100,000 to remodel a home. Three construction jobs are created when you build a new home. We found a 2009 report on that organization's website that estimated 78 jobs were supported by each $10 million spent on remodeling homes in a typical metro area. NAHB used federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data to come up with its findings. Paul Emrath, a co-author of the report, said the 78 job estimate is full-time positions that someone worked during an entire 12-month period.

There's little research on the impact of the NSP on job creation and retention. Its focus is on getting people into homes. Clayton officials estimate there are about 900 foreclosures per month. The state of Georgia received $77 million during the first round of grants. Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties were awarded NSP grants, as well as the city of Atlanta. Clayton started spending its NSP funds in January, Williams said.

The NSP program, which was passed in 2008, is administered under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Joseph Phillips, a regional spokesman for HUD, said the federal agency does not keep track of how many people are employed through each grant recipient. The city of Atlanta has a list of 185 vendors who have done work for its NSP efforts, but they do not keep a breakdown of how many people are employed in each project.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia interviewed several people who buy, renovate and resell foreclosed homes. Each one said they worked with a dozen or more people during the process. Bryan Eastman, who builds homes in several southeast Atlanta neighborhoods, rattled off the names of 25 different types of people he works with. Jeff Baillis, who fixes up homes in southwest Atlanta, said he typically works with about a dozen people. The work usually takes more than a month.

""You can keep going and going and going,"" said Philippe Pellerin of Real Estate Alliance Partners, an Atlanta NSP partner who buys and resells homes in Atlanta neighborhoods like Peoplestown and Summerhill.

We went back to a key question Adams asked: How long do these architects, drywall contractors and closing attorneys work on these projects?

Williams said that is difficult to estimate because each project is different. The drywall repair work on one house may take more time than another, she said.

Greg Shealey, a leader of one of the four asset management teams Clayton County used to handle the construction work on its NSP efforts, said one house may take two weeks to fix while another could take about two months. He estimated the crews spend about 60 hours a week on each house.

Emrath and others noted, job creation and retention was not the main purpose of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. No one interviewed doubted 1,300 people have been hired to do work by Clayton County. But, as Emrath and others said, it would be easier to examine the numbers if Clayton had a breakdown of how much work each person hired performed for the county.

People who work independently to buy, fix up and resell homes offer similar estimates to Clayton concerning the number of people they've hired to do such work.

Clayton County's initial statement appears accurate. But it's based on estimates that can't be confirmed, and for that reason, we believe it needs more context. We rate the NSP estimate as Half True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/14/mickie-williams/clayton-officials-say-housing-program-has-employed/

Austan Goolsbee says John Boehner wants to repeal stimulus tax cuts
","
On ABC's This Week on Sept. 12, 2010, Austan Goolsbee, the new chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, picked up on President Barack Obama's recent attacks on House Republican Leader John Boehner.

""I would point out that Representative Boehner has a different view and is calling for repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle class people,"" Goolsbee said.

That Boehner has called for a halt to stimulus spending is undisputed. The question is whether that means Boehner would put the kibosh on the Making Work Pay tax credits included in the economic stimulus package that passed in early 2009. The tax credits came to $400 for working individuals, $800 per couple, per year in 2009 and 2010. It was estimated to benefit about 110 million Americans.

We asked Boehner's spokesman Michael Steel about Goolsbee's statement.

""That is not correct,"" Steel wrote in an e-mail. ""The savings we outline from cancelling unspent stimulus funds does not include Making Work Pay.""

We can see where the confusion arose. In his public statements about stopping stimulus spending, Boehner hasn't been particularly clear on the point.

For example, in February 2010, Boehner released a statement calling on the Obama administration to start cutting spending immediately, and ""that can begin by repealing spending from the stimulus."" He doesn't make clear if he is leaving out the tax credits.

More recently, when David Gregory questioned Boehner in an NBC Meet the Press interview on Aug. 8, 2010, about how Republicans would offset the cost of extending all of the Bush tax cuts, as they have proposed, Boehner responded, ""Why don't we stop the stimulus spending? ... Why don't we stop it. It's not working.""

Making Work Tay tax credits are stimulus spending. And while they are set to expire in just a few months (the end of 2010), in theory, the government could cut them off tomorrow.

But we think Steel has credible evidence to support the claim that Boehner's call to repeal stimulus spending did not extend to Making Work Pay. His previous comments have focused entirely on the stimulus spending programs, not the tax cuts.

For example, in the Meet the Press interview, Boehner voiced support for spending cuts outlined by Republican Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling -- which suggested there was $266 billion in unspent stimulus that could be redirected to pay down the deficit. In a previous item, we looked into the claim that there was really that much ""unspent"" stimulus, and concluded there was actually much less, even if you included money from Making Work Pay that the government hasn't yet paid out.

More importantly, though, the plan from the Republican caucus of the Commitee on the Budget to ""Cancel remaining 'stimulus' funds"" specifically references H.R. 3140, introduced by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. Price's bill targets ""unspent stimulus,"" and the legislative language makes clear that the stimulus package's tax sections -- including the Making Work Pay tax credit -- would not be impacted.

According to a section by section summary of the bill from the Republican Study Committee, Price's bill ""rescinds or repeals all of the spending in the 'stimulus' excepting only the tax provisions and the unemployment benefits."" Press releases issued from legislative co-sponsors of the bill also note that the tax provisions of the stimulus would not be impacted.

There are some political games being played by both sides here, of course. Republicans like Boehner want to attack the stimulus without acknowledging that it included tax relief (an idea Republicans traditionally support). And Democrats want to remind that it does. But in this case, we think Goolsbee is overreaching to make his point. Yes, Boehner and other Republicans have talked about putting a halt to all unspent stimulus -- and without being more specific, one might wonder if that includes money not yet spent on tax credits. But when you dig into the nitty-gritty of the Republicans' plan, it specifically notes that it does not include repeal of Making Work Pay. And so we rule Goolsbee's claim False.",/factchecks/2010/sep/13/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-boehner-wants-repeal-stimulus/

Goolsbee says millionaires' tax cuts average $100,000
","
Tax cuts passed under the Bush administration have been in place for close to ten years, but they will expire at the end of 2010 if Congress doesn't take action. Add in a weak economy, big government deficits, and an upcoming election, and you've got one of the most pressing policy issues of the year.

President Barack Obama's administration wants to see the tax cuts made permanent for individuals who make less than $200,000 a year and couples who make less than $250,000 a year. Tax rates would go up for people who make more than that.

Austan Goolsbee defended that position on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Goolsbee is one of Obama's top economic officials, and was recently selected to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, which counsels the president on economic policy.

Obama has been ""quite clear,"" Goolsbee said, ""that borrowing $700 billion to extend tax cuts that average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires is the least effective bang for the buck we have.""

We were interested in that $100,000 number -- that extending the expiring tax cuts would ""average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires.""

The White House pointed us to data from the Ways and Means Committee, the committee in the U.S. House of Representatives charged with writing tax legislation. Democrats on the committee asked the Joint Committee on Taxation for an analysis of extending the expiring tax cuts. The Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, is a nonpartisan committee with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants who conduct research.

The JCT crunched the numbers to generate several tables estimating tax revenues if the tax cuts expire, and how many taxpayers would be affected. The JCT found that, for those who have income of $1 million or more, extending the Bush tax cuts would mean $32.7 billion that the government would not collect in 2011. That amount would apply to 315,000 tax filers. Divide the foregone tax revenues by the number of filers, and you get $103,809, or just over $100,000, as Goolsbee said.

We also checked with the Tax Policy Center, an independent, nonpartisan think tank that generates economic projections similar to those of the JCT. The Tax Policy Center found that the average tax increase to millionaires and up would be $128,832. That's a bit higher than the JCT estimate, but for a complex economic analysis, it's fairly close. The center's numbers also supports Goolsbee's statement that extending the tax cuts would ""average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires.""

To get the point of view of someone who opposes letting the current tax rates expire, we turned to the conservative Heritage Foundation. J.D. Foster said he didn't argue with the numbers, but with Goolsbee's focus on millionaires. Many of those who make more than $200,000 or $250,000 are not millionaires, and those people will see a tax increase as well.

""If they only intend to raise taxes on millionaires, then they need to change their proposal,"" Foster said. ""I understand it's a convenient rhetorical ploy, but its factually incorrect.""

This is a fair point: Goolsbee talked about a $700 billion cost, which is a general estimate for what extending the tax cuts for 10 years would cost for all higher earners, not just millionaires.

We went back to the analysis and found calculations for what the Bush tax cuts are worth for other high incomes. The JCT found that for those who make between $500,000 and $1 million, the lower rates were worth an average $17,467 per tax filer, and for those who make between $200,000 and $500,000, the lower rates were worth $7,152 per tax filer. The Tax Policy Center's numbers were similar.

So Goolsbee is correct that the expiring tax cuts are worth, on average, more than $100,000 for millionaires and billionaires. But the proposal the president supports would let tax cuts expire for some people who make high salaries but aren't millionaires, which Goolsbee didn't mention. So we deduct a tick from the Truth-O-Meter and rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/13/austan-goolsbee/Goolsbee-millionaires-tax-cuts-average/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Robert Gibbs']","
Is Robert Gibbs right to call John Boehner's stance on tax extensions a ""change in position""?
","
House Republican Leader John Boehner, made headlines on the Sept. 12, 2010, edition of CBS' Face the Nation with his comments about a limited extension of George W. Bush-era tax cuts.

During the show, host Bob Schieffer asked the Ohio Republican to elaborate on his approach to extending a series of tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of this year. President Barack Obama and key Democratic leaders are seeking to renew the tax cuts for Americans earning below $200,000 (for single earners) and below $250,000 (for married couples). By contrast, Republican leaders, including Boehner, have consistently called for renewing the tax cuts for all taxpayers, regardless of income. (Some Democrats have said they would side with the Republicans, at least for the next year or two.)

Schieffer pressed him on whether he would be willing to vote for the more limited Democratic approach. ""If the only option I have is to vote for some of those tax reductions ... I’ll vote for them,"" Boehner responded. ""But I’ve been making the point now for months that we need to extend all the current rates for all Americans if we want to get our economy going again and we want to get jobs in America.""

Schieffer then made several attempts to confirm that Boehner really meant that he could support the Democratic version if it came to that. Boehner said that he could. ""Bob, we don’t know what the bill is going to say, all right?"" Boehner said. ""If the only option I have is to vote for those at ($250,000) and below, of course, I’m going to do that. But I’m going to do everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans.""

The White House pounced on Boehner's comment and suggested he had flip-flopped.

In a one-sentence statement issued later that afternoon, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, ""We welcome John Boehner's change in position and support for the middle class tax cuts, but time will tell if his actions will be anything but continued support for the failed policies that got us into this mess.""

We thought it would be worth checking whether Boehner's statement represented a ""change in position.""

Boehner's staff doesn't dispute that prior to the Face the Nation appearance, Boehner hadn't gone so far as to say he'd support a Democratic bill that would not extend the cuts for the wealthiest Americans. So there is some truth to the White House's characterization of the statement as a ""change in position."" Previously, he hadn't mentioned that possibility; suddenly, he did. On some level, that is a ""change of position.""

But it leaves out a lot of context we think is important. In the interview, it actually took four questions by Schieffer to elicit a conciliatory answer from Boehner toward the Democratic proposal. In his answers to those first three questions, Boehner made clear that he favored extending the tax cuts for all brackets.

Boehner said in response to Schieffer's first question, ""I think raising taxes in ... a very weak economy is a really, really bad idea. And most economists would agree with that. And I just think that if we’re going to extend the tax cuts for some Americans, why don’t we extend ... the current tax rates to all Americans, ... and get rid of some of the uncertainty that is out there, so that small businesses can plan and reinvest in ... their business and the new economy.""

And in the same response that made so much news, Boehner reiterated, ""I’ve been making the point now for months that we need to extend all the current rates for all Americans.""

Indeed, Boehner has been consistent about that. In a high-profile economic address before the City Club of Cleveland on Aug. 24, 2010, Boehner said, ""President Obama should work with Republicans to stop all of these job-killing tax hikes."" And in a Sep. 8, 2010, press release in response to an economic speech by the president, Boehner advocated a ""two-point plan for immediate, bipartisan action on jobs and spending,"" with one of the two points being ""a two-year freeze on all current tax rates.""

We'll add that the second part of Gibbs' statement -- that ""we welcome John Boehner's change in position and support for the middle class tax cuts"" -- also raised a question in our mind.

If Gibbs is merely thanking Boehner for his longtime, consistent support of ""middle-class tax cuts"" then we would have have no quarrel with his description. But coming immediately after Gibbs' expression of ""welcome"" for ""Boehner's change in position,"" we feel that a reasonable person might conclude that Boehner had previously opposed middle-class tax cuts and now supports them. And suggesting that would be inaccurate, since Boehner has not wavered in his support of extending the middle-class portion of the tax cuts.

So we think it is a stretch for Gibbs to say Boehner has changed his position. It's very clear that Boehner still supports extending the tax cuts for people of all incomes. He was asked how he would vote under a very specific scenario and he answered the question. Yes, Boehner added a new aspect to that position -- that he's willing to support the other extensions even if they don't cover the wealthiest Americans. But in the same interview and elsewhere, Boehner has repeatedly said he supports extending the tax cuts for all Americans. That's sounds like a lot of consistency with a bit of change thrown in. So we find Gibbs' claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/sep/13/robert-gibbs/robert-gibbs-right-call-john-boehners-stance-tax-e/

Would Rick Scott be Florida's first bald governor?
","
2010 is a historic election year in Florida. 
A gripping three-way U.S. Senate race that could decide the balance of power in Washington. Competitive races for the state Cabinet. A proposed constitutional amendment that could shape state growth for decades. 
Then there's the governor's race, where the Nov. 2 election will produce either Florida's first female chief executive or, a leading Republican says, its first bald one. 
(Cue screeching of brakes.) You read that right — bald. 
Republican Party of Florida Chairman John Thrasher made that claim about Rick Scott on Sept. 10 at a victory party in Scott's honor. ""Rick, we will be the first party to elect a bald guy to governor,"" was the exact quote, according to the Associated Press' Brendan Farrington. 
Editors note: Being serious fact-checkers, PolitiFact Florida immediately abandoned analyses about the future of Social Security, the extension of the Bush tax cuts and federal hurricane policy. The staff thought it that critical to see if Scott can make hair history. 
Because hair, after all, is a nonpartisan political issue. 
The Economist, in a recent piece, raced hair in politics back to the Roman Republic, telling the story of how enemies of an up-and-coming young general Publius Cornelius Scipio tried to derail his rise by implying that he grew his hair un-Romanly long, in a Greek style that seemed soft and suspicious. Then there's the modern-day stories of John Edwards' $400 haircuts during the 2008 presidential campaign and Marco Rubio having to explain that his $135 barbershop bill in Miami wasn't for a back wax. 
Scott, himself, already has poked fun at his (lack of) hair. ""Remember me, the handsome bald guy?"" Scott said during his primary night victory speech. 
Let the record show, Scott does have speckled gray and white hair around the sides and back of his head, but he is bald on the top and describes himself as bald. 
The official definition, let the record also show, is ""lacking a natural or usual covering,"" according to Merriam-Webster. 
Knowing all that, we turned to Museum of Florida History Senior Curator Lisa Barton to help our exclusive investigation. Barton, among other things, curates the exhibit of the official portraits of Florida's governors on display at Florida's Historic Capitol building in Tallahassee.

She dutifully scoured the portraits, which you can see for yourself online.

""Check out the portrait of the 15th governor, Harrison Reed,"" she said. ""It looks like he was bald on top.""

Reed served as the state's governor from 1868-1873. He's the 15th person to hold the title of governor, and the ninth after statehood. He was a Republican who faced two serious impeachment attempts from members of his own party, according to his biography. After leaving office, Reed became editor of the Semi-Tropical, a monthly magazine devoted to southern agricultural and economic development. He died in Jacksonville, where a street is named in his honor, in 1899. 
But none of that's really germane to this investigation. His head is. The bald top of his head. Just look at his official portrait. 
""Reed was a little man, slightly built, with a big, bald head and a bushy beard -- almost goat-like -- the upper lip shaven clean,"" wrote William Watson Davis in the book The Civil War and Reconstruction in Florida, Volume 53. ""A full fringe of hair on three sides of the bald spot, a high forehead, and heavy spectacles gave him an owl-like appearance, which accentuated his calm moderation and well-poised personal address."" 
Richard Nelson Current in Those Terrible Carpetbaggers had the same opinion, describing Reed as ""bushy-bearded, bald-headed, (and) bespectacled."" 
During our thorough investigation, we uncovered several governors with receding hairlines but we're hesitant to declare any other governor bald. William Dunn Moseley, the first elected governor of Florida post-statehood, was perhaps closest (he has no hair from his forehead to the crown of his head in his official portrait) — but far from a Shaquille O'Neal. 
Other contenders included George Franklin Drew (12th state governor, very high hairline), William Dunnington Bloxham (13th governor, widow's peak), and C. Farris Bryant (34th governor, balding. But bald?) 
To confirm the results of our investigation, we turned to Mike Mercado, a stylist for 11 years who has spent the past three working as an educator at the Aveda Institute in St. Petersburg. We showed him pictures of Scott, as well as the previous governors. 
He reached a stunning conclusion: He doesn't think Scott is bald at all. ""He definitely looks bald because he clips the hair on his side so short,"" Mercado said. 
But Scott calls himself bald, we said. Bald on top might be a more accurate description, Mercado said. 
And for the others? He singled out Reed and Moseley. If they clipped their remaining hair as short as Scott, they would look ""just as bald,"" Mercado said. 
So Thrasher said Scott would be a trailblazer for bald Floridians, being the first bald person elected governor. Thrasher — sorry, bad-pun police — is a hair off. First, there is a debate if Scott is truly bald. And even putting that aside, Reed was ""just as bald"" as Scott way back in 1868, and is described by historians as bald. We rate Thrasher's statement False.

Obama said Boehner opposes tax rule to keep profits and jobs in the USA
","
President Barack Obama has been in campaign mode this month, no doubt looking toward the elections less than two months away. In two speeches recently, he's said American companies shouldn't be rewarded for shipping jobs and profits overseas, but warned that Republicans don't agree.

Obama discussed aid the federal government sent to the states in August, part of a package to pay teacher salaries. The aid was offset by changes to the tax code that closed what Obama said were loopholes for corporations.

""By the way, this bill that we passed to save all those jobs, we made sure that bill wouldn't add to the deficit,"" Obama said in a speech on Labor Day. ""You know how we paid for it? By closing one of these ridiculous tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas. I mean, this was one of those loopholes that allowed companies to write off taxes they pay to foreign governments –- even though they weren't paying taxes here in the United States.""

""So middle-class families were footing tax breaks for companies creating jobs somewhere else,"" Obama added. ""I mean, even a lot of America's biggest corporations agreed that this loophole didn't make sense, agreed that it needed to be closed, agreed that it wasn't fair -– but the man who thinks he's going to be speaker, he wants to reopen this loophole.""

We wanted to know two things: Is the law Obama talks about really ""one of these ridiculous tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas""? And does Ohio's John Boehner -- the current House Republican leader -- want to reverse the law?

Let's take these questions in order.

Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10. It sends $26.1 billion to states facing budget shortfalls, providing $10 billion for salaries and compensation for teachers and another $16.1 million to help states pay for Medicaid, the long-standing government insurance program for the poor and disabled. The law also includes ""offsets,"" which is any kind of spending cut or tax increase that balances out the new spending so that it doesn't add to the deficit. This closed the ""loopholes"" that Obama mentions by taking away exemptions and credits that previously existed, which increases revenues by $9.8 billion over 10 years.

The summary of the law from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service lists seven different credits or exemptions that the law changes.

The United States government taxes its companies on foreign profits, which not all countries do. But companies don't have to pay taxes on foreign earnings until they bring their profits back to this country. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as possible. But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments. Some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid on the same income to foreign governments. That's the loophole the new law is trying to address. It says companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until they report their income.

Boehner's office sent us several letters from business groups who opposed the law. During the debate over the measure, companies said any increase in taxes would make American companies less competitive with their foreign rivals.

""The current U.S. system is inconsistent with the free flow of trade and investment, and it inhibits use of foreign earnings to invest in the U.S. economy. The provisions included in the House legislation to be considered today will only make matters worse,"" wrote Larry Burton, executive director of the Business Roundtable, in a letter to members of Congress. The Business Roundtable represents chief executive officers of major U.S. companies.

We queried several tax professors via e-mail to see what their take on the new law was. We got a range of responses, but they all agreed that companies with international operations can shield profits from being taxed, and these changes make that harder.

""The rules that were changed were necessary, if narrowly targeted, reforms of the foreign tax credit rules,"" said Robert Peroni of the University of Texas at Austin. ""The old rules resulted in overstated foreign tax credits for some U.S. multinational corporations, resulting in those corporations paying lower U.S. income taxes than they should have paid under a properly designed U.S. international income tax system.""

""It's hard to deny that there was a problem. There clearly was a problem,"" said David Rosenbloom of New York University. ""But companies worried that any rules that the IRS adopts will be very hard to confine to only the abuse situations.""

The tax experts also said it's difficult to prove whether American companies with business overseas employ fewer people in the United States because of the tax rules.

""The connection between the loophole and jobs being shipped overseas is tenuous at best,"" Rosenbloom said.

Finally, Lawrence Lokken of the University of Florida warned us that even experts disagree about the effects of some international tax rules. ""Whether the current system encourages companies to move jobs offshore, and whether these fixes will discourage companies from doing so, are hotly debated issues. You can find entirely respectable opinion on each side of the issues,"" he said.

So does Boehner want to reverse the new rule? Yes, said his spokesman Michael Steel. Boehner ""opposes the change the President mentioned but would strongly disagree with the way the President characterizes it,"" Steel said via e-mail.

We're fact-checking Obama's statement that John Boehner wants to reopen a ""tax loopholes that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas."" The tax experts we spoke with said the rules did attempt to close loopholes in the tax system. The loopholes had to do with companies keeping profits overseas. Boehner does oppose the measure. The point we question is whether re-opening the tax loophole will result in jobs being shipped overseas. We do not see a connection there, based on what the tax experts said. That's a pretty big caveat. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.

"['Ohio', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'John Boccieri']","
Democratic Rep. John Boccieri invokes GOP Sen. John McCain to back his cap-and-trade stance
","Democratic Rep. John Boccieri has taken heat from Republicans ever since his 2009 vote for a House energy bill that would establish a ""cap and trade"" system designed to reduce emission of the greenhouse gasses thought to cause global warming.

The system would impose a government cap on allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, like electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or purchase credits to allow continued emissions. Either way, the cost likely would be passed along to consumers. Critics of the program have said it would be particularly harmful in Ohio, where a high proportion of electricity is derived from coal-burning power plants that would be most affected by the proposed law.

Groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee have criticized Boccieri for his vote, placing ads in his district that say the system amounts to a nationwide electricity tax that would drive up the nation’s electricity rates.

Boccieri, from Alliance, Ohio, has repeatedly said that he favored the bill because it would create renewable energy jobs in his district that can’t be shipped overseas, and would protect national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil from unstable regions like the Middle East.

During an interview Aug. 18, he stated the ""cap and trade"" concept was originally a Republican idea, and expressed frustration with the GOP’s current opposition.

""Only in Washington can you propose an idea, introduce legislation and then campaign against it,"" Boccieri said. ""I don’t understand what Republicans are doing against this. It was their idea. John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times.""

Boccieri is correct that the ""cap and trade"" concept was pioneered by Republicans.

MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins noted in July that Ronald Reagan used a ""cap-and-trade"" system to phase out leaded gasoline and George H.W. Bush established a ""cap-and-trade"" system that reduced the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain.

In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the ""Climate Stewardship Act,"" which would have used a similar cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007.

""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies,"" McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. ""Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life.""

McCain’s 2007 version was cosponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap-and-trade programs in their presidential platforms.

If cap-and-trade legislation was backed by the 2008 presidential contenders from both political parties, why hasn’t it been a shoo-in for implementation?

In short, working out the details has been complicated.

The carbon emissions that cause global warming behave differently in the atmosphere than the sulfur emissions that cause acid rain, making it harder to design a ""cap-and-trade"" program that will control them. The acid rain program created in the ‘90s ""addressed a relatively small number of major sources that could comply simply by using off-the-shelf-technology. By contrast, carbon dioxide is emitted from sources throughout the economy and cannot be sufficiently addressed by technology currently at our disposal,"" Ohio GOP Sen. George Voinovich told National Journal’s Congress Daily.

Another culprit was legislative maneuvering by the lead sponsors of the House climate bill, Democrats Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. As The New York Times put it, in order to gain passage for the bill  ""a cornucopia of concessions and exemptions"" were granted to ""coal companies, utilities, refiners, heavy industry and agribusiness. The original simplicity was lost, replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals.""

McCain’s staff did not respond to our request to discuss his stance on the House cap-and-trade bill that Boccieri supported. Until late August, McCain faced a tough primary battle against former GOP congressman J. D. Hayworth, who had criticized McCain’s support for cap-and-trade. Energy expert Frank Maisano said McCain has been silent on the issue recently, because of ""political pressures he was getting from the right"" during that campaign.

We find Boccieri’s statement that John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times to be True. Comment on this item.

Wisconsin state Sen. Jeff Plale saved 300 jobs at Bucyrus International
","
The race between state Sen. Jeff Plale (D-South Milwaukee) and Milwaukee County Supervisor Chris Larson may be the hottest legislative contest in Sept. 14 primary. And that doesn’t even include what the candidates themselves are saying.

The district, which stretches from Milwaukee’s blue-collar south suburbs to the city’s affluent east side, is heavily Democratic. But it has a sharp ideological split and Plale is again facing a challenge from the left, based on his support of private school choice and his role in killing a state global warming bill, among other issues.

One outside group is attacking his voting record, another has come to his defense and voters have been buried in a pile of direct mail pieces featuring competing claims.

On the pro-Plale side, the American Federation for Children-- a group that supports the Milwaukee private school voucher program -- is touting Plale’s role in retaining jobs at Bucyrus International, a maker of mining equipment and an important employer in his district. Former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, a Republican, heads the group’s state operation.

One direct-mail piece features a photo of Wynn Sandahl, identified as a 12-year Bucyrus employee, on the cover with this quote: ""It’s the honest truth. Senator Jeff Plale saved my job.""

It says on the back, ""Milwaukee County almost lost 300 jobs. Then Senator Jeff Plale stood up for our community,"" and inside notes as a result ""300 workers just like Wynn Sandahl still report for work everyday at Bucyrus.""

That’s some personalized constituent service.

But what role did Plale, a state legislator, have in an issue that turned on the Obama administration and the U.S. Export-Import Bank?

Export-Import banks are trade promotion agencies that provide financing for projects that, collectively, generate billions of dollars in business and stimulate economies. In this case, the U.S. Export-Import bank, funded by Congress, initially declined to support a $917 million loan to an India-based power company, which planned to use about $600 million to buy mining machines from Bucyrus.

After the rejection, Bucyrus CEO Tim Sullivan started calling a host of local business leaders and elected officials to put pressure on the bank to overturn its decision. At stake, he said, were up to 1,000 company jobs, 300 at the South Milwaukee plant -- work that would go instead to an overseas supplier of the equipment.

Among those Sullivan dialed was the state senator who represents South Milwaukee, Jeff Plale.

A state legislator, of course, has little -- if any -- influence over a Washington agency that handles international trade matters. But having local officials line up with Bucyrus was important,  said Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.

""The list of folks who were helpful includes Sen. Plale,"" said Sheehy, who also credited U.S. Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, both Democrats; U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), and Gov. Jim Doyle and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.  

As for Plale, Sheehy said: ""He did more than his fair share in terms of helping.""

What did he do? A check of more than a dozen Journal Sentinel stories about the mining equipment deal found no mention of Plale.

Plale told PolitiFact Wisconsin he attended a June 30 rally timed to coincide with a visit by Obama to Racine. Plale said he also called a contact in Chicago who he said was ""close to (Obama chief of staff Rahm) Emanuel"" and told the person -- whom he would not name -- that the Bucyrus matter was an important for his district. He asked that the message be forwarded to Emanuel.

""Whether he did that or not, I don’t know,"" Plale said.

The morning of June 30 -- hours before the president arrived in Racine -- the Export-Import Bank indicated that it would reconsider its decision. Although the matter won’t be settled for certain for weeks, the bank took another step in August 2010 that will allow the Bucyrus equipment sale.

So, the jobs aren’t yet saved, but it appears they will be.

Of course, the job the American Federation for Children is concerned about now is Jeff Plale’s.

To support its claim, the only thing the group cites in the literature is a commerce association report on the impact of the deal, which says 1,000 jobs could be affected when suppliers are considered. That report makes no mention of Plale.

So did Plale save the job of Bucyrus employee Wynn Sandahl and some 300 others, as the group claims? Plale did what was asked of him as a local lawmaker to pressure the Obama administration and the bank. But so did many, many others. Plale’s role was a bit part in an international drama, but the group gives him sole responsibility.

Wisconsin state Sen. Jeff Plale ""pocketed"" a $2,500 a year raise when others turned it down
","
Voters in a Milwaukee-area state Senate contest can be forgiven if they are confusing campaign literature with liquor advertising. Citing a laundry-list of complaints, the Progressive Wisconsin Political Fund has been labeling Democratic incumbent Jeff Plale an ""Absolute Conservative.""

Plale is facing Milwaukee County Supervisor Chris Larson in the Sept. 14 primary. The district is heavily Democratic, but ideologically split. That led to the outside groups joining the fray.

On the anti-Plale side, the Progressive Wisconsin Political Fund has mailed a dozen or more pieces, with many using a replica of the Absolut vodka bottle. Plale, of South Milwaukee, says he is puzzled by the vodka bottle image. ""I don’t even like vodka,"" he said.

Less confusing is the message in a piece labeled ""Welcome to Plale’s Playhouse,"" featuring a cartoonish version of Plale standing in a tree house under a sign: ""Typical Politicians Only!"" Citing several issues, the piece argues that Plale puts his own interests before taxpayers.

It includes this claim:

""Last year, while many of his colleagues turned down a $2,500 pay raise because Wisconsin faced a deficit and our families faced tough economic times, Senator Plale pocketed the extra money.""

As a source, the fund cites a Feb. 9, 2009 item from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, which itself is a reprint of a Wisconsin State Journal editorial from the day before.

So did Plale take the money and run?

Members of the state Assembly and Senate are paid $49,943. They received a $2,530 (5.06 percent) annual pay raise, which took effect in January 2009 and lasts for the current two-year legislative term. The raise amounts to about $210 a month.

State lawmakers automatically got the increase to their salary -- a boost set by an administrative panel and approved by a bipartisan committee from both chambers. So there is no way to turn down the salary increase itself.

""I have to pay them their full salary,"" said Robert Marchant, Senate chief clerk and administrator.

The raises come at a time when state employees -- but not state lawmakers -- are required to take 16 unpaid furlough days, eight in the fiscal year that started July 2009 and eight in the fiscal year that started July 2010. And with lots of private-sector employees taking recession-driven pay cuts, many state lawmakers have made a point of giving their raises back.

In the Senate, 31 of the 38 members have returned the money in one form or another, according to Marchant. There are several ways to do this, from taking unpaid furlough days to simply writing a check and depositing it back in the state coffers. Others have given the money to charity, though there is no system for tracking that.

Plale said he is taking 16 unpaid furlough days to ""give back"" his raise.

""That comes close to washing that out,"" Plale said. ""How can I ask my staff to take 16 unpaid work days and not do it myself?""

Will it even out in the end?

 According to Marchant, Plale in July 2009 began docking his monthly paycheck by $91.20. Over the course of two years, that will be the equivalent of 16 days of salary. From July of 2009 to Sept. 1, 2010, Plale had returned $1,276.90.

Over the full two-year period, that would amount to $2,189, or 43 percent of the full raise.

So what about the original claim, that Plale pocketed the money?

Plale’s salary did go up, there was no way to stop that. He did not start giving the money back right away, as a few lawmakers did. Once other state employees were required to take furloughs, Plale imposed the same standard on himself -- long before the direct mail piece was sent. But that approach won’t account for the full raise, only about 43 percent of it.

Report says Georgia Tech professor ""apparently"" gets stimulus dollars to play music
","
A Georgia Tech project funded with stimulus dollars gave two U.S. senators a case of the government spending blues.

The ""Summertime Blues"" report issued by U.S. Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that the federal government gave more than $760,000 worth of stimulus funds to a Georgia Tech professor so he can play tunes with top musicians as part of a research project on creativity.

The project, which the report dubs ""Jamming for Dollars,"" will ""apparently involve the professor jamming with 'world-renowned musicians' to 'hopefully also create satisfying works of art,'"" the report states.

Feds spent three-quarters of a million dollars so a professor can rock out? We had to check this one out.

""Summertime Blues"" is a critique of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was passed to boost the slumping economy. More than a year later, the economy's still in the dumps.

The report singles out 100 projects funded by the act that accomplish ""questionable goals"" or are ""being mismanaged or were poorly planned.""

""The projects featured in the report cannot be considered as an investment in long-term priorities to create and sustain economic growth that the Stimulus was designed to do,"" a press release from McCain's office said.

The ""Jamming for Dollars"" entry quotes directly from a summary of the grant proposal on Research.gov, a website that lists information on federal research grants:

The project ""seek[s] to understand, model, and support improvisation, or real-time collaborative creativity, in the context of jazz, Indian classical, and avantgarde art music,"" according to the project description. ""They will also conduct systematic evaluation of formal models in realistic performance contexts, and use brain imaging of improvising musicians to gain insight into highly creative mental activity.""

To verify this description, we interviewed Parag Chordia, an assistant professor of music at Georgia Tech and one of four researchers with backgrounds in music and computer science leading the project. We also reviewed information from Georgia Tech and the National Science Foundation, or NSF, which approved the grant.

The NSF is an independent federal agency that promotes science and engineering. In 2008, before the stimulus bill passed, the agency asked researchers to submit grant proposals for its CreativeIT program, which funds research in the study of creativity and computing. Agency officials think such research can transform the way we innovate and solve difficult, important problems.

An independent panel of scientists reviewed the music improvisation proposal using criteria that include the qualifications of the researchers, how well the project is designed and whether it will break new ground.

The three-year effort, which was launched last year, studies how the brain improvises music. The larger goal is to create computers that are more intelligent, or can do more thinking for themselves, Chordia said.

How can studying music improvisation do that?

If a jazz trumpeter wants to improvise a solo that will complement what the drummer, guitarist, bassist and other musicians that are backing her up are playing, she can't play arbitrary sounds. She has to choose those that match up with the music from her band.

If a scientist figures out how to describe the choices available to the trumpeter through statistical models, he can tell a computer how to make those choices, too. In other words, the researcher can teach a computer how to think on its feet.

Established musicians do play music as part of the research, but they're doing so while hooked up to machines that record brain waves and other neurological activity as they improvise and play written music, Chordia said.

Researchers will also find statistical models that can tell a computer how to improvise and use them to create computer software that can help budding musicians learn improvisation skills.

More than 40 percent of the $760,000 grant is paying for salaries and wages for senior personnel and five graduate students, plus graduate student tuition. The rest is for travel, materials, overhead and similar expenditures.

In its first year, the research project led to the launch of Khush, a company that employs five people. It created a well-received music IPod app, LaDiDa. The app instantly creates a musical accompaniment to any ditty you sing into your iPod.

So are Chordia and his fellow scientists ""jamming for dollars""?

If you mean using statistical models to develop computing technology that helps foster creativity and leads to new products, yes, Chordia said.

""Am I going to get up on stage and have a jam session and bill the NSF $50,000? The answer is no,"" he added.

McCain's office did not respond to a request for comment.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia agrees with Chordia.

Experienced musicians will perform, but taxpayers are not just paying a professor to partake in jam sessions. They're paying for a team of researchers to study brain activity and break ground in the fields of creativity and computing.

The project was vetted by an independent panel of experts on its merit and quality. It resulted in the launch of a company that employs five people, and pays for the tuition and stipends of five graduate students.

Since the report said the project will ""apparently"" involve the professor jamming with musicians, rather than stating it as an absolute fact, we'll grant Sens. McCain and Coburn a little leeway.

Tom Barrett says Scott Walker is a big spender, despite tax-cutting claims
","
Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker makes much of his efforts to hold down taxes and spending. His focus on taxes has been a hallmark of his eight years as Milwaukee County executive: He’s slashed county jobs, cut spending on parks and programs, and has returned a portion of his paychecks to the county coffers.

So when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat in the race for governor, uses a TV ad to accuse Walker of being a closet big spender, it raises some eyebrows.

In making his claim, Barrett is relying on the Milwaukee County budgets since Walker took office in 2002.  For the 2010 budget, total spending was $1,460,291,522. That’s up $349 million, or 31.5 percent, from the 2003 budget -- the first one crafted by Walker.

At first glance, the claim appears accurate. But Barrett is making an old apples and oranges mash-up: He compares total spending with the tax levy.

The total spending picture includes every penny that comes in the door of the Milwaukee County Courthouse and goes out again, from fees to state and federal aid. Property taxes make up about 18 percent of the total county budget.

Of course, that’s the piece John Q. Taxpayer focuses on.

Between 2003 and 2010, the county’s property tax levy went up 19.9 percent. Using Barrett’s approach, that was a $43.8 million increase. If you take the amount of the levy from the time Walker took office and adjust it for inflation, the total today would be $259 million. The actual figure is $4 million higher, or $263 million.

Of course, Walker does not raise the levy alone. Indeed, he won the county post on a pledge to hold the levy flat.

This has been the pattern: Walker submits a budget that holds the property tax levy at the previous year’s level. The County Board, with a veto-proof margin, returns items to the budget or adds new items to the mix, and the levy rises. To be sure, Walker does take the higher property tax levy and uses it as his starting point for the next year’s budget.

But it has been the board, not Walker, responsible for the annual increases.

That settles the tax side, but the overall argument -- made by Barrett and other Democrats -- remains: Scott Walker is a closet tax and spender.

Let’s look at the spending side, too.

If total county spending had simply kept pace with inflation from 2003 to 2010, it would now tally about $1.3 billion a year. But the actual total is about $140 million higher.

Again, other factors are at work.

In that time the county has taken on additional programs, such as Family Care, that add to the budget. The county administers the programs for other units of government and receives revenue to cover the expense. For instance, Family Care alone has a budget of about $257 million to provide services to elderly and people with disabilities. But all of the money comes from state and federal dollars rather than county property taxes.

Let’s sum it all up:

In his TV ad, Barrett is mixing and matching two very different sets of numbers -- tax increases and overall spending. When it comes to property taxes, it is the County Board that has been increasing the tax levy, over Walker’s objections and vetoes. Walker does, however, build that increase into each future budget. Meanwhile, spending did rise faster than inflation, but mostly because the county took on new responsibilities and state money that went with them.

David Porter says Democrat Jeff Weems has record of lawyering for BP, Enron and big oil companies
","
Republican David Porter, facing Democrat Jeff Weems for a seat on the state body that oversees oil and gas production, suggests voters beware of Weems, a Houston lawyer, before electing him to the Texas Railroad Commission. 
Porter consultant Corbin Casteel said in a July 28 press release: Weems ""claims to represent the ‘working man,’ yet his legal record is one of defending BP, Enron and just about every big oil company against the working man."" 
We wondered if it's accurate to cast Weems, who has practiced law since the early 1990s, as a defender of Big Oil--including BP, widely blamed for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, and Enron, the Houston-based energy company that collapsed in scandal. 
Casteel, responding to our request for back-up, forwarded research by Porter’s campaign drawing from Harris County court records and news reports. 
First, to the Enron and BP connections. 
Two personal-injury lawsuits filed against Enron, both from 1993, appear in Porter's list of about 50 ""known civil court"" cases involving Weems from September 1989 to late October 2009. Casteel said the campaign, satisfied that Weems represented Enron, didn't dive into the lawsuits' particulars. 
As far as BP, an April 2010 Bloomberg News article calls Weems an oil and gas lawyer who has represented BP in Texas courts. Weems later told the Austin American-Statesman: ""I do a very specific set of litigation representing BP"" representing the company in cases in the northern part of West Texas and in the Panhandle ""when they get sued by wealthy royalty owners who want more royalties.""

Porter's campaign also pointed to a ""news"" item posted online by the law firm where Weems is a partner, Harrison, Bettis, Staff, McFarland & Weems, LLP. Headlined ""BP Wins!,"" the undated item says that in the weeks immediately following Hurricane Ike, Weems and two other lawyers ""traveled to Levelland, Texas to represent BP America Production Company at trial in a multi-million dollar royalty dispute. The plaintiff royalty owners initially sought damages of over $10 million. After a two-week trial, the judge signed a final judgment ordering that the plaintiffs take nothing from BP America Production Company and further ordering the plaintiffs to pay BP America Production Company’s court costs.""

When we asked Weems about the BP America lawsuits, he said his representation of the company doesn't sully him in any way. Noting that Porter owns stock in Exxon Mobil, Weems said in an interview: ""Would he be sullied if that (BP) well that blew up in the Gulf was an Exxon well? I wouldn't level that charge."" (According to Porter's personal financial statement filed with the state and posted online by the Texas Tribune, his wife--not Porter--owns 100 to 499 shares of stock in Exxon Mobil Corp.)

Per the Enron cases, Weems said in an e-mail that he didn't recall them. He speculated they were small personal-injury cases that a partner in the law firm assigned to him.

Weems said: ""The bigger picture is that I am an oil and gas litigation attorney... When you are an oil and gas attorney, with oil and gas companies as clients, it follows that you represent oil and gas companies.""

Weems declined to provide a breakdown of his clients, saying such information was private. He said in an e-mail that some clients have been BP America Production Company, Amerada Hess, Southwestern Energy Production Company, Wapiti Energy LLC, JM Huber and numerous ""small operators, working-interest owners, royalty owners and land owners.""

In its back-up materials, Porter's campaign quotes from the Martindale-Hubbell Legal Directory listing ""representative clients"" of the firm where Weems is a partner. The clients are: Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Baker Hughes Inc., BP America Production Company, Cameron International, Inc., COACH USA, Dollar General, El Paso Corp., General Electric, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Loomis Armored US, Inc., National Oilwell Varco, Oil States International, Inc., Republic Waste Services, Inc., Southwestern Energy Company, United Resources LP and Waste Management, Inc.

After confirming the list from the directory, we called Weems' firm where attorney Mitch McFarland, a partner, said 10 of the 16 representative clients are heavily involved in the oil and gas business and that Weems has represented or might have had a hand in matters involving five: BP America Production Company, Cameron International, Inc., El Paso Corp., Southwestern Energy Company and Anadarko Petroleum Corp.--an investor in the BP well that blew up in the Gulf of Mexico.

Would it be correct to say the law firm represents ""big oil"" (Porter's words) companies? McFarland replied: ""In our firm we represent individuals and major corporations. All we do is litigation ... There's no politics in our discussions about clients. We work for clients who call on us and who are good fine upstanding citizens, both individuals and corporations.""

What constitutes a big oil company anyway? According to a Web post at oilprices.org, there are six ""supermajor"" oil companies in the world: ExxonMobil, rooted in the United States; Royal Dutch Shell; BP; Chevron Corp.; ConocoPhillips; and Total S.A., based in France. ""If considered as a group, the Supermajors have control over almost 5 percent of the world's oil and natural gas reserves,"" according to the Web post. ""The other 95 percent of the world's oil and gas reserves are under the control of state-owned national oil companies, most of which are in the Middle East.""

Casteel of Porter's campaign said the oil companies cited in the July critique of Weems wasn't limited to super-sized ones. ""The intent of the comment was yes, indeed, he represents big companies like BP,"" Casteel said.

What about the charge that Weems represents oil interests against the ""working man,"" as Porter's camp puts it?

""Most of the work Jeff has done for the firm,"" McFarland said, ""involves companies and (against) royalty owners, (who are) hardly considered 'working men.'""

In an earlier e-mail, Casteel took issue with Weems' reference to his opponents in court as ""wealthy royalty owners."" Casteel said three cases in which Weems defended BP were against non-profits and private universities including Wayland Baptist University, William Jewell College, the Plum Foundation and the Helen Jones Foundation, a non-profit organization for the fine arts, public schools and college students.

McFarland said some of the cited foundations are quite wealthy. He said casting them as working folk is like calling the University of Texas small.

So how does Porter's statement shake out? 
Weems, an oil and gas lawyer, has represented numerous energy companies including BP and Enron, the latter almost 20 years ago. However, Porter saying Weems has represented ""just about every big oil company"" is a stretch on Weems' actual legal record. 
Resolving whether Weems has battled working folk in court would entail a careful review of his cases. Porter hasn't done that, far as we can tell, nor do we have the resources to undertake it. We have to punt on this part.

Mark Neumann says Scott Walker supported a 1998 transportation bill that he now says he opposed
","
In the final days before the Sept. 14 primary, the Republican gubernatorial candidates are focused more on the past than the future -- chiefly, the 1998 federal transportation bill, Mark Neumann’s vote for it and what rival Scott Walker said about it at the time.

It began with a Walker ad that faulted Neumann for voting for the pork-laden bill, which included the infamous ""bridge to nowhere"" in Alaska, and equating him with current Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two are hardly ideological soul mates, and we rated that connection False.

Neumann struck back with his own ad.

""Scott Walker claims I’m Nancy Pelosi?"" Neumann says, speaking to the camera. ""He must be kidding. The vote Scott Walker’s attacking me for, he supported too. The bill he calls pork today, he said would save the taxpayers money, back then.""

We’ll stop there for a closer look.

As the pork line is read, an image of a June 15, 1998 letter to the editor that appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel appears. It settles on and partially highlights in yellow this line: ""In our opinion, supporting these projects is a better use of the funds and will ultimately save Milwaukee County taxpayers money.""

The letter is signed by Walker, then a member of the state Assembly representing Wauwatosa.

Is it a smoking gun?

The Walker letter came about three weeks after the May 22, 1998 vote in the U.S. House on the big road and transit bill. The letter makes it clear he and five other state lawmakers representing Milwaukee County backed a specific change in transportation funding made possible by a provision in the bill.

That provision, inserted by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Fond du Lac, lifted a requirement that $241 million in federal money set aside for Milwaukee be used on either a light rail system or freeway bus and car-pool lanes in the East-West Corridor between Milwaukee and Waukesha.

Walker, a longtime light-rail opponent, wanted the funds to go instead to freeway reconstruction in Milwaukee, including the Marquette Interchange, and the county bus system. He has long opposed light rail as a waste of taxpayer money, too costly to build and likely to lead to long-term government subsidies.

So, at issue now is what Walker was pointing to in the ""money saving"" statement highlighted in the Neumann ad. Was Walker talking about the full bill with its $9 billion in pork, or the provision that moved money from light rail to other purposes?

And, by supporting that piece of the bill, was Walker supporting the entire bill?

Start with the money savings.

In addition to the letter in the TV ad, the Neumann campaign also cited a May 30, 1998 Journal Sentinel story quoting from a letter that Walker and the five other state lawmakers sent to then-Gov. Tommy Thompson the day before.

In the letter to Thompson, Walker and the others are clearly focused on the Petri provision.

""We believe the taxpayers of Milwaukee County will benefit from not being forced to use these transportation funds"" on a light rail system or special freeway lanes, the letter read.

Walker certainly did not say the entire bill would save taxpayers money.

The provision in question did not increase funding. The $241 million in question had been appropriated seven years earlier and was sitting unspent.

The Neumann campaign has not pointed to any statement of support by Walker for the full bill but notes that in legislative bodies you either vote up or down on a measure; in the end, you don’t get to pick and choose pieces of it.

Ironically, that’s what Neumann complained about in the wake of the first ad -- he didn’t like the pork but supported the bill because of other policy aspects, especially because it prevented the siphoning off of federal gas tax proceeds for non-transportation purposes.

So what about the central statement by Neumann?

He’s not totally off base. Walker’s only public comments were actually in favor of one provision in the bill. Walker did not qualify his remarks to suggest he liked the Petri provision but was against the whole bill. We could find no record of Walker opposing the full bill or the $9 billion in pork.

But by pairing the highlighted words from Walker’s letter with Neumann’s narration, it leaves viewers with the impression that the words refer to support for the full bill. They do not.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump’s dollar estimate is overstated. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, reported that between 1995 and 2008, the United States provided North Korea with over $1.3 billion in assistance. CRS reported that ""slightly more than 50 percent for food aid and about 40 percent for energy assistance."" The funding was distributed from the end of Bill Clinton’s first term to the final year of George W. Bush. $666 million were given during the Clinton administration. The portion for food aid was aimed at patching the chronic malnutrition faced by large portions of the North Korean population, as a result of famine and inequalities perpetuated by the dictatorship. The United States provided energy funds of $549.7 million in two chunks to North Korea, one between 1995 and 2003, another between 2007 and 2009. From the context of his remark, it seems Trump was talking about the first stream under Clinton. That’s the 1994 Agreed Framework, negotiated between the United States and North Korea amid threats from Pyongyang to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In the treaty, North Korea agreed to halt production of plutonium, which is used for nuclear weapons. The country halted plutonium processing in Yongbyon and froze construction of two other reactors. In return, an international consortium would replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors, mostly financed by Japan and South Korea, to provide the energy without nuclear capability. Meanwhile, the United States agreed to supply heavy fuel oil. The two light-water nuclear reactors were never built. The United States nonetheless provided North Korea $400 million in heavy fuel oil until 2003. The money was distributed by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, the organization established to implement the Agreed Framework. When Clinton was president, the United States provided $236 million. In 2002, U.S. negotiators presented North Korean officials with evidence of a clandestine uranium enrichment program, which North Korean officials initially confirmed, then denied, leading to the breakdown of the Agreed Framework under the Bush administration, according to another CRS report. That’s about eight years later than Trump suggested. While the agreement ultimately failed with the revelation of North Korea’s uranium enrichment program, experts said it was too far to say that the agreement Clinton struck didn’t do anything. ""The Framework Agreement was at best an incomplete agreement, but it worked for the better part of a decade to keep spent reactor fuel in cooling ponds,"" Jonathan Pollack, nonresident senior fellow in the Center for East Asia Policy at the Brookings Institution. ""Not optimal, perhaps, but it kept North Korea’s plutonium based program frozen between 1994 and 2002."" Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, pointed to the key metric of North Korean warheads from Clinton’s defense secretary, William Perry. In Perry’s 2015 book My Journey at the Nuclear Brink, he estimated that North Korea would have enough plutonium for more than 100 nuclear warheads today, as opposed to the estimated 25 in its current arsenal, were it not for the Framework Agreement. Greg Thielmann, former director of the Strategic, Proliferation, and Military Affairs Office of the State Department's Intelligence Bureau, said Clinton’s policies also interrupted North Korea’s flight-testing of longer range ballistic missiles. ""Recall that the U.S. intelligence community had predicted in the fall of 1999 that North Korea was likely to test an intercontinental-range ballistic missile before the end of the year,"" Thielmann said. ""But instead, North Korea agreed during the Clinton administration to a missile testing moratorium that lasted until 2006."" Trump said Clinton ""spent $3 billion and got nothing. And (North Korea) started making nuclear weapons a day later."" The money that went toward North Korea as part of the Agreed Framework, negotiated by Clinton in 1994, amounted to approximately $400 million. The rest of the $1.3 billion the United States has spent on North Korea mostly went toward food aid. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities were curbed for almost a decade, experts told us, tempering Trump’s claim that the deal accomplished ""nothing."" There's an element of truth in that money changed hands and North Korea found another way to get nuclear bomb material. But the specifics Trump offered are overblown and incorrect. So we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jun/13/donald-trump/bill-clinton-north-korea-3-billion-nuclear/

Donald Trump says Canada levies 270 percent tariff on dairy. That's basically right
","  In the run-up to a stormy meeting of the G-7 group of advanced industrial nations, President Donald Trump zeroed in on a specific trade policy by the meeting’s host, Canada. In fact, he tweeted about it four times over four days, culminating in a rant about ""fool trade."" The target: Canadian trade barriers on imported milk. On June 8, Trump tweeted, ""Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!"" (Here are the three other tweets.) Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers! He has a point, though he’s left out some important context. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. For decades, Canada has protected its dairy industry, erecting trade barriers that diminish foreign competition and result in higher prices for Canadian consumers. While this has prompted longstanding complaints by the United States and other exporters, the tariffs have survived, thanks in part to a strong dairy lobby that Canadian politicians have been loath to oppose. After a small fixed quota of U.S. exports is reached, Canada imposes a tariff on any dairy products brought into the country, with the level varying a bit depending on the specific product. For instance, fluid milk is 241 percent, cheese is 245.5 percent, ice cream is 277 percent, cream is 292.5 percent, and butter is 298.5 percent. Experts said Trump’s tweet is a reasonable mid-range estimate, and given the scale of these tariffs, ""Trump's complaints have some basis in fact,"" said Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo. Not that this is news, said Dan Trefler, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. ""Has the tariff risen over time or otherwise become more restrictive over the last few decades? No,"" Trefler said. First, not all the news has been grim for the United States on the Canadian dairy front. In recent years, United States dairy producers have used technological advances to exploit a lucrative loophole in Canadian trade law. They have begun separating milk into its component parts, creating what’s called ""ultrafiltered milk."" These are high in protein and are easier to use for making cheese and yogurt. Since this product didn’t exist when the most recent negotiations were completed, it falls outside the list of products with high tariffs. So in recent years, U.S. producers have sold a substantial amount of ultrafiltered milk to Canada, duty free. Canada ranks as the second-biggest market for U.S. dairy exports after Mexico. Between 2013 and 2016, United States exports of ""milk protein substances"" to Canada grew from $78 million in Canadian dollars to $129 million. The United States accounted for two-thirds of all of Canada’s imports of this type. Thanks to these exports, the United States has actually posted a large trade surplus with Canada in dairy products in recent years. In 2016, the United States exported $631.6 million in dairy products to Canada, compared to just $113 million in Canadian dairy exports to the United States (these figures are in U.S. dollars). Part of the reason for low levels of Canadian dairy exports is that the World Trade Organization ruled that Canada is effectively subsidizing its dairy producers, making exports harder. This trade surplus for the United States ""has certainly helped balance whatever pain Canada's overall dairy exemptions may have caused,"" Eagles said. Despite the complaints, the United States has long accepted Canada’s high dairy tariffs as the price of wider access to the Canadian market. The U.S. has similarly protected certain goods that it produces for export. ""In the last multilateral negotiations, Canada agreed to set its tariffs on dairy and poultry at high, but agreed, levels, as did the U.S. on products such as peanuts, tobacco, and sugar,"" said Michael Hart, a trade policy specialist at Carleton University in Canada. ""As good as these agreements are, the level of protection on some agriculture products remains obscene, but legal. If Trump wants to lower them, he needs to negotiate."" That said, Canadian dairy interests have fought back with a policy that promotes using domestic sources of milk for high-protein substances. In 2017, U.S. exports of milk protein substances to Canada fell by about half. The change of Canadian policy on ultrafiltered milk ""is a legitimate concern for U.S. dairy exporters,"" said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Ultimately, neither side has entirely clean hands on this issue. ""Given the domestic political concerns and the power of agricultural lobbies in Canada and the U.S., there's no such thing as pure-as-snow free trade in agriculture,"" said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. ""Each country can point to the other's protection if they wish."" Trump tweeted, ""Canada charges the U.S. a 270% tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!"" That number is a reasonable estimate of Canada’s dairy tariffs, which are high by any standard. That said, the United States has recently run a sizable trade surplus with Canada in dairy products, driven by a strong business in a milk product that was unaffected by the high tariffs. Trump also glosses over the fact that the United States imposes its own trade barriers on certain American-made products. The statement is basically accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/jun/13/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweets-about-canadas-2/

Clickbait headline wrongly blames Clintons for Anthony Bourdain's death
","A clickbait headline on Facebook falsely claimed CNN’s Anthony Bourdain was killed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. This is an unsubstantiated, ridiculous allegation by conspiracy theorists who have tried to link the Clintons to criminal activity for years. ""Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives,"" said a June 10, 2018, headline from YourNewsWire.com, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online.

As evidence of a link between Bourdain’s death and the Clintons, the report pointed to two tweets from Bourdain. The first tweet, posted Oct. 11, 2017, criticized Hillary Clinton over an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria during which she said she was ""appalled"" to discover that there was ""a different side"" to her longtime donor Harvey Weinstein, a film producer who was accused by several women — including Bourdain’s girlfriend, Asia Argento — of sexual assault.

"['Immigration', 'Pennsylvania', 'Lou Barletta']","
Hazleton wasn’t half-Latino when Lou Barletta was re-elected mayor. He said it was.
","In an interview with Fox Business Network’s Stuart Varney on June 7, Republican Congressman and U.S. Senate candidate from Pennsylvania Lou Barletta claimed that he won re-election as mayor of Hazleton, a city in northeastern Pennsylvania with a large Latino population, while also serving as the driving force behind a heavily scrutinized crackdown on undocumented immigrants there. ""The city that I was mayor of was 50 percent Latino, and I won with 90 percent of the vote, and I was standing up for legal immigrants. Legal — keyword — legal immigrants,"" Barletta asserted. Barletta was on the program to discuss, among other things, a federal court’s ruling against the Trump administration’s plan to penalize Philadelphia for its sanctuary city policy by docking its federal funding. Barletta, a Trump supporter, has been an outspoken critic of U.S. immigration policy, sanctuary cities and the Democratic Party’s approach to dealing with millions of immigrants who entered the country illegally. This includes the approach of his Democratic opponent for the U.S. Senate seat, longtime incumbent Bob Casey. But is Barletta’s claim that he won re-election by a landslide in a majority Latino city in the midst of a high-profile crackdown on undocumented immigrants accurate? There are a few things to consider with Barletta’s claim: First, did he win with 90 percent of the vote? Yes, if you round up slightly. According to archived Luzerne County elections records, Barletta won 89.05 percent of the vote when he was re-elected mayor of Hazleton in 2007. Barletta was the only major party candidate on the ballot and appeared as both the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee after winning the Democratic nomination with a write-in campaign. Barletta first won election in 1999 with 65 percent of the vote and won re-election in 2003 with 68 percent of the vote, according to the Hazleton Standard-Speaker, which pulled results from their archives to provide to Politifact Pennsylvania. Second, was the city half Latino at the time? No. According to Census data, Hazleton’s Latino population grew from 1,132 or 4.84 percent of the city’s overall population in 2000 to 9,454 or 37.31 percent of the total population in 2010. In 2007, the last time Barletta was re-elected as mayor before being elected to U.S. Congress — and the only time he was re-elected mayor with anywhere near 90 percent of the vote — the city’s Latino population was under 37 percent. It’s unclear how many of those Latino residents were eligible or registered to vote, or how many of them did vote. According to a 2017 report in the Washington Post, the town never studied the number of undocumented immigrants living in Hazleton. Philly.com,in 2016, reported an unnamed ""veteran police official"" estimated 10 percent of the city’s Latino population was undocumented. And while Census data are not infallible as a gauge of demographic makeup, Barletta’s claim that Hazleton was 50 percent Latino at the time of his re-election is not supported by a more reliable source. Barletta spokesman David Jackson offered the following response: ""Even if you think that legal immigrants only made up ‘nearly 40 percent’’ of the population of Hazleton in 2006, to garner 90 percent of the vote, many of them had to have supported his policies. This is anecdotal, but we're talking hard numbers here."" There was also no empirical evidence provided by his campaign to support the implication that support for Barletta’s Illegal Immigration Relief Act, which threatened Hazleton landlords and employers with fines for housing or hiring undocumented immigrants, helped propel him to victory. ""The fact that he won with such a high proportion of the vote at a time when the ordinance was so prominent in the news is evidence in and of itself that it was not received as negatively as it is being portrayed,"" Jackson added. ""I don't think he made the statement that the ordinance was the driving factor in his re-election, but by any measurement, a 90 percent re-election win is a mandate to continue the policies an elected official had begun."" Worth noting: the 89.05 percent of the vote Barletta received in winning re-election in 2007 represents just 89.05 percent of the votes cast, not 89.05 percent of the city’s population or 89.05 percent of overall registered voters. There were 3,964 total votes cast in the Hazleton mayor’s race in 2007 and 3,530 of those went to Barletta. Hazleton’s total population was roughly 21,000 at the time. Today, the city is more than 50 percent Latino and that number continued to grow even during the controversy over Barletta’s Illegal Immigration Relief Act. The ordinance drew a lawsuit before being struck down by a federal court. Barletta’s claim that he won re-election with 90 percent of the vote in a majority Latino city while driving a crackdown on illegal immigration there misstates the size of Hazleton’s Latino population at the time and the timeline involved. Barletta was re-elected mayor of Hazleton with roughly 90 percent of the vote in 2007 but the city was not majority-Latino then. It is now. And while Barletta’s crackdown was certainly popular with some in the city at the time, and unpopular with others, it’s unclear what role it played in his 2007 victory.

Richard Cordray casts some blame on Mike DeWine for opioid overdoses in Ohio
","As opioid deaths have risen in Ohio, the epidemic has become weaponized in political campaigns. Democrat Richard Cordray has cast some blame on his rival for governor, Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine. ""Mike DeWine has been a dismal failure as Ohio’s top cop. Opioid deaths have tripled on his watch and there have been cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis,"" Cordray said in Springfield June 4. Cordray has previously pointed the finger saying DeWine and Republicans were ""asleep at the switch"" on opioids and that DeWine ""did nothing about it."" Cordray’s statement is an overreach. Although Ohio is one of the hardest hit states by opioid overdoses, this is a national problem. Opioids (including prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, more than any year on record. About 40 percent of all opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. In October, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. The over-prescribing of opioids began in the mid 1990s amid a marketing campaign telling doctors that they should prescribe more opioids to help ease patients’ pain. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University, said it is ""silly"" to blame DeWine — or any other state attorney general — for the increase in overdose deaths. ""There are certain levers attorney generals can pull to impact opioids, but they would not have any short-term impact on opioid deaths,"" he said. Cordray's campaign cited state health data showing opioid overdose deaths tripled from 1,163 in 2011 to 3,495 in 2016, overlapping with DeWine’s tenure. Cordray was elected attorney general in November 2008 to fill a vacancy, and he lost his bid to keep the seat to DeWine in 2010.    The data shows that one of the key reasons behind the spike in overdoses was the increase in deaths from fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more potent than heroin. These overdoses soared from 73 in 2011 to 2,357 in 2016. To tackle the epidemic, DeWine filed has lawsuits against drug manufacturers in 2017 and drug distributors in 2018. He has also devoted money to assist addicts and victims, added scientists and equipment to test drugs, sponsored training for law enforcement, formed a heroin unit and negotiated an agreement to reimburse local agencies that use Naloxone, a treatment to stop overdoses. But bringing the epidemic under control requires reducing the incidence of new people addicted and increasing access to treatment. Those goals are not under the purview of an attorney general. ""I do not think it makes sense to blame the attorney general,"" said Kolodny. ""I think there is a lot of blame to go around but pointing to a single state official is silly."" Kolodny has criticized the federal response both under Trump and Barack Obama and called for more federal money. Orman Hall, who worked in Gov. John Kasich’s administration on the opioid epidemic, said he doesn’t believe law enforcement will solve this problem. DeWine effectively used his bully pulpit and put forth a good-faith effort to deal with the problem. However, as the attorney general, he doesn’t have access to funds to significantly impact treatment or the health care system. DeWine countered that it was Cordray ""who was asleep"" on the issue of opioids when he was attorney general, a position he held before DeWine. It’s also misguided to blame Cordray, because when he was attorney general the state didn’t yet fully understand the extent of the problem but was beginning to take action, Hall said. ""Everybody made a good faith effort,"" Hall said. ""Nobody has done anything very successful."" Cordray’s campaign pointed to news reports about the state budget cutting money to local governments. Some of those cuts started before DeWine was attorney general and then were exacerbated amid a nearly $8 billion budget shortfall in 2011. Kasich initiated reductions to the state’s Local Government Fund, which is used by local governments for any purpose. The cuts by the state led to cuts for police, fire and other local services. Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart, a Republican who endorsed Cordray, told PolitiFact that the cuts hurt law enforcement’s ability to investigate crimes, including crimes related to opioids. Cordray spokesman Mike Gwin said that DeWine ""failed in his responsibility to stand up for law enforcement - to fight for additional money in the state budget for badly-needed resources for the first responders, sheriffs, and police officers on the front lines of this fight."" However, as attorney general, DeWine doesn’t oversee the state budget signed by Kasich and can’t be blamed for state budget cuts. Cordray said, ""Opioid deaths have tripled on (Mike DeWine’s) watch and there have been cuts to funds for first responders and people in the community fighting the crisis."" Opioid deaths tripled between 2011 and 2016. However, there is no evidence that DeWine bears responsibility for the spike in overdoses, something that occurred nationally. The state budget did cut money to local governments but as attorney general, DeWine doesn’t set the overall state budget. There is a kernel of truth here in that the deaths did triple on DeWine’s watch and Kasich did sign state budgets that cut money to local governments, but Cordray has failed to provide evidence that as attorney general DeWine is to blame.

Have 101 utilities cut their rates thanks to the GOP tax bill?
","For months, President Donald Trump has been touting the benefits of the tax law he signed in December. But in early June, he began expanding his argument beyond lower tax bills to lower energy bills. On June 7, Trump tweeted, ""$3 billion payoff: 101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts."" The tweet linked to a Washington Examiner article that in turn cited research by Americans for Tax Reform, a group supportive of the tax cut. “$3 billion payoff: 101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts” https://t.co/x1a1OJuRgd This isn’t the first time the White House has relied on Americans for Tax Reform for evidence of real-world impacts from passage of the tax bill. Previously, we looked at Trump’s statement that ""since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars."" That talking point, gleaned from the group’s research, rated Mostly True. The energy rate-cut list — which is a sub-list of the broader one we checked previously — attracted the White House’s attention not long after it hit its 100th item. For the utilities on the group's list that provided an estimate of savings per customer, most said rate-payers would save about $1 to $4 on their bill per month. Americans for Tax Reform cited a large number of company news releases and news articles, so we don’t quarrel with the number (which had already grown to 102 a day later). That said, we will provide some additional information that helps put the list in fuller context. It shouldn’t be surprising to see a lot of investor-owned utilities lowering rates after the corporate tax reduction. And it also shouldn’t be surprising that the companies specifically cited the tax changes as the reason for the rate cut. In most cases, experts said, utilities would have been required to do so by their regulators. The tax law has an impact on privately owned utilities — often called ""investor-owned utilities,"" or IOUs for short — but not on public utilities. Investor-owned utilities pay corporate taxes, so the tax law’s lowering of the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent should save this type of utility a substantial amount of money. By contrast, publicly held utilities do not pay corporate taxes, so they are unaffected by this provision of the tax bill. Public utilities include rural electric cooperatives, municipally owned utilities, and federal or state power authorities. Among electricity utilities, about two-thirds of Americans are served by investor-owned utilities, while about a third receive their power from public utilities. For water utilities, a few of which appear on the group's list, public utilities are dominant. So while 101 utilities cutting their rates may seem like a large number, your ability to benefit from a rate cut depends on which utilities happen to serve your area. It’s also worth pointing out that many of these rate cuts were preordained by existing energy regulations. ""Utilities are natural monopolies, and because of that, they’ve been regulated for well over 100 years,"" said Manny Teodoro, a political scientist at Texas A&M University who has studied energy issues. ""It’s a recognition that a pure monopoly will result in a lack of competition and abusive pricing."" For that reason, under longstanding regulations, utilities need to go back to energy regulatory bodies whenever they seek to modify their rates, in order to provide reasons for the change. And if a utility happens to benefit from a tax change, there’s a good chance it will be required under existing regulations to lower their rates to account for that. ""Rates are set by public utility commissions through rate-making processes that would clearly identify the reasons for the rate change, up or down,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University public policy professor who studies energy. This doesn’t undercut the larger point of the tally, but it does suggest that the rate cuts required two elements to materialize — the tax cut, which Trump touted, and the longstanding regulations that require companies to share the tax gains with ratepayers rather than just with shareholders. And the latter is an aspect Trump didn’t get into. Trump tweeted, ""101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts."" The list comes from a organization that strongly supported the tax bill. The tally of rate cuts is well-documented, and the group acknowledges that it is not comprehensive. That said, it’s worth noting that public utility customers will not see the same types of rate cuts cited in the list, which is about one-third of Americans. Trump’s tweet seeks full credit for the tax law, while glossing over the role of energy regulations that mandate that utility savings be passed along to customers.

Promise Kept Increased borrowing On transportation, Walker has been criticized for refusing to raise gas taxes or vehicle fees to bring more revenue into the state’s road fund, opting instead to borrow more money and to delay some road projects. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan state agency, warned in analyzing Walker’s 2017-’19 state budget that ""continued reliance on bonds over a sustained period can result in debt service costs that consume an increasing share of transportation revenue."" On the other hand, Walker has made good on two promises -- to stop ""raids"" on the state transportation fund, and to pay back money that had been transferred from that fund to the state’s general fund under his predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. The numbers To assess Roys’ statement, we examined the latest available figures from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which were produced in November 2017. In analyzing 2017-’19 two-year state budget enacted by Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature, the bureau provided figures on the total of all transportation debt service as a percentage of gross transportation fund revenue -- in other words, what portion of transportation revenue for road work would be going to paying off debt. To look at what’s happened during Walker’s tenure, we use as a base the 2010-’11 state fiscal year -- the second year of the final state budget under under his Doyle: State budget year Amount of transportation debt payments Debt payments as a percentage of  transportation revenue 2010-’11: Final budget year under Doyle $197.2 million 11.5% *2017-’18: Current budget year $380.2 million 20% *2018-’19: Starts July 1, 2018 $398.4 million 20.9% Doubling would be 23 percent, so 20.9 percent is pretty close. But it’s worth noting that the figures for 2017-18 and 2018-’19 are estimates, though they are based on the 2017-’19 state budget and are not expected to change much. Our rating Roys says that under Walker, on a percentage basis, Wisconsin is ""spending twice as much on debt service for just basic road repair and maintenance"" than before he took office.

The portion of road revenue being used for debt service was 11.5 percent during the final budget year for Doyle, Walker’s predecessor. The figure is projected to reach 20.9 percent during the second year of the current two-year state budget Walker signed, which is nearly doubling. With the caveat that the figure for the current budget is an estimate, we rate Roys’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/jun/11/kelda-helen-roys/debt-payments-wisconsin-road-work-have-doubled-und/

Andrew Gillum questions Philip Levine's record on banning assault weapons, raising minimum wage
","As he makes his run to become Florida’s governor, Democrat Philip Levine often touts the more progressive moves he made during his time as mayor of Miami Beach. Chief among them is increasing the minimum wage and banning assault weapons. ""Everyone wants to tell you what they’re gonna do in the future, but no one wants to tell you what they’ve done,"" Levine said June 9. ""Well let me tell you what I’ve done as mayor: I raised the minimum living wage in the city of Miami Beach and I plan to do it statewide. We actually decriminalized marijuana. We’ve had the highest LGBTQ scores in the entire state of Florida. We became the leading poster child on sea-level rise and climate change and by the way, we banned assault rifles."" But one of Levine’s opponents in 2018 Democratic primary says Levine’s achievements aren’t as successful as he sometimes makes it seem. ""They passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable and never enforced,"" said Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. ""(Philip Levine) passed a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced."" Gillum’s claim is largely accurate. Miami Beach passed a resolution urging lawmakers to adopt an assault rifle ban, but it wasn’t a ban. It was a resolution that carried no legal authority. As for the minimum wage increase, Miami Beach passed an ordinance to gradually increase it to $13.31 per hour by 2021, but it was struck down by the courts before it went into effect. On July 13, 2016, the Miami Beach Commissioners adopted a resolution urging Congress and the Florida Legislature to lobby for assault weapons bans. It also urges the Florida Legislature to lift the preemption policy that prevents local governments from enacting gun control ordinances. The resolution had no legal authority, though. That’s because resolutions, according to the Florida Statutes, are a statement of position, not an official legislative action of a governing body like a law. ""A resolution of the city commission of the city of Miami Beach, Florida, calling upon the federal and state-elected officials to collaborate with local officials and first responders to prevent mass shootings… ,"" the resolution heading says. So rather than an actual ban, the resolution was really more of a call to action for lawmakers to consider banning assault weapons. It did not impede Miami Beach’s access to them. The resolution wouldn’t have survived. Under Florida law, any local officials who try to enact gun regulations that are more restrictive than state law face fines up to $5,000 or even removal from office. Florida cities, including Miami Beach, have sued Gov. Rick Scott so they can enact tougher local gun regulations. As we mentioned, Levine sometimes touts this achievement with no additional clarifications, but at one point during the June 9 debate, Levine acknowledged that the assault weapon ban ""wasn’t enforceable."" ""As the mayor of Miami Beach we did many things,"" Levine said. ""From reforming a police department from raising the minimum wage to fighting back sea level rise to decriminalizing marijuana to banning assault rifles even, though unfortunately, it was not enforceable."" In June 2016, Miami Beach Commissioners voted to gradually raise its minimum wage in the city from $8.05 to $13.31 per hour by 2021. The increase would have been enforced basically starting January 2018 and gone up every year until reaching the 2021 threshold. The law never went in to effect, though. Florida Circuit Court Judge Peter Lopez ruled in March 2017 that Miami Beach's minimum wage law was pre-empted by a state statute preventing local minimum wages from exceeding the state rate. A panel of the 3rd District Court of Appeal upheld Lopez’s ruling, but Miami Beach (along with other cities) asked the Florida Supreme Court to review the December 13 appellate court ruling. So, Gillum is right that no one really got the benefit of it. The one thing worth noting is that Gillum could have been more precise in describing the action Miami Beach took. Gillum said it was a resolution, but it was an ordinance. This means that the minimum wage increase, unlike the assault weapon resolution, would have been enforced had it not been struck down. During the debate, Levine alluded to issues with the minimum wage effort. ""In 2004, the people of Florida voted that the local municipality should have the right to enforce and set their own minimum wage,"" Levine said. ""That's what we did.  Unfortunately, we got sued by the governor, the state of Florida, the Retail Federation. We are fighting it in court and we believe it's going to go to the Florida Supreme Court and we're going to win. The fact of that matter is we did it."" Gillum said Levine ""passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable,"" and passed ""a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced."" Gillum’s claim is largely accurate. He could have been more precise in describing the legislative action Miami Beach took, but his general idea for both initiatives is accurate. The assault weapon ""ban"" that Levine talks about was a symbolic resolution, not an actual ban. And the minimum wage increase was struck down before taking effect in 2018.

Most Austin city parks lack recycling though donations funded bins in biggest parks
","Despite’s Austin’s ""zero-waste"" commitment, an advocacy group says that nearly every city park lacks recycling. We wondered about that declaration by the Texas Campaign for the Environment, which describes itself as the state’s largest environmental group organizing support through door-to-door canvassing. An April 2018 handout from the group notes that the city adopted a zero-waste commitment in 2011 requiring businesses and landlords to provide recycling. The city has a goal of reducing trash sent to landfills by 90 percent by 2040. ""Unfortunately,"" the TCE handout says, the ""zero-waste"" requirement ""does not apply to city government operations"" and parks rank among big missed opportunities. ""As many as 293 out of 300 parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park,"" the handout says. There’s also good news, the handout says, in that the city has launched recycling in every recreation and cultural center and in most of Austin’s biggest parks. Still, 293 of 300 parks, including nearly every neighborhood park, have no recycling? By email, Andrew Dobbs, the group’s Central Texas program director, said he based his statement on an April 2018 city staff presentation to Austin’s Parks and Recreation Board. A slide in the presentation says the city has 300 parks. Two subsequent slides say a pilot program has introduced recycling to Zilker, Town Lake, Walnut Creek, Bull Creek and Ramsay parks plus Walsh Boat Landing. Other slides say recycling also has been added to more than five city swimming pools, five of six city golf courses and two softball complexes. Dobbs told us the campaign knows of one other park with recycling bins thanks to a neighborhood association. The group’s handout, Dobbs said, says ""as many as 293 out of 300"" parks have no recycling ""because we aren’t 100% certain if other parks might have recycling added on an ad hoc basis."" Records show Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department made the recycling presentation to two city boards. By phone, we separately confirmed TCE’s count of parks without recycling from Charles Vaclavik, a parks department official, who told us that plans are in motion next to expand recycling mostly along the south side of Lady Bird Lake through Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park. Vaclavik said Austin’s parks-with-recycling count would be higher if the department had started its pilot recycling program in 2017 by concentrating on small neighborhood parks rather than installing recycling bins in large ""metropolitan"" parks the city’s jewel, 351-acre Zilker Park. ""We concentrated (instead) on the activity centers that have the most people,"" Vaclavik said, seeking a ""bigger bang for the buck."" To date, he said, the recycling pilot has diverted about 35 percent of materials previously destined to move from trash cans to a landfill. Another factor: The city has yet to budget for recycling in its parks. Liana Kallivoka, the department’s assistant director, told the city’s Zero Waste Advisory Commission at its April 11, 2018, meeting that department officials were drafting a request for $250,000 in recycling-specific funding in the next city budget. If approved by the Austin City Council, Kallivoka said, the money would fund a program coordinator and hundreds of pairs of waste-recycling receptacles with tops, which run $1,100 each, to follow on 150 pairs already installed in park facilities and outdoors. Shelley Parks, a city spokeswoman, told us by phone that the cost of the installed bins was covered largely by donors including the Austin Parks Foundation, the Trail Foundation, neighborhood associations and the office of City Council Member Alison Alter, who represents District 10. Generally, Kallivoka told the commission, the department’s goal is to extend recycling to all parks and facilities in three phases wrapping up with the addition of recycling to neighborhood parks. Commission members approved a resolution calling for the city to create a Parks & Recreation Recycling Task Force. The resolution says, in part, that ""approximately 4 of 300 City of Austin parks and 14 of 51 City of Austin aquatic facilities currently provide recycling opportunities."" Austin’s Parks and Recreation Board voted to urge creation of the same task force at its April 24, 2018, meeting. Dobbs also spoke to the commission, saying: ""The good news is that we’re at a point where everybody wants to do this."" Our ruling TCE’s handout says that most of Austin’s biggest parks have recycling though as ""many as 293 out of 300"" Austin city ""parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park.""

Richard Cordray says Ohio payday lending law is worst in nation
","Though consumer advocates have long called for changing the payday lending law in Ohio, a criminal investigation has resulted in the resignation of the state House speaker. Republican Cliff Rosenberger resigned in April as the FBI was investigating his foreign travel sponsored by payday-lending lobbyists. He denied wrongdoing. Rosenberger’s resignation brought votes on legislation screeching to a halt, including a proposed bill to strengthen consumer protections for payday loans. Consumer advocates are collecting signatures to put similar language before voters on the ballot, likely in 2019. The Ohio Consumer Lenders Association, which represents the industry, opposes the measures. Richard Cordray, the Democrat running for governor against Republican Mike DeWine, has criticized the state law. ""The current shutdown of the State House has delayed legislation addressing payday lending, where Ohio's laws are now the worst in the nation,"" Cordray tweeted May 17. ""Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans that end up ruining people’s lives. Unconscionable."" Cordray’s statement comparing Ohio’s payday industry to the nation comes from a 2014 report by Pew Charitable Trusts. Cordray worked on changing rules on payday lending on a national level when he was the first director of the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. The bureau finalized rules on payday lending in October 2017, several weeks before he resigned to run for governor. Cordray has attacked his successor, Mick Mulvaney, for attempting to roll back the rules. Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. About three dozen states have their own payday laws, including Ohio. Proponents argue that the working poor need payday loans to cover their bills, while opponents argue that they trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. About one in 10 adults in Ohio have taken out a payday loan. In 2008, Ohio lawmakers approved the Short Term Loan Act. The law, opposed by the industry, included protections for borrowers, such as capping the loan at $500 and the annual interest rates for payday loans at 28 percent. However, payday lenders found a loophole: They registered as mortgage lenders instead. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the law in 2014, prompting one concurring judge to ask, ""Were the lobbyists smarter than the legislators? Did the legislators realize that the bill was smoke and mirrors and would accomplish nothing?"" Ohio is the only state where lenders operate under such a statute that was not intended for payday loans, said Alex Horowitz, senior research officer for Pew Charitable Trust's consumer finance project, which has researched payday laws in the states for many years. In a 2014 analysis of states’ payday lending laws, Pew didn’t flat-out label Ohio as the worst in the nation for payday lending. But it did find that borrowers were charged much more than their peers in many other states. By examining payday loan prices in each state from the four largest lenders, Pew found that over five months a $300 payday loan would cost an Ohio borrower $680 in interest and fees, which equals an average annual percentage rate of 591 percent (which is close to the 594 percent figure cited by Cordray.) No other state had a higher rate, according to the Pew analysis. The interest and fees amount in Ohio was slightly exceeded by Texas, but Texas has more protections for consumers, including a 180-day loan limit that Ohio doesn’t have. While the typical loan is technically two weeks, in the majority of cases the borrower ends up in a cycle of loans for several months.  While most states that allow payday lending cap loans at $500, Ohio lenders don’t operate under the Short Term Loan Act, so they can make loans that are double or even triple the amount of conventional payday loans. The Center for Responsible Lending, an organization that calls for more safeguards for consumers, found in 2015 that payday loan storefronts in Ohio advertised rates of more than 600 percent annual percentage rate. Diane Standaert, director of state policy, said that since that time some storefronts now reflect rates between 300 and 400 percent for some loans. ""But this is basically comparing the differences between (1) a very bad loan, and (2) another very bad loan,"" she said. The effort to change Ohio’s payday lending law gained steam in March 2017 when House Bill 123 was introduced by State Reps. Kyle Koehler, a Republican of Springfield, and Michael Ashford, a Toledo Democrat. The bill is similar to Colorado’s payday lending law which consumer advocates have upheld as a model example. After languishing for a year, it passed a House committee in April 2018 about a week after Rosenberger resigned, but a full vote was placed on hold while lawmakers deadlocked over picking a new speaker. On June 7, the House passed the bill and it now heads to the Senate. The bill would cap the interest rate at 28 percent and a fee of up to $20 a month, which would mean that a borrower of $300 would pay $96 in interest and fees. Cordray said, ""Ohio's (payday lending) laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans."" Pew Charitable Trusts found in 2014 that over five months a $300 payday loan would cost an Ohio borrower $680 in interest and fees, which equals an average annual percentage rate of 591 percent. While the report didn’t call out Ohio as the ""worst in the nation,"" no other state had a rate that was higher, according to the report. The difference between the 591 percent cited in the report and the 594 percent tweeted by Cordray is negligible. We rate this statement True.

Did Adam Putnam adopt Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ position on term limits?
","Republican governor candidate Adam Putnam has been a politician for over half of his life, providing opponents a long history of stances to chew on. ""Flip Flop! After opposing term limits for decades, Adam Putnam adopts Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ position,"" read the subject line of a Florida Democratic Party news release. Putnam’s flip-flop, according to the Florida Democrats, came June 6 when he weighed in on term limits for school board members. ""If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards,"" Putnam said via email to the Tampa Bay Times. Term limits have been an issue in Florida for quite some time. Voters in November will decide whether to approve a constitutional amendment establishing eight-year term limits on school board members, among other things. The proposal closely mirrors the 1992 measure that established eight-year caps on members of Florida’s Legislature. Congressional term limits are also a priority of the man Putnam is looking to replace, Gov. Rick Scott. For this reason, we wanted to see if the claim had any credence. Did Putnam really change a longtime stance opposing term limits to one that lines up with DeSantis and Trump? While there is some truth to this claim, the link to Trump is largely irrelevant. Trump’s position on term limits is mainly about Congress, not school boards and state legislatures. Putnam served in the U.S. House for 10 years before he started the first of two terms as agriculture commissioner in 2011. He also was a member of the Florida House from 1996 to 2000. The issue of term limits has come up several times over his political tenure. The Democrats latched onto several instances of Putnam discussing why, at the federal level, he did not support a limit on terms. When Putnam was first elected to the U.S. House in 2000, he hinted that voters should control the term lengths of lawmakers. ""I have always believed that voters are the ultimate term limit implementers,"" Putnam said Nov. 25, 2000, according to the Associated Press. ""The voters are pretty effective at giving those two-year job evaluations."" He turned down signing a term-limit pledge in Congress as a candidate in 2000. And he voted against term limits as a citizen, he said, when they were on the referendum in the state of Florida in 1992. (He was 18 at the time.) ""I believe term limits are implemented every two years by the voting public for the House of Representatives,"" Putnam said in a 2001 appearance on CNN. ""I voted against them when they were on the referendum in the state of Florida. And so, therefore, I did not take the pledge."" And finally, as agriculture commissioner in 2012, Putnam suggested that the eight-year term limit on state lawmakers impedes their ability to do their job. ""The eight-year (term limit) time frame virtually guarantees the likelihood of someone spending more than one term as a committee chair is almost nil because it suggests you are ineffective,"" Putnam said in a Tampa Bay Times column. The Democrats started to shout ""flip-flop"" after a comment by Putnam on June 4, 2018. Putnam said he supports term limits on school board members, telling the Tampa Bay Times that ""if term limits are good enough for the governor and the legislature, they're good enough for school boards."" That position is consistent with his primary opponent, DeSantis, who recently penned an op-ed for the U.S. Term Limits website in support of Florida’s Amendment 8 requiring school board term limits. ""No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians,"" DeSantis wrote. ""That’s why I support eight-year term limits for all school board member."" The connection to Trump is more tenuous. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to enact a constitutional amendment that would extend term limits to all members of Congress (which is Stalled on our Trump-O-Meter). ""If I’m elected president, I will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress,"" Trump said at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colo. ""Right? They’ve been talking about that for years."" Trump’s 100-day action plan also detailed his term-limit plans for Congress. But Trump has not specifically come out in support of school board term limits, in Florida or elsewhere, as Putnam did. To back up the Trump connection, Florida Democratic Party spokesman Kevin Donohoe pointed to an alleged remark from a 2016 rally in South Carolina to suggest Trump’s comments throughout the 2016 campaign were broad enough to make the argument he supports term limits for ""any politician."" ""Under my proposal, there will never be a 'next campaign' for any politician in America ever again,"" a Newsmax article quoted Trump as saying. We checked the Lexis Nexis and CQ databases for evidence of Trump’s remark, as well as Factba.se, which compiles everything the president has ever publicly said or tweeted. As it turns out, Trump didn’t really say that. The quote came from a 2016 column on The Blaze by Wayne Allyn Root, who urged Trump to brand himself the ""Term Limits President."" ""Here is the speech Donald should give this week in South Carolina,"" Root wrote, before adding the quote that was shared on Newsmax. The Florida Democratic Party said, ""Flip-flop: After opposing term limits for decades, Adam Putnam adopts Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ position."" The Democrats are conflating Putnam’s general position against term limits for members of Congress and state government with a recent ballot initiative on school boards. They have a point that Putnam has long been skeptical of term limits, declining pledges to support them, criticizing them as impeding sound governance, and voting against them in 1992 as a young adult. Putnam’s most recent comments in support of term limits for school board members do suggest a change in tone, and they are in line with his opponent, DeSantis. However, Trump’s position on term limits is a red herring in this case. Trump has promised to enact congressional term limits, but has not specifically come out in support of term limits for school board members. A piece of evidence the Democrats provided relies on a suggested speech for Trump, and is not a stated philosophy.

Donald Trump says people went out on their boats to watch Hurricane Harvey
","President Donald Trump paused from extolling the Coast Guard for rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S. in 2017 to suggest that people had foolishly gotten in boats to watch Hurricane Harvey. Did people do that? We didn’t recall that happening and the next day, we failed to draw elaboration on Trump’s claim from the White House nor did other agencies respond with information showing that people took boats out to watch the powerful hurricane that swept ashore at Rockport, Texas before touching off days of heavy rain and flooding in Houston and southeast Texas. According to a White House transcript, Trump said during a June 6, 2018 briefing involving FEMA and cabinet secretaries including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development: ""I also want to recognize the Coast Guard, our other military services. I have to tell you, the Coast Guard saved 16,000 people.  What do you think of that, Ben? Sixteen-thousand people. (Applause.) And I think — you know, honestly, they don’t get enough credit in many ways. ""Mike made the commencement address this year at the Coast Guard Academy.  I did it the year before. I don’t think the Coast Guard gets enough credit.  And I’ve said it, and I even say it to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. I said, I think this year the Coast Guard, maybe in terms of increased branding — the brand of the Coast Guard has been something incredible what’s happened. Saved 16,000 people, many of them in Texas, for whatever reason that is. People went out in their boats to watch the hurricane. That didn’t work out too well.  That didn’t work out too well."" The Houston Chronicle said in a news story posted later the same day that law enforcement ""first responders"" were baffled by Trump’s boating claim which, the story said, nobody could explain. The story quoted Harris County’s sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, crediting civilians with making an ""extraordinary effort"" with their own boats to rescue neighbors, relatives and pets as Hurricane Harvey flooded the Texas coast with 52 inches of rain. ""I didn't see anyone taking the approach that would reflect his comments,"" Gonzalez said. Separately, Gov. Greg Abbott said he had ""no information one way or another about"" what Trump described and Coast Guard Petty Officer Edward Wargo told the Chronicle: ""I don’t know how we would go about confirming that."" No confirmations Our search of the Nexis news database turned up a September 2017 Tampa Bay Times news story on a man rescued from a Florida shrimping boat overtaken by Hurricane Irma yet no news accounts on people taking boats out to watch hurricanes. We later connected with Chad Saylor, a spokesman for the Coast Guard at its Washington, D.C., headquarters. Saylor had no comment on the president’s boating claim, referring us to the White House, which offered no on-the-record response to our inquiry. Saylor otherwise advised by email that the Coast Guard, teaming with multiple law agencies, rescued nearly 12,000 people during the nation’s 2017 hurricanes, mostly from rooftops in urban areas, Saylor said by phone. Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard’s commandant, said in a March 2018 speech that the agency responded to the year’s hurricanes by dispatching nearly 3,000 first responders and more than 200 helicopters, cutters, small boats and fixed-wing aircraft. Of its rescues, Zukunft said: ""Most of those men, women, and children were rescued from the roofs and flooded streets of Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur, Texas… areas not generally accustomed to seeing Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead, dangling rescue swimmers into urban settings, as water engulfed their homes."" A Sept. 7, 2017, Coast Guard news release says that in response to Hurricane Harvey, Coast Guard members helped rescue 11,022 people and 1,384 pets. Christopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also had no comment on Trump’s claim. Vaccaro suggested by email that we contact the Coast Guard and local law enforcement agencies. We also reached Bill Read, a resident of League City, outside Houston, and a former director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. By phone, Read commented that he was unaware of anyone ever going out on a boat to watch a hurricane. ""Absolutely not,"" Read said. ""It’s dangerous."" Read said it’d be ""insane"" to take a boat into the ocean to watch a hurricane because of tremendous storm-related currents and waves. Inland in 2017, Read said, ""the people I know who were out on boats were trying to rescue people"" from Harvey-caused flooding. Our ruling Trump, saluting Coast Guard rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S., also said: ""People went out in their boats to watch"" Hurricane Harvey. The White House didn’t provide nor did we find confirmation of people venturing out on boats to watch the hurricane. The boats we saw people using in Houston and elsewhere were to evacuate flooded homes and neighborhoods.

But several reports inaccurately stated that the laws would punish state residents who use too much water in their everyday routine. ""New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day,"" said a June 5, 2018, headline from the Federalist Papers Project, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Federalist Papers Project story references a similar post from conservative website Breitbart, but seems to have gathered most of its information from an article on The Organic Prepper, a blog devoted to ""preparedness, health, frugality and food,"" according to its about page. Several other websites reposted The Organic Prepper’s report or wrote similar articles. Even U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., seemed to push the false narrative online. In a blog post, Nunes wrote, ""Californians don’t want to have to choose between doing their laundry and taking a shower, but that’s the kind of choice being forced on us."" The false reports center on two bills — Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668 — that Brown signed into law May 31, 2018. Broadly speaking, the bills instruct cities, water districts and some larger agricultural water districts to establish strict water budgets. But the Federalist Papers Project story said the bills would limit California residents to 55 gallons of indoor water use per person per day, beginning in 2022. Violators who use more water than allowed, the story went, would be fined $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.   The story said this limit ""will turn the most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers"" by making it illegal to take a shower and run a load of laundry in a single day. Here, the Federalist Papers Project borrowed calculations from The Organic Prepper’s story, which said the average shower and laundry load use 17 and 40 gallons of water, respectively, for a total of 57 daily gallons — two more gallons than would be allowed were California residents actually limited to 55 gallons of indoor water use per day. But that is where the Federalist Papers Project got it wrong: Under the new legislation, Californians will not actually be penalized on an individual basis for excessive water use. In reality, the bills stipulate that cities, water districts and large agricultural water districts must come up with budgetary targets for water use by 2022. They will then need to meet their targets across their ratepayer bases, with failure to do so resulting in a fine of $1,000 per day or $10,000 per day during drought emergencies.   George Kostyrko, director of the office of public affairs for the State Water Resources Control Board, told us the water districts will be guided in their target-setting by three standards, one of which is the allowance of 55 gallons per capita per day for indoor residential water use — a number that will drop to 50 gallons by 2030. The other standards, both yet to be determined, will place similar caps on outdoor residential water use and water loss due to system leaks. ""Unfortunately some media outlets have grossly misinterpreted the law,"" Kostyrko said. ""These are not individual mandates for homeowners, but actually a task given to each water district to average water consumption use out to hit the goal."" Jim Metropulos, legislative director for state Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, who wrote Assembly Bill 1668, explained that the legislation ""sets water efficiency goals for water districts and municipalities on the territorial level, but it does not regulate what individual Californians or businesses can and can’t do."" ""There is nothing in this bill to target households or companies,"" Metropulos wrote in an email. ""Water use objectives are on territory-level of a water agency. There is nothing regulating the time a person may shower or when they may or may not do laundry."" This means that the Federalist Papers Project story was wrong to suggest that water use would be assessed on a daily individual basis. ""The new requirements are for water districts, not individuals,"" said Katie Hanzlik, press secretary for state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, who authored Senate Bill 606. ""And the number is based on average water use."" Fines based on consumption will actually be administered to the water agencies that fail to meet their targets, rather than individuals who use too much water on a given day. And while a water district could theoretically let those costs shift to individual water bills, any increase in costs assumed by ratepayers would be closer to a few bucks than $1,000. For the record, it is also worth noting that washing machines are more efficient than they used to be, which calls into question some of the water-use estimates mentioned in the false reports. Daisy Luther, author of The Organic Prepper, told us she got the figures for her story’s 57-gallon estimate from Home Water Works, a project from the nonprofit Alliance for Water Efficiency in collaboration with Chicago’s Field Museum. (The Federalist Papers Project did not respond to a request for comment.) The Organic Prepper story reported that an average shower uses 17 gallons of water and an average load of laundry uses 40, and Luther said the 40-gallon figure was listed as the average for older washing machines. But most people now own high-efficiency laundry machines that use between 15 and 30 gallons per wash, according to Home Water Works. And since it is the average water use per capita that matters, one person’s reliance on an older machine would likely be offset by other residents who are not using so much water. A headline stated, ""New law makes it illegal to shower and do laundry on same day."" The new California legislation does not actually make this combination illegal, nor does it create a financial penalty for residents whose water use exceeds a 55-gallon daily limit. Some Californians will need to use less water, but the police will not come knocking or demanding hefty fines should someone shower and do laundry on the same day. We rate this statement False. Update: The Federalist Papers Project responded to our request for comment shortly after publication, saying its report was ""accurate based on the source we used"" and linking to an article in Fox News’ opinion section. Our ruling remains the same.  ",/factchecks/2018/jun/07/blog-posting/it-illegal-shower-and-do-laundry-same-day-californ/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Foreign Policy', ""President Trump's lawyers""]","
Was initial Trump statement on Trump Tower meeting accurate, as lawyers' memo said?
","The New York Times made a splash when it published a document prepared by President Donald Trump’s legal team to special counsel Robert Mueller. The letter made several bold assertions, including that the president ""could, if he wished, terminate (Mueller’s) inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired,"" and that ordering the end to an investigation ""could not constitute obstruction of justice."" We’ve looked at some of those possibilities before. But one part of the letter that caught our eye is an assertion about how the White House responded to media disclosures of a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and Russian nationals. This meeting, involving Trump's eldest son and first reported by the New York Times, has attracted intense interest from Mueller’s investigators, as well as from congressional committees. The lawyers’ memo acknowledged that President Trump had indeed dictated an initial statement to the New York Times. It went on to defend the president's message as ""short but accurate."" ""You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump Jr.,"" said the Jan. 29, 2018, letter from attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd. However, the original explanation for the meeting was not as accurate as the lawyers’ asserted. The statement from Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting focused ""primarily"" on Russian adoptions. But while the adoptions were indeed mentioned at the meeting, there is evidence that the broader topic of sanctions against well-connected Russians under the Magnitsky Act received significant attention. The statement also offered incomplete characterizations of how much Trump Jr. knew about meeting participants and what he expected to get out of it, and it ignored later efforts by the Russian side to follow up on the meeting. The White House did not respond to multiple inquiries for this article, and a separate inquiry to Sekulow was not returned. An email chain to coordinate the meeting shows that Donald Trump Jr. accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father’s campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The younger Trump forwarded the email chain to the candidate’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, his campaign chair at the time. All three Trump campaign officials ended up attending the meeting on June 9, 2016. One of the participants was Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was described in an email to Trump Jr. as a ""Russian government attorney."" Veselnitskaya has represented Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official, according to the New York Times. Other participants included Russian-American Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet soldier with experience in military counterintelligence, and Georgian-American Ike Kaveladze, who was once the subject of a congressional inquiry into Russian money-laundering through the U.S. banking system. The meeting became public knowledge after the New York Times reported on it 13 months later. For that article, Donald Trump Jr. gave the newspaper a statement (the one that is central to this fact-check): ""It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand."" That statement was later supplanted by other, conflicting statements from the Trump camp, including contradictions about whether Donald Trump himself dictated the statement in the name of his son — which his lawyers now say he did. The most misleading part of the statement is that the meeting ""primarily"" entailed ""a program about the adoption of Russian children."" While that topic did come up in the meeting, the statement leaves out an apparently detailed discussion of the 2012 Magnitsky Act sanctions, as well as ""dirt"" on Bill Browder, the businessman who had pushed for the act. Veselnitskaya came to the meeting armed with talking points that were primarily critcisms of the Magnitsky Act that placed strong sanctions on prominent Russians and which Putin and his allies have worked hard to quash. Veselnitskaya’s five pages of talking points only mentioned ""adoptions"" in passing at the end, saying that the law ""became a basis for open confrontation between our countries, complicating relations on all key geopolitical issues and leading to the ban on Americans adopting Russian children."" Under questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee — transcripts of which have been released publicly — Trump Jr., Kaveladze and Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump who helped organize the meeting and attended it, said that adoptions were discussed at the meeting. Trump Jr., for instance, testified that ""it started off with that sort of tax scheme (about the Democratic National Committee) and, you know, quickly migrated to Russian adoption and ultimately the Magnitsky Act."" The evidence suggests that the other topics took up a significant portion of the meeting. Kaveladze testified that Veselnitskaya offered remarks in the meeting ""about Magnitsky Act and about destructive role played by Bill Browder, the initiator of that act, in ruining relationship between U.S. and Russia. … She also suggested that the repeal of that act could significantly improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S."" At some point, Akhmetshin ""gave a little bit more details"" on this argument and segued into the act’s impact on adoptions, Kaveladze testified. Also in the meeting, Kaveladze added, Veselnitskaya talked at some length about the owners of Browder’s company being major Democratic donors and how that could be ""a negative for the Democratic Party."" This account is supported by a page of notes taken by Manafort and released by the committee. The document includes 11 bullet points, including ""Bill Browder,"" ""Offshore - Cyprus,"" ""Active sponsors of RNC,"" and, only as the final bullet point, ""Russian adoption by American families."" It’s also worth mentioning that adoptions were hardly the meeting’s draw for the Trump camp, according to emails Trump Jr. released three days after the initial New York Times story. The meeting was set in motion on June 3, 2016, when Trump Jr. received an email from Goldstone. He informed the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and told of his connection to a Russian government official with incriminating evidence against Clinton. ""This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,"" Goldstone told Trump Jr. The younger Trump replied: ""If it’s what you say I love it."" Several other elements of the statement paint an incomplete picture. One is the question of whether there was follow-up after the meeting. That may be true for actions by the Trump side. Trump Jr. has said that he ""never discussed the meeting again"" with Goldstone or fellow meeting organizer Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov. He also told Fox News’ Hannity that Goldstone apologized about the likely ""bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about."" However, there is evidence that the other side tried to reach out to the Trump campaign on more than one occasion. For instance, congressional investigators obtained an email from Goldstone to Trump aide Dan Scavino that ""encourages Scavino to get candidate Trump to create a page on the Russian social networking site VK, telling him that ‘Don and Paul’ were on board with the idea,"" a reference to Trump Jr. and Manafort, CNN reported in December 2017. In addition, there were attempts at outreach after the election, CNN reported in April 2018. Goldstone told congressional investigators that he proposed a second meeting with Veselnitskaya, the New York Times reported. Goldstone sent an email on Nov. 28, 2016, to Trump's assistant, Rhona Graff, that said, ""Aras Agalarov has asked me to pass on this document in the hope it can be passed on to the appropriate team."" The email, which had an attachment about the Magnitsky Act, was forwarded to then-Trump adviser Steve Bannon with the notation, ""Not sure how to proceed, if at all,"" CNN reported. A meeting never took place. Another area where the statement tells only part of the story is its claim that Trump Jr. was not told a specific name in advance. While we found no evidence that he knew a name in advance, Trump Jr. possessed a fair amount of more general information, judging by the email chain with Goldstone that was made public. The first email in the chain said in part, ""Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin."" Later in the email chain, Goldstone wrote, ""Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday."" The White House legal document said that then-candidate Trump ""dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article"" about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians. The accuracy of the statement was misleading, at least. The statement's most inaccurate suggestion was that the meeting was primarily about Russian adoptions. That wasn't what the Trump officials came to hear about, and adoptions weren't atop the list of topics for the Russian figures, either. There was a significant amount of discussion about the Magnitsky Act sanctions and allegations of wrongdoing by the act’s champion. Further, the initial statement obscured what we now know about Trump Jr.’s motivation for taking the meeting: the prospect of compromising material on Clinton from the Russians. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jun/07/president-trumps-lawyers/was-initial-trump-statement-ny-times-accurate-lawy/

Kelda Roys, Democrat for governor, commits to participating in debate, then withdraws commitment
","The Wisconsin Broadcasters Association’s decision to hold a debate with no more than four of the 10 Democratic candidates for governor caused so much consternation among the candidates and others that the association is reconsidering its decision. Amid the backlash, did Kelda Helen Roys, arguably one of the leading candidates, change her position on attending the debate? We go to our Flip-O-Meter, which examines an official's consistency on an issue. (It does not pass a judgement on a politician who changes positions, or determine if any shift is good policy or good politics.) The decision The broadcasters association, which represents nearly all radio and television broadcasters in the state, announced June 4, 2018, the criteria it would use for determining which candidates would be invited to its debate on July 27, 2018, in Madison, less than three weeks before the primary election. Saying it would invite ""the most significant candidates,"" the association detailed how up to four of the Democratic gubernatorial candidates (as well as up to four Republicans in the U.S. Senate race) would be included. The main criterion: Results of the Marquette University Law School Poll released closest to the date of the debate. The Flip-O-Meter The Flip-O-Meter rates an official's consistency on an issue. Some voters appreciate politicians who are flexible and have the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of their voters. Still, accusations of shifting positions are common in politics, and we’ve found that an analysis of the shift and the degree of change can be informative.

The Flip-O-Meter has three ratings:

NO FLIP – No significant change in position.
HALF FLIP – A partial change in position.
FULL FLOP – A complete change in position. ""All polls have a margin of error, making small percentage differences between candidates in a crowded field especially uncertain,"" he said. Roys: I’m in On June 5, 2018, the day after the criteria were announced, Roys’ campaign issued a statement to Associated Press reporter Scott Bauer, saying in part: Kelda is looking forward to joining three of her competitors in this debate and continuing to share her positive vision for the future of Wisconsin. Roys campaign spokesman Brian Evans told us that when Bauer asked for the campaign’s reaction to the criteria, he thought Bauer wanted to know whether the campaign thought Roys would meet the criteria to participate. The campaign’s statement was later clarified to say the statement had been based on the campaign’s assumption that Marquette would do another poll before the debate. Roys didn’t fare well in the most recent Marquette poll, done in March 2018, which asked respondents if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of the candidates. On Roys, 92 percent of respondents said they hadn’t heard enough about her or didn’t know her enough to have an opinion. Two days before the broadcast association’s announcement, however, she gained momentum by winning a straw poll at the state Democratic Party convention. So, Roys committed to participating in the debate, even going so far as to presume she would qualify. But she would withdraw her commitment. Roys: Actually ... The change came later the same day, when Bauer quoted Roys as saying to the broadcasters association: We are confident that my campaign will qualify for inclusion in the debate, but given the flawed criteria you are using to decide who is included in your debate, I cannot in good conscience commit to attending. So, Roys didn’t flatly state she would not participate in the debate. But she was no longer committing to participate. Moreover, after Bauer tweeted that Roys had changed her position and was now against the debate, Evans tweeted in response: Mistake was mine, apologies. Statement was based on the work Kelda has done to attend as many forums as possible all across WI, as well as our confidence that she will meet the criteria the WBA put out. I had not checked whether Kelda thought the criteria were fair or democratic. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Then on June 6, 2018, two days after the criteria were announced, Roys released an open letter to the association, which said in part: I strongly object to limiting the number of candidates in the debate, especially using the arbitrary, inaccurate, and undemocratic criteria put forward by WBA. … We are confident that my campaign will qualify for inclusion in the debate, but given the flawed criteria you are using to decide who is included in your debate, I cannot in good conscience commit to attending. Again, no more commitment to participate. (Later on June 7, 2018, the day we published this article, the association canceled the debate.) Our rating Initially, Roys essentially committed to participating in a Wisconsin Broadcasters Association debate that would be limited to four of the 10 Democratic candidates for governor, saying she ""is looking forward to joining three of her competitors in this debate."" But later the same day, and again the following day, Roys issued statements changing her position. She didn’t flatly refuse to participate. But saying she objected to the criteria, she withdrew her commitment, saying: ""I cannot in good conscience commit to attending."" For a complete change in position, we give Roys a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2018/jun/07/kelda-helen-roys/kelda-roys-democrat-governor-commits-participating/
