No, Socrates didn’t call slander the 'tool of the losers'
","A viral image on Facebook quotes Socrates as saying, ""When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers.""​ There’s no evidence Socrates said that. The Facebook page Allen West Republic shared the photo on the morning of Sept. 25, the day Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Kavanaugh narrowly passed the Senate’s confirmation vote and was sworn in Oct. 6.) The post has been shared more than 12,200 times since then, but the misattribution has been around a lot longer. A user posted the quote on Goodreads in 2008, and the quote has been circulating ever since. Socrates didn’t write anything himself, so the picture of who he was and what he said is reliant on others’ writings. Plato and Xenophon wrote about Socrates and slander but not in the context of lost debates, said Christopher Moore, a philosophy and classics assistant professor at Penn State.  Socrates believed those who slandered him hated philosophy and truth, but he didn’t call them losers. In Plato’s ""Apology,"" Socrates points to his effort to find men smarter than himself as the root of slander against him, according to Debra Nails, a Michigan State University philosophy professor emeritus. When Socrates decided other men weren’t as smart as him, those men didn’t like him very much. However, there's no evidence of him saying any version of the viral image quote. Plato’s and Aristotle’s versions of Socrates were not interested in debates as something that could be won or lost, at least not by an individual, according to Christopher Rowe, Durham University classics and ancient history professor emeritus. In Socrates’ view, only truth could defeat anyone. Middle school essayists love to start with a good philosophical quote or a dictionary definition, but this supposed Socratic saying originates from the internet, not from a textbook.

Andrew Gillum says crime dropping in Tallahassee
","Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has pushed back on attacks by Republicans that he oversees a crime-ridden city. Gillum’s opponent in the Florida governor’s race, Ron DeSantis, zeroed in on the crime rate in an interview with CBS4’s Jim DeFede. ""This is a guy that is presiding over the highest crime in Florida four years running,"" DeSantis said Sept. 23. One week later, also on DeFede’s show, Gillum fired back: ""I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate and we accomplished that by having fewer arrests at the same time,"" he said. We decided to fact-check both candidates who are running for governor. We found that  DeSantis and Gillum point to valid statistics, but cherry-pick those that make their point while omitting the broader picture and caveats about crime statistics. ""I would say that both DeSantis and Gillum are off the mark a bit in either blaming or crediting the mayor,"" University of Florida criminology professor emeritus Ronald Akers said. Here, we will fact-check the statement by Gillum that Tallahassee is experiencing a five-year low in its crime rate. Experts generally focus on crime rates per 100,000 residents rather than sheer numbers of crimes. The Tallahassee Police Department, among other law enforcement agencies across the state, report crime data to the state for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports program each year. The data includes arrest and crime figures for several types of offenses, including murder, rape, robberies and thefts. We looked at the reports on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s website and compiled the crime rate for each year for the past decade. Gillum was sworn into office as mayor in November 2014 following more than a decade on the city commission.   Year Tallahassee crime rate per 100,000 residents 2017 5,764.5 2016 6,726.8 2015 6,211.3 2014 5,833.7 2013 5,178.3 2012 5,553.7 2011 6,041.1 2010 5,801.9 2009 5,669.6 2008 6,115.2 Source: Uniform Crime Reports So when Gillum says that Tallahassee is experiencing a five-year low in the crime rate, he is pointing to the rate of 5,764.5 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2017 and comparing that 2013, when the rate was 5,187.3. Gillum has said the downward trend in crime has continued so far in 2018. In September, city Police Chief Michael DeLeo shared data with the city commission showing that during the first six months of 2018 overall crime was down 10.3 percent and violent crime was down 24 percent. One caveat about crime data: it is only as good as the reporting by the local police agencies. An audit the police chief sought found that the city incorrectly reported crime statistics at a higher rate due to various errors in 2017. DeLeo told PolitiFact a small percentage of the drop between 2016 and 2017 is attributed to the overreporting found in the audit. However, he said that even when comparing the first half of 2016 and 2017 before the reports were audited there was a decrease in crime. Rather than focus on the more favorable trend of reduced crime, the Republicans focus on hard, scary recent numbers. In 2017, the city had 17 murders, the highest ever. In the same year, Leon County’s crime rate was the highest in the state — as it was in 2014, 2015 and 2016. While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the bulk of the county’s crime. The FBI cautions about the pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities. Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. The American Society of Criminology reached a similar conclusion. Tallahassee is a college town, home to Florida State University and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and also the state government. Accordingly, the city has a large number of visitors who do not live year-round in the city, including students, lobbyists, politicians and other people who work at the Capitol but may live in other cities. That means that crimes committed against — or by — students or commuters who work in the capital city are included in the count of Tallahassee’s crimes, but many of them are not counted in the residential population of the city. ""This causes the per-person crime rate to be artificially inflated,"" said Brian Stults, an associate criminology professor at Florida State. A city mayor has relatively little control over the characteristics most often identified as the strongest predictors of local crime rates, such as poverty and the age of residents, Stults said. The mayor may have some control over the size of the police department, but studies are inconsistent about whether increases in police size and funding lead to decreases in crime, Stults said. The more important factor is not how many police you have, but how they police.  The police department has increased its emphasis on community and problem-oriented policing over the past several years, which some studies have linked to reductions in crime. A city spokeswoman said Tallahassee has hired a few dozen more police officers during Gillum’s tenure as mayor, growing the force by about 11 percent. Mayors, and police chiefs, can influence the strategies the police department uses, but the results that flow from these strategies take time, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a police officer in Bartow, Fla., in the 1970s. The Tallahassee Democrat has written about various efforts by city and county officials to tackle crime in recent years, including targeting violent crime hotspots, monitoring crime trends, and developing a program for young people who are not in school or work. Experts caution against giving politicians credit or blame for declines or increases in crime, which are more likely a function of social changes in the community or economy than political actions. Gillum said, ""I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate."" The crime rate in Tallahassee was 5,764.5 per 100,000 people in 2017 — the last time it was lower was in 2013. While Gillum points to the good news about the crime rate drop, Leon County still tops the state in the crime rate. The county includes a broader area than Tallahassee. Experts caution against mayors taking too much credit (or blame) for changes in crime, which is heavily influenced by factors beyond a mayor’s control.

Ron DeSantis says Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum presided over the highest crime in Florida
","Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum wants a promotion to the governor’s office. But Republican rival Ron DeSantis says the state would be in trouble if that happened based on Gillum’s track record with crime in the capital city. ""This is a guy that is presiding over the highest crime in Florida four years running,"" DeSantis said on CBS4 Jim DeFede’s show Sept. 23. One week later on DeFede’s show, Gillum boasted about a drop in crime.

Here, we will fact-check the statement by DeSantis that Gillum has presided over the highest crime in Florida four years running. Leon County and the city of Tallahassee have been in the limelight for crime in recent years. Experts generally focus on crime rates per 100,000 residents rather than sheer numbers of crimes. Crime rate data submitted by law enforcement to the FBI shows that there were 4,802 crimes per 100,000 residents in Leon County in 2017. The data includes violent offenses such as murder and rape and property offenses such as theft. In 2017, Leon County had the highest crime rate of all Florida counties. Leon County’s crime rate was the highest in Florida in 2014, 2015 and 2016, too. While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the bulk of the county’s crime. Gillum’s former chief of staff, who is now running for mayor, has also made statements about the high crime rate and ""the highest number of murders in history last year."" There were 17 murders in 2017 compared to 11 the year before. The Gillum campaign, however, has said the crime stats actually have good news, too: The county crime rate overall dropped between 2016 and 2017 by 15 percent. The statistics based on crimes reported only by the Tallahassee Police Department showed a similar decrease. And the downward trend has continued for the first half of 2018. The Tallahassee Police Department ranks 28th in the crime rate when examining all cities and counties in 2017. However, a comparison of all departments isn’t particularly useful because that combines tiny towns and large counties. Tallahassee’s population is about 190,000. When looking at cities with a population of at least 90,000, Tallahassee’s rate in 2017 was lower than Miami Beach, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale — all cities with a high number of visitors or workers who may not live in the city. While DeSantis didn’t single out any type of crime, the data shows that the majority of the crimes reported by the Tallahassee police department were larcencies. That includes anything from shoplifting to breaking into a car and stealing a briefcase, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said. The American Society of Criminology and FBI caution about the pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities. Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population.

Data shows that Leon County had the highest crime rate in Florida in recent years. DeSantis omits that the county’s crime rate in 2017 declined from 2016. A few cities had higher crime rates, but like Tallahassee, they draw a lot of visitors who aren’t included in the residential population.

Donald Trump falsely claims there's an 'open borders bill' backed by Democrats
","President Donald Trump went to Kansas to rally for Republicans seeking election in November and in the process made false claims about Democrats signing on to a purported ""open borders bill."" ""Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders, and it's a bill, it's called the ‘open borders bill.’ What's going on? And it's written by, guess who? Dianne Feinstein,"" Trump said Oct. 6 in Topeka. Overall, Trump portrayed Democrats as too extreme and radical for public office and cast fear that if the alleged Democratic bill ever became law, ""a tidal wave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never, ever before."" There are layers of falsehoods to what Trump said. A main one? There’s no ""open borders bill."" Trump on the campaign trail: His 3 reasons to fear Democrats, fact-checked Trump is misrepresenting a bill introduced in June by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called the Keep Families Together Act. The intention of that bill isn’t to create open borders, but to prevent the separation of immigrant families arriving at U.S. borders. We’ve fact-checked other Republican attacks on this bill and its companion in the U.S. House of Representatives. A False claim in Missouri said the bill ""would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border."" Similarly, a False claim in Arizona about the House bill said it was ""essentially encouraging child trafficking."" Here are the facts. Feinstein introduced the Keep Families Together Act at the height of family separations caused by Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. The bill sought to prohibit federal agents and officers from separating a child from a parent or legal guardian at or near a port of entry or within 100 miles of U.S. borders. Separations would be allowed under specific circumstances: if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies could also separate a child from a parent if it's in the child's best interest. The point of Feinstein’s bill is to prohibit separations as a policy to deter immigrants from coming to the United States, ""or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws."" ""The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a ‘pass’ — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States,"" David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank told us for a similar Missouri fact-check. Immigration experts have also told us that the Senate and House versions of Keep Families Together Act don’t prohibit the removal or detention of adults and families. The proposals also don’t supersede immigration laws. Immigrants would still have to go through proceedings to proof any claims for asylum or other relief. Feinstein’s bill also calls for annual reports on family separations. Such reports would include whether an adult was charged with a crime, the type of crime, if the adult was prosecuted, and the outcome. Trump routinely claims Democrats want ""open borders."" He bases this attack line on Democrats' general opposition to Trump’s promised U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democrats favor other border security measures and argue that the wall would be too expensive, especially since Mexico refuses to pay for it. Trump said, ""Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders, and it's a bill, it's called the ‘open borders bill’,"" written by Feinstein. There is no such bill. The bill introduced by Feinstein, and supported by all Senate Democrats, is meant to stop family separations at the border. The measure does not eliminate the enforcement of immigration laws.

Attack ad falsely claims that Dean Phillips doesn't provide health coverage to his employees
","As the midterm elections draw closer, a warzone of attack ads are airing in Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District. The seat, held by Republican Erik Paulsen and challenged by Democrat Dean Phillips, has been widely considered a toss up. Now, a particularly incendiary claim has made its way into a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The ad, which aired on Sept. 15, criticizes Phillips for not offering health insurance to his coffee shop’s employees. Phillips has made health care a focus of his campaign. The same claim is mentioned in a Congressional Leadership Fund ad, which aired only three days after the NRCC ad. Here is the text of the NRCC ad in full, before we break it down: ""Dean Phillips isn’t telling you the whole truth."" (Clip of Phillips speaking) ""We do offer health care to full-time employees."" ""FACT CHECK. When a reporter asked if he offered health insurance, Phillips admitted ‘No, we don’t.’ Dean Phillips is the 1 percent, but won’t provide health care to all his employees. Dean Phillips: Another rich politician who can’t tell the truth."" So does Phillips offer health insurance to his employees? He does, but not to all of them. But the ad distorts the facts and takes Phillips out of context. Let’s dive in. Phillips opened Penny’s Coffee in downtown Minneapolis in 2016. The second location opened in August 2017 and a third is on the way. The NRCC ad is accurate in that Phillips doesn’t offer health insurance to all his employees, but it leaves out some important details. First, Penny’s Coffee, like many companies, does not provide health insurance to part-time employees. It does, however, pay workers $15 per hour plus tips, Phillips’ campaign said. The company now has full-time workers, and all of them get access to company-provided health care. When Phillips started the coffee shop, his campaign says he initially only had part-time workers. But once the company grew, his campaign says, a handful of employees were converted to full time, and Penny’s began to offer a health care plan in which it pays 50 percent of the premium. The NRCC bases Phillips’ comments in a June 2017 Forbes Magazine article in which he declared health care ""a moral right."" He was asked this question in the article: ""Does the coffee shop you’ve started offer health insurance?"" His full answer: ""No, we don't. We are contemplating a pretty significant expansion, which would necessitate a reinvestigation of that, but right now, we're just a single coffee shop with a handful of employees, and that's something we'll assess moving forward. But the ACA afforded opportunities to employees like ours to actually go out and obtain health insurance."" The NRCC ad cuts him off after ""No, we don’t,"" removing the additional context. The National Republican Congressional Committee says that Phillips doesn’t provide health insurance to his coffee shop employees even after he has said that health insurance should be a ""moral right."" We found that he doesn’t provide coverage for his part-time employees, but does so for his full-time employees.

Did Kevin Cramer raise his own salary by $23,000? No.
","A new campaign ad in the North Dakota Senate race claims Republican contender Kevin Cramer gave himself a five-figure raise as a public official. ""Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise?"" the ad voiceover says. ""Ask Kevin Cramer. On the Public Service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650."" Cramer did get raises totalling that amount. But the ad completely distorts Cramer’s hand in securing the pay increase. The Public Service Commission has three commissioners who are elected to six-year terms. They regulate utilities, pipeline safety, telecommunications, railroads and other state services. Cramer joined the commission in August 2003. He served until the end of 2012, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Commissioners’ salaries usually originate from the governor’s office, which works with the Office of Management and Budget to determine how much money is available for public officials, according to Jeff Larshus, director of state financial services at the OMB. The governor then submits a budget to the Legislative Assembly, which writes the salaries into statute and votes on their approval. So saying Cramer raised his own salary ignores the arbiter of that salary. The OMB proposed and received across the board salary hikes for elected officials every year between 2005 and 2012. These include the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, superintendent for public instruction, state auditor, state treasurer, and the tax, insurance, public service and agriculture commissioners. In 2005, they all got a 4 percent hike from their last salary number, determined in 2002. They got three more 4 percent hikes in 2006, 2007, and 2008, a 5 percent increase in 2009, another 5 percent increase in 2010, and then 3 percent in 2011 and again in 2012. While their salaries all differ, the percentage increases were equal across the board. That’s how Cramer’s salary jumped from $69,874 to $95,611 from the time he was elected to the time he left office — a $25,737 increase. ""So did it go up considerably during that time frame?"" Larshus said. ""Yes. But it wasn’t because the commissioner asked for the salary."" Commissioners submit a budget to the OMB every two years. There, they can suggest compensation for commissioners. But staff at the Public Service Commission and at the OMB said they could not recall an instance in which they had requested salary bumps for commissioners. The OMB had three of the four budget requests during which Cramer served and got salary hikes on file. Only one asked for equity funds to raise administrative staff salaries. But that does not include the commissioners, according to Jill Kringstad, Accounting Budget Specialist. She could not recall any instances where commissioners' salary increases were included in budget requests. The bottom line is that the legislative assembly needs to approve, write into law and vote on any proposed salaries for elected officials proposed by the OMB. These salary changes were all ultimately set by the legislature. Heitkamp’s office said Cramer could have refused to accept the raises or requested lower salary numbers to the OMB. The current governor had to change a North Dakota statute in order to fulfill his campaign promise to refuse pay. Heitkamp said, ""Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise? Ask Kevin Cramer. On the public service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650."" Cramer’s salary increased by $25,737 during his tenure on the Public Service Commission. But he didn’t give himself that raise. The governor proposed it, the OMB drafted it, and the legislative assembly voted on its passage. The other 12 elected officials in North Dakota received the same percentage salary bump.

Rauner ad rewrites property tax history
","Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has run numerous re-election ads attempting to tie Democratic rival J.B. Pritzker to high taxes, public corruption and powerful Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. In Rauner’s telling, Madigan is the ultimate puppet-master of Illinois politics, controlling Pritzker and everyone and everything the governor deems bad. Now Rauner has yet another ad that not only hits on the same themes but dispenses with all subtlety by using actual puppets to deliver his points. ""For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them,"" the talking puppets claim as they ask viewers to take it from them that Madigan is pulling Pritzker’s strings.  Madigan, a Chicago Democrat who has served as speaker for all but two of the past 35 years, undeniably wields considerable power. On the side, he also is a partner in a law firm that, like many others, does lucrative work contesting appraisals for commercial and industrial property to secure real-estate tax reductions for clients. So the ad’s reference to the money he’s made in the field is clear. But property tax levies are set at the local level, not by lawmakers in Springfield. That makes the main beat of Rauner’s contention a head-scratcher. How could Madigan, as a state lawmaker, take action to ensure local property taxes remain high? And what about his work suggests his clients are ""cronies"" out to game the system? Understanding the thrust of the ad’s claim requires a brief journey into the weeds of property taxes in Illinois. The state itself stopped taxing property a decade before the 76-year-old Madigan was born. Since then, the taxing of property has been largely a local affair, with municipal and county officials determining assessments, tax rates and levies. The state isn’t totally divorced from the process, however. During Madigan’s lengthy tenure as speaker, lawmakers and the governor imposed a cap on how much most local governments in the state could raise property tax levies in a given year. Last decade, Springfield responded to soaring home values in Cook County by temporarily imposing limits on the growth of assessments for tax purposes. Despite that history, Justin Giorgio, a Rauner campaign spokesman, said Madigan had ""consistently"" opposed legislation that would prevent local officials from increasing their levies. During a two-year state budget standoff between Rauner and Madigan’s Democrats, both backed property tax freeze plans, though the speaker’s was not as sweeping. Neither plan became law. But the biggest impact the state has on the size of property tax bills is what it doesn’t do. Few states chip in as little to cover school costs as does Illinois, forcing school districts to rely on local revenue streams to cover more than 60 percent of education costs. ""In just about every other state in the union, the state itself puts more into local public schools than we do in Illinois,"" said Charles N. Wheeler III, a state budget expert and director of the Public Affairs Reporting program at the University of Illinois-Springfield. That practice has been reinforced for decades by the spending policies set by state Republicans and Democrats alike, despite a goal laid out in the Illinois Constitution for the state to assume ""primary responsibility"" for funding K-12 schools. Two decades ago, then Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, pushed to change that. He proposed a ""tax swap"" that would increase the state income tax, using the extra funds to support schools and provide property tax relief. That plan passed Madigan’s chamber with the speaker’s support, but was spiked in the Senate by members of Edgar’s own party. The ad also accuses Madigan of capitalizing on high property taxes in order to line his pockets by helping ""cronies like Pritzker"" avoid them. Madigan has been elusive about his personal wealth, but he once said that he makes at least $1 million ""in a good year."" And in 2015, his practice ranked second among law firms for total property tax refunds in Cook County, according to a Reuters report. Giorgio, Rauner’s spokesman, pointed us to county records showing a lawyer from Madigan’s firm has represented a company owned by the investment group Pritzker co-founded, securing reductions in its property value assessments. But there are tens of thousands of property assessment appeals filed in Cook County each year by a multitude of law firms, so it is unclear what makes the clients of Madigan’s firm ""cronies."" When asked, Giorgio pointed only to why the campaign pinned the term on Pritzker. ""It has been shown that Madigan's law firm has received a large number of tax reductions from (Cook County Assessor Joseph) Berrios. Berrios is the head of the Cook County Democratic party, former Democratic State Rep. and an ally of Madigan,"" Giorgio wrote in an email. ""Pritzker has been a donor to Madigan and Berrios. Pritzker has received successful reductions through hiring Madigan's law firm from Berrios. That's clearly a ‘crony’ connection."" That’s besides the point, however, because state lawmakers do not set property assessments. A recent Rauner ad stars puppets that declare ""for decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them."" That claim suggests Madigan, the powerful House speaker, took action as a lawmaker to ensure Illinois property taxes remain some of the nation’s highest. For support, Rauner’s campaign said Madigan has kept property taxes high by ""consistently"" opposing legislation to provide property tax relief, even though Madigan’s record says otherwise. The claim also ignores the reality that state lawmakers play no direct role in the assessment process, which takes place at the local level. There is a glimmer of truth in the ad’s contention that Madigan is a partner in a law firm that conducts property tax appeals work for those who can afford it, including a Pritzker-owned company. And it’s a lucrative business because property taxes are extraordinarily high in Illinois. But skyrocketing property taxes are part of a long and bipartisan legacy in Springfield of foisting the lion’s share of public school funding on to local property tax payers. The responsibility for that phenomenon is broadly shared by decades of governors and lawmakers, Madigan included.

Hawley misconstrues McCaskill's support for ""Keep Families Together Act""
","Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and outside groups supporting his campaign have criticized Sen. Claire McCaskill for her views on immigration during their Senate race. A recent salvo in this subtext of their contest comes from Hawley in the form of an op-ed for FoxNews.com.   ""…now she (McCaskill) is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress,"" Hawley wrote. ""Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border."" Hawley is referring to the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar family separations except if the child is at risk of trafficking and abuse by parents or guardians. Kelli Ford, the Hawley campaign’s press secretary, said that Hawley’s ""free pass"" comments meant that if you are an immigrant coming here illegally with a child, this bill would let you enter into the United States. With immigration becoming a wedge issue between McCaskill and Hawley, we spoke to experts and consulted the text of the bill to determine the accuracy of Hawley’s assertion. Ford pointed to the language of the bill from Section 2(a), which, in her words, ""tells agents/officers that they can’t remove a child from a parent/legal guardian within the 100-mile limit"" of the United States. That’s true — with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest. Finally, Ford pointed to an excerpt from the bill that says children can’t be removed from guardians ""solely for the policy goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws."" Hawley’s depiction of the Keeping Families Together Act is incorrect, experts said. ""The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a ‘pass’ — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States,"" David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. ""It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse."" Bier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S. Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney based in Washington, D.C., put his objections to Hawley’s claim simply: ""Nothing in this bill prevents the removal of a family unit in its entirety."" The bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, a former deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senate’s comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking it’s wrong to ""prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child,"" that is not what this proposed law would do. ""It only prevents the separation of the adult and the child,"" Fresco wrote. The bill does not put forth safeguards for immigrants without documentation; adults can still be prosecuted. Matt Barreto, UCLA professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, was adamant in his disagreement with Hawley’s conclusion about the bill: ""It absolutely does not do that."" ""It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents,"" Barreto wrote in an email. ""People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration."" The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barreto’s firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Hawley said McCaskill backed a bill that ""would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border."" The bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawley’s charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesn’t make it more right. We rate the statement False. Update, Oct. 6, 11:30p.m.:  The article has been updated to add context to two sources, Leon Fresco and Matt Barreto. ",/factchecks/2018/oct/06/josh-hawley/hawley-misconstrues-mccaskills-support-keep-famili/

McCaskill has voted for and against defunding sanctuary cities
","While Democrats nationwide have embraced sanctuary cities, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill is touting the opposite on the campaign trail. On Sept. 10 in a question-and-answer session at Truman State University, the senator said she ""voted to defund sanctuary cities"" when asked whether she supported them, according to a transcript by the Columbia Daily Tribune. She then talked about the importance of cooperating with law enforcement but said she empathized with children and parents separated at the border.   So-called ""sanctuary cities"" are jurisdictions that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement particularly when concerning undocumented immigrants. But McCaskill, who is defending her seat against state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been attacked by many conservative groups for helping sanctuary cities. So who is telling the truth? This isn’t the first time McCaskill expressed her opposition to sanctuary cities. In response to an ad by One Nation, her campaign released a fact check of its own in August, stating she ""voted to crack down on sanctuary cities."" It referenced the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which reported in February that ""McCaskill was one of four Democrats who, this month, voted with Republicans to clamp down on so-called ‘sanctuary cities’ during a string of failed immigration votes in the Senate."" PolitiFact looked into the specific vote in February as well as others, and we found six votes which can be grouped into three types. •  One vote on the ""cloture motion"": This is the vote just mentioned, where on Feb. 15, McCaskill voted yes on the cloture motion for an amendment that would not allow sanctuary jurisdictions to receive various economic grants. A ""cloture motion"" is a move to end the debate and hold the final vote. This amendment failed to get enough votes to do that. • Two votes on ""cloture on the motion to proceed"": This move essentially puts the bill onto the floor for debate and consideration in the first place. In October 2015 and July 2016, McCaskill voted no on this move for two bills that would prohibit sanctuary cities from receiving certain grants. Both bills failed to get past this step.   • Three votes tabling an amendment: In 2007, 2008 and 2009, McCaskill voted to table three amendments sponsored by former Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana that would prohibit funding for sanctuary localities to develop their community policing. By definition, tabling legislation is to simply postpone consideration. But tabling legislation also effectively kills it. All three of Vitter’s amendments were tabled. It should be noted that all six votes were procedural, and none were explicitly on the actual issue itself. The question is now whether these votes should count as voting for or against an issue. Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, said that ultimately these are just procedural votes. But, he added, ""procedures often help determine substantive outcomes."" It’s along these lines that political science professor Gregory Koger of the University of Miami argues the procedural votes mentioned, by proxy, count as votes on the actual issue. ""The key question is what these votes mean in context,"" said Koger. ""What do senators think they are voting on? What are the consequences of a ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ vote?"" Wolfensberger said procedural votes can be merely partisan rather than substantive in some cases. In the House, members of the minority party often try to delay the process even though in the end, they end up voting with the majority party. ""In deciphering procedural votes, one should look at what the legislator says, not just what they do,"" he said. It is clear, regarding the February 2018 vote, that McCaskill intended to defund sanctuary cities, citing this stance because of the murder of a Missouri man by a person staying in the country illegally. But what about the other five votes that seemed to be against defunding those cities? What was her intent back then? In a 2017 Joplin Globe article, McCaskill was reported as saying that she voted against defunding sanctuary cities because it would deter immigrants from reporting crimes. PolitiFact Missouri also reached out to the McCaskill campaign to ask for the reasoning behind those five votes. The campaign cited the community policing funding cuts and how law enforcement was against them as a reason for one of the votes. The campaign did not outrightly deny her past votes against defunding, saying that ""how she voted on other proposals does not change that fact"" she voted to defund sanctuary cities. McCaskill said she ""voted to defund sanctuary cities."" The vote her campaign references, despite being procedural, had the proxy effect of voting for the defunding, experts point out, especially considering the context where McCaskill has explicitly stated she takes that stance. The rest of her voting record, however, is against defunding sanctuary cities, and her intent back then supports the idea that those votes were substantive, too. So groups who attack her on this stance have a point. In short, she voted most recently to defund, but other votes show her defending sanctuary cities.

Walmart raised wages, gave bonuses as Ann Wagner claimed
","With the 2018 midterms on the way, many Republicans are turning to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to bolster their campaigns. You can count Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District among them. On Aug. 27, Wagner tweeted, ""The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is delivering real results. Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses."" We thought Wagner’s claim might be too large, so we decided to see if she was right. In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, restructuring tax laws for both private individuals and major corporations. The bill cuts corporate tax rates to 21 percent from the previous 35 percent. Republicans at the time said the move would almost double the standard deduction for citizens, would encourage investments and lead to overall economic growth. In January, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon announced in a blog post to employees the company’s plans due to the president’s tax overhaul. He said workers’ starting wages would be increased to $11. He also previewed bonuses to workers ineligible for the hourly wage increase that ranged from $200 to $1,000 depending on time spent within the company. ""As you know, the president and Congress have approved a lower business tax rate,"" McMillon wrote. ""Given these changes, we have an opportunity to accelerate a few pieces of our investment plan."" Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform, but the law fast-tracked the process. Wagner’s office linked us to a January CNBC article announcing Walmart planned to distribute these raises and bonuses and that the payments were projected to start the following month. The office also sent another article from the St. Louis Business Journal about a St. Louis Walmart receiving regular bonuses because of ""their store’s performance the previous quarter."" In its original announcement, Walmart said it planned to spend $400 million on one time bonuses. The company would not confirm the exact amount but said the number was close to its original projection. Justin Rushing, the director of corporate communications for Walmart, said ""the raises went into effect on Feb. 17, and showed up on the paycheck our associates received on March 8. This is the same paycheck they all received their one-time bonus."" Wagner said that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was creating real results. ""Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses."" Wagner is correct that Walmart made the payments and that it credited the legislation for the company’s actions.

Will California’s rent control measure Prop 10 really have ‘no effect on homeowners’?
","Much of the debate over California’s rent control measure, Proposition 10, has centered on how it will affect apartment dwellers and landlords. But a claim by the Yes on 10 campaign in a recent TV ad has fueled questions over how homeowners will fare should the measure pass in November. Here’s what the ad says: ""Independent voices urge Yes on Prop 10. League of Women Voters, Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee all say Prop 10 will empower your local community to limit rent increases. No effect on homeowners. Help for struggling renters. Vote yes on 10.""  The measure’s opponents seized on the claim that Prop 10 would have ""no effect on homeowners."" They argue that statement is false and ""recklessly disregards the truth."" They’ve asked media outlets to pull the ad. Given the disagreement over the claim and significance of the ballot measure, we decided to check the facts. This, however, is not the only claim that’s in dispute. There’s also disagreement over whether rent control really helps ""struggling renters,"" as the ad states. Economists argue it helps the select few who have their rents capped, but has the unintended consequence of making rental housing scarcer and increasing the average rent citywide, a topic Capital Public Radio explored earlier this year.   Background on Prop 10  Prop 10 would repeal the state's Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which blocks rent control on units built after February 1995. The law also prevents cities from imposing rent caps on condominiums and single-family homes. Repealing the law would allow cities to craft their own, potentially stronger, rent control rules, including on condos and single-family homes. A report released this month by UC Berkeley’s Fisher Center for Real Estate & Urban Economics found the measure would negatively affect owners who rent out single-family homes.   Rent control on single-family homes ""would decrease property values for homeowners by 10 percent to 15 percent over time,"" for the more than 2 million California owners who rent out single-family homes, according to the study. A spokesman for the No on 10 campaign added that, based on the campaign’s interpretation of existing laws, rent control would automatically be imposed on single-family home rentals in several cities should Prop 10 pass. Supporters of the measure rejected that interpretation. Response from Yes on 10  Asked about the claim in the ad, the Yes on 10 campaign emphasized that the initiative doesn’t force cities to impose any rent control rules. It simply gives them that option. ""The measure itself does not make any changes to local rent control laws,"" wrote Beverly Grossman Palmer, an attorney for the Yes on 10 campaign, in a letter to broadcasters. ""This is a campaign, not a legal brief. The California voters who view this ad understand the message: People who own their own homes are not going to be affected by rent control measures."" Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College who has testified to lawmakers in favor of Prop 10, said there’s another reason to believe the measure won’t affect homeowners: It ""would be politically stupid"" for cities to impose rent control on single family homes. ""There’s never been a rent control law in the country to that effect,"" he said. ""That’s not going to happen."" Apartment associations and real estate groups have contributed more than $30 million to defeat Prop 10. Supporters, meanwhile, have raised more than $12 million dollars for it, primarily from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The foundation is a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles, and is active in supporting political campaigns. Our ruling In a recent TV ad, the Yes on 10 campaign claimed California’s rent control measure would have ""no effect on homeowners."" Prop 10 would not force cities to impose rent control, but it would give them that option -- including on single family home rentals. Prop 10 supporters say it would be a politically poor decision for cities to do that. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. The TV ad is partially accurate. But it leaves out the key information that single-family homes are currently exempt from rent control in the state, and that Prop 10 would at least give cities the option to impose rent regulations on them.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about Democrats, pre-existing conditions
","Democrats across the country have been saying on the campaign trail that the Republicans’ longstanding push to overturn the Affordable Care Act threatens insurance protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. The law was passed in 2010 by a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by President Barack Obama; no Republican voted for it. Republicans used popular dissatisfaction with the law to make significant congressional gains in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, but the pattern has shifted in 2018, after unsuccessful Republican efforts to repeal the law. The Wesleyan Media Project recently found that health care was the most common subject of Democratic congressional campaign ads, the New York Times reported. But in a rally in Rochester, Minn., on Oct. 4, President Donald Trump sought to flip this narrative on its head. He argued that it’s actually the Republicans who are the champions of pre-existing condition protections, and Democrats who are trying to kill them. ""We will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions,"" Trump said around the 34:00 mark. ""We’re going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions. And some people have -- you know what I say? We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine."" We have previously written that a pending lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act by Republican attorneys general would, if successful, end protections for pre-existing conditions. (Such protections could be reinstated by new legislation if the courts do strike down the law, but health policy experts say the mechanics of achieving this result in a way different from the Affordable Care Act would be tricky; the decades-long fight to protect patients with pre-existing conditions does not provide much optimism for a quick legislative fix.) For its part, the Trump administration has decided not defend the law against the attorney generals’ suit, effectively siding with those who want to overturn the law. The second part of Trump’s assertion, however, was new to us. Is he right that ""some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions""? We found zero evidence of this. For starters, Trump’s assertion is illogical given the Democrats’ role in passing the law and Democratic efforts to hammer Republican candidates over pre-existing condition protections on the campaign trail. Here are examples from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Ohio Democratic candidate for governor Richard Cordray. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is no such chatter among Democratic officeholders or candidates. We also asked independent health-policy experts whether they had heard any Democratic messages — or even whispers — about getting rid of pre-existing condition protections. They said they had not. ""I find President Trump’s comments surprising,"" said Christine Eibner, a health policy specialist at the Rand Corp. ""I can’t think of any,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""No — how bad can this (rhetoric) get?"" asked John Holahan, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. ""Unbelievable,"" said Linda Blumberg, who also studies health policy at the Urban Institute. ""No."" The White House did not reply to an inquiry seeking examples. Neither did the office of the Senate majority leader or the House speaker. Trump said, ""Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending (coverage for) pre-existing conditions."" We can’t find any examples of what Trump claimed Democrats were saying. A Democratic proposal to end pre-existing conditions would run 100 percent counter to Democrats’ own history with the Affordable Care Act and would undercut one of the Democrats’ most powerful messages on the campaign trail this year.

How much dark money is fueling the Kavanaugh confirmation fight?

","Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., waded into Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination and the millions of dollars that has been spent both for and against the would-be justice. ""Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh’s) ads,"" Tester said in Sept. 29 debate. Tester has said he would vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Much of that funding has taken the form of ""dark money,"" which refers to political spending by unknown donors for the purpose of influencing public opinion. We found no one who knows how much money in total has been spent in support of Kavanaugh's nomination. On top of that, the dark money groups aren't required in most cases to report their expenditures. But many of those organizations like the publicitly and announce that they're spending millions to get Kavanaugh on the court. And those amounts are substantial. Tester’s campaign pointed us to a slew of announcements from eight groups that are funding pro-Kavanaugh ads. Here’s their tally as of Oct. 2: Funding for pro-Kavanaugh ads Group Amount Judicial Crisis Network > $6 million Great America Alliance ~ $4.5 million America First Policies ~ $2 million NRA-ILA > $1 million Americans for Prosperity > $1 million Citizens United > $250,000 45Committee $650,000 Great America PAC $448,000 TOTAL: ~ $15.84 million With the possible exception of Great America PAC, none of these groups needs to disclose their donors or their expenditures. In addition to data flagged by Tester’s campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice compiled data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks television ad buys in national markets. Here's their list of pro-Kavanaugh ads as of Oct. 3: Kantar Media data (via Brennan Center for Justice; current as of Oct. 3) Judicial Crisis Network $3,692,730 NRA-ILA $1,243,070 America First Policies $1,109,950 State Government Leadership Foundation $473,230 One Nation $404,440 45Committee $118,490 Citizens United $27,490 Great America PAC $5,550 TOTAL: $7.07 million To be clear, this is an estimate of dark money spending. However, groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee have also spent on advertisements in support of Kavanaugh.  Such groups do have to disclose their donors and expenditures, but don't need to do so until the next deadline for the Federal Elections Commission. That means no one can put together a total ad budget favoring Kavanaugh. Without those reports, no one can have a complete accounting of the pro-Kavanaugh ad spending. Nevertheless, this type of spending played a significant role in the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, said Anna Massoglia, an analyst who tracks the flow of dark money at the Center for Responsive Politics.  "" 'Dark money' does make up a substantial portion of spending on the Supreme Court confirmation fight,"" she said. ""But I would be reluctant to classify all spending on Kavanaugh as 'dark money' due to the structure of some of the entities spending on ads."" Tester said, ""Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh’s) ads."" We did our best to tally up the outside spending on the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. But it’s difficult if not impossible to conclusively say how much money is involved. Experts said dark money comprises a substantial portion of spending on the Supreme Court confirmation fight. It’s even possible dark money makes up 80 percent or more of the overall share, as Tester said. But we simply can’t be sure. Neither can Tester.

Could GOP bill targeting abortion require IRS ""rape audits""?
","The Wisconsin Democratic Party combined abortion, IRS audits and rape in a fund-raising appeal it made Jan. 19, 2014. Like many fund-raising emails, this one opened by sounding many alarms: ""Extreme, right-wing Republicans in Congress like Sean Duffy are doubling down on their War on Women with a completely terrifying proposal that not only makes it harder for women -- even those using private insurance -- to access safe, legal abortions, it could actually require the Internal Revenue Service to conduct audits of rape victims."" If the proposal became law, could the IRS really be required to audit rape victims? The legislation The email targets the ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,"" which was introduced by New Jersey Republican Chris Smith in May 2013. Duffy, the GOP congressman who represents central Wisconsin, was one of 167 Republican co-sponsors; there were also four Democratic co-sponsors. With the U.S. Senate controlled by Democrats, the bill stands only a 14 percent chance of becoming law, according to the nonpartisan GovTrack.us. Nevertheless, the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s email said, the bill could become model legislation for states to adopt. When the Democratic Party distributed its email, the bill included a provision that the party claims could require the IRS to audit rape victims. Nine days later, when the GOP-controlled House approved the bill, that provision had been removed. As we do with all fact-checks, we’re evaluating the Democratic Party’s claim based on the facts at the time the claim was made -- in this case, when the provision singled out by the party was still in the bill. That version would have prohibited taxpayers from claiming a medical expense deduction for an abortion, except in cases of rape or incest -- leading some critics to decry so-called ""rape audits."" Nothing in the text of the legislation, however, spells out any conditions under which the IRS could be required to audit women who claim a medical expense deduction for an abortion. Likewise, analyses from two nonpartisan offices -- one by the Congressional Research Service and one by Congressional Budget Office -- make no reference to audits. So, where does the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s claim come from? Party’s evidence Asked to back up the claim, Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff told us: ""Any time someone claims a deduction on their taxes, they could be subject to verify that deduction for the Internal Revenue Service via an audit."" Yes. But that’s different than the party's claim of new legislation setting up a situation in which the IRS could be required to conduct certain audits. Three articles Baldauff provided make a less-sweeping assertion. They say the bill could put women in the position of having to prove to the IRS that their medical expense deduction for an abortion was legal because their pregnancy was caused by rape. We received similar comments from two other opponents of the bill. George Washington University health policy professor Susan Wood told us that if a woman were audited for any reason, and the IRS questioned her deduction for an abortion expense, the woman might have to prove that her pregnancy was due to rape in order to show that the tax deduction was legal. American University law professor Sharon Levin, who directs federal reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, said the bill ""could lead to some women having to document to IRS auditors that they had been raped if they took a tax deduction for an abortion."" Let’s get a better understanding of how audits work. How audits work First of all, there are no statutes that proscribe when the IRS must conduct audits, Baker Tilly tax expert and former IRS attorney Mark Heroux told us. Rather, the IRS uses its discretion, considering various factors, in deciding which tax returns to review, he said. Secondly, when taxpayers claim medical expense deductions, the total amount of the deduction appears on their returns; the medical expenses and procedures are not itemized. As for which returns get audited, here’s how the IRS summarizes the process: When tax returns are filed, they are compared against ""norms"" for similar returns. The ""norms"" are developed from audits of ""a statistically valid random sample of returns."" In other words, on its first pass, the IRS flags returns that are outliers. For example, a taxpayer with modest income who claims unusually high deductions for medical expenses or charitable donations. Then a series of reviews is done to determine whether there will be an audit. Flagged returns are examined by an IRS auditor. The auditor can decide to accept the return or refer it to an ""examining group."" If the group doesn’t accept the return, a manager reviews it and decides whether to accept it as filed, or assign it to an auditor. Finally, that auditor accepts the return or ""contacts the taxpayer to schedule an appointment."" So, the IRS has considerable discretion in deciding which returns to audit. And, again, nothing in the bill targeted by the Wisconsin Democratic Party requires audits. Supporters Duffy’s office referred us to other supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn. Speaking on the House floor in 2011 -- when essentially the same bill, including the provision criticized by the Democrats, was being considered -- Black said ""a woman would not have to list on a tax form that a specific medical expense was for an abortion. That’s simply not how the process works. It’s not how it works today, nor will it be how it works if this is signed into law."" Because tax returns don’t contain itemized lists of procedures such as abortions, a return wouldn't get flagged by the IRS for possible auditing just because an abortion had been claimed as a medical expense deduction. So, a rape victim who claimed a medical expense deduction for an abortion would be put in the position of having to explain the deduction to the IRS only if her return were audited for some other reason, and only if medical expense deductions came into question. We’ll note again that the provision criticized by Democratic Party was in place when the party made its claim, but was removed before the bill was approved by the House. Our rating The Wisconsin Democratic Party said a bill backed by Duffy and other House Republicans ""could actually require the Internal Revenue Service to conduct audits of rape victims"" who get an abortion. The version of the bill criticized by the party did not contain any audit requirements. We rate the claim False.

Providence Mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop says the city needs $1.2 billion to finance its pensions but has only about $250 million
","Providence Mayor Angel Taveras had to deal with near bankruptcy in the capital city after he took office in 2011. As the city struggled to fix its budget problems, he won union concessions to reduce pension costs. But critics question how far the pension deal negotiated by Taveras, now a candidate for governor, went to fix the problem. The most recent figures released last month show the plan is only 31.4-percent  funded. Republican mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop raised the issue during the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of WPRI's ""Newsmakers"" program. Asked why he wants to run again, he said the city needs a mayor who will stay around to solve the city's long-term problems and not have aspirations for higher office, like Taveras and his predecessor, David Cicilline, now a member of Congress. ""We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion,"" Harrop said. That would mean that the city, at the time, had a pension system that was only 20 percent funded. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office says public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) First, we need to explain why we're ruling on a seemingly-straightforward statement two months after it was made. We began work on this item in December but getting up-to-date numbers about the city's pension fund turned out to be maddeningly difficult. The city was often slow to respond and listed different amounts in different reports over different time frames. We decided to wait for the completion of the latest estimate of the city's accrued liability, in part because the city has refused to release an earlier actuary report for the year ending June 30, 2012, citing a dispute over its accuracy. Finally, a week ago, the city released the latest actuarial report, for the year ending June 30, 2013, allowing us to proceed. So let’s go back to December, when Harrop made his statement. At that point, we asked Harrop about his figures. He cited two blog postings on the Providence pension system from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com. One, published Oct. 30,  reported that the fund had $283 million in assets on Oct. 22. The other, published Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of  ""almost $1.2 billion."" Harrop also cited a 2011 city report saying the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million. We don't know the precise status of the pension system the day Harrop made his statement. But now that we have the up-to-date financial reports, we do have a snapshot of what the system's assets and liabilities were as of June 30, 2013. According to that latest actuary report, released Jan. 31, 2014, on June 30 the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations. On that point, Harrop turns out to have been right on the money. At the same time, according to both the actuary report and the city's latest annual financial report, released about a month after Harrop made his statement, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets, a lot more than what Harrop stated. The amount in the city's investment account was $247 million. In addition, there was $3 million in cash and $59 million the city paid into the fund that year. Finally, the report counted as an asset $26 million owed to the fund from loans made to people in the retirement system at a rate of 9.25 percent, according to David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Taveras. Add all those together and you get the $336 million. In Harrop’s defense, at the time he made his statement, up-to-date data on the city’s pension obligations were not available. The city was withholding it as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, who the city accused of making ""fundamental and inexcusable errors"" in its 2012 pension calculations. This year Providence used a different firm, Segal Consulting. Our ruling In December, Daniel Harrop said, ""We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion."" Harrop was citing numbers from different sources and different years, and those numbers are moving targets. They all support his underlying point: Providence's pension program is woefully underfunded, even with recent concessions negotiated with the city's unions. Based on the latest report of the city's actuary, which was not available at the time Harrop made his statement, the candidate was correct on his $1.2 billion figure. At the same time, there was significantly more than a quarter billion dollars set aside in the city's coffers for pension costs. But the number he cited accurately reflected the approximate amount the city had in its investment portfolio. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.

Cantor says CBO predicts Obamacare will cause ""millions"" to lose jobs
","House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, says his description of Obamacare as a job killer has been validated by a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Shortly after the study was released on Feb.4, Cantor issued a news release saying, ""The CBO’s latest report confirms what Republicans have been saying for years now. Under Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans will lose their jobs and those who keep them will see their hours and wages reduced."" Cantor is hardly the only Republican to hail the report; House Speaker John Boehner tweeted that Obamacare is ""expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs."" Democrats replied that conservatives were misrepresenting the CBO’s projections. We looked at the CBO report to see if Cantor’s statement is accurate. The agency estimates that Obamacare will lead to a decline of about 2 million full-time equivalent workers in 2017, 2.3 million in 2021 and 2.5 million by 2024. Cantor suggests the CBO is saying businesses will eliminate existing jobs. But the report refers to employees who decide on their own to leave the workforce because of various Obamacare provisions. ""The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor,"" the CBO says on pages 117-118 of the report. House Budget Committee Chairman. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., phrased the CBO’s findings correctly during a Feb. 5 hearing with CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf. ""Just to understand this, it’s not that employers are laying people off, it’s that people aren’t working in the workforce, aren’t supplying labor, to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024 and as a result that lower workforce participation rate that less labor supplied lowers economic growth?"" Ryan asked the CBO director. ""Yes that’s right,"" Elmendorf responded. Because Obamacare allows people to get subsidies for health care coverage or find insurance outside of an employer setting, the CBO says some folks won’t feel the need to work as much to get health care benefits. Some lower-income workers who receive health care subsidies under Obamacare gradually will get lower federal subsidies as their incomes rise. That, the CBO said, will end up ""discouraging work."" Remember, the CBO is talking about a loss of full-time equivalent jobs. These job equivalents are of a lot of bits and pieces of work hours each week that people will chose to drop. Some people working several jobs, for example, will decide to cut back. Other provisions in the health care law will lower the cost of insurance plans offered to older workers outside the workplace, the CBO said, and that will cause some senior citizens to retire earlier. The report notes that under Obamacare, employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent workers must provide health care coverage to those working 30 hours or more a week. That, the CBO says, may cause some businesses to limit full-time hiring or put more part-time workers on the payroll. But, the CBO added, ""there is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA (Affordable Care Act)."" The future impact of the employer mandate is still unclear, the CBO said, noting that it does not go into effect until next year. When we asked Cantor’s office for comment, press secretary Megan Whittemore emailed, ""We stand by the assertion that millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Virginians will lose their jobs as a result of Obamacare..."" She provided no reference to findings in the CBO report. Our ruling Cantor says the CBO confirmed a long-standing Republican talking point -- that millions of people would ""lose their jobs"" as a result of the health care reform. But the statement is misleading. The CBO projected the law will lead to 2.5 million fewer full time equivalent workers by 2024, but the report does not say that those legions will ""lose their jobs."" That implies the employees will be laid off or forced out of work. To the contrary, the report takes pains to note that virtually all of those people will be working less due to their own choices, such as opting to receive higher federal subsidies for care rather than working more to boost their wages. The CBO said it’s not projecting the law would cause a bump in unemployment or underemployment. The report does not paint a rosy picture of the economy and it can be easy to miss the distinction between people leaving jobs because they want to as opposed to being laid off. But Cantor’s statement is deeply flawed and we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/07/eric-cantor/cantor-says-cbo-predicts-obamacare-will-cause-mill/

Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says union members earn $200 more a week than those not in unions
","Do union members really make $200 a week more than people who aren’t in unions? Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said so during the Feb. 4, 2014, edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Perez said, ""just came out with their data on union membership. … If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week. So collective bargaining is a big part of how this middle class grew in America and it continues to be an important part of who we are as Americans."" We located the report Perez was talking about. In this table, BLS summarizes median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers in 2012 and 2013 by whether they are in a union or not. The table shows that the median weekly earnings for union members in 2013 was $950, compared to $750 for non-union workers. So Perez is basically right, with one exception. He should have referred to median earnings, rather than average earnings. A median takes the exact middle value from a list that’s ordered from biggest to smallest, rather than taking the sum of all earnings and dividing it by the number of people. The two calculations usually aren’t the same; a median is less likely to be skewed by very small or very large values. Meanwhile, it’s worth pointing out a few other bits of context, none of which make Perez’s claim less accurate. • This is an overall median; the ratios by occupation differ. In some sectors, being a union member doesn’t matter much, BLS found. In several sectors -- including ""management, professional, and related occupations,"" ""financial activities,"" ""professional and technical services,"" ""sales and related occupations,"" ""mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction,"" and the federal government -- non-union workers actually earn modestly more than union members do. And union members earn only marginally more than non-union workers in such fields as ""telecommunications"" and ""arts, entertainment, and recreation."" By contrast, the biggest gaps come in fields such as ""protective service occupations"" (a difference of $459 a week) and ""construction"" (a difference of $383 a week). Protective service occupations includes correctional officers, police, firefighters, animal control workers, lifeguards, and security guards. ""Unions do more to raise the wages of workers with less-than-average education than they do to boost the wages of those with better-than-average education,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Unionized Ph.D.s do not gain as much from being in a union as high school dropouts, though even unionized Ph.D.s may enjoy a bit better job security and receive bigger helpings of health and retirement benefits than their non-union counterparts."" • If you include fringe benefits, the difference between union members and non-union workers grows. According to BLS data from 2011, workers’ pay plus benefts for a 40-hour week was $1,508 for a union employee and $1,083 for a non-union worker. That’s a gap of $425 -- more than double the gap in the figures cited by Perez. ""Unions are typically more successful in getting good fringe benefits – especially health benefits, sickness pay, and retirement benefits – than in raising workers’ money wages,"" Burtless said. Our ruling Perez said. ""If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week."" His figures are correct, but with an asterisk -- Perez should have specified ""median"" when he said ""average."" In general, though, his overall point is backed up by the data.

"['LGBTQ', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Before he changed his stance on gay marriage, Charlie Crist says he always supported civil unions
","Charlie Crist, currently a Democratic candidate for governor, has apologized for his prior stance against gay marriage when he was Florida’s Republican governor. His change of heart isn’t that unusual for a politician in the past year or two, as national public opinion has shifted significantly toward support of same-sex marriage. In fact, Crist has tried to portray his evolution as being in line with that of President Barack Obama, who came out in favor of gay marriage in 2012 after favoring civil unions. Like Obama, ""I always supported civil unions,"" Crist told reporters outside a Fort Lauderdale fundraiser Jan. 28. ""But I thought about it just as President Obama thought about it, and I have come to the conclusion, as the Pope said himself, ‘Who am I to judge?’ I’ve always been a live-and-let live kind of guy. That’s what’s in my heart."" Crist made similar claims that he supported civil unions in his political autobiography and in an interview with an LGBT publication. But is it the truth? Charlie Crist’s flip flop on gay marriage In May 2013, Crist came out in support of gay marriage on Facebook. ""Some great news: On Tuesday, Delaware became the 11th state to allow marriage equality. And just a few days ago, Rhode Island adopted a similar measure, which followed victories last fall in Maine, Maryland and Washington. I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here,"" Crist wrote. That was a reversal from 2008 when he voted for a state constitutional ban on gay marriage. We gave Crist a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for his reversal. His past record on civil unions, however, is more complex. Crist on civil unions in 2005 and 2006 In general, civil unions include many of the rights of marriage as it pertains to the state level. Florida doesn’t have a civil unions law, but several cities and counties have domestic partnership registries that afford residents some rights. Gay marriage advocates view both civil unions and domestic partnerships as inferior to marriage. The topic of civil unions surfaced in 2005 and 2006 when Crist, the state attorney general at the time, ran for governor in a primary against then-CFO Tom Gallagher. The constitutional amendment in the works in 2005 banned gay marriage but also included a phrase interpreted by some gay rights advocates and lawyers to ban civil unions, too -- that ""no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized."" In September 2005, Crist signed a petition in favor of the amendment at the request of the Christian Coalition. But in July 2006, Crist told radio talk show host Jim DeFede that civil unions for same-sex couples are ""fine, but I support marriage between a man and a woman."" Watermark, a Central Florida gay and lesbian publication, endorsed Crist in the homestretch of the Republican primary citing his support for civil unions. During the 2006 general-election debate, Crist said, ""We respect civil unions and I do as well. I think it's fine if people want to introduce and go into agreements to be able to have funeral arrangements made, things of that nature. But I think that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman."" Moderator Chris Matthews asked: What's the difference between a civil union and a marriage, legally, under the eyes of the law? Crist replied: ""Under the eyes of this law, under the eyes of Florida, I believe that the difference is that civil unions are not the same as marriage. Marriage is a relationship like my mother and father had. Like I had before I got divorced. It is one of those unique institutions, not only in America but across the world where a man and a woman commit to one another. This is one of the things where I think it is fundamental, it is my belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman and it is different from civil unions."" Crist on the 2008 amendment Amendment backers weren’t able to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot until 2008. Proposition 2 stated: ""This amendment protects marriage as the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife and provides that no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized."" During Florida Supreme Court oral arguments Chief Justice Barbara Pariente asked whether the amendment would prohibit ""any legal sanction of a same sex relationship."" ""Absolutely not,"" replied Mathew Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, sponsor of the amendment. He also said it would not affect domestic partner registries. Justice Peggy Quince asked Staver if a same-sex couple entered some type of union in another state and moved to Florida whether that would be recognized in Florida. ""It depends upon what that union was. If it was the substantial equivalent of marriage, then yes, it (the amendment) would prevent that..."" Staver replied. Justice Raoul Cantero said the meaning of the phrase ""substantial equivalent"" would be open to challenge if the amendment should pass, though he added that it wasn’t a reason to keep it off the ballot. The Supreme Court ruled that the amendment passed the test of addressing only a single issue and containing clear language so it was allowed on the ballot. The ruling didn’t use the phrase ""civil unions"" but stated that the amendment could ban other types of unions. ""The plain meaning of these words, according to dictionary definition, is clear that the chief purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that unions between same-sex couples that are treated virtually identically to marriage will not be recognized in Florida,"" the court held. By early 2008, Crist backed away from the topic and asked the Republican Party of Florida not to spend money on it and direct their efforts elsewhere such as helping presidential candidate Sen. John McCain. ""I'll support it. I'll vote for it. Move on,"" Crist told the Orlando Sentinel in September. ""It's not top tier for me, put it that way."" On election day, Crist told reporters: ""I voted for it. It's what I believe in."" It passed with about 62 percent of the vote. In reality, what did amendment mean? There has been no subsequent challenge that would have tested the meaning of ""substantial equivalent,"" because Florida doesn’t have a civil unions law. PolitiFact sent the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling to a few law professors and asked if the amendment would ban civil unions. What they generally said was it would depend on how closely such a civil unions law resembled marriage (though advocates of gay rights told us they questioned the point of drafting a civil unions law that would be so weak as to pass that test). ""You could craft a civil union bill that is virtually identical or craft one that is not virtually identical,"" said University of Florida constitutional law professor Jon Mills. A statewide domestic-partnership registry law was approved by a state legislative committee in 2013 but later died. Supporters of the amendment fought the registry proposal. Crist on civil unions in 2010 During the Republican U.S. Senate primary in 2010, as he lagged behind his rival, Marco Rubio, Crist switched to run as an independent. Crist released a position paper in which he declared support for civil unions that ""provide the full range of legal protections"" including ""access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families."" Crist told CNN that he had supported a ban on gay marriage but added (once again) that he's a ""live-and-let-live kind of guy. … I think if partners want to have the opportunity to live together, I don't have a problem with that."" Following that interview, Crist put out a statement saying, ""I am fully supportive of civil unions and will continue to be as a United States senator, but believe marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman."" Crist’s adviser's response We sent a summary of our findings to Crist and to former state Sen. Steve Geller -- a Democrat who is informally advising Crist and whose law firm hosted the fundraiser where we heard Crist make the claim. ""It simply isn’t fair to say that someone who votes on a constitutional amendment that has both provisions that he supported (prohibition on gay marriage) and provisions that he opposed (prohibitions on civil unions) necessarily is in support of both or against both,"" Geller responded. ""Here, Charlie is clearly and unequivocally on the record as stating that he was in favor of civil unions. He stated this before Amendment 2 and after."" Our ruling When asked about his changing stance on gay marriage, Crist said, ""I always supported civil unions."" Crist repeatedly made statements in favor of civil unions between 2006 and 2010. In fact a gay publication endorsed him in the Republican primary in 2006 because of his stance on civil unions. But Crist sacrified his support for civil unions by voting for an anti-gay-marriage amendment that could have also banned civil unions. As the amendment headed toward the ballot, news stories often quoted experts who said civil unions could be at risk if the amendment were to pass. That supposition hasn’t been tested, since a statewide law on civil unions hasn’t passed. But while Crist was clearly conflicted about the amendment -- he didn’t campaign for it and he urged the Republican Party of Florida not to spend money on it -- he ultimately did say that he voted for it. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/07/charlie-crist/he-changed-his-stance-gay-marriage-charlie-crist-s/
"['Abortion', 'Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist has called himself 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' and backed certain restrictions while opposing others
","Former Gov. Charlie Crist has done a slew of national television interviews recently promoting his new book, The Party's Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat. So it’s only natural that he’s been quizzed on his political evolution. On Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor on Feb. 4, Bill O’Reilly asked Crist about his changing stance on abortion. ""On abortion, you wanted in the State of Florida to outlaw it, except in rape and incest,"" O’Reilly said. ""But, now, you morphed into, ‘Hey it's a woman's body. She can do what she wants.’ It's a pretty big change."" In response, Crist portrayed himself as being consistent on the topic. ""When I was a young state senator from Tampa Bay -- back in the early ‘90s is when I got elected -- one of the first votes I had as a state senator was on a health care committee. And the bill said you have to have a 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion if she is making that decision. As a Republican, back in the ‘90s, I voted against the bill. As a result of my ‘no’ vote it died on a tie vote. So I’ve always been pro-life personally. But in terms of wanting to change the law, what I said in 2006 was ‘I’d rather change hearts than laws’ and that’s still how I feel."" We decided to put Crist’s stances on abortion on our Flip-O-Meter. We’re not passing judgment on whether a change of position is right or wrong; we’re merely documenting whether there actually has been a change of position or not. We went to the archives to review our earlier fact-checks about Crist’s views on abortion. Overall, we’ve found it hard to label Crist at any point as an abortion rights supporter or an opponent, because he’s been all over the map on the issue. Let’s review the evidence. Crist as a state legislator In 1992 when he ran for the state Legislature, Crist said he was ""pro-choice"" but opposed to state-funded abortion, the Miami Herald reported. Crist won that race. In 1995, Crist was a Republican state senator from St. Petersburg serving on a Senate health care committee. As he told O’Reilly, Crist joined Democrats in voting against a bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion. The 3-3 vote meant that the bill failed. The Tampa Bay Times reported then that Crist was a supporter of abortion rights: ""I generally don't like the government telling people what to do,"" Crist said. ""I believe in individual rights and freedom. That's why I'm a Republican."" But the next year, the health care committee approved a waiting period bill 5-3, after an amendment offered by Crist to restrict the bill to women younger than 18. News reports at the time said Crist favored abortion rights but wanted minors to be adequately counseled. The bill failed in the House. In March 1998, then-Sen. Crist voted to override Gov. Lawton Chiles’ veto of a bill banning what opponents call a ""partial birth"" abortion, a late-term procedure. The House and Senate successfully overrode the veto and that summer the Supreme Court upheld the ban. When he was running for the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Times: ""I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government."" When debating his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Graham, Crist was asked if he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ""No, I would not,"" Crist said. ""I think this is a very personal decision. And I think it is a decision that a woman should make and have the right to make after consulting with her family, her physician and her clergy but not her government."" The 2006 governor’s race In 2006 when he was running for governor, the Times wrote that ""On abortion, Crist’s position is a moving target,"" noting that Crist called himself pro-life. But he didn’t support repealing the U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade, and he opposed a 24-hour waiting period for abortion. ""I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,"" said Crist, whose father is a doctor. Also during the 2006 race, he told a priest in Pensacola that he would sign a bill outlawing abortions except when the mother’s life was at stake. But then he told an AP reporter that he would only sign such a bill if it included exceptions for rape and incest. As Crist and then CFO Tom Gallagher competed for votes in a Republican primary, Crist launched an attack ad calling Gallagher ""pro-choice"" and referring to himself as ""pro-life."" Later, in the general election debate against Democrat Jim Davis, Crist said: ""I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,""' Crist said. ""I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law. . . . I'm pro-life and I'm proud of it, but I don't think that I should impose my will on other people as a result of it."" The 2010 Senate race In January 2010, Crist’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign released a statement saying he would ""fight for pro-life legislative efforts."" In April, as he lagged in a primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the Republican Party to become a ""no party affiliation"" candidate. Weeks later, he vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure ""punitive"" and that the measure was ""almost mean-spirited."" Crist lost the Senate race in 2010 and left the governor’s office in January 2011. Post 2010 In 2012, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Times and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues. ""Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims,"" Crist wrote. Crist was exaggerating here. The platform clearly opposed most abortions but was vague on the details. It does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment referring to then-Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri who made the ""legitimate rape"" comment. We rated Crist’s statement Half True. A few months later, Crist officially signed papers to become a Democrat at a Christmas reception at the White House. We sent a sample of Crist’s past stances on abortion to his campaign. ""He is pro-life. He’s just not anti-choice,"" replied Kevin Cate, a paid Crist adviser. ""They aren’t mutually exclusive."" Cate argued that Crist has been consistent in that he is ""personally pro-life"" but believes the government should not interfere with decisions between a woman and her doctor. In an interview with Watermark, a Central Florida publication that covers the gay community, Crist was asked about his stance on abortion in December: ""It’s confusing because I’m ‘pro-life,’ but by my definition. I’m for life. But I don’t believe the government should tell women what they can and can’t do with their bodies. That may sound inconsistent… I don’t care. I think we’re all for life, and I don’t like the fact that one side of this issue has taken that term and made it theirs. Because when they say they’re pro-life, what are they saying about those of us who believe in choice… that we’re pro-death?! We’re all pro-life. So I’m pro-life, and I’m pro-choice. I’m pro-life because I’m for life, but I will not impose my will on others."" Our Flip-O-Meter rating If we look at Crist’s comments and actions on abortion in sum over his career, this much is clear: He has been conflicted about abortion. In fact, we struggled to find a consistent position he's ever held on the matter. Crist has used the ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"" labels to describe himself at different points in his career, and he now says he is both. There is a kernel of consistency in that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally ""pro-life"" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors.  What is more telling is his stances on particular abortion laws. He has backed restrictions such as a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. But he's also rejected a waiting period for adults and has said he doesn’t want to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Overall, Crist seems to have partially changed position several times, without having any one inflexible position along the way. For this reason, we rate his position on abortion a Half Flip. ",/factchecks/2014/feb/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-has-called-himself-pro-life-and-pro-/

Sheriff David Clarke blames Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett for the size of his property tax bill
","When some politicians speak, it’s like a whisper in the wind. For Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., it’s often more like heavy-metal thunder. In a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article Jan. 31, 2014, Clarke revealed plans to explore a possible run for mayor of Milwaukee in 2016. The sheriff called three-term Mayor Tom Barrett politically vulnerable and lacking vision. Then he lowered the boom. ""I have 7,800 reasons to be critical of Mayor Barrett,"" Clarke contended. ""That's about what I pay in property taxes per year."" As every Wisconsin property taxpayer knows, when property tax bills show up each December, they show dollar-signs from a handful of governmental bodies. So, how is it that Barrett is responsible for the entire amount of Clarke’s property tax bill? That would be some heavy-metal power. Property tax breakdown We plugged Clarke’s home address, on Milwaukee’s far northwest side, into the city property tax database to see his latest property tax bill, for 2013. (Clarke’s spokeswoman confirmed the sheriff was referring to the total amount of his bill. She said he didn't have any other evidence for us to consider.) The record shows Clarke paid $7,728 in property taxes, a bit less than the $7,800 he said in the interview. Before about $200 in credits, Clarke's bill broke down this way: Governmental body Amount of property tax levied City of Milwaukee $2,745 Milwaukee Public Schools $2,728 Milwaukee County $1,387 Milwaukee Area Technical College $575 Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District $460 State of Wisconsin $46 Bottom line: The city’s levy accounts for only about one-third of Clarke’s property tax bill. Even at that, responsibility for the city’s portion can’t be put entirely on Barrett. In Wisconsin, the governing body of each town, village, city, county and school district, as well as the state, levies the total amount of property tax to be raised. The amount is based on the size of each entity’s budget and how much in property taxes, in addition to other revenue, will be needed to fund the budget. (The total levy for Milwaukee County, by the way, is $279.3 million. Nearly one-fourth, $66.7 million, is for the Sheriff’s Office.) As mayor, Barrett plays a pivotal role in how much Milwaukee collects in property taxes. He proposes the city budget and can veto changes made by the Common Council, although ultimately aldermen could override his vetoes. The Milwaukee mayor also appoints seven of the 11 commissioners for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. But MMSD sets its own property tax levy. Meanwhile, Milwaukee Area Technical College District board members, who are appointed by county officials, set MATC’s levy. And levies for Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Public Schools and the state are set by elected representatives of those bodies. Which is to say, Barrett has little or nothing to do with the lion’s share of Clarke’s property tax bill. Our rating Clarke said Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 ""I pay in property taxes per year."" Barrett has significant influence over how much Clarke pays in property taxes to the city, but that amounts to only about one-third of Clarke’s tax bill. We rate Clarke’s claim False.

Is spending at an all-time high?
","Could Congress be on a roll? It has passed two major spending bills in recent months, most recently the so-called farm bill. Many conservatives were rejoicing that the federal crop subsidy program contained cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food stamp program. Too much money is being spent on that program, they argued. ""The cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high,"" we saw on the Facebook pages of some conservatives. One person had a chart showing the annual totals. The highest number was for the 12-month fiscal year period that ended Sept. 30, at nearly $80 billion. We wondered if this chart is correct and about the claim that spending for the program is at an all-time high. SNAP is administered by the federal Agriculture Department. Recipients must meet various income eligibility requirements to join the program. In Georgia, the state’s Human Services Department helps determine whether someone is eligible to get assistance. An estimated 2 million Georgians were receiving SNAP assistance at some point last year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. More than 47 million Americans -- nearly one in seven men, women and children -- receive assistance from the program. Congress cut food stamp spending by $8.6 billion over the next 10 years. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill Friday. The U.S. Agriculture Department keeps data on annual SNAP spending on its website. SNAP spending has risen in recent years like fly balls used to do on summer nights in the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. In fiscal year 2008, the SNAP spending totaled about $53.6 billion. Five years later, it was $79.64 billion. The fiscal year 2013 total of approximately $80 billion was the highest annual total since the program started in 1969. Adjusted for inflation, the 2013 total is higher than any other fiscal year. Once you adjusted for inflation, the prior fiscal year came the closest to 2013, at $79.59 billion. SNAP spending, adjusted for inflation, has increased all but one fiscal year since 2000. The only fiscal year there was not an increase was 2007. We also decided to check whether the amount of money spent per recipient was at its zenith. Close, but not the highest, we found. The department’s chart shows the monthly allotment for each person in a household receiving benefits was at its highest in fiscal year 2011, at $133.85. The 2013 fiscal year total was $133.07. Federal officials said that SNAP spending and the number of recipients are designed to expand during periods of economic upheaval. The Agriculture Department noted in a statement that the number of recipients declined by 500,000 between June and September 2013. The department expects the number of recipients to continue to decrease as the economy improves. Perhaps. Back to the claim we were trying to check. Some Facebook users are posting claims that the cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high. Indeed, the most recent total fiscal year budget has never been higher. Spending per recipient was slightly higher a couple of years ago. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/07/facebook-posts/spending-all-time-high/

President Obama's wins in Rep. C.W. Bill Young's district were closer than George Will suggests
","Conservative pundit George Will honed in on Florida’s Pinellas County for a column about the closely watched special election to fill the shoes of the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Headlining the March 11 race are Democrat Alex Sink and Republican David Jolly. Reporters covering the race usually call it a toss-up district, pointing out President Barack Obama had ""narrow"" wins in 2008 and 2012. (Young typically won by comfortable margins; he was a 40-plus year incumbent.) Will described Obama’s wins differently -- and incorrectly. ""Obama carried this Gulf Coast district, a one-county constituency near Tampa, by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012."" Florida’s 13th Congressional District covers most of Pinellas County, but not all of it. The district stretches from South Pinellas to Dunedin, excluding pieces of southern and downtown St. Petersburg. Will’s column links to election returns from Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections for 2008 and 2012. But he was trying to explain how the congressional district -- and not the county -- voted in those presidential races. The fact that it doesn’t cover the entire county is an important distinction. If the entire county was included, the district would lean more to the left, as Will’s links show. Voting data by congressional district is available, but a lot harder to uncover because it must be tabulated by the precincts in the district (and those change every 10 years). Neither the Florida Department of State nor the Pinellas County elections supervisor’s office keep it. We had luck with the Florida Legislature, which in 2012 wrapped up its once-a-decade redistricting process. The Florida House developed a Web tool called My District Builder that allows data-savvy users to play with the demographic and political information of constituents in various congressional and legislative districts. The election data comes from the Florida Department of State and local elections supervisors. Using this tool, we found: In 2008, Obama earned 51.32 percent of the vote in Young’s old seat (District 10) and Republican candidate Sen. John McCain got 47.14 percent. That’s a margin of 4.18 percentage points. In 2012, Obama garnered 49.95 percent of the CD-13 vote versus Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s 48.49 percent, a margin of almost 1.5 percentage points. Other efforts to analyze the presidential vote by congressional district in 2008 and 2012 produce similar findings, including CNN, NBC News and the liberal Daily Kos. We also consulted David Wasserman, House editor of The Cook Political Report, which has voting data by congressional district prepared by PolitiData. Because the boundaries of Young’s district varied in the elections in question, Wasserman argues it is more fair to compare the 2008 votes of constituents who live in present-day District 13 (versus turnout for then-District 10) with the 2012 returns there. The results are not significantly different from what we found in our exercise with My District Builder (and certainly a lot closer than Will’s.) In 2008, 51.33 percent of voters living within the boundaries of current-day District 13 chose Obama, and 47.54 percent chose McCain -- a difference of nearly 3.8 points. In 2012, 50.25 percent of voters chose Obama and 48.77 chose Romney -- a difference of 1.48 points. Because Will relied on the number of voter registrations in the county and not the district, his column also errantly suggests that Democrats outnumber Republicans in Congressional District 13. He wrote, ""This is a purple but not a polarized district, with 37 percent Democrat and 36 percent Republican."" Those numbers are wrong, too. The party breakdown for the district is 37.1 percent Republican and 34.6 percent Democrat, said Nancy Whitlock, a spokeswoman for the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections. We reached out to Will and his researcher for comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Will wrote that Obama carried the 13th Congressional District ""by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012."" He was using countywide election returns. Using returns from the actual congressional district show a much smaller margin of victory for Obama in both presidential elections. Obama carried the district by about 4 points in 2008 and about 1.5 points 2012. We rate Will’s statement False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/george-will/presidential-election-results-rep-cw-bill-youngs-o/

George Will says, 'Any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically'
","Conservative pundit George Will lamented the waning influence of Election Day in a column about the special election to replace the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young. The race is the first federal election of the year, and both Democrats and Republicans are watching it closely as a potential sign of what will happen in other congressional races in November. The country’s infatuation with early voting will give Democrat Alex Sink a leg up over Republican David Jolly in the race that ends March 11, he argued. ""Sink will benefit from the national trend allowing early voting to obliterate Election Day. Any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically. ... ""Instead of a community deliberation culminating in a shared day of decision, an election like the one here is diffuse and inferior. If Sink wins, Republicans nationally can shrug; if Jolly wins, Democrats should tremble. But no matter who wins, the district loses because it has lost Election Day."" His comment about Florida’s absentee voting policies raised some eyebrows in Florida political circles, so we wanted to check it out. (PunditFact reached out to Will and his researcher via email but did not hear back.) Will’s column links to the website Long Distance Voter, which provides absentee ballot guidelines state by state. In a Q&A format, it asks whether someone can vote absentee on a permanent basis in Florida. The answer says ""sort of,"" explaining that ballots can be requested for a specific election or in advance of a regularly scheduled election. We checked with official sources, too. Both the Florida Department of State and the Pinellas County supervisor of elections’ office directed us to the Florida Statutes, 101.62 (1)(a). It reads: The supervisor shall accept a request for an absentee ballot from an elector in person or in writing. One request shall be deemed sufficient to receive an absentee ballot for all elections through the end of the calendar year of the second ensuing regularly scheduled general election, unless the elector or the elector’s designee indicates at the time the request is made the elections for which the elector desires to receive an absentee ballot. Translation: If a voter requested an absentee ballot for the Congressional District 13 special election, he or she would automatically receive one for the 2014 and 2016 general elections (unless he or she requested it just for this election). After that, their request would be canceled unless they made another request at some point. ""So it’s not indefinite, in other words,"" said Pinellas County elections supervisor spokeswoman Nancy Whitlock. A voter who requested a ballot for the 2012 general election would automatically get one for the 2014 special election, as it is one of the elections covered in the two-cycle window. The exception would be if they requested a ballot solely for the 2012 election. Our ruling Will’s claim that ""any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically"" is not accurate. A Florida voter who requested an absentee ballot would get one automatically through the end of the calendar year of the second general election -- not ""henceforth."" Will used strong language to describe why Sink would have the edge, saying people get mail-in ballots in perpetuity in Florida. But that's not the way it works.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/george-will/george-will-says-any-floridian-who-has-ever-reques/

David Jolly 'lobbied on a plan' to turn Medicare into a voucher program, Alex Sink says
","Alex Sink’s campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat continues to pile on Republican rival David Jolly’s lobbyist past. The latest attack has been that the Dunedin native lobbied on radical changes to Medicare. A campaign commercial released on Jan. 25, 2014, features a voiceover detailing Jolly’s financial windfall from his work in Washington. It goes on to say, ""Jolly even lobbied for a group committed to privatizing Social Security and then lobbied on a plan to turn Medicare into a costly voucher program."" Did Jolly lobby on Medicare vouchers? This is a significant charge, since the district ranks eighth in the nation for population over 65 -- those eligible for Medicare. It’s also turning into a favored Democratic attack against Jolly, implying that he favored a plan to alter the program. We decided to investigate. The Ryan budget Jolly was a longtime aide and general counsel to the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young, whose death triggered the March 11 special election. Later, Jolly worked as a lobbyist from 2007 to 2012, first for Van Scoyoc Associates Inc., then for his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. One of his clients at both firms was Free Enterprise Nation, a pro-business, anti-regulation advocacy group founded by Jim MacDougald, who is now Jolly’s campaign finance co-chairman. A Nov. 2009 lobbying disclosure form (with spelling errors) shows Jolly worked on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation for ""Health Care reform, Social Security Reform, Paycheck Fairness Act and other labor related issues and initatives; Taxpayer proection, and Small business."" His campaign confirmed the disclosure referred to a meeting with Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the former vice presidential running mate for Mitt Romney. Ryan has written several budget proposals that support restructuring Social Security and Medicare. Ryan’s plan was first submitted to the House as ""The Roadmap for America’s Future"" in 2008 and again in 2010.  The proposal called for Medicare to be replaced with a government payment to beneficiaries to buy private insurance instead. These payouts were called subsidies or ""premium support"" by supporters and ""vouchers"" by detractors. The plan was reintroduced in 2011, 2012 and 2013, when they were passed by the Republican-led House but not the Democratic-controlled Senate. So the budget proposals have never been enacted. PolitiFact has considered whether the Ryan version of Medicare was a voucher system, and found the claim was Mostly True, though a more expansive version of the Democratic claim -- that proposals like Ryan’s would ""end Medicare"" -- received PolitiFact’s 2011 Lie of the Year. The Jolly campaign at first said Jolly didn’t actively lobby either way to get Ryan’s budget proposals passed. Then they said he opposed the part of the plan that would change Medicare. Jolly was there to ""advocate for transparency of the out-year obligations of Social Security and Medicare"" and  ""transparency and protecting promises made to beneficiaries,"" said Jolly campaign spokesman Sarah Bascom. On a Dec. 8, 2013, edition of Bay News 9’s Political Connections, Jolly himself said ""there was a lot of good in the Ryan budget."" But Jolly also said he believed the budget wasn’t the proper approach to some problems. ""I think we have to be careful on the Ryan budget for a couple of reasons,"" he said on the show. ""Entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare — we know what that means to the community here. I have said from the very beginning, we have to protect the promises that have been made, to everybody."" Vouching for Jolly None of Jolly’s disclosure forms for his work with Free Enterprise Nation list Medicare as a topic. Nonetheless, the Sink campaign inferred that if Jolly was discussing ""Health Care reform"" with Ryan, and Ryan’s budget proposal was a topic, then Jolly had lobbied on the voucher plan. Experts we spoke to said the term ""Health Care reform"" was broad enough to include Medicare, since disclosure forms only require topics and not specifics. The caveat is that Sink’s attack would imply, to most reasonable people, that Jolly was in favor of the voucher plan, not against it. Experts on lobbying said that if Jolly was at a meeting where the Ryan budget was discussed, that counts as lobbying. Brett Kappel, an attorney for Washington, D.C., law firm Arent Fox who specializes in lobbying, said that according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, being paid for any discussion of a piece of legislation with a covered government official is an act of lobbying. ""It doesn’t matter whether you’re for or against it,"" Kappel said, adding that even though Ryan’s budget proposal was a not technically a piece of legislation -- budget resolutions do not get sent to the president to be signed, as normal bills do --  it qualified as an item covered under disclosure guidelines. ""There are a lot of gray areas in the rules,"" he said. ""This isn’t one of them."" It also doesn’t matter if Jolly’s sentiments about the budget were his or those of his client, Free Enterprise Nation. ""He’s representing his client,"" Kappel said. ""If he didn’t know his client’s position, he shouldn’t have said anything."" Finally, Jolly himself said in a Feb. 3, 2014 interview with Tampa Bay TV station WFLA, that he had lobbied on the budget proposal. ""A federal lobbying registration filing for a client simply says that this bill was discussed, so yes, I met with Paul Ryan, at the time that he was writing the Ryan budget,"" Jolly said, again specifying the conversation was about projecting future costs of Social Security and Medicare. ""So what I talked to Paul Ryan about was transparency of the out-year debt, and as he’s wrestling with reforms, making sure that’s included. Now, all that appears on the filing is that I Iobbied on the Ryan budget, so they have taken that and they can play with it however they want."" Our ruling One of Sink’s campaign commercials claims that Jolly ""lobbied on a plan"" by Ryan that would turn Medicare into a voucher program. She’s suggesting that a meeting with would-be Medicare reformist Ryan on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation had to be advocating for the congressman’s plan to alter the face of the retiree health insurance program. Jolly’s campaign acknowledged that Jolly had attended a meeting on an overall budget proposal that included changes to Medicare, and under the law, that is enough to count as lobbying. But Jolly’s camp says he didn’t support Ryan’s potential changes to Medicare, and we can’t contradict that. More importantly, neither can Sink. Democrats used vague language that a reasonable person would assume meant Jolly was promoting the voucher portion of the proposal, when Jolly says he was critical of it. There’s a lack of evidence to tie Jolly specifically to that part of the Ryan budget plan, even though he did lobby on the legislation and was discussing Medicare. Sink is leaving out important context as she tries to harness a hot-button issue. We rate her claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/alex-sink/david-jolly-lobbied-plan-turn-medicare-costly-vouc/

Chain email claims Barack Obama has signed 1,000 executive orders to grab power from Congress
","In his State of the Union address last month, President Barack Obama said he doesn’t intend to wait if Congress doesn’t move forward on his priorities in 2014. ""I'm eager to work with all of you,"" Obama said Jan. 28. ""But America does not stand still, and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do."" That means using his executive office — ""I've got a pen and I've got a phone,"" he has taken to saying lately — to accomplish his agenda, if necessary. Republicans have lashed out in response, insisting Obama is overstepping his authority. Reps. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Steve King, R-Iowa, even threatened to sue the president. We also saw an old chain email resurface claiming that Obama has already issued more executive orders than any of his predecessors. It first gained attention in the fall of 2012. ""This president is determined to take control away from the House and Senate,"" the email says, while providing a tally of presidential executive orders from Teddy Roosevelt to Obama. The email claims Obama issued 923 executive orders in his first 3.5 years and ""More than 1000+ and counting executive orders in six years."" It goes on to list a handful of examples of Obama’s alleged work. (Read the chain email in its entirety.) As we dug into its claims, we found that pretty much everything about this email is wrong. And most of it was already debunked more than a year ago by our good friends at FactCheck.org. But several readers sent it to us again, and since the issue of executive authority has become newsworthy of late, we thought this deserved an update. By the numbers The tradition of executive orders dates back to our first president, George Washington, though it was used sparingly through the first 100 years of the union. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he can (and plans to) raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour. The process picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder. After Grant, it became commonplace for presidents to issue more than 100 executive orders. In fact, four presidents have eclipsed 1,000 executive orders: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (Notice Obama is absent from that list.) Franklin Roosevelt holds the record with 3,522 executive orders during his 12-plus years in office. But according to the chain email, FDR used his pen infrequently and issued a paltry 11 executive orders -- another inaccuracy. Here’s the incorrect tallies of presidential executive orders in the chain email versus the actual numbers, provided by the University of California Santa Barbara The American Presidency Project. President Executive orders according
to chain email (false) Actual number of
executive orders Franklin Roosevelt 11 3,522 Harry Truman 7 907 Dwight Eisenhower 2 484 John F. Kennedy 4 214 Lyndon Johnson 4 325 Richard Nixon 1 346 Gerald Ford 3 169 Jimmy Carter 3 320 Ronald Reagan 5 381 George H.W. Bush 3 166 Bill Clinton 15 364 George W. Bush 62 291 Barack Obama 1000+ 168* *As of Jan. 20, 2014 It’s obvious the chain email is way off. Not only is Obama far from the most prolific user of executive orders, at this point he’s not even on pace to surpass President George W. Bush’s total. In fact, unless he picks up speed, Obama will likely sign fewer executive orders than any two-term president since the start of the 20th century. Judging the acts That’s not the only part where the chain email invokes an alternate reality. It also lists 14 executive orders Obama signed that allegedly usurp traditional executive powers, including things like seizing control of the media, railroads, waterways and correctional institutions. The email invited us to ""Feel free to verify the ‘executive orders’ at will."" When we looked up the specific executive order numbers that the chain email mentioned, we found that they were all signed by other presidents. Also, those order numbers matched up with executive orders on either entirely different topics or orders that were much more limited in scope. Here's the rundown:    Executive order number What the chain email
claims it does What it actually does Who actually signed it No. 10990 Allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports. Created the Federal Safety Council in the Department of Labor to improve workplace safety for federal workers and civilian contractors Kennedy No. 10995  Allows the government to seize and control the communication media. Assigned telecommunications management functions  Kennedy No. 10997 Allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of the Interior  Kennedy No. 10998  Allows the government to take over all food resources and farms. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of Agriculture  Kennedy No. 11000 Allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of Labor  Kennedy No. 11001 Allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  Kennedy No. 11002 Designates the registration of all persons. Postmaster General to operate a national registration. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Postmaster General  Kennedy No. 11003 Allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft. Assigning emergency preparedness functions to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency Kennedy No. 11004 Allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations. Assigned certain emergency preparedness functions to the Housing and Home Finance Administrator  Kennedy No. 11005 Allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Interstate Commerce Commission Kennedy No. 11049 Assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period. Directs Secretary of Commerce to help president decide which public works projects to fund through Public Works Acceleration Act  Kennedy No. 11051 Specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis. Prescribed responsibilities of the Office of Emergency Planning in the Executive Office of the President  Kennedy No. 11310 Grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President. Assigned emergency preparedness functions to the Attorney General Johnson No. 11921 Allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. Financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. Adjusted emergency preparedness assignments to organizational and functional changes in Federal departments and agencies  Ford   As you can see by the table, none of these executive orders were signed by Obama. The first executive order Obama ever signed was No. 13489, far later than even the most recent executive order listed in the email (they count up). Many of the executive orders listed above deal with the Defense Protection Act passed by Congress in 1950 and reauthorized repeatedly since then. According to the Congressional Research Service, the act says ""authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense."" Obama has signed subsequent executive orders similar to the ones issued by Kennedy, Johnson and Ford that deal with emergency preparation, but they don’t create a state of martial law, like the email implies. The Congressional Research Service even said in 2000 that the Defense Protection Act ""has nothing whatever to deal with martial law."" Our ruling The chain email said Obama has issued more than 1,000 executive orders. That’s not even close. As of Jan. 20, 2014, he was at 168. The email also infers that Obama has far surpassed his predecessors in using his executive powers. That, too, is way off. FDR signed off on more than 3,500 executive orders, and, in fact, Obama is on pace to issue fewer executive orders than any two-term president since 1900. As for the 14 executive orders highlighted in the email? Obama didn’t issue any of them. They came from Kennedy, Johnson and Ford. Almost all of them have been revoked. Overall, the statements in this email seem to be completely made up. So we rate its claims Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-barack-obama-has-signed-1000-ex/

Milbank: O'Reilly said 40% of the words in Obama interview
","At least among Fox News viewers, nothing boosts audience like taking President Barack Obama to task. The day after Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had an interview with Obama, O’Reilly picked up an additional 1 million viewers for his show The O’Reilly Factor. The president sat down with O’Reilly right before the Super Bowl, and the tone of the conversation itself stirred up a flurry of reactions. Here’s a small example from a moment when O’Reilly pressed Obama on the administration’s response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. O’Reilly: If (Ambassador to the United Nations) Susan Rice goes out and tells the world that it was a spontaneous demonstration... Obama:  Bill... O’Reilly:  -- off a videotape but your... Obama:  Bill... O’Reilly:  -- your commanders and the secretary of Defense know it's a terror attack... Obama:  Now, Bill... O’Reilly:  Just... Obama:  -- Bill... O’Reilly:  -- as an American... Obama:  -- Bill -- Bill... O’Reilly:  -- I'm just confused. Obama:  And I'm -- and I'm trying to explain it to (you), if you want to listen. No wonder that many observers described the interview as testy. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank called it ""the roughest and nastiest exchange"" of the three times that O’Reilly has interviewed Obama. ""He interrupted the president 42 times in 10 minutes,"" Milbank said on MSNBC’s Politics Nation. Of all the words uttered in this 10-minute interview, 40 percent were uttered by O’Reilly."" We wanted to check Milbank’s numbers. Not on the interruptions, but on the word count. We pulled out our digital centrifuge and separated the O’Reilly and Obama utterances. According to our research, O’Reilly delivered 787 words to Obama’s 1,484. This gave O’Reilly 35 percent of the conversation. That’s a little lower than Milbank said but more or less in the same ballpark. We reached out to Milbank and did not hear back. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare this with another one-on-one interview between the president and a journalist. A couple of days before Obama sat down with O’Reilly, he did the same with CNN’s Jake Tapper. We subjected that transcript to the same rigorous methods and found that Tapper spoke 23 percent of the time, leaving the president the other 77 percent. The precise word counts were Tapper -- 849 and Obama -- 2,886. Milbank’s point was that O’Reilly’s interview was almost as much about O’Reilly as it was about the president. We don’t know about that, but we can say that O’Reilly spoke about 50 percent more than Tapper did in his interview. The topics in the two interviews differed greatly. O’Reilly brought up Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Tapper focused on issues like immigration reform, legalization of marijuana, spying by the National Security Agency, and security at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. O’Reilly had a second installment of his time with Obama that aired the night after the Super Bowl. Milbank’s comment came on the same night, so we’re counting only the segment that had aired publicly at that point. For the record, in the second installment, O’Reilly asked the president about African-American children raised in single-parent households, school vouchers, the Keystone pipeline, a contraceptive coverage exemption for Little Sisters of the Poor, and veterans benefits. Our ruling Milbank said O’Reilly said 40 percent of the words during his interview with the president. That was a little high. By our count, 35 percent would be more accurate. O’Reilly spoke decidedly more than Tapper did in his time with Obama. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/dana-milbank/milbank-oreilly-said-40-words-obama-interview/

Conservative website says Barack Obama signed law to require health professionals to share private data that would lead to gun confiscation
","Three of the biggest hot buttons in politics these days are health care, privacy and guns. Put all three of them together and you get an explosive claim. A reader recently asked us to look into a blog post at the website Mr. Conservative, with the provocative headline, ""Obama Quietly Uses Executive Orders For Two New Gun Control Laws."" ""Just a few weeks ago,"" the post said, President Barack Obama ""quietly used executive action — one of his new favorite pastimes — that has got gun owners’ feathers in a ruffle. According to Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government. The illegally obtained data is then used as justification for gun confiscation by the federal government."" Mr. Conservative’s claims don’t have to do with Obama’s health care law. Obamacare explicitly bars the collection of information about ""the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition"" or the maintenance of ""records of individual ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition."" Rather, at issue is a proposed rule that would clarify some currently murky interpretations of privacy restrictions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which set limits on who can share and receive private health information about individuals. The provision cited in the blog post is designed to make clear that state authorities are allowed to share certain information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to screen potential gun purchasers. Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law-enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Another one -- the one that’s important for this discussion because it intersects with the health care system -- is involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The instant background check system is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. Several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, privacy is a key reason cited by states that haven’t provided data about involuntary commitments. The federal government’s argument is that these states are being needlessly cautious. The government says the kind of data being sought for background checks isn’t subject to HIPAA’s privacy restrictions. The HHS proposal would explicitly clarify that point. Let’s take a look at the claim phrase by phrase. • It’s an ""unconstitutionally enacted law."" Like the old-timey drink known as an egg cream -- which includes neither egg nor cream -- this provision isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted yet and it’s not unconstitutional. A law is a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president; that doesn’t describe this provision. Nor is it an ""executive order,"" the term used in the headline. Executive orders are directives written and personally signed by the president. Instead, it’s an administrative regulation. Specifically, it’s a notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. In other words, it’s a policy proposal emerging from a federal agency, with a specified public comment period before the agency decides whether to enact it -- or scrap it. So while it’s fair to say the Obama administration is behind it, it would be incorrect to say it’s already ""enacted."" It’s currently in the comment phase, and it may not ever be enacted. As for ""unconstitutional,"" the Supreme Court, for one, doesn’t consider the regulatory process to be problematic constitutionally. ""Some people do question the constitutionality of the administrative state, but as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it's been settled law for almost 100 years that Congress can delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. • ""Health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws to submit medical data to the government"" The information reportable to NICS doesn’t concern physicians’ medical records about diagnoses of mental illness, prescriptions, or treatment recommendations. Rather, the relevant information for gun-buying purposes -- and thus for providing data to NICS -- are decisions by ""a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority."" As HHS put it when it released the proposed rule, ""Seeking help for mental health problems or getting treatment does not make someone legally prohibited from having a firearm, and nothing in this proposed rule changes that. Furthermore, nothing in this proposed rule would require reporting on general mental health visits or other routine mental health care, or exempt providers solely performing these treatment services from existing privacy rules."" Importantly, HHS added that ""the proposed modifications would merely permit, and not require, covered entities to report to the NICS."" That directly conflicts with the blog post’s claim. So, let’s recap: ""Health care professionals"" is misleading -- it’s courts, boards and commissions, not doctors, who would be submitting to NICS. ""Are now"" is wrong because, as we noted, this is a proposal and is not in force yet. ""Required"" is wrong because state entities would be able to submit to NICS, but would not be required to do so. ""To violate HIPAA privacy laws"" is at best misleading because HIPAA already didn’t block the transfer of this kind of data; the proposed rule simply makes that point extra clear. And ""to submit medical data to the government"" is misleading because only involuntary commitment data is sought by NICS, not detailed treatment records. • It’s ""justification for gun confiscation"" The idea that Obama wants to take away Americans’ guns is a durable one among his critics. But it’s unclear the extent to which the HHS proposal would make this scenario more likely. On the surface, all NICS does is prevent ineligible people from newly purchasing a gun. It says nothing about taking away the guns they already own. But if someone is unable to purchase a gun, it also means they’re unable to own a gun. The question is how aggressively this is enforced. Critics of the proposal say that increasing the flow of mental-health information to NICS could promote rise in confiscation. If enacted, the proposal ""would make it clear that the ATF and other federal agencies could troll this database for persons with Alzheimer's, PTSD, ADHD, etc.,"" said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, a group that has been critical of the HHS proposal. In the group’s official comments to HHS on the proposal, it cited a letter from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that says that 140,000 veterans have been added to the NICS list over the years. Coburn and Gun Owners of America say too many of these veterans are being caught up in the dragnet. In addition, California in 2013 passed a law that allocated $24 million to enforce the confiscation of firearms from people who are not allowed to own them, using a variety of databases; about 30 percent of these people were mentally ill. While NICS only accepts into its database the official determinations of mental incompetency, Hammond warned that there’s no universal standard for incompetency determinations. They may be ""made with little more than a psychiatric diagnosis and perhaps a star-chamber proceeding, in which a supposedly incompetent person is deemed competent to have waived all of his or her rights,"" Hammond said. ""This would mean that the names of persons who had received little due process"" might find their information newly added to NICS, leaving them open to confiscation. But even if these are legitimate concerns, others don’t see the HIPAA proposal as a harbinger of massive gun confiscations. Mark Heyrman, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, called any kind of large-scale gun confiscation effort based on the HHS action ""implausible."" Jay Corzine, a sociologist who studies gun policy at the University of Central Florida, agreed, saying the proposal strikes a ""reasonable"" balance. Federal law ""proscribes possession of a firearm by persons in these groups and could conceivably lead to seizure of firearms owned prior to their change in status,"" he said. ""This currently occurs in selected situations -- domestic violence cases in some states for example. Not very many people would be impacted, however, and the idea that this is the opening move in a planned campaign for large-scale gun confiscation is far-fetched at best."" Our ruling The post we’re checking said that, ""according to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government,"" which is ""then used as justification for gun confiscation."" The elements of this claim range from misleading to flat-out wrong. The one area of reasonable concern is that some jurisdictions may lack full due process for declaring someone mentally incompetent, potentially putting some people at risk of seeing their guns confiscated. But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible. The rule isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted and it isn’t unconstitutional according to Supreme Court jurisprudence. It isn’t a requirement, and it doesn’t involve routine diagnostic data compiled by ""health care professionals"" such as doctors. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/mr-conservative/conservative-website-says-barack-obama-signed-law-/

Are people having to shrink back their businesses because of Obamacare?
","Editor's note: The ruling statement on this report has been changed to clarify that we're fact-checking the law's effects on some businesses in Oregon. The original statement was simply, ""People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result of the law."" Controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act isn’t going away anytime soon. Republicans have vowed to make Obamacare a central theme of the 2014 campaign, while Democrats insist that troubles with the initial rollout are subsiding and that millions of Americans now have health insurance as a result of the law. A new congressional report on the law, meanwhile, appears to stoke potential arguments on both sides. U.S. Senate candidate Monica Wehby toured Oregon recently, meeting with 100 business owners in as many days. Wehby is running for the GOP nomination to face Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. During a stop in La Grande, Wehby said the new law threatens to hinder Oregon’s efforts to dig out of the Great Recession. ""We obviously have a lot of concerns about the health care law,"" she told a gathering of about 15 people at a La Grande coffee shop. ""People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result of the law."" There have been many claims about the Affordable Care Act, but this one caught our attention. Is the law causing businesses to shrink? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We contacted Wehby’s campaign and got a response from Charlie Pearce, her communications manager. In addition to providing links to national news stories reporting that some major companies are cutting employee hours to avoid ACA-related insurance costs, he directed us to Robert Decker, owner of Westcare Healthcare Management in Salem, a company that operates health care facilities for veterans and the disabled in several states. Decker said costs associated with the new law prompted him to sell three care facilities in Idaho in 2012. When he ran the numbers, he found it would cost him between $800,000 and $1 million to provide health insurance for the 650 employees he had in Idaho at the time. Spending that much money on insurance, Decker said, would have rendered those businesses unprofitable. ""The health care law was a big driving force in our selling those facilities,"" Decker said. ""It had a big impact on us, no question."" Two supervisors with the company that bought the bulk of Westcare Management’s Idaho holdings confirmed the March 2012 sale. Both declined to give their names, saying they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the transaction. The company’s human resources director did not return our calls. To gauge the accuracy of Decker’s health-care costs claim, we called T.J. Sullivan, a partner in Huggins Insurance in Salem. His agency has been advising Oregon businesses on how the health care law affects them. The average premium for ACA-approved business plans runs about $250 to $300 a month, he said, with management picking up about half of that. Assuming costs of $125 per month for 650 workers, Westcare Management’s costs under the new law would run roughly $975,000 annually, Sullivan said. On that score, Decker’s assertion checks out. Decker’s company is privately held and he declined to discuss profits, however, so we weren’t able to independently verify that a cost of $800,000 to $1 million would have rendered the businesses unprofitable. Sullivan said he has seen effects of the new law locally, as well. One provision, the so-called employer mandate, has been delayed until 2015. It requires businesses that employ more than 50 people --  who all work at least 30 hours a week -- to provide insurance to their workers. However, Sullivan said he is working with at least one Salem-area company in that category that’s trimming hours to get employees under 30 per week. The company has multiple locations and employs about 100 Salem-area residents. The company’s owner, Sullivan said, is aiming to trim work hours to get 60 to 75 of those employees under the 30-hour threshold. The owner isn’t hiring workers to fill the gap -- nor laying anyone off, Sullivan said. He declined to name the company, saying that he wanted the owner to speak for himself. The owner did not return our calls. From Sullivan’s description, however, the business is ""shrinking."" A new report from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the new law will mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021 as hours are reduced. The report contains an important caveat, however, in noting that many of those losses will be voluntary as people opt to keep their incomes low to remain eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid. Next, we wondered whether state employment data reflect either trend -- larger companies not hiring that 51st employee or smaller ones hiring more part-time employees to avoid health-insurance requirements. Not according to a blog entry posted Nov. 6, 2013, by Josh Lehner, senior economist in the state Office of Economic Analysis. ""Here in Oregon,"" Lehner wrote, ""over 90 percent of the jobs added between 2009 and 2012 have been full-time positions, on net."" Later in the post, he added, ""Of course, the so-called ‘employer mandate’ under the health law doesn’t take effect until 2015, so it’s possible that employers are simply waiting to cut hours until closer to the deadline. But there’s little evidence they’ve started yet."" Clarity on the issue may not be coming anytime soon. According to Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, ""This is a really tough one to get a handle on. Even after enough time has passed for the impacts of the law to show up in the aggregate data, these impacts will be difficult to isolate."" Oregon, like the rest of the country, continues to wrestle with the Affordable Care Act. The two major political parties are largely split on whether it represents government overreach or the best way to control health-care spending while providing insurance to those who don’t have it. Wehby told a small audience in La Grande that ""People are having to shrink back their businesses as a result."" It’s true that Wehby said businesses are ""having"" to shrink their operations. There’s a nuance there suggesting businesses are being compelled to make cuts. Because we can’t assess motives, we chose to look more narrowly at whether businesses are or are not making cutbacks in response to the law, accepting that the overwhelming majority would be acting with their businesses’ bottom line in mind. Wehby’s campaign provided an example of a significant scaling back of an Oregon-based business, though aspects could not be independently verified. She also gave us links to national news stories reporting similar cuts elsewhere. An Oregon consultant also outlined an example of a business trimming employee hours as a result of the law. We rate her claim True.  ",/factchecks/2014/feb/06/monica-wehby/are-people-having-shrink-back-their-businesses-bec/

Grants from Staples’ agency were small part of existing border camera program
","Lieutenant governor candidate Todd Staples says he not only has a plan that addresses border security, he’s already tackled the challenge. Staples, Texas’ agriculture commissioner, wrote in a Jan. 13, 2014, campaign email blast, ""Using cost savings that I achieved from cutting government waste, I helped fund Operation Drawbridge, a low-cost, high-tech, DPS-led operation that placed game cameras along the border to detect illegal trafficking. ""As a result, more than 21,500 arrests have been made and 46 tons of narcotics confiscated."" The Texas Department of Agriculture indeed approved aid for Operation Drawbridge, we learned, but the multimillion-dollar Department of Public Safety project had already been in place for most of a year. Also, Staples’ cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridge’s overall results. In an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and he’s never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agency’s savings ""helped"" achieve the results. ""I don’t want to get popped for something I’ve never taken credit for,"" he said. Operation Drawbridge The state’s Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its website. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program. The main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor’s Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million. A description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news story said, ""(T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results."" A 2013 DPS conference presentation placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation. 
 
 Images from 2013 conference presentation on DPS website preparingtexas.org  Staples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege. His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge. Staples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help. Savings to buy cameras Black said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a chart with the agency’s ""lapsed appropriations,"" money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13. It showed the total returned to the state treasury in 2012-13 was $10.3 million. DPS spokesman Vinger sent us web links to his agency’s Oct. 11, 2012, press release on the $225,000 grant and Aug. 8, 2013, release on the $120,000 grant. The 2012 release said, ""Operation Drawbridge is fully operational today with hundreds of cameras located along the border. This funding will essentially double the number of cameras involved in the program."" Drawbridge was operating 750 cameras as of June 30, 2013, according to the online DPS presentation. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton emailed us a Sept. 28, 2012, grant agreement between the agencies stating that the $225,000 grant was ""for the funding of additional DPS remote motion-sensing cameras, installation and monitoring activities associated with the surveillance along the border, particularly in those areas of the Texas-Mexico border where illegal activity and border violence have adversely affected rural landowners and the Texas agriculture industry."" An Aug. 8, 2013, McAllen Monitor news story said, ""The $120,000 grant is for DPS to expand the program by purchasing more motion-sensing cameras."" Arrests and confiscations From January 2012 through December 2013, according to Vinger and the DPS website, Drawbridge ""resulted in the apprehension of more than 22,950 individuals and more than 50 tons of narcotics."" The October 2012 press release announcing the first Department of Agriculture grant said Drawbridge had ""resulted in the apprehension of approximately 4,000 individuals and 10 tons of narcotics since January 2012."" So it would appear that at least 18,950 people and 40 tons of narcotics were captured from Oct. 11, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2013. Some supporting detail comes from the 2013 DPS conference presentation:    Our ruling Staples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated. This statement could leave the misleading impression that a few hundred thousand dollars committed on Staples’ watch to an established program near the border culminated in the touted arrests and confiscations. It’s documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we don’t see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operation’s funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governor’s office. We rate this claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Ann Coulter says a friend's sister ""died from Obamacare"" because Blue Shield of California left
","Of all the reasons Republicans oppose Obamacare, none is more stark than death. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter on Feb. 2, 2014, offered what she called a ""shocking and horrible"" personal story on Fox & Friends Weekend illustrating lethal consequences of the health care law. Coulter told host Tucker Carlson that she woke up Saturday morning to an email from a friend who said her sister ""almost died because of Obamacare."" Coulter zipped through the backstory: The woman ""had been thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California."" The woman tried to ""get on Obamacare, (but) couldn’t get through the website."" Then she got a fever, but she didn’t want to go to the emergency room without insurance. On Thursday, the woman went into septic shock, Coulter said, and went to the hospital. Coulter recounted the story in a Saturday speech. ""I got up to my hotel room after the speech and my friend sent me an email saying, ‘My sister died from Obamacare,’ "" she said. Carlson responded, ""That is completely shocking."" Coulter added that she asked her friend if she could tweet the sister's story, and ""She said, 'Julie would be very happy for you to tweet this.' "" We don't know the name of the woman (beyond Julie), the type of coverage she had or anything about her medical history, and Coulter did not respond to our request for more information. But the claim that someone ""died from Obamacare"" because Blue Shield ""completely just pulled out of California"" is something we can fact-check. It’s obviously misleading to say someone died from Obamacare in the same way someones dies from cancer or a car accident. Hospitals in the United States are required to treat patients whether they have health insurance or not. But more germane to this particular fact-check is Coulter’s assertion that the woman found herself without insurance because Blue Shield pulled out of the state of California. That did not happen. Blue Shield of California: Still in business Some insurance companies stopped writing health insurance policies in the individual market in California, but not Blue Shield of California. The not-for-profit insurer competes with for-profit insurer Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente. It continues to be a big player in the individual marketplace, which is what we assume Coulter is talking about, as well as the state’s health exchange, Covered California. Like other insurers across California and the country, Blue Shield of California could no longer offer some health insurance plans because they did not include ""essential health benefits"" required by the Affordable Care Act. These plans could not be grandfathered in under the new law. Blue Shield of California sent letters to 119,000 customers in September notifying them their current plans would end ""but we can still have you covered in 2014."" PunditFact obtained a sample cancellation letter from the company. The letter explained Blue Shield would offer new plans that include the minimum health benefits required by the health care law, such as emergency services, prescription drugs and preventive care. If a customer took no action after reading the letter, he or she would be automatically enrolled into a new plan recommended by Blue Shield. This was meant ""to ensure that no one experienced a lapse in coverage,"" said spokeswoman Mia Campitelli. The letters went to 57 percent of the insurer’s individual market customers, she said. For two-thirds of the people who lost their plan, the recommended option was more expensive, the Los Angeles Times reported. This scenario was similar for 300,000 Florida Blue customers last fall. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said affected customers were ""going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."" But PolitiFact Florida rated that claim Mostly False because they were not losing coverage unless they opted out. Most of these Blue Shield of California customers were given the chance to temporarily extend their old plan until the end of March 2014 because the state’s insurance regulator determined they did not give customers 180 days of notice. About 15,000 people decided to take the extension, Campitelli said. For a customer to be without Blue Shield coverage after getting the letter, he or she would have had to contact Blue Shield to cancel the recommended plan. Campitelli said the company would not have a number for how many people chose to drop Blue Shield until open enrollment ends after March. Trouble with the website? Coulter said her friend’s sister tried to get Obamacare but couldn’t get through the website. (That’s assuming she canceled her Blue Shield coverage.) But if the woman was looking for new coverage in California, she would not have needed to access the troubled federal marketplace, healthcare.gov. California is one of the states running its own insurance marketplace. Consumers are free to buy coverage directly from insurers, but if they want access to tax credits to offset the cost, they have to go through the exchange. Covered California was not as hampered by technical difficulties as healthcare.gov, though it has not been without its snags, particularly during the hectic leadup to the end of open enrollment for 2014 coverage. The marketplace extended deadlines to accommodate some shoppers, said California deputy insurance commissioner Janice Rocco, and about 500,000 people chose an insurance plan during the Oct. 1-Dec. 31, 2013, enrollment period. Our ruling Coulter said a friend’s sister ""died from Obamacare"" because she was ""thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California."" We're not fact-checking whether someone died. We're looking at the circumstances Coulter presented. Blue Shield did not pull out of California, and the company did not leave people without insurance. In fact, customers were allowed to keep their existing insurance plans through March. If the basic facts of Coulter’s story are accurate, the woman in question elected to drop insurance coverage. Whatever the story of Blue Shield, saying someone died ""from Obamacare"" is incendiary and grossly misleading. Coulter’s claim rates Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/feb/05/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-friends-sister-died/
