Did Julie Parrish vote to send $160 million to private for-profit schools?
","
One of the fiercest legislative fights in 2011 had to do with a bill that loosened enrollment restrictions at online charter schools. It was a battle mostly along party lines and now House Bill 2301 has cropped up in a competitive House race in Clackamas County.

Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, is the freshman incumbent. Her Democratic opponent is Metro councilor Carl Hosticka of Tualatin. In a September guest column published in the West Linn Tidings, he listed a number of Parrish’s many legislative failings -- in his view -- including this one:

""During this time of cuts in public education, my opponent voted to divert $160 million from public schools to private for-profit schools,"" Hosticka wrote.

Parrish asked for a PolitiFact ruling, with this tart remark: ""Online schools are public schools, not private. And I'm not sure where he gets the $160M diverted to for-profit schools as again, while they are contracted out, these are still part of the Oregon public school system.""

Solid questions. Both major party candidates are claiming to be the education advocate in the race. We plowed on.

The controversial legislation was approved as part of a compromise deal involving charter school advocates in the House Republican caucus and Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat. What readers need to know for this PolitiFact is that the legislation loosened restrictions on online enrollment, authorizing up to 3 percent of a school district’s population to attend a virtual school.

There are an estimated 560,000 Oregon public school students in grades K-12, which means the legislation would allow up to 16,000 students to enroll in online academies. However, there’s nowhere near that number in virtual schools; enrollment grew from 4,200 students in the year before the legislation to 5,400 students the year after. Enrollment figures for this fall are not available yet.

In Oregon, the money follows the student, from the state to school districts, and then from the school district to a traditional school or charter school. For charter schools, the amount is roughly $5,200 a student a year, compared with $6,000 for a student at a traditional school.

The 5,400 enrollment figure translates into $28 million going to online schools in a single year, 2011-12. That is a fraction of the $160 million estimated over two years, a budget period that Hosticka didn’t clarify in his statement. We do, however, find his $160 million estimate based in fact, since 16,000 students multiplied by $5,200 comes out to $166 million for a two-year period.

So if the maximum number of students allowed by the legislation were to enroll in online schools, at least $160 million would go toward those online schools over two years. We’ll put aside the question of whether that’s cherry-picking on the part of Hosticka. We want to know whether those schools are ""private for-profit?""

The answer is no. By definition, charter schools -- both brick-and-mortar and online -- are public schools. They are sponsored by a public school district, or the state. They use public money to educate students, who pay nothing. (Private schools, on the other hand, charge tuition and can do such things as require students to attend religious services, which a public school could not do.)

Where does the ""private for-profit,"" language come from?

There are fewer than a dozen online-only schools in Oregon and most number enrollment in the hundreds, if that. The largest virtual school is Oregon Connections Academy, out of Scio. The school is run by a nonprofit corporation and board, but it’s part of the Connections Academy network, whose parent company is Connections Education, which is now part of Pearson. Connections Education LLC is a private, for-profit entity based in Baltimore, Md.  

The second-largest virtual school is Oregon Virtual Academy, out of the North Bend School District, which contracts with K12 Inc.

Hosticka stands by his statement that $160 million will be diverted from public schools.

""She’s trying to hang me on a technicality, whether it’s a public school or a for-profit school. You can make the argument it’s an amalgam of both,"" he said. ""It’s technically a charter school, but then they contract with a for-profit company for education. I’m prepared to stand by this statement that $160 million would end up at for-profit schools.""

We ran the statement by various education groups in Oregon, and received two very different responses.

""In terms of a diversion, absolutely. You’re taking from one pot and putting it in another, taking it from neighborhood schools that are already struggling and passing it to for-profit, private, out-of-state companies,"" said Becca Uherbelau, spokeswoman for the Oregon Education Association, the union that represents school teachers but not the ones at charter schools.

Then there’s Sue Levin, executive director of the advocacy group Stand For Children. She is not an advocate of charter schools or virtual charter schools, and she offers no opinion on their quality. But the schools are part of the public school system.

""He’s trying to create an impression that in a tight budget, actual dollars were taken out of the state schools funds but that is absolutely not the case. That is misleading, and particularly in the environment that schools are in, it’s pretty inflammatory,"" Levin said.

Clearly there’s a wide difference of opinion on what deserves to be part of our taxpayer-paid public school system. There are arguments that online schools are not very effective as well as arguments that they are a lifesaver for children who can’t attend a physical school.

But Levin, who doesn’t particularly champion them, is right. Like it or not, online charter schools are public schools, so we’re not sure how $160 million can be ""diverted"" from public schools. The money cited is also the maximum amount, should 16,000 children overnight enroll in online classes, which nobody expected to happen and which didn’t happen -- so $160 million is overblown.

Hosticka’s statement contains an element of truth, we’ll give him that. The two largest online charter schools in Oregon exist because of private companies that want to make money. But charter school advocates have the Oregon Department of Education on their side: Online schools are public schools. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9A3F40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/13/carl-hosticka/did-julie-parrish-vote-send-160-million-private-pr/
"['New Hampshire', 'State Budget', 'Ovide Lamontagne']","
Republican Lamontagne paints opponent Hassan as tax-and spend liberal
","
A central strategy of Republican candidate for governor Ovide Lamontagne's campaign has been labeling Democratic rival Maggie Hassan as a liberal spender of epic proportion.

It's a strategy that’s proven successful before.

In 2010, Hassan, the state Senate’s top Democrat, was swept from office during a political landslide that gave control of the Senate and House back to Republicans who painted their Democratic rivals as tax-and spend liberals.

""If you look at state spending, the truth is under Maggie's leadership we increased state spending in the middle of the great recession by 24 percent leading up to and following it,'' Lamontagne said in the midst of his 90-minute debate with Hassan at Rivier University in Nashua late last month.

PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the accuracy of that statement.

Hassan was elected to the state Senate in 2004 and spent six years in office. She became a chief budget writer in 2007-2008 and was Senate Majority leader in 2009-2010. The great recession peaked between 2007 and 2009, which covers her time in office. Democrats controlled the Senate during those years and she played a critical role in state budget decisions.

We checked with the Lamontage campaign and they backed up their 24 percent spending claim  by pointing to state budgets signed into law before the two-year budget cycle even begins, not what was actually spent.

In Fiscal Year 2006  and 2007, when Republicans were last in charge of the Legislature, the total budget they passed was $9.3 billion. The budget for the following 2 years was $9.7 billion.

Meanwhile, the two year budget for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the second under Sen. Hassan’s leadership, was $11.5 billion, which is in fact a 24 percent increase from four years earlier.

""Those numbers don't lie,"" said Lamontagne Communications Director Tom Cronin.

However, those numbers aren’t the state’s actual spending.

The sitting legislature can make budgetary changes along the way, so the two-year approved budget isn’t the same as what gets spent.

""Every appropriated budget doesn't mirror what gets spent and it can change in either direction, less gets spent in some bienniums, more has to get spent in others,'' said Legislative Budget Assistant Jeff Pattison.

""The appropriated budget is an important statement because it does represent what the Legislature had intended to spend. But it's never the final picture.''

For example, the budget agreed to for 2010-11 that Hassan helped craft called for $11.5 billion in spending, but the state’s independent auditors confirmed what actually spent was $10.7 billion during that time.

State spending is typically measured two different ways: One way is to include total spending, which includes federal grants. The other way is measure spending from state taxes and fees, which lawmakers have greater control over.

Put another way, the state of New Hampshire plans to spend $10.4 billion over the next two years, which includes federal funds, but only 26 percent of that, $2.6 billion, comes from state taxes and fees.

Lets look at the numbers:

Using the total spending figures from all sources in the state budget for the 12-month period that ended on June 30 of that year, according to the state’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for FY2011, spending did go up while Hassan was in office, but not by as much as Lamontage says.  

Fiscal 2006: $4.4 billion
Fiscal 2007: $4.5 billion
Fiscal 2008: $4.8 billion
Fiscal 2009: $4.9 billion
Fiscal 2010: $5.4 billion
Fiscal 2011: $5.3 billion

So, total state spending over the years Hassan was in the Senate went up 20 percent, not 24 percent.

Now, looking at spending from state sources that budget writers have more control over presents an even leaner spending picture.

Here are the amounts actually spent from state taxes and fees in the state budget for the 12-month period that ended on June 30 of that year. (It should be noted that in 2010 and 2011, $180 million to operate the state-owned liquor stores and to support local school construction costs was removed from the state's books. For the purpose of testing the accuracy of Lamontagne's statement and comparing spending over those years, we added that money back in.)

Fiscal 2006: $1.35 billion
Fiscal 2007: $1.39 billion
Fiscal 2008: $1.51 billion
Fiscal 2009: $1.44 billion
Fiscal 2010: $1.38 billion*
Fiscal 2011: $1.33 billion*

These numbers reveal spending from state revenue sources actually went down slightly during Hassan’s time in office.

Steve Norton, executive director of the non-partisan New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies, said lawmakers often make tweaks to the budget, but the depth of the recession required Governor John Lynch and Democrats controlling the Legislature to make deep spending cuts.

In the fall of 2009 and spring of 2010, Lynch and Democratic legislative leaders adopted two rounds of spending cuts totaling more than $233 million.

These included freezes on hiring, out-of-state travel and purchasing, laying off nearly 200 state workers, restructuring state debt, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid.

Another maneuver was removing the State Liquor Commission off state spending books putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account. Another $90 million was saved by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover the state costs for local school construction projects.

Hassan cites these cuts on the campaign trail, saying she helped decrease spending during her final two years in the legislature when she was majority leader. However, she is using the numbers from state taxes and fees, not total spending.

""There is no support for the notion that we overspent. In fact we were the first Legislature to actually cut state spending in decades of legislative control under Republicans,'' Hassan claimed at the first debate the two had at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics last week.

The Hassan campaign pointed to the state's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report that concluded state spending declined by 8 percent -- from $2.95 billion for the two-year 2008-09 period, down to $2.7 billion in 2010-11. Again, these figures look at strictly state spending and leave out the federal numbers.

While Hassan is correct spending did go down in that second, two-year cycle when compared to the first two years she helped write the budget, but adding back in the $180 million for the liquor stores and school construction, the decrease is more like a 2.2 percent from the previous two years, not 8 percent.

Our ruling

In trying to paint his challenger as a big spender, Lamontagne pointed to four years of state budgets when Hassan was in the Senate.

While the proposed budgets show a 24 percent increase from all sources, total spending went up by 20 percent, which is slightly less. And looking at the money state budget writers have the most control over -- funds spent from state taxes and fees -- spending actually went down a hair, since the Democrats twice reopened the budget to make cuts.  

Based on this analysis, we find the claim of state spending having gone up 24 percent to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD1D440>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/ovide-lamontagne/republican-lamontagne-paints-opponent-hassan-tax-a/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'China', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says Biden sympathized and wouldn't second-guess forced abortions and sterilizations
","
Did Vice President Joe Biden really endorse forced abortions and sterilizations in China?

That’s the accusation made by Paul Ryan, who said Biden ""sympathized and wouldn’t second guess (China’s) one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations,"" during their Oct. 11, 2012, vice presidential debate.

Ryan’s statement about China came after moderator Martha Raddatz asked for the candidates’ views on abortion.

Ryan talked about his Catholic faith and the Romney campaign’s anti-abortion position (which includes exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother). He characterized the Democratic Party as increasingly supportive of abortion, ""without restriction and with taxpayer funding.""

Then he got to China.

""The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn't second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations,"" Ryan said. ""That to me is pretty extreme.""

We decided to fact-check whether Ryan was describing Biden’s position accurately.

First, a little background: China’s one-child per-couple policy dates back to 1979, when the government became alarmed by its rapid population growth during the prior 30 years. As a response, it restricted the number of children to one per family, with some exceptions. China’s population growth rate slowed with each ensuing decade.

But the population-control measure has received widespread criticism from the international community because government officials in localities have been known to force women with unauthorized pregnancies to get abortions and sterilizations.  

Forced abortions are illegal in China, and recent news reports suggest they became less frequent in the last decade, but they still happen.

What Biden said

In a 2011 visit to Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, Biden answered a student’s question about the United States’ downgraded credit rating and its plan for reducing the deficit. The solution, Biden said, was to reform U.S. entitlement programs such as Medicare.

He said as the Baby Boomer generation retires, a relatively small working population will be left to support those retirees.

Then he likened the situation to China’s growing inequity in the ratio of workers to seniors --  a consequence of its one-child policy:

""As I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China. You have no safety net. Your policy has been one which I fully understand -- I’m not second-guessing -- of one child per family. The result being that you’re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable.""

So Biden did make a trip to China and said he fully understood and did not second-guess the country’s one-child policy.

Reproductive rights advocates have room for displeasure here -- he had an opportunity to condemn the policy and he didn’t. But that’s far from an affirmative endorsement that Ryan’s words imply.

Shortly after Biden’s China visit, the White House argued that he called the one-child policy unsustainable. He didn’t though: He said a situation in which one worker takes care of four retired people is ""not sustainable.""

In response to criticism about Biden’s remarks at the time, a White House spokeswoman said Biden ""strongly opposes all aspects of China’s coercive birth limitation policies, including forced abortion and sterilization"" and ""believes such practices are repugnant.""

Our ruling

Ryan accused Biden of going to China and saying he ""sympathized and wouldn’t second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.""

Biden did not use the word ""sympathize"" and didn’t endorse the one-child policy. Instead, he said that he understood it and wouldn’t second-guess it.  Days after the speech, his spokeswoman said he specifically condemned ""coercive birth limitation policies.""

Ryan’s claim contains a kernel of truth, but it ignores critical context that would leave a different impression. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACAFDC0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/biden-sympathized-and-wouldnt-second-guess-forced-/

Joe Biden says no Democrats support Paul Ryan’s Medicare proposal
","
In their only face-to-face debate of the campaign, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin challenged and chided each other’s proposals, particularly on the hot-button issue of Medicare reform.

Ryan is the author of a House budget proposal that calls for substantial changes to the government health care program for seniors, including an eventual shift to ""premium support"" which beneficiaries could use to purchase private insurance. Romney has embraced it as a means of introducing choice and competition into Medicare. Democrats, including Biden and President Barack Obama, say it will end up costing seniors more.  

In the Oct. 11 debate, Ryan defended the plan as having bipartisan support:

""This is a plan that's bipartisan. It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat
senator from Oregon,"" said Ryan.

""There's not one Democrat who endorses it,"" Biden interjected.

""Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon,"" Ryan answered amid some cross-talk.

""And he said he does no longer support (it),"" Biden insisted.

Medicare -- complex, polarizing and highly political because of the huge voting bloc of seniors who cherish it -- is center stage in the campaign. We decided to check who’s right about across-aisle-support for the Republican plan.

The Ryan budgets

Ryan, the Republican House budget chairman, first unveiled a budget blueprint in early 2011 that would convert Medicare to the premium support model. It also raised the program’s eligibility age from 65 to 67, called for a repeal of Obamacare and reined in other spending to reduce the federal deficit. It passed the House on April 15, 2011, but the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected it a month later.

Arguments over Medicare hit a fever pitch that year, with Democrats accusing Republicans of voting to ""end Medicare."" Then, in December, the hope of compromise peeked through the partisan clouds.

Ryan and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., joined together and offered a compromise on Medicare reform ideas. Their ideas were contained in a white paper -- never taking the form of legislation -- and were branded as marrying the best proposals from each side.

The main difference from Ryan’s original plan: The new proposal left in place traditional Medicare for those who wanted it, while still offering premium support to buy private policies.

""There's a lot to work with here in terms of trying to find common ground,"" Wyden said at the time, according to the Washington Post. ""This doesn't end Medicare as we know it. People can go to bed knowing that traditional Medicare will be there for them for all time.""

He said the plan presented ""the opportunity for progressives and conservatives to come together and address the real challenges"" of the federal entitlement program: rising health costs and an aging population.

Democrats were unequivocal in their criticism. The White House returned to the old party line, saying the plan would ""end Medicare as we know it."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats said it would essentially kill Medicare. Republicans, who sensed a political opportunity in the defection of Wyden, offered more open-minded reactions. Newt Gingrich, who called Ryan's original plan ""right-wing social engineering,"" praised the Ryan-Wyden deal as ""a major breakthrough.""

Wyden, a senator since 1996, is known as policy-driven and liberal-minded, but also a true and rare compromiser. He told the Oregonian newspaper in March 2012 that he was not being punished by Democratic leaders for partnering with Ryan, saying his biggest adversaries were special interests.

""When you deal with a big issue where there are a lot of passions, you expect this,"" he said then. ""I made the judgment that I couldn't just sit by and talk about business as usual for this program that, for me, has been sacred for three decades.""

He also found himself fending off suggestions by Romney that he abetted the Republicans’ Medicare plan. Wyden, according to the Oregonian, said he'd never spoken to Romney. He posted an explanation in the Huffington Post titled ""Preserving the Medicare Guarantee: Why I've Been Working with Paul Ryan.""

He used personal anecdotes to explain his motivation to fight for seniors and warned that serious reform was needed to preserve the ""guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older.""

In the meantime, Ryan unveiled his budget proposal for 2013. It contained many of the same hallmarks as its predecessor: reduced federal spending, repeal of Obamacare. Only this one incorporated the Ryan-Wyden plan for Medicare, with premium support and the traditional option.

Wyden said he was wary of the wider proposal, citing a lower limit for Medicare's spending growth and a full repeal of the health care overhaul. He also warned his Medicare white paper should not be used to anoint the whole Ryan budget as having bipartisan support.

""Any person on the right who says that this is about cover -- that person is hurting senior citizens,"" Wyden said in a March 20 story in Congressional Quarterly Today. ""I say that explicitly because they're making it tougher to get a bipartisan agreement in the future.""

Partners no more

If the spring of 2012 showed the Ryan-Wyden romance fading, late summer was the break-up. On Aug. 11, 2012, Ryan was tapped as Romney’s running mate, and within days, Romney was hailing his VP nominee’s Medicare plan as bipartisan -- and naming Wyden.

""Paul Ryan and Sen. Wyden said, 'No, we need to restore, retain and protect Medicare,' "" Romney said at a campaign stop in Virginia. ""That's what our party will do.""

The Post wrote that Wyden was ""apparently displeased about his sudden prominence as a validator of the Republican ticket.""

""Gov. Romney is talking nonsense,"" Wyden told reporters, according to the Post.

He explained in detail his two main objections to Romney’s proposals in an interview with Ezra Klein, who writes the Post’s Wonk Blog. Repealing Obamacare, he said, would undo changes to Medicare that are necessary to transition to premium support.

Secondly, Romney has proposed turning Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and disabled, into a block grant to the states and rein in spending. That change, Wyden said, ""would do enormous harm to those people whose protection was at the center of the white paper."" Romney’s approach to Medicaid ""completely pulls the rug out from under the poorest and most vulnerable seniors,"" he said.

If any doubt remained following the vice presidential debate on Oct. 11 about Wyden’s position on the Republican Medicare plan, Wyden addressed it the same night on his Facebook page.

""The Republican ticket knows that neither I, nor any other Democrat, would support these policies. The Romney/Ryan plan on Medicare is further proof that Mitt Romney is singularly unfit to end gridlock and bring bipartisan solutions to Washington,"" he wrote.

Our ruling

Biden said ""there’s not one Democrat who endorses"" the Republican proposal to fundamentally restructure Medicare.

That hasn’t always been the case. Last year, Wyden and Ryan put their heads together and offered a compromise proposal for the future of Medicare. But that bipartisan bond began to crack months ago when the Wisconsin congressman put forth a second budget with provisions Wyden opposed. Their partnership dissolved in August, after Ryan joined the Romney ticket, and Wyden made a point of talking up the differences between his and the Republicans’ ideas for Medicare, not the similarities.

Wyden was the only Democrat to endorse Ryan’s idea of premium support in Medicare, and his approval has clearly been revoked. We rate Biden’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAAD1C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-no-democrats-support-paul-ryans-med/

Paul Ryan says Canada now has 15 percent corporate tax rate
","
Canada doesn’t often get mentioned in political debates in the United States, but our northern neighbor had a cameo in the vice presidential debate, cited as a bastion of low taxes.

Seeking to draw a contrast with the tax policies of President Barack Obama, Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin native, said, ""Where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior — the Canadians — they drop their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent.""

We wondered whether Canada was really as much of a low-tax haven as Ryan indicated.

Canadian corporate taxes

We found two measurements of Canada's corporate tax rate from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations. Over the past 15 years, the trendline for both has been consistently downward. Since 1998, the central government corporate rate has declined from 29.12 percent to 15 percent today; while the combination of the central and provincial corporate tax rates has fallen from 42.94 percent to 26.1 percent today.

So Ryan is right that Canada’s national rate was recently lowered to 15 percent -- the culmination of policies put forward by both center-left prime ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin and current center-right prime minister Stephen Harper, who took office in 2006. Small businesses today have a special, lower rate of 11 percent.

Still, it’s worth noting that when you take into account average provincial tax rates -- the equivalent of state corporate taxes in the U.S. -- the combined corporate tax rate in Canada rises to 26.1 percent.

International comparisons

What about Ryan’s claim that the ""average tax rate on businesses in  the industrialized world is 25 percent""?

We can use the same OECD data to check this claim. Averaging the 2012 tax rates for OECD members, we found that the average for the 34 countries studied is just slightly under 25 percent. That’s just as Ryan said.

And in case you’re wondering, the top U.S. corporate tax rate, including both federal and state taxes, is 39.1 percent. That’s quite a bit higher than Canada’s, and since April, it has been the highest corporate tax rate on the books of any OECD nation.

Still, the actual tax rate paid by a company will likely be lower than the official rate, due to deductions and exemptions.

Our rating

Ryan said Canada dropped its corporate tax rates to 15 percent and that ""the average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent."" He’s correct on both counts, though it’s worth pointing out that provincial taxes boost Canada’s rate to 26.1 percent, and that the actual rate paid by specific companies in certain countries, such as the U.S., can be lower than official rates due to deductions and exemptions. We rate Ryan’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA776C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-canada-now-has-15-percent-corporate/

Biden says 'we weren't told' about Libya security requests
","
The attack on the consulate in Libya that took the life of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans has put the Obama administration on the defensive. In the vice presidential debate, moderator Martha Raddatz pressed Vice President Joe Biden to explain why administration officials at first described the attack as something that emerged from a protest: 
RADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why were people talking about protests? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters. Why did that go on? 
BIDEN: Because that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment. That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there are any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again. 
RADDATZ: And they wanted more security there. 
BIDEN: Well, we weren't told they wanted more security there. 
In this fact check, we'll look at whether the administration was told that that U.S. officials in Libya wanted additional security. 
In a House hearing on Wednesday, a State Department employee, Eric Nordstrom, said he told his superiors twice that the embassy mission needed more armed security. Nordstrom was the regional security officer for Libya in the months before the attack. In a July cable, he said he wanted 12 guards plus military trainers. 
Charlene Lamb, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department who reviewed his request, confirmed at the hearing that she opposed keeping the security team in Libya. 
Beyond putting his assessment on paper, Nordstrom made that request verbally to a State Department officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. ""His response to that was, 'You're asking for the sun, moon, and the stars,'"" Nordstrom said. 
Nordstrom, who still works for the State Department, described a phone call with that officer and his frustration with the department's bureaucracy. 
""I said, ' It's not the hardships. It's not the gunfire. It's not the threats. It's dealing and fighting against the people, programs, and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me,"" Nordstrom said. 
State Department officials at the hearing argued that they met other security requests and that the additional personnel would have been of little use since they would have been based in Tripoli. The attack took place in Benghazi. 
Nordstrom was seeking more forces for the embassy mission nationally, not exclusively Benghazi. In fact, the number of guards at the Benghazi consulate when the attack occurred was at or near the number Nordstrom said were needed for that site. 
White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said that Biden was aware of the House testimony and was answering the debate question in terms of what the White House knew, not the entire administration. 
""The vice president was speaking for himself and the President, Vietor said. ""In over four hours of testimony the other day, no one suggested that requests for additional security were made to the president or the White House. These are issues that are appropriately handled by security professionals at the State Department."" 
Our ruling 
Vice President Biden said, ""We weren't told they wanted more security."" 
That statement is accurate only if you define ""we"" to mean ""people at the White House."" A State Department officer in Libya said that he requested additional guards and was turned down by at least one other official in the State Department. The White House said Biden meant that the security requests had not been conveyed to him and others in the executive office. 
It's possible that Biden and Obama were unaware of that request. Still, it was made in the State Department, which is part of the Obama administration. Even if it didn't make its way up through the bureaucracy, a request was made.

That could prove of interest to Nov. 6 voters deciding between Huber and Republican opponent Gerald Daugherty, a staunch supporter of building Texas 45 Southwest — a 3.6-mile road that would connect FM 1626 and South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).

Huber has taken action against the project both as a commissioner and as a member of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. But has she supported not building it?

The comment Aleshire flagged came from a Sept. 17, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, so we began by talking to the newspaper’s transportation reporter, Ben Wear, and asking Aleshire for evidence contradicting Huber.

Wear and archived Statesman stories got us up to speed on the long-proposed project. Currently pitched as a four-lane tollway divided by a median, it’s been part of the CAMPO long-range transportation plan for years; the right-of-way for it was purchased in 1997.

Every five years, CAMPO’s board approves a rewrite of the 25-year plan, which looks at everything from roads, trains, planes, public transit and freight to bikes and feet in Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. ""Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money,"" said a May 24, 2010, Statesman news story.

This stretch of Texas 45 Southwest was proposed in the mid-1980s as part of a Texas 45 that encircled the entire metropolitan area and was to be dubbed the Austin Outer Parkway. Some segments were later built, others abandoned.

Wear described the road’s potential impact today — or rather, sometime after 2020 to 2025, when construction might start under CAMPO’s plan — in his Feb. 5, 2012, column: 
A horde of exurbanites from places such as Kyle and Buda comes up FM 1626 each weekday morning to go to work in Austin. Right now, those people have to then take crowded Brodie Lane (and then Slaughter Lane or William Cannon Drive) to get to MoPac. Texas 45 Southwest would allow those commuters a more or less straight shot to MoPac. 

Critics of Texas 45 Southwest, including Huber, say there’s not enough evidence that the highway would ease Brodie traffic. They also cite environmental concerns, because the road would cross the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone.

In a June 11, 2010, opinion piece in the Statesman, Huber wrote: 
Because of constraints on transportation funding, Texas 45 SW is now proposed as a toll road. No study yet demonstrates that commuters would pay the tolls and avoid Brodie. ... It is irresponsible to spend an estimated $100 million on Texas 45 SW without effectively justifying it. 
Meanwhile, there are other projects of much more demonstrated need and much higher priority that must be built first, like increasing vehicle capacity on South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) and improvements to the Y at Oak Hill. 

According to Statesman news stories, Huber introduced a resolution in May 2010 asking her Commissioners Court colleagues to support culling 45 from the CAMPO plan. It passed 3-1, effectively ending county backing for the road.

Huber is also a member of the CAMPO board, which consists mainly of local elected officials. In that capacity, she made an unsuccessful motion later in May 2010 to drop 45 from the plan.

The board approved the plan with two votes against (one being Huber’s) and 17 votes in favor. The May 24, 2010, Statesman story quotes Huber: ""We've got real priority problems in this plan. I cannot support this plan, because I cannot support business as usual.""

The story said, ""However, she did successfully knock down an eleventh-hour recommendation from TxDOT that construction on Texas 45 Southwest begin in 2015 rather than 2020.""

Aleshire, whom we interviewed by phone and email, sent us news articles and documents describing Huber’s opposition to the road. None quoted Huber saying she wanted to stop the road outright, though they included instances of Huber offering reasons not to proceed immediately.  

We asked editors at two local newspapers covering the Texas 45 issue whether they recalled or had reported Huber saying ""Don’t build it"" or something similarly unequivocal. Editor Will Atkins of the Oak Hill Gazette and managing editor Veronica Gordon of the Hays Free Press each told us by phone they did not recall such a statement. Atkins searched his paper’s archives, also finding no such statement.

While Aleshire acknowledged he didn’t have direct evidence, he told us that the ""proof is her motion at Commissioners Court to remove it from the county plans and her motion at CAMPO to delete it from the Metropolitan Transportation Plan entirely, making the project ineligible for state or federal funding.""

Were Huber’s actions to pull 45 out of the plan equivalent to saying ""Don’t build it""?

In a phone interview, CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us she didn’t think removing 45 from the plan would keep it from being built because it could later be restored to the plan by an amendment. It’s ""not atypical"" for a road to be added to the plan that way, she said.

If the road weren’t in the plan, it wouldn’t be eligible for federal funding. We asked TxDOT Austin spokesman Chris Bishop how likely it was that the state could build such a road. ""We have done roads without it,"" he said. ""Matter of fact, at one point I remember this was proposed as being done with state funds.""

He recalled two nearby examples of roads built with state funding, albeit two decades ago: Texas 45 Southwest between FM 1826 and MoPac and the stretch of South MoPac to Texas 71/Ben White Boulevard.

Whether the puzzle pieces of state funding, local funding, potential toll revenues, etc., would come together for this road is a variable, he and McCoy said, as is the project’s eventual cost. McCoy pointed out that the study now being conducted on the road’s environmental impact could indicate, for example, that the road should have two lanes instead of four.

By telephone, Huber told us she’s been consistent in her position: ""I’m saying, on that road, that I do not believe we should move forward with it till we conclude that it is going to do what they say it is going to do"" (in easing Brodie traffic).

Now, in fact, Huber said she doesn’t mind keeping 45 in the CAMPO plan, because that allows the environmental study to continue.  

""I just don’t believe we should go to construction until we have answers.""

Our ruling

Huber claimed that she’s never said ""don’t build"" Texas 45 Southwest.

As far as we can tell, there’s no instance of Huber being so blunt. But her efforts to get the road pulled from the CAMPO plan and her stated desire not to proceed to construction without more information are evidence she doesn’t want the project built yet.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says Obama administration called Bashar Assad 'a reformer'
","Three times during the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan accused the Obama administration of being soft on Syrian president Bashar Assad.

The administration, Ryan said, ""called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people."" He repeated the claim twice more in the 90-minute debate.

We decided to take a closer look. First, some background.

Assad’s family has maintained a tight grip on power in Syria for decades. As the Arab spring rippled across the region in early 2011, Syria began to experience unrest, with protests emerging both in the capital, Damascus, and Deraa, a relatively remote city near the Jordanian border.

What happened in Deraa in March 2011 became the spark that ignited a widespread revolt that has now morphed into a bloody civil war.

Several schoolchildren were arrested in late February 2011, accused of scrawling graffiti on a school that said ""the people want to topple the regime,"" according to CNN. When residents found out that the boys were beaten and tortured in prison, they sought their release but were rebuffed.

On March 18, security forces opened fire on protesters in Deraa, killing at least four, according to Human Rights Watch. ""Within days, the protests grew into rallies that gathered thousands of people,"" according to Human Rights Watch.

The comment Ryan referenced came just over a week after the killings in Deraa, on the March 27, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, which included an appearance by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Schieffer asked Clinton how the situation in Syria was different than in Libya, where the U.S. took action against a repressive government.

Clinton: ""Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don’t think that it’s yet clear what will occur. What will unfold? There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he’s a reformer. What’s been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning. But there’s a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities, then police actions, which frankly have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see.""

The comments quickly drew criticism in some quarters. For instance, four days later, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote, ""Few things said by this administration in its two years can match this one for moral bankruptcy and strategic incomprehensibility. … It was hoped that President Assad would be a reformer when he inherited his father’s dictatorship a decade ago. … Wrong. Assad has run the same iron-fisted Alawite police state as did his father,"" Hafez Assad.

We will not judge the wisdom of what Clinton said, but rather analyze whether Ryan correctly characterized what she did say.

Ryan did get the timing right. Though the conflict would eventually get much bloodier, Syrian guns had already killed several people in Deraa by the time Clinton made her comment. In fact, the show opened with a report from Tripoli covering the spread of the Arab spring, with the reporter saying that Syria’s government acknowledged that 12 people were killed, more than 200 wounded as protests and demonstrations spread across that country.""

As for invoking ""Russian-provided guns,"" it certainly sounds plausible. Russia is Syria’s biggest supplier of weaponry, and Russia’s arms trade with Syria totaled about $1.5 billion, making Damascus Moscow’s seventh-largest client, according to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

Where Ryan may have gone too far was in saying that the administration ""called Bashar Assad a reformer."" While Clinton did use the word, she said, ""Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he’s a reformer.""

So, Clinton didn’t exactly say that she, or the administration, was labeling Assad a reformer. Rather, she was referring to what other people -- namely ""lawmakers"" --""believe.""

Our ruling

Ryan said the Obama administration ""called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.""

That’s not quite what Clinton said; instead, she was describing what she understood lawmakers’ views to be. Still, as a secretary of state speaking on national television, her decision to discuss such beliefs without knocking them down suggests that she lends them at least some credibility. On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE508C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-obama-administration-called-bashar-/

NEA says Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism
","
Members of the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, teach all kinds of students. Some have autism, a disorder of brain development, and special education teachers are trained to deal with their social behavior and communication issues.

Daria Denoia, a teacher in Columbus, Ohio, is one such teacher. She was featured in a recent commercial sponsored by the NEA Fund for Children and Public Education sponsored by the NEA Fund for Children and Public Education, a  political action committee, as part of the union’s campaign against Josh Mandel’s election to the U.S. Senate. Mandel, a Republican, is Ohio’s treasurer but hopes to replace Democrat Sherrod Brown in the Senate.

It is no surprise that the NEA takes sides in political races, especially considering recent tensions between public employees and state officials over collective bargaining rights. But something that the teacher said in the anti-Mandel commercial stood out -- a new and measurable charge in a race in which many other other issues are litigated over and over.

Denoia said, ""I read that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism.""  

This was actually the second claim in the teachers union ad. The first was that ""I heard that Josh Mandel wants to allow insurance companies to deny medical coverage for pre-existing medical conditions.""

Mandel unquestionably supports repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which says that starting in 2014 insurers may not deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Mandel says other portions of the act, including fines on employers who do not provide health coverage, could harm the economy.

Since issuing a statement in June saying the law should be fully repealed, Mandel has said in interviews that he would support keeping some provisions, including the one on pre-existing conditions. Exactly how that would work is not known.

Covering people with high health care expenses could drive up insurance costs, insurers say, unless nearly every American, healthy or sick, is required to have insurance and spread the financial risk. That very mandate is the cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. There could be other ways to block denial, including expanding state-based high-risk pools (which have their own cost issues) or passing reforms in less-divisive existing laws, conservative groups say.

Could they work, or is this all just a political sop, as Democrats suggest? That is speculative. The NEA has made a claim based on what Mandel says he opposes but not on Mandel’s later statement of intent. He opposes the current law but says he could support something else to take care of pre-existing conditions. Since the form of that ""something else"" is not yet set and we cannot measure intent on a true-false spectrum, we cannot rate this claim by the NEA.

But what about the claim that Mandel voted to deny autism coverage?

Mandel has, in fact, voted on autism coverage. He was in the Ohio General Assembly at the time.

A 2009 state bill would have mandated that health insurers cover autism. The bill, backed by autism-care groups, passed the Ohio House but never got out of the Ohio Senate. Mandel, in the House, was among the minority voting no.

According to news coverage, opponents said they worried the mandate would drive up premiums, which small employers could not afford. This was also the view of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which lobbied against the bill.

Yet the bill contained controls against excessive costs. According to the bill language and a related analysis we read from the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, the legislation stipulated that any company could opt out of the coverage requirement if it could show this mandate drove up its insurance costs by 1 percent or more.  

Mandel’s campaign communications director, Travis Considine, acknowledged Mandel’s ""no"" vote. But he pointed us to an amendment that Mandel supported before voting against the final bill. Intended to help control costs, the amendment would have required an attending psychologist or physician to develop a treatment plan for each autism patient using insurance, and to limit mandatory autism coverage to $36,000 a year, according to the bill language and a legislative summary. The amendment also would allow insurers to request reviews of treatment every six months.

The amendment passed unanimously and its requirements were included in the final bill. That final bill had 57 ""yes"" votes and 39 votes of no, including Mandel’s, before moving the state Senate, where it died. The support group Autism Speaks says it expects a new version to emerge in Columbus soon.

Considine also told us that in a separate matter, Mandel voted for state legislation providing money for a special education scholarship program. Special education students sometimes transfer out of their local schools and attend alternative programs to get the individualized attention their parents want for them. The scholarships are similar to vouchers, reducing parents’ costs, and have been popular among families with autistic children.

This may help show that Mandel is not heartless. But it does not change the accuracy of the NEA claim that Mandel ""voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism."" The point of the commercial, in fact, comes in Denoia’s final line: ""Ohio needs a senator who will stand up to the insurance companies...""

Two points are worth mentioning.

First, the NEA couched its claim with the teacher saying, ""I read that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism."" (Italics added for emphasis.) Some ad campaigns use similar words to get a little wiggle room if their accuracy is challenged. Hey, the teacher is only saying what she read. But in this case, no couching was necessary. The teacher’s reading comprehension was good.

Second, as a point of semantics, Mandel did not actually vote to deny autism coverage; it was already denied by many insurers. But he voted against requiring coverage, which has the same effect as voting to allow insurers to deny it.

That’s additional information that provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the NEA’s claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD25C40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/national-education-association/nea-says-josh-mandel-voted-let-insurance-companies/

Paul Ryan said Obama was in NYC same day as Bibi but dissed him
","
President Barack Obama couldn’t manage to squeeze in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while they were in New York on the same day, but Obama did find time to go on a TV talk show, charged vice presidential candidate U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during a debate on Oct. 11.

Here is what Ryan said:

""Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see? They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. They're spinning the centrifuges faster.

""They see us saying when we come into the administration, when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and he, instead of meeting with him, goes on a daily talk show.""

Ryan was referring to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York that occurred the last week of September; both Obama and Netanyahu attended. But were Obama and Netanyahu at the U.N. meeting the same day, and did Obama ditch the prime minister for a TV talk show instead?

 Scheduling problems

First, some background on the much talked about a meeting that didn’t happen between the two leaders.

The controversy over the allegedly missed meeting started Sept. 11, 2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the White House declined Israel’s request for a meeting during the U.N. conference.

""An official in Jerusalem said that the Prime Minister's Office sent the White House a message stating that although Netanyahu will spend only two and a half days on U.S. soil, he is interested in meeting Obama and is willing to travel to the U.S. capital specifically for that purpose. The official added that the White House rejected the request and said that at this time Obama's schedule does not allow for a meeting.""

We fact-checked a claim by a Romney campaign surrogate, South Florida congressional candidate Adam Hasner, that ""President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York."" We ruled that claim Mostly True.

We found several news stories -- based on anonymous sources -- that said Netanyahu’s team asked for a meeting between the two leaders and was rejected.

The White House responded on the record that the leaders couldn’t meet due to scheduling conflicts. The controversy led the two men to speak by telephone for an hour the night of Sept. 11.

Let’s look at when the two leaders were in New York during the week of Sept. 24. Obama was in the city on Monday and Tuesday. He taped the interview with The View on Monday and addressed the U.N. on Tuesday 
Wednesday was the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Netanyahu planned to be in New York on Thursday and Friday.

When Netanyahu spoke to the U.N. on Thursday, Sept. 27, he asked the U.N. to draw ""a clear red line"" to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 
The New York Times wrote: ""In a theatrical gesture, Netanyahu held up a cartoon-like drawing of a spherical bomb and drew a red line below the fuse, ""before Iran completes the second stage of nuclear enrichment to make a bomb,"" he said.

Netanyahu met with Hillary Clinton on Thursday. On Friday, he spoke with both Obama and Romney by telephone, the Jerusalem Post reported. Netanyahu left New York on Saturday.

The Los Angeles Times reported that ""the absence of face time with world leaders was glaring. Obama held 13 meetings with leaders at last year’s meeting, according to CBS Radio’s Mark Knoller, the unofficial White House stat keeper."" The article stated that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was slated to handle the one-on-one diplomacy including a meeting with Netanyahu.

The View

Obama and first lady Michelle Obama taped an appearance on ABC’s The View at studios in Manhattan on the afternoon of Monday, Sept. 24, and it aired Sept. 25, according to a pool press report that day. Much of the interview was light-hearted -- some questions about the Obamas’ marriage, a mention of one of his daughters playing tennis.

They discussed that they would celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary on Oct. 3, the night of the first debate and held hands during most of the taping, according to the pool report.

But Obama also touched on serious topics including his campaign, the economy and Libya.

Obama’s critics attacked him for going on the show. Fox News’ headline on commentary by a Republican strategist was: ""Obama picks ‘The View’ over foreign policy.""

""As world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, President Obama and the first lady gathered with the women of the daytime talk show,’The View,’ sadly choosing show business over the business of foreign relations. Leadership is about priorities, what does this say about the priorities of our president?"" stated the column by Alice Stewart, a Romney and Republican National Committee surrogate. 
To be clear, though, Netanyahu was not in New York on Monday, the day Obama taped The View. News reports indicate he left Israel on Wednesday, after Yom Kippur.

Our ruling

During the debate Ryan said that Obama was in New York City the same day as Netanyahu and ""instead of meeting with him, goes on a daily talk show.""

The two leaders were not there on the same day: Obama was there Monday and Tuesday, and Netanyahu was there later in the week, on Thursday and Friday. Obama taped The View on Monday.

Ryan says stimulus dollars paid for electric cars in Finland and windmills from China
","
In the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan and Joe Biden argued whether the stimulus was worth the hundreds of billions of dollars that it cost the government.

Ryan said, ""Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus. The vice president was in charge of overseeing this. Ninety billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups.""

Biden responded with, ""It was a good idea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to stop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able to grow again.""

They argued about whether the stimulus money was wasted, and Ryan said ""Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland, or on windmills in China?""

Republicans have made these charges before. In this fact-check, we look at whether the stimulus money went where Ryan said it did.

The Fisker electric car

In 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive, won a total of $528 million in loan guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic. The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on it is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open.

The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far.

Not stimulus dollars

The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects.

First, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating.

That money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it’s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.

The only reference to this loan program in the stimulus is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses.

The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.

Fisker Automotive says that the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to insure that all federal dollars are spent in the United States.

Windmills in China

Windmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging.  The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for this claim. Among the reports and articles the campaign cites, one refers to a massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University.

The Investigative Reporting Workshop’s report backs the claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldn’t say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. ""Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe,"" he wrote.

A challenging money trail

Federal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $7.6 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes.

To choose an example, let’s look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the world’s third largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, ""The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China.""

We called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But ""that might not be exactly right,"" said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis . ""Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms.""

If it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese ""windmills,"" then they account for less than 1 percent of the total.

Our ruling

Paul Ryan said stimulus dollars were spent on electric cars in Finland and windmills in China.

In fact, the program that provided loan guarantees for the Fisker cars was not part of the stimulus -- and the money went toward engineering and design in the United States.

As for the windmills in China, it's true that a small number of windmills and components to build them came from China. But the statement greatly exaggerates China’s role in the overall use of stimulus money.

On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA44B80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/ryan-says-stimulus-dollars-paid-electric-cars-finl/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden: Romney called ending the Iraq war 'tragic'
","
The vice presidential debate started off with questions about the Obama administration’s handling of the lethal attacks on the Libyan consulate in September 2012.

Vice President Joe Biden sought to portray the commander-in-chief as ever-mindful of threats to the country as he answered questions from moderator Martha Raddatz.

""When you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That's caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day.

""On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 -- he ended it. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.""

Did Romney really say ending the Iraq war was ""tragic"" and that the U.S. should have left behind 30,000 troops?

First, some background. Ending the war in Iraq was a big campaign promise for Obama. In October 2011 he announced all troops would be pulled from Iraq by the end of the year.

By the end of 2011, his administration could not reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on the size of a residual force. Negotiations on that fell apart, according to a Reuters report, ""over a Pentagon demand that Iraq provide U.S. troops with immunity against prosecution in Iraq for any crimes committed there. Iraq's government was unwilling to meet that demand, and its political elite were divided over a post-2011 U.S. military presence.""

Some troops remained in the country. In the days leading up to the withdrawal date, about 200 U.S. troops remained and operated within the American Embassy ""to coordinate military relations between Washington and Baghdad, particularly arms sales,"" the New York Times reported.

So what was Romney’s take? He addressed Obama’s actions during a roundtable discussion with veterans at a South Carolina barbecue restaurant on Veterans Day in 2011. A colonel asked Romney how he would handle soldiers returning to the country in need of jobs, according to a transcript of the event.

Romney called Obama’s troop removal ""an enormous mistake,"" ""a failing,"" ""precipitous"" and -- here’s the buzz word -- ""tragic.""

His complete response: ""Yeah. A couple of things. One, you probably know that it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and a failing by the Obama administration. Secretary Panetta and others had indicated they were working to put in place a Status of Forces Agreement to maintain our presence there, so that we could most effectively transition to the Iraqi military and Iraqi security forces providing security for their country. 
""The precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate. It's more than unfortunate. I think it's tragic. It puts at risk many of the victories that were hard-won by the men and women who have served there. I hope the risk is not realized. I hope instead that the Iraqis are able to pick up the baton, and despite the fact that we will have walked away on a too-rapid basis."" 
This wasn’t the first time Romney’s campaign reacted to Obama’s withdrawal plan. He expressed his disapproval in a biting statement a few weeks earlier, keying in on the lack of an ""orderly transition.""

On the night of the vice presidential debate, the Romney campaign website still faults the Obama administration for not reaching a Status of Force Agreement, or SOFA, and emphasizes continued unrest there.

""Despite the clear need for a SOFA and desire on both sides to conclude an agreement, President Obama fumbled the negotiation. It was a display of stunning diplomatic incompetence. The day after the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of last year, Iraq’s Prime Minister took worrying actions to consolidate power. He leveled terrorism charges against the Sunni Vice President, causing the Vice President to flee the capital and sparking a political crisis that continues to this day. Iraq still faces worrying insurgent attacks.""

In a December 2011 interview with Reuters, Romney criticized Obama's ""failure to secure an agreement and maintain 10,000 to 30,000 troops in Iraq.""

Our ruling

While talking about how Obama kept his promise to end the Iraq war, Biden said, ""Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there.""

It’s true that Romney characterized Obama’s 2011 deadline with the word ""tragic."" Romney did not say ending the war was tragic; he was talking about the speed at which Obama removed all troops. Romney’s preference was to leave a large residual force, and he has used an estimate of up to 30,000 in the past, as Biden said during the debate. We rate Biden’s claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF2EC80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/joe-biden/biden-romney-called-ending-iraq-war-tragic/

Ryan: Obama promised unemployment would not exceed 8 percent
","
Seated a few feet apart in their lone debate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan and Vice President Joe Biden jousted over how to boost the economy.

Ryan sought to brand President Barack Obama’s recession remedies as a failure and said the president had broken his promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent.

""They passed the stimulus. The idea that we could borrow $831 billion, spend it on all of these special interest groups, and that it would work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8 percent -- it went up above 8 percent for 43 months. They said that, right now, if we just passed this stimulus, the economy would grow at 4 percent. It's growing at 1.3.

The claim that Obama said unemployment would not exceed 8 percent is one we’ve heard before. A super PAC ad took it even further, saying Obama promised unemployment topping out at 5.6 percent.

But we've found these claims contain only a grain of truth.

Projection vs. promise
       
The source for Ryan’s statement -- and others like it -- is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser.
           
Their report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. It also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.
           
The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers.
           
""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""
           
There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart stating: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.""

Republicans have also cited a speech from then President-Elect Obama about the stimulus.

But Obama’s speech also presents the report’s findings as ""projections,"" and later says that a stimulus plan would ""likely"" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, ""we’ll create"" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure.
   
Here’s how he sets it up:

""I asked my nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, and the Vice President-Elect's Chief Economic Adviser, Dr. Jared Bernstein, to conduct a rigorous analysis of this plan and come up with projections of how many jobs it will create — and what kind of jobs they will be. Today, I am releasing a report of their findings so that the American people can see exactly what this plan will mean for their families, their communities, and our economy. The report confirms that our plan will likely save or create three to four million jobs.""
   
As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and has decreased very slowly. In September, it fell to 7.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   
Our ruling
   
Ryan said the Obama administration promised ""unemployment would never get to 8 percent.""
   
Obama didn’t say that. Rather, his Council of Economic Advisers predicted that the stimulus would hold it to that level. Their report included heavy disclaimers that the projections had ""significant margins of error"" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""
   
The sub-8 percent prediction did not hold true, but it’s still incorrect to characterize it as a promise or guarantee.
   
We rate Ryan’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC4E880>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/ryan-obama-promised-unemployment-would-not-exceed-/

The Pants on Fire claim that Donald Trump has as much blood on his hands as Hitler, Stalin, Mao
","Does President Donald Trump rank alongside the 20th century’s bloodiest dictators? A prominent psychiatrist said so during an interview on CNN. Allen James Frances, the chairman emeritus of Duke University’s department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, appeared on CNN’s ""Reliable Sources,"" a program hosted by Brian Stelter that analyzes the news media.  Frances – who played a key role in the publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the reference work that defines recognized psychiatric conditions – was brought on the show to discuss how the media should cover those who question Trump’s mental fitness for office. Frances warned against ""medicalizing politics,"" but he expressed concern about Trump: ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were. He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person."" After some Twitter users attacked Frances for comparing Trump to Adolf Hitler of Germany, Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong of China – and criticized Stelter for allowing Frances’ comment to go unchallenged – Stelter took responsibility, citing technical difficulties that had distracted him during Frances’ comment. Frances also elaborated on Twitter, saying he was referring to the future death toll from climate change, hastened by Trump’s policies: ""Terrible damage Trump is doing to world climate at this global warming tipping point may be irreversable/could kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades. Many of them our children & grandchildren & their children. This is an existential crisis for humanity."" We decided to take a closer look at Frances’ original comment. In interviews with PolitiFact, historians of the 20th century and experts on climate change both agreed that Frances made an extraordinarily flawed comparison to put Trump in the company of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. ""Much as I abhor Trump’s climate policies, calling him Hitler seems inappropriate to me,"" said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor of earth system science. ""Trump’s climate and environmental policies are destructive. Calling him Hitler, though, is a distraction. It helps him marginalize criticism."" ""Frances’s statement is shockingly stupid and uninformed for someone with a respectable and responsible position,"" said Benjamin Hett, a historian at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and author of ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic."" Frances did not respond to inquiries for this article. A spokesman for Duke said that Frances is retired from the university and has no current responsibilities.  The death toll for each of the three 20th century dictators is subject to some disagreement and  margin of error, but authoritative accountings suggest that each was responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million or more. Yale University historian Timothy Snyder estimated in 2011 that Hitler caused between 11 million and 12 million deaths of noncombatants, and that Stalin caused a similar number if you include deaths from disease and famine.  Meanwhile, one calculation by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum estimated more than 17 million deaths caused by Hitler. Combat deaths from World War II, would push the number higher still. (Since Hitler and Stalin faced off in World War II, there’s a risk of double-counting in such calculations.) Mao, for his part, may have exceeded them both. Ian Johnson, the author of ""The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao,"" estimated in 2018 that Mao was responsible for perhaps 42.5 million deaths, of which the largest number came from a preventable famine stemming from his Great Leap Forward policy. A 2014 World Health Organization analysis found that ""climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050,"" from such varied causes as heat exposure to the elderly, diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition. Using the 250,000-a-year figure, it would take about 40 years of Trump-related deaths from climate change to meet the low end of the Hitler and Stalin death counts. To reach Mao’s death toll of 42.5 million, it would take 170 years.  In early 2019, Andy Haines and Kristie Ebi, environmental and health specialists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the WHO calculation ""a conservative estimate"" in a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine. But even if the WHO estimate is low, it’s clear that you’d have to stick Trump with the blame for many decades worth of global deaths from climate change to compete with Hitler, Stalin or Mao. Even experts who decry Trump’s climate policies note that any future deaths will not be solely attributable to him.  The process has been underway long before Trump entered the Oval Office. In addition, countless other factors – from corporate policies to individuals’ own actions – have brought us to where we are today.  ""When Trump took office, we were already committed to the ocean and atmospheric warming that we are seeing now, the basically irreversible acceleration in polar ice melt we are seeing now, the accelerating melt of permafrost and its effects we are seeing now, and the accelerating sea level rise we are seeing now,"" said Harold R. Wanless, a professor of geography and regional studies at the University of Miami. Given this, Wanless said, the blame should be shared with all preceding administrations and congresses since about 1979, ""when it became apparent that climate change was happening, was starting to produce these changes, was basically irreversible, and would be made worse and worse as we added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.""  Wanless termed Frances’ comparison ""naïve, irresponsible, and purely political."" Peter Fritzsche, a University of Illinois historian, told PolitiFact that ""it seems silly to find a single embodiment to the problem of climate change,"" he said. ""Trump is a poster boy of ignorance, but the problem is much much larger, more serious, more difficult."" Fritzsche suggested a different comparison – presidents such as Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan whose inaction made the Civil War inevitable. ""I would compare Trump to the weak presidents of the 1850s who completely failed to see -- purposefully -- the conflict between North and South, the expansion of slavery in the West, and the issue of fugitive slaves,"" he said. Frances said, ""Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century. He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were."" Not only does Frances’ comparison exaggerate the predicted climate change death toll compared to that of the dictators, he also lays the blame for potential future deaths at Trump’s feet alone, which even experts critical of Trump consider wrongheaded.

The Trump administration is using DNA tests to crack down on “fake families” at the border
","Fearing that children were being smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border, the Trump administration has sought to detect instances where adult migrants fraudulently present unrelated children as their own.  So earlier this year, the administration rolled out a pilot program to DNA test some groups apprehended at the border who purported to be family units, as a way to determine if they are in fact related. According to the acting director of the office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, nearly a third of suspicious cases were found to reveal fraudulent families. ""You've undoubtedly heard about the pilot programs with the Border Patrol where they're doing DNA testing,"" Cuccinelli told at the Texas Public Policy Foundation Aug. 22, 2019. ""They're identifying fake families. In the areas where those are being implemented, it's something like 30% are fake families."" While the DNA testing program uncovered cases of migrant groups lying about being families, the federal data we found showed the rate of fraudulent families was lower than Cuccinelli’s figure.  The pilot DNA testing program Cuccinelli referred to was carried out earlier this year by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Officials said the rapid DNA tests, administered through cheek swabs, were done on a voluntary basis. Results take about 90 minutes to produce. Before rapid DNA testing, officials relied on more traditional investigative means to suss out fraudulent families, like screening documents for counterfeits. Using such methods, agents detected more than 1,000 instances of fraudulent families attempting to cross the Southern Border from October 2018 through April of this year, according to the Washington Post.  During a three-day pilot operation from May 8-10, DNA testing revealed a portion of the groups caught crossing the border illegally had lied about being related. But the rate was not as high as 30%, as Cuccinelli said. According to an ICE statement in June, agents tested 84 family units who ""presented indicia of fraud."" Of those, 16 groups claiming to be a family were identified as fraudulent. That’s a rate of 19%. The June ICE statement also said the agency would extend the pilot program by 120 days, and expand it to five additional border locations beginning later that month. However, we found no data showing the results of the extended pilot program.  Homeland Security did not respond or provide data when asked. The office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — under Cuccinelli’s charge — did not respond to our request, either.  It’s not entirely clear where Cuccinelli’s 30% figure comes from.  The Associated Press reported on May 1 that ""ICE officials said they have identified 101 possible instances of fraudulent families since April 18 and determined one-third were fraudulent."" But that report was published prior to the rollout of the DNA pilot program that began May 8. About a week after phase one of the pilot program ended in May, the Washington Examiner on May 18 reported the 30% figure, citing an anonymous ""official involved in the system's temporary rollout.""  ""Approximately 30% of rapid DNA tests of immigrant adults who were suspected of arriving at the southern border with children who weren't theirs revealed the adults were not related to the children, an official involved in the system's temporary rollout who asked to be anonymous in order to speak freely told the Washington Examiner,"" the newspaper’s May 18 report stated. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also cited the 30% figure during a July 14 appearance on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures. ""Thirty percent of the people with small children are fake families,"" he told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo.  Graham’s office indicated the senator had not been describing the results of the DNA pilot program. Rather, he was referring to data about fake families that was collected prior to the DNA testing. Cuccinelli said a federal pilot program to DNA test illegal immigrants showed ""something like 30% (of test subjects) are fake families."" It’s not entirely clear where Cuccinelli’s 30% figure comes from.  The Associated Press reported that in the latter half of April, border officials identified around 100 possible cases of fraudulent families, and found that one third were fraudulent. But these findings were based on traditional investigative methods like document screening, and happened before the DNA testing program went into effect.   An article in the Washington Examiner published on May 18 — about a week after phase one of the DNA pilot program ended — reported the 30% statistic, citing an unnamed immigration official.  But in June, the ICE released data that showed around 20% of suspicious cases turned up DNA evidence that disproved a family relationship.

Post comparing mass shooting deaths to homicides by undocumented immigrants way off
","A viral post circulating on Facebook claims that, in 2018, tens of thousands more people died at the hands of undocumented immigrants than those killed in mass shootings. The Aug. 15 post has been shared over 7,000 times and says:  ""Number of people killed in mass shootings in 2018 = 194 … Number of people killed by illegal immigrants in 2018 = 83,211."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This very specific, unsourced post is inaccurate, for several reasons. First, there is no universally accepted definition of a mass shooting.  The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, are shot and/or killed in the same location, at roughly the same time.  Based on that definition, the organization reported that 372 people were killed from 338 mass shootings that occurred in the country in 2018. That’s almost twice as many as the claim states. If you go by the crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project, which goes by the looser mass shooting definition of four or more people shot in one incident, including the shooter, 2018’s count goes up to 528 deaths from 426 mass shootings. Or take Mother Jones’ findings, which uses the government’s more conservative mass shooting designation: A single attack in a public place in which three or more victims are killed. This definition dramatically lowers the numbers, eliminating all shootings in which victims are only injured. Based on the stricter classification, Mother Jones reported there were 12 mass shootings in the U.S. in 2018 that took the lives of 80 people.  Regardless of how you look at it, the first half of the post is off – it’s either too high, or far too low.  So what about the part that claims 83,211 people were killed by undocumented immigrants in 2018? That’s also inaccurate. First, there isn't a national database tracking how many people are killed by immigrants who are in the country illegally. But even without that data, it’s clear that this figure is wildly out of the ballpark of what could be considered a reasonable estimate. In 2017, the estimated number of total murders in the United States was 17,284, a 0.7% decrease from the 2016 estimate, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. And according to the agency’s preliminary 2018 report, there appears to be an overall decrease in violent crime in the country: ""Preliminary figures indicate that law enforcement agencies throughout the nation showed an overall decrease of 4.3 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention for the first 6 months of 2018 when compared with figures reported for the same time in 2017."" The final 2018 crime statistics report hasn’t been released yet, so it is unlikely the post is based on anything credible. But even without having those numbers available, we know that the U.S. experiences an average of roughly 17,000 murders each year, and that includes those committed by legal citizens. It is therefore impossible that immigrants alone would have been responsible for the murders of more than 83,000 people in 2018. Moreover, according to the Cato Institute, which describes itself as a ""public policy research organization – a think tank – dedicated to the principles of individual liberty, limited government, free markets and peace,"" immigrants have a lower criminal incarceration rate than native-born Americans: ""All immigrants have a lower criminal incarceration rate and there are lower crime rates in the neighborhoods where they live, according to the near-unanimous findings of the peer-reviewed evidence.  Since 1911, large nationwide federal immigration commissions have asked whether immigrants are more crime-prone than native-born Americans and each one of them answered no, even when the rest of their reports unjustifiably blamed immigrants for virtually every problem in the United States.  From the 1911 Immigration Commission, also known as the Dillingham Commission, to the 1931 Wickersham Commission, and 1994’s Barbara Jordan Commission, each has reported that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans."" The organization also looked at Texas, the only state that tracks crimes committed by immigration status, in a 2018 study and found that, in 2015, ""the criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born Americans. Moreover, the conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans. This result holds for most crimes."" A viral Facebook post claims that 194 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018, while 83,211 were killed by undocumented immigrants. The post appears to be entirely fabricated – neither part of the claim checks out.  Estimates for mass shooting fatalities in 2018 range from 80 to 528, depending on the reporting organization and how they each define a ""mass shooting."" But no estimates come close to the 194 figure. As well, according to the FBI, roughly 17,000 murders occur in the U.S. each year, so 83,211 people being killed by specifically undocumented immigrants in one year is improbable. We rate this post False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB64440>],/factchecks/2019/aug/26/facebook-posts/post-comparing-mass-shooting-deaths-homicides-undo/

The power bank, AFP reported, is made of lithium battery packs that can provide electricity for an electric vehicle for about 12 kilometers (or about 7.5 miles). AFP found that the packs can charge from any energy source in OAMTC’s shops, and according to the World Bank, 76% of Austria’s electricity output came from renewable sources in 2015. And though the Facebook post says the van is gasoline-powered and towing a diesel generator (the lithium battery pack), it is actually the van that is diesel-powered, according to OAMTC officials.

Former Wisconsin rep. misses mark on redistricting claim
","Skewed maps orchestrated by Wisconsin Republicans after the 2010 Census drew numerous legal challenges but survived to give the GOP a stranglehold on the state Legislature. With the 2020 Census looming, redistricting is again a hot topic, particularly for the Democrats who garnered more statewide votes but claimed just over one-third of the Assembly seats last fall. Opponents of gerrymandering proposed in July 2019 to have the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau draw the maps without giving an advantage to either party. Republican leaders who control the state Legislature have said the bill is going nowhere. But that proposal prompted a Twitter exchange that caught our eye. Former state Rep. Adam Jarchow, R-Balsam Lake, retweeted coverage of the proposal July 16, 2019, calling it ""non-sense"" and insisting elected officials should draw maps. When another user asked if he felt gerrymandering is an issue, the two-term lawmaker responded: ""My answer is the same as it’s been for 250 years in this country. Elected officials draw maps. That’s it. If people don’t like how they drew them, kick them out of office."" Hmm. Are elected officials really the only people who draw district maps in the U.S.? Or are there other ways to do it? Given the attention on this issue will only grow in the coming year, we decided to check it out. Wisconsin is currently a classic example of gerrymandering, or manipulating legislative boundaries for partisan gain.  Amid one legal challenge to the maps, a federal court said the Wisconsin maps drawn in 2011 were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. We rated Mostly True a 2017 claim that Wisconsin was the most or second-most gerrymandered state in the country.   After the 2010 Census, Republicans — who controlled all of state government — drew lines that created an out-sized number of GOP districts in a state that is otherwise pretty evenly divided between Democrat and Republican voters. The November 2018 election laid the disproportionate boundaries bare.    Across the 99 elections for the state Assembly, Democrats garnered 53% of the votes, compared to 45% for Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. But that overall advantage yielded only 36 Democratic seats in the Assembly, compared to 63 for Republicans. That’s because the GOP-imposed boundaries clustered Democratic voters together while Republicans wound up with smaller but hard-to-overcome majorities in other districts. The Democratic winners averaged 90% of the vote in Fall 2018, while Republican winners averaged 63%. Meanwhile, a Marquette University Law School poll earlier this year found 72% of Wisconsinites support having a nonpartisan commission draw the maps — including a majority of both parties. Wisconsin’s approach redistricting is the most common nationally, but it is far from the only option. As of December 2018, state legislatures were responsible for drawing state district maps in 30 states, often subject to a veto by the governor. (Wisconsin is among those granting the governor veto power, which means the state Legislature may need a more cooperative approach than the all-GOP process that yielded the current maps.) Four of those states have a backup commission, however, that draws the maps if the Legislature deadlocks or the governor issues a veto.  But that number is shrinking. Redistricting reforms have put maps in the hands of a commission of some kind in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio and Utah since 2010, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.  New Hampshire passed a bill to move to an independent commission, but it was vetoed Aug. 9, 2019, by the Republican governor. All told, 20 states now use some type of commission or nonpartisan agency to draft of state legislative maps. The commissions are often nominated by leaders of both parties. Some states give them final say, others make the commission’s maps subject to approval by the Legislature or governor. Eleven states currently give the Legislature no direct role in drawing or approving the state legislative boundaries, according to the Brennan Center. That number will grow to 13 in 2021 when new laws in Ohio and Michigan take effect.  The breakdown is similar for how congressional districts are drawn, aside from the seven states that have only one district. Jarchow did not reply to requests for evidence of his claim. An attorney in Polk County in northwestern Wisconsin, Jarchow left the state legislature in January 2019 after losing a special election for a state Senate seat and serving two terms in the Assembly. Jarchow concluded his claim with an oft-heard response to political criticism, that voters who don’t like it can elect for new lawmakers. But that’s exceptionally difficult in a gerrymandered state. ""Even in wave election years you don’t see that much change,"" said Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel at Brennan. ""The whole point of gerrymandering is to make sure seats don’t flip, and we have proof from around the country that this works if you draw districts right."" In 2018, only 28% of the congressional districts that flipped to another party nationwide were from states where maps were drawn by legislatures — even though the majority of states use that system. Jarchow, a Republican, said amid a redistricting discussion that ""elected officials draw maps. That’s it."" That’s simply not true. State legislatures still draw the majority of maps around the country. But a growing number of states have turned to an independent or bipartisan commission of some kind to establish legislative boundaries. Eleven states currently give the Legislature no direct involvement in drawing or approving maps. We rate Jarchow’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC81F340>],/factchecks/2019/aug/23/adam-jarchow/former-wisconsin-rep-misses-mark-redistricting-cla/

No, Obama didn’t make it legal for media outlets to ‘purposely lie’ to the American public
","Did President Barack Obama make it ""legal"" for media outlets to purposely lie to the American public?  That’s what one Facebook post claims. The full post reads: ""Thanks to Obama, it is perfectly legal for the media to purposely lie to the American people. He quietly signed into law HR 4310 in 2012, allowing propaganda to be used on the citizens of the USA by its own government, essentially repealing the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, banning the use of domestic propaganda."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, Obama didn’t make it legal for propaganda to run amok in U.S. newsrooms and be presented as fact in broadcasts and reports to the American public. But a bill passed as part of H.R. 4310 — the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 — instead reversed restrictions on news programs funded by the U.S. government. Let’s break this down. First, Obama didn’t ""quietly"" sign H.R. 4310, also known as the National Defense Authorization Act, into law as the meme suggests. He issued a statement about its passing and about some provisions he didn’t agree with, though he didn’t list the Smith-Mundt modernization bill as part of his objections.  So what did the legislation actually do? H.R. 4310, otherwise known as the National Defense Authorization Act, authorized Pentagon funding through fiscal year 2013.  As part of H.R. 4310, the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 also passed and removed restrictions on programming produced by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the U.S. government’s broadcasting arm.  Some of these programs include Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks.  Many have criticized the programs and dubbed the content propaganda, while the organizations say they adhere to strict journalistic standards and aim to educate populations that come from parts of the world where freedom of speech is suppressed.  For example, Voice of America says it broadcasts ""accurate, balanced and comprehensive reporting, programming, online and social media content for a global audience, particularly to those who are denied access to open and free media,"" and it defines the legally mandated standards in the VOA journalistic code. ""An essential guarantee of the journalistic credibility of Voice of America content is the ‘firewall’ enshrined in the 1994 U.S. International Broadcasting Act,"" the website says. ""The firewall prohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news, thereby safeguarding the ability of our journalists to develop content that reflects the highest professional standards of journalism, free of political interference."" Before the act was passed, the programs could only be viewed or listened to at broadcast quality in foreign countries. The bill removed restrictions on domestic distribution.  A contemporaneous report by Foreign Policy, a news organization that covers global affairs, detailed what the bill did, along with why government officials say it was passed:  ""A former U.S. government source with knowledge of the BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) says the organization is no Pravda, but it does advance U.S. interests in more subtle ways. In Somalia, for instance, VOA serves as counterprogramming to outlets peddling anti-American or jihadist sentiment. ‘Somalis have three options for news,’ the source said, ‘word of mouth, al-Shabab, or VOA Somalia.’ This partially explains the push to allow BBG broadcasts on local radio stations in the United States. The agency wants to reach diaspora communities, such as St. Paul, Minnesota’s significant Somali expat community. ‘Those people can get al-Shabab, they can get Russia Today, but they couldn’t get access to their taxpayer-funded news sources like VOA Somalia,’ the source said. ‘It was silly.’ Lynne added that the reform has a transparency benefit as well. ‘Now Americans will be able to know more about what they are paying for with their tax dollars — greater transparency is a win-win for all involved,’ she said.."" That doesn’t change the fact that the programs can be considered propaganda, but contrary to the Facebook post’s claim, the legislation did not repeal any law that prohibited independent and traditional media outlets in the private sector from publishing false information. It removed limitations on U.S.-funded and generated content from being aired in the country.  For context, it’s important to note that post might sound like Obama changed libel laws in the country. But that’s not true, either. Libel laws vary state by state, and there isn't a federal libel law. A Facebook post claims Obama made it legal for the media to ""purposely lie to the American people"" when he signed H.R. 4310 into law in 2012, ""allowing propaganda to be used on the citizens of the USA by its own government, essentially repealing the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, banning the use of domestic propaganda."" Obama did sign H.R. 4310 into law, also passing the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. But the bill did not make it legal for independent, private-sector media outlets to present outright false information to the public. Instead, it allowed government-sponsored news like Voice of American to be broadcast in the United States. It removed restrictions on U.S.-generated news from being presented to American audiences.   The claim is not accurate. We rate it False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACC86C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/23/facebook-posts/no-obama-didnt-make-it-legal-media-outlets-purpose/
"['Health Care', 'North Carolina', 'Dan McCready']","
McCready tells half the story about Bishop's health bill
","A North Carolina Democrat is accusing his Republican opponent of supporting health-care policies that don’t offer protection for people with pre-existing conditions. That Democrat is Dan McCready, who’s running for Congress in NC’s 9th district against state Sen. Dan Bishop of Mecklenburg County. The district is Republican-leaning, but the race is considered close leading up to the Sept. 10 election. McCready recently put health care coverage at the forefront of his campaign, highlighting legislation Bishop sponsored as an example of how the Republican would fail to protect North Carolinians. ""Sen. Dan Bishop doubles down on removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,"" McCready tweeted on Aug. 8, adding ""Under (Bishop’s) sham ‘association health plans,’ insurance companies don’t have to pay for medications for pre-existing conditions."" What is McCready talking about? His tweet provided a link to a Winston-Salem Journal story about the Small Business Health Care Act, also known as Senate Bill 86. The bill was recently passed by the legislature and sent to Gov. Roy Cooper for approval. We looked into the details of the bill and found McCready has a point about insurers being able to offer skimpy coverage as part of the proposed new health plans, but his claim about ""removing coverage"" for people is an exaggeration. What are association health plans? At the federal level, Bishop has stated that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which protects people with pre-existing conditions. Bishop has said he wants to replace it with something better. At the state level, Bishop sponsored SB 86. The bill aims to provide coverage for small businesses, trade associations and other groups of professionals who are in the same industry or line of work through what’s called an ""association health plan."" President Donald Trump in 2017 signed an executive order expanding the availability of these plans as a way of providing an alternative option who can’t afford ACA plans. People who work for associations and other small businesses sometimes can’t offer their employees insurance because they struggle to find plans that are affordable. This bill would enable insurers to offer coverage plans to these groups that might be cheaper than ACA plans because they’re not required to provide as much coverage. Bishop’s bill explicitly states that association health plans would be subject to the ACA’s ""group health plan"" requirements, which means insurers ""cannot deny individuals coverage if they have preexisting conditions, cannot impose annual and lifetime limits on certain benefits, and must provide free access to certain preventative services."" But that doesn’t mean that people with pre-existing conditions would be guaranteed coverage for services they need. ‘Essential benefits’ There’s more than one way to deny coverage to people, said Valerie Lewis, an associate professor of health policy and management at UNC’s Gillings School of Global Public Health. Allowing insurers to discriminate at the time of enrollment is just one way, she said. ""The other way is to allow anyone to join or purchase the plan, but to have the plan provide a very limited set of benefits,"" she said in an email. That’s what health policy experts say could happen under Bishop’s bill. While the ACA requires plans to cover 10 ""essential benefits"" — from prescription drugs and rehabilitative services to chronic disease management — association plans are subject to looser standards and aren’t required to cover those essential benefits, she said. ""As a simple example, you could allow people who have cancer to buy into the plan, but the plan might cover (pay for) zero cancer care — in effect removing coverage for the preexisting condition despite nominally allowing the person to purchase the insurance plan,"" Lewis said. The Winston-Salem Journal story points out that Bishop’s bill ""does not include guarantees of the essential benefits. An amendment to add the essential benefits to SB86 was tabled by a 28-20 vote in the Senate,"" with Bishop voting to table it. Under the version the legislature sent to the governor, ""employers could still choose between AHPs with somewhat more limited coverage and normal group insurance that has full coverage,"" said Mark Hall, Director of Health Law and Policy at Wake Forest University’s School of Law. ""So no group would be denied the option of full coverage,"" Hall said, emphasizing the word ""option."" But, people within a group could, and probably would, end up with less coverage for some of their pre-existing conditions."" Other potential problems After a year of insuring a group or association, an insurer could ""identify people whose claims are high"" and write the following year’s coverage plan to exclude their needs, said David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy. Indeed, an association plan ""can be shaped so that it doesn’t attract people with certain conditions,"" said Kevin Lucia, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms for Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. But it’s also possible insurers craft plans in order to attract people, Hughes Waren, a leader of the NC Association of Health Underwriters, told North Carolina Health News. If the associations include high-income workers, he said the associations may be incentivized to seek plans with decent benefits. ""I would have no reason to think that anybody is doing these to offer skinny plans. It’s really to provide a benefit to their members,"" Waren told NC Health News. ""They’re going to create competitive plans that are attractive."" There’s one more factor to consider. If healthy people leave their ACA plan for an association health plan, people with ACA plans could face higher premiums the following years because there won’t be as many people to share the cost burden. Customers with pre-existing conditions are likely to be the most affected. Our ruling McCready said Bishop supported ""removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions."" That wording could give the impression that this bill directly and immediately strips health care coverage from people with pre-existing conditions. That’s not the case. But experts point out that insurers aren’t required to offer association health plans with a full range of services for people with pre-existing conditions. The proliferation of association health plans could also affect people with pre-existing conditions on ACA plans. McCready’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate his claim Half True.

Ivanka Trump mostly accurate that disposable income has risen by $5,205
","To combat worries about a recession, the Trump team has turned to economic stats to paint a picture of a strong economy.  ""Since the passage of Tax Cuts, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205,"" Ivanka Trump tweeted on Aug. 20. Fact: Thanks to pro-growth policies of this Administration, Americans are earning more. Since the passage of Tax Cuts, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205 and the lowest wage earners have seen the fastest nominal wage growth (8.9%)! Vice President Mike Pence had tweeted something similar a day earlier. For most Americans, $5,000 more in their pocket should be noticeable. So is the talking point accurate? Federal data does back up the number -- but you can be forgiven if you’re wondering where your extra $5,000 is. The figure being touted by the White House is an average, and your take may be much, much lower than that. The earliest source of this figure comes from a July 31 tweet from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers. It said, ""Thanks in part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and other pro-growth policies of @realDonaldTrump's Administration, Americans are earning more. Since the passage of the #TCJA in December 2017, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205 as of June 2019!"" Thanks in part to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and other pro-growth policies of @realDonaldTrump's Administration, Americans are earning more. Since the passage of the #TCJA in December 2017, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205 as of June 2019! We made several inquiries to the White House to confirm the methodology the Council of Economic Advisers used, but they did not respond. So we looked at publicly available data from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.  On a per-capita basis, inflation-adjusted disposable personal income rose from $43,414 to $45,473 between the 4th quarter of 2017 (the last quarter before the tax cuts) and the 2nd quarter of 2019 (the most recent quarter for which data is available). That’s a difference of $2,059. However, Ivanka Trump’s tweet, talked about ""per household"" personal income, while the data on the BEA website calculates it per person. We were able to adjust this calculation by multiplying the figure by 2.5, which is the approximate number of people in the average household. That produces a final dollar increase of $5,148, which is close to what Ivanka Trump tweeted. Mathematically, then, the figure is basically accurate. However, it would be wrong to assume that a typical American is $5,000 richer today. Here’s why. It’s an average. The increase of $5,000 is a national average, rather than a median, so there will be a wide variation in gains on a household-by-household basis. Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless offered an analogy featuring Microsoft founder Bill Gates. ""If Bill Gates walks into a room containing 99 destitute people, the average wealth of the people in the room will rise from $0 to $1 billion, even though the median wealth in the room remains unchanged at zero,"" he said. In the case of the White House’s number, the large benefits accruing to a modest number of top earners boosts the size of the pie that produced $5,000 figure for disposable income gains. Not everyone should expect to have seen their income go up by that much. It’s partly driven by lower tax bills. It’s worth remembering that at least some portion of the increase in disposable income comes from the tax cuts themselves, rather than from the economic growth they have spurred.  ""Gains in disposable real income are positive news,"" Burtless said. ""The news would be even more positive if we knew the improvement also reflects faster gains in the pre-tax real incomes of middle- and lower-income families. That’s because the tax cuts for those families are supposed to gradually fall to zero."" Income has been on the rise, starting under Obama. The performance under Trump does exceed the improvement seen under the final seven quarters of Barack Obama’s presidency – $1,082 under Obama compared with the $5,148 under Trump. But again, it’s worth noting that Obama was not cutting taxes significantly during his final year and a half in office, while Trump was cutting them in the period Ivanka Trump noted. The following chart suggests that the trend line for inflation-adjusted, per-capita disposable personal income has been on a fairly consistent upward path since early 2013, or about four years before Obama left office. Ivanka Trump said, ""Since the passage of Tax Cuts, real disposable personal income per household has increased $5,205."" Mathematically, the number is accurate, but it’s worth noting some context she left out. The $5,205 figure is an average, so it is likely skewed by large gains among wealthier Americans. In addition, this statistic has been rising pretty consistently since early 2013, when Obama was in office, even during periods where it was not boosted by a large tax cut. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBD2C00>],/factchecks/2019/aug/22/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-mostly-accurate-disposable-income-has/

Do one in four young black men ‘end up in the criminal justice system?’
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has a new ally in his race for president: Cardi B. In an interview with the Bronx, N.Y., rapper posted Aug. 15, the senator answered questions provided by Cardi’s nearly 50 million Instagram followers. Around one and a half minutes into the video, Cardi asked Sanders about police brutality. ""We constantly see on social media police brutality against black men and against minorities,"" she said. ""What are we going to do to change that? Because that is discouraging our people. We constantly see our men getting killed every day, and it seems like nobody cares, nobody’s sympathizing, nobody’s talking about it."" Sanders said, ""We have something like one out of four young black men in this country end up in the criminal justice system. They may end up in jail, they may end up on parole, they may end up on probation."" We hadn’t heard a one-in-four statistic exactly how Sanders said it, so we decided to check it out. A Sanders campaign spokesperson sent us three sources: one Gallup poll from 2013, a 2003 report from the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and a 2018 report from the Sentencing Project, an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform. • None of those sources directly back up his claim, though they do speak to disparities in the treatment African Americans receive in the criminal justice system.  • Our own research found that federal crime statistics don’t often include breakdowns by sex, age and race for adults. That makes it hard to tell how many ""young black men"" end up in the criminal justice system. • Also complicating things is the imprecision of the phrase ""young black men."" It could refer to juveniles, or reasonably to men younger than 25, or 35. By talking about how one-in-four young black men end up in the system, did he mean while they were young — or their likelihood down the road? The phrase ""end up in the criminal justice system"" is vague, said Candace McCoy, a professor in the Graduate Center's Department of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York. The best support for Sanders' claim is a 2003 report from the Justice Department — the second source the Sanders campaign sent us.  The report estimated that black men born in 2001 had a 32.2% chance of going to prison during their lifetime, based on incarceration rates at the time. The likelihood was 11.3% for men overall. That figure applied to black men of all ages, so we looked closer at the report for age-specific data.  It estimated that about 681,000 black men aged 18-34 in 2001 had been incarcerated in state and federal prison during their lifetimes. Census data show there were about 4.3 million black men in that age group as of 2000, which would put the imprisonment rate at about 15.7%. The one-in-three imprisonment stat is about 16 years old. But since 2003, imprisonment rates of black men have declined, lending more credence to what Sanders laid out, said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project.  ""While there have been no updated analyses of how this affects the ‘one in three’ figure, it seems that ‘one in four’ is a reasonable, and conservative, estimate of the current situation,"" Mauer said. Another way of reading Sanders' claim is to focus on how often black youth currently interact with the criminal justice system. We found that federal crime statistics for black juveniles put offense rates lower than what Sanders suggested. According to a dataset maintained by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, there were an estimated 212,000 juvenile delinquency offenses, including probation, among black youth (mostly commonly defined as anyone 17 or younger) in 2017.  U.S. Census data show that there were an estimated 5.25 million black men 17 or younger in 2017. That would put the offense rate for juvenile black men at around 8.7%. Keep in mind, that doesn’t take into account the proportion of juveniles who end up in the criminal justice system — just the number of cases.  There is other data that speaks to overrepresentation of the black population in the criminal justice system, though not exactly to what Sanders said. Sanders’ campaign spokesperson pointed us to a Gallup poll about black men under the age of 35. It found that about 24% of black men say the police have treated them unfairly in the past 30 days. That doesn’t prove Sanders’ claim, so we set out to find crime rate numbers for black men under 35. But just like with juvenile data, there aren’t many federal statistics that count crime rates for black men in that age group, which makes it hard to confirm or deny Sanders’ statement. We wanted to take a look at the three areas mentioned by Sanders during his interview with Cardi: jail inmates, probation and parole. We included prison inmates, too, since the Justice Department has age-specific data for them. Prison inmates: Of 456,300 black men in state and federal prisons in 2017, about 44.4% were between the ages of 18 and 34. Jail inmates: There were approximately 250,100 African Americans in local jails. There was no further breakdown by age or sex. Probation and parole: Of the 3.67 million adults on probation at the end of 2016, about 28% were black. Of the 874,777 adults on parole, that proportion of black adults was higher at 38%. There was no further breakdown by age or sex. Sanders said ""one out of four young black men in this country end up in the criminal justice system."" We found that the senator’s specific claim is not directly supported by federal crime statistics, however you read it. That said, it might be a reasonable estimate based on incarceration trends and older research on crime rates among black men. Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC756800>],/factchecks/2019/aug/22/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-told-cardi-b-one-four-young-black-m/

Donald Trump incorrect that U.S. dollar is strongest it's ever been
","  Is the U.S. dollar stronger against other currencies than it’s ever been? President Donald Trump said so — at least four times in one day. First, Trump tweeted on Aug. 21, 2019, that the United States has the ""Strongest Dollar in History."" So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!..... A few hours later, Trump told reporters at the White House, ""Yesterday we had the strongest dollar in the history of our country."" He then repeated the assertion two more times. (The remarks start around 31:10 in this video.) Trump wasn’t entirely cheerleading, as he acknowledged in his comments — he noted that having a strong dollar also has drawbacks.  A strong dollar can benefit Americans traveling overseas, because their dollars will go further in the local currency. The downside, however, is that U.S. exports cost more overseas. This harms U.S. business output, and it can exacerbate the U.S. trade imbalance. We wondered whether Trump was right that the U.S. dollar recently set a new historical high against foreign currencies. It hasn’t.  Currency traders work at a foreign exchange dealing room in Seoul, South Korea. (AP) The most common way to track the overall strength of the dollar is the U.S. Dollar Index, a statistic that has been calculated for decades. It’s based on a weighted average of U.S. exchange rates with six currencies: primarily the Euro, but also the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. According to that index, the dollar was stronger as recently as many of the days between December 2016 to March 2017, and it was stronger still between late 1999 and early 2003. The dollar was at its peak historical strength during portions of the early to mid 1980s. Trump didn’t specify any one foreign currency for his comparison, but a spot check of some of the big ones shows that Trump isn’t correct here, either. According to calculations by Markets Insider, the dollar is nowhere near the historical highs for one-on-one comparisons to the euro, yen or yuan. On Aug. 20, the Euro could buy 1.11 dollars — but the Euro could often buy less than that between 2015 and 2017, and the record low of 0.64 dollars came in 1985. (That was compared with the European Currency Unit, or ECU, the predecessor to the Euro.) Meanwhile, on Aug. 20, one dollar could buy 106 yen. But the dollar has been stronger for long stretches since 2014 and for much of the time between 1998 and 2008. And the dollar could buy a record 358.44 yen back in January 1971. Finally, on Aug. 20, a dollar could buy 7.06 Chinese yuan. The dollar was stronger between at least 2000 and 2008. ""The president’s claim is fully unwarranted and clearly not factual,"" said Torben Andersen, director of the international business and markets program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. ""The U.S. dollar is strong, but nowhere as strong as in the mid 1980s."" The strength of the dollar, Andersen added, ""is a natural outgrowth of better economic growth and higher interest rates in the U.S. than most other western developed economies."" Trump said, ""Yesterday we had the strongest dollar in the history of our country."" That’s not the case — the overall dollar index and one-to-one comparisons with the Euro, the yen and the yuan have all been stronger for the United States for long stretches of time in recent years. We rate the statement False. Clarification, Aug. 23: This article has been updated to clarify that the strongest dollar exchange rate in history against the Euro was actually against the predecessor currency to the Euro, the ECU.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACC07C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-incorrect-us-dollar-strongest-its-eve/

Federal law’s ‘boyfriend loophole’ is not so simple
","After the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is running for president, called for eliminating the ""boyfriend loophole."" The loophole, she said on MSNBC, ""means that right now if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can’t get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can, which is outrageous."" Klobuchar has a point, but she oversimplifies the situation. Federal law bars anyone convicted of any felony from possessing a firearm.  But the gun prohibition, as cited to us by Klobuchar’s campaign, also is imposed on people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence.  That provision applies to anyone who has or had a domestic relationship with the victim, said University of Wyoming law professor George Mocsary, co-author of a law school textbook on gun laws. So, despite Klobuchar’s claim, the provision applies to more than just current or former spouses. It applies if the perpetrator in the domestic abuse has a child in common with the victim; lives or lived with the victim; or is ""similarly situated to a spouse."" As for the ""similarly situated"" language, some courts have said live-in boyfriends would be covered by the law, said Jacob Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke University. And a regulation promulgated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives makes it clear that live-in partners are covered, Mocsary said. Klobuchar’s claim of a loophole is accurate to the extent that the law does not apply to a boyfriend who is or was simply dating the victim, but not sharing a residence or children.  But Mocsary said there is a difference in risk when there is a gun in a domestic situation versus someone who owns a gun but doesn’t live with their girlfriend. ""Everyone agrees that a firearm in a household with domestic violence poses a clear increased danger to the abused partner,"" he told PolitiFact. But there is no reliable evidence ""that there is a similar increased danger"" in non-cohabitation situations, he said. Klobuchar’s claim was made in the context of federal law. But it’s worth noting that 23 states have laws that prohibit at least some abusive dating partners from gaining access to firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.  That includes 19 states that bar people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from possessing a gun. Among them are California, Texas, Illinois and New York. Klobuchar said the ""boyfriend loophole"" means that ""if you commit a serious crime of domestic abuse against your wife, you can't get a gun, but if you do it against your girlfriend, you can."" The gun prohibition, which is in federal law, does not apply to boyfriends who are, or were, in mere dating or more casual relationships.  But it does apply to boyfriends who have a child in common with the domestic violence victim; live or lived with the victim; or who are ""similarly situated to a spouse."" Also, 19 states have similar laws on misdemeanor domestic violence cases. Klobuchar’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACC1F40>],/factchecks/2019/aug/22/amy-klobuchar/boyfriend-loophole-some-convicted-domestic-violenc/

62% of U.S. gun deaths are suicides
","Del. Jason Miyares, R-Virginia Beach, has offered a compromise red-flag bill that would take firearms away from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others. While the gun-control debate has largely focused on stopping mass shootings, Miyares says the biggest value of his bill could be that it would stop some people from shooting themselves. ""On average, 65% of all gun deaths in America are from suicides,"" he said during an August 14 interview on The John Frederick Show, a conservative radio broadcast. ""...This is one step we could do, in my opinion, to prevent people from harming themselves. ""It’s not just about some of the mass carnage."" We fact-checked his claim that suicides account for 65 percent of gun deaths in the U.S. The latest information comes from an annual report issued in June 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study is called, ""Deaths, Final Data for 2017."" According to the data, there were 38,882 deaths by firearms in 2017, and 23,854 were suicides. That comes to 61.4% - a little lower than Miyares’ figure. In addition to suicides, the statistics showed 14,542 of the gun deaths (37.4%)  were murders, and 486 were accidental (1.2%). Because Miyares began his statement saying ""on average,"" we computed 10 years of statistics - from 2008 through 2017. There were 335,746 gun deaths, and 208,287 were suicides. That’s a 62% average - again, a little lower than Miyares figure.  Over 10 years, the CDC reported 335,746 gun deaths, and 208,287 were suicides. That’s 62%. We asked Miyares for the source of his 65% claim, and he sent us a magazine article that ran in The Atlantic on Dec. 21, 2018. The article, referring to CDC data, said, ""suicides account for 60 percent of the country’s gun deaths."" During the span from 2008 to 2017, slightly more than half of suicides were committed with firearms, according to CDC data. The number of yearly suicides increased by 36 percent - from 18,223 to 23,8545. Annual suicides by guns increased 30 percent, from 18,223 to 23,854. Red-flag laws  A number of Virginia legislators - most of them Democrats - have called for a red-flag law, predicting it would reduce gun violence. At least 15 states have enacted such measures.   In Virginia, Democrats offered a bill this winter that would have allowed law-enforcement officials to ask a judge to declare a person a ""substantial risk"" to himself or others and order police to seize his guns for up 14 days. Sometime within that period, the person would have been entitled to a hearing to refute charges. If the judge found the charges credible, he could have ordered the guns held for renewable 180-day periods. Republicans controlling a House subcommittee defeated the bill on a 4-2 vote. Gun enthusiasts complained the measure allowed guns to be taken without due process. Miyares says his bill addresses that concern. It would require a person to be evaluated by a mental health expert and appear before a judge, with a chance to defend himself, before his firearms could be taken away for renewable 14-day periods. The General Assembly is expected to consider the measure in November. Our ruling Miyares, in promoting his red-flag bill, said, ""On average, 65% of gun deaths in America are from suicides."" His figure slightly overstates a sad situation. CDC data shows that 62% of gun deaths from 2008 to 2017 were suicides. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC59F40>],/factchecks/2019/aug/21/jason-miyares/62-us-gun-deaths-are-suicides/

No, America’s auto industry not expected to lose ‘as many as 300,000’ jobs, as Kamala Harris claimed
","Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris recently attacked President Donald Trump over his trade policy, saying it is hurting American workers.  The California senator then said as many as ""300,000 auto workers"" were expected to lose their jobs this year, suggesting Trump was to blame.  ""Donald Trump betrayed a lot of people. He came in office, making all kinds of promises to working people, from farmers to auto workers,"" Harris said in a CNN interview on Aug. 12. ""He said he was going to help working people, and it is estimated that as many as 300,000 auto workers may be out of a job before the end of the year.""  Trump’s trade policy, especially the tariffs he’s placed on China, have been blamed by economists for hurting farmers. But are ""as many as 300,000 auto workers"" really expected to lose their jobs by the end of this year as Harris claimed?  Two recent fact-checks called that figure into question. We’ll review the facts and place a rating on the senator’s claim.   Checking the facts After the interview, Harris’ campaign told CNN the 300,000 number is from a February study by the Center For Automotive Research, CAR.  The research group examined the impact of a 25 percent tariff Trump proposed on all imported cars and auto parts except on Canada, Mexico and South Korea. It estimated that between about 70,000 jobs and 367,000 jobs would be lost across all sectors of the U.S. economy, but not specifically among autoworkers, under a ""worst-case scenario."" In May, Trump delayed for six months his decision on whether to impose the tariffs.  Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor & economics at the research center, or CAR, told FactCheck.org in an email: ""300,000 auto workers out of a job before the end of the year is NOT what CAR is projecting."" FactCheck.org added that Dziczek confirmed the figure was an estimate for ""job loss across the economy"" one year after several proposed and implemented trade policies on the auto industry went into effect.  Auto workers produce vehicles at Volkswagen's U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. in 2017. (AP Photo/Erik Schelzig) The CAR report did not specify how many of the up to 367,000 job losses would come from the auto industry. Dziczek told CNN ""the (auto) sector is starting to shrink,"" but she added that a rapid loss of 300,000 autoworker jobs ""would be orders of magnitude worse than what we're expecting to see."" The only industry specific estimate was for 77,000 job losses at car dealerships. Dziczek told PolitiFact California there would ""an overall net loss"" in auto assembly and parts sectors.  ""How big of a loss depends on how willing consumers would be to switch brand preference from imports to vehicles made in the United States,"" she wrote in an email.  FactCheck.org described Harris’ claim as ""wrong,"" while CNN said it was ""false.""  Harris’ campaign did not respond to our request for comment, including whether the senator has corrected, or plans to correct, her statement.  Our ruling  Sen. Kamala Harris claimed that ""as many as 300,000 auto workers"" may lose their jobs by the end of this year.  She relied on a study that predicted, in a worst-case scenario, that between 70,000 jobs and 367,000 jobs could be lost across all sectors of the U.S. economy, but in no way all from the auto industry. The losses would take place one year after President Trump imposes a proposed 25 percent tariff on imported cars and auto parts.  Trump has delayed his decision on those tariffs until later this year, meaning the one-year later impact would not be felt until well into 2020, and not by the end of this year as Harris said.   Harris’ claim far overestimates potential job losses for the auto industry, the timing of them and ignores the fact that no decision has been made on the tariffs.  We rated her claim False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.
