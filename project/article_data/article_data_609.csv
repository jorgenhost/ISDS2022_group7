Iowa’s jobs numbers for now but will be recalculated
","State Senate Minority Leader Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, marked the end of the 2022 Iowa legislative session last month reviewing a few items Democrats liked about the Republican-led Legislature’s efforts, but especially the long list of things Democrats disliked.  Lamenting laws like the one cutting the amount of time Iowans are eligible for state unemployment benefits and forcing unemployed people to accept lower paying jobs after a specific period of time while drawing unemployment, he wrote this in an end-of-session newsletter: ""There are fewer Iowans working today than when Gov. Reynolds took office, even as the U.S. has added more than 10 million new jobs."" Iowa’s most recent numbers support Wahl’s claim about fewer workers, by the thin margin of about 200 workers that could fall within a margin of error. Current preliminary Iowa Workforce Development data show that 1,646,800 Iowans had jobs in April, the most recent month for which data existed when he made the comment. That compares with 1,647,000 working in May 2017, when Reynolds became governor.  When eligible, non-working Iowans are added to the mix, the 1,697,700 people in the labor force in April amounted to 1,900 fewer than the 1,699,600 in the labor force in May 2017, the data show. Iowa’s April unemployment rate was 3%, near the 3.1% in May 2017.  But the survey operates with a margin of error. The unemployment rate at a 90% level of confidencefor April is between 2.5% to 3.5%, for example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Updated numbers that include May are scheduled to be released June 16, 2022.  How close the April data are to the most accurate reflection of actual jobs in the state won’t be known for a while. Jobs data – which come from a nationwide U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employment, hours worked, and earnings – are recalculated in the following month when more data are known. They are recalculated again at the end of a year when the state’s unemployment insurance data and other factors are figured into the jobs count, the bureau says in its frequently asked questions summary.  Moreover, data for the previous five years are recalculated when more factors are known, the bureau states. Updated data are released each March. Reynolds became governor in 2017 to finish a term by Terry Branstad, who was appointed the U.S. ambassador to China by former President Donald Trump. She was elected in 2018 and faces re-election this year, thus Wahls’ jab at the governor, who touts a pro-business record that includes getting a fixed state income tax for individuals and businesses, international trade efforts, and less business regulation. Wahls’ and other Democrats’ goal is to show Reynolds’ performance in a negative light but several other factors go into growing jobs. They include trends affecting a state’s large industries, such as inflation and buyers’ habits; business owner preferences on where to locate; competition at the interstate level and globally; available transportation; and economic pressures such as those provided by recessions.  Starting in March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic also played a role in the number of jobs as businesses closed and workers were laid off. For example, non-farm employment in Iowa was down in April by an estimated 1.1% – or 18,000 workers – since March 2020, state jobs numbers show.  Mike Maciag, a former staff writer for Governing magazine, wrote for the publication in 2017 that several factors affect jobs creation more than what governors do. Five years later, he hasn’t changed his mind, he wrote to PolitiFact Iowa in an email. ""Governors certainly play a role in job creation, but their influence on a state’s overall net change in jobs is relatively minimal in the short term,"" Maciag, now an analyst with the Pew Charitable Trusts, wrote. ""Most of what drives job growth or losses, particularly business cycles, is far beyond their control. If their policies do spur job growth, much of the gains generally won’t be realized until after they leave office. ""One area where governors can have a more immediate effect is the public sector. This might include allocating additional funding for state employee staff or pay, along with budget increases for schools and other units of government relying on state support."" The National Governors Association, consisting of both Republican and Democrat governors, issued a report in 2019 that said governors can better connect workers to good jobs in their states by bringing schools and businesses together, increasing learning opportunities for mid-career workers, and spending money on digital and workforce development efforts in rural areas. Different kinds of data exist to show what is happening in the jobs market. The state’s labor pool data show how many people in Iowa work or are available for work. Another measure, for seasonally adjusted non-farm employment, shows how many jobs exist in the state.  Non-farm employment comes from regular surveys of how many jobs Iowa employers have filled in the state, regardless of where the workers live. For example, a worker along Iowa’s border with another state – the Mississippi River in the Quad Cities, for example – could live in Illinois and show up in non-farm job data in Iowa but not data showing how many Iowans have jobs. Iowa Workforce Development data show that 1,565,700 non-farm jobs existed in Iowa in April 2022, down 4,000 from 1,569,700 workers holding non-farm jobs in the state in May 2017, although up from 1,529,400 in April 2021. While Iowa has been adding jobs in that 12-month period starting in April 2021, its 2.4% growth rate during that time for non-farm employment ranked 43rd among the 50 U.S. states, the Arizona State University’s Seidman Research Institute reports. The institute is a consulting enterprise at the university’s W.P. Carey School of Business that Wahls cited when PolitiFact Iowa asked him to back his claim about jobs creation. A new national jobs report was issued June 3. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that non-farm employment grew nationally by 390,000 people in May 2022. The Iowa numbers are to be reported later in June. Iowa’s top Democrat in the state Senate says fewer Iowans have jobs now than when the Republican governor took office in May 2017. The numbers back this up, at least until they can be verified better. Additionally, Wahl’s point about a slow jobs creation rate for Iowa gets an assist from rankings that show the state 43rd for jobs growth among the 50 U.S. states in April this year.  But numbers based on survey estimates that will be adjusted when more data are known leave open possibilities that the 200-jobs margin reflected now could change, downward but also upward. That uncertainty, combined with current reports showing slow jobs creation when compared with other states, leads us to rate the statement about Iowa losing jobs during Reynolds’ time in office to be Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2022/jun/09/zach-wahls/iowas-jobs-numbers-now-will-be-recalculated/

Chap Petersen does Full Flop on Commanders Stadium
","The General Assembly’s zest for luring the Washington Commanders to Northern Virginia is losing its zing.  In February, there was broad bipartisan backing for a bill that would help the football team finance construction of a $3-billion stadium, retail and entertainment complex. The measure would allow a state authority to sell $1 billion in bonds that the Commanders would later pay back.  Negotiators have since reduced the state subsidy to $300 million as Dan Snyder, the Commanders’ owner, has become entangled in allegations of sexual and financial improprieties. Snyder denies the charges. The project lost a key supporter on March 25 in state Sen. Chap Petersen (D-Fairfax). Days after his announcement, the General Assembly leaders indefinitely delayed a scheduled June 1 vote on the plan. We decided to gauge Petersen’s actions on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures a politician’s consistency on an issue. We do not contend politicians should never change their minds; we just lay out their reasons.   Petersen was a huge fan of the Commanders when they were called the Washington Redskins. He held season tickets for their games at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, for 22 years and was a founding member of ""Redskins Caucus,"" a group of tailgating legislators that defended the team’s old name against arguments that it was a racist term for native Americans.  Petersen voted for the $1-billion-bond bill during a Feb. 10 meeting of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee. He opposed an unsuccessful effort that would have made the loan contingent on the release of NFL investigations into Snyder’s conduct that the team and league have kept private. ""We need to focus on the business details, that’s the only thing that matters,"" he said.  Petersen voiced unspecific concern about the business deal. ""I think there’s a lot of details here that need to be vetted,"" he said.  Five days later, Petersen voted for the bill again on the Senate floor and it passed overwhelmingly. He later said he thought there would be time to work out particulars as the measure worked its way through the House and to the governor’s desk. Word leaked on May 23 that the Commanders had acquired the right to buy 200 acres in Prince William County to build a stadium. Even so, the team is reportedly still interested in sites in Washington and Maryland. Two days later, Petersen issued a scathing statement saying, ""I do not plan to support the project or Virginia's pursuit of this NFL franchise."" His main reason, he wrote, is ""I don't have confidence in the Washington Commanders as a viable NFL franchise."" During a May 26 radio interview with The Sports Junkies, Petersen said the Commanders are a different organization than the once-powerful Redskins, a team that filled stadiums and won championships from the early 1970s through 1992.  ""None of that exists anymore. You don't have the fanbase for starters … . You don't have the same identity; you don't have the same community buy-in,"" he said, referring to the team’s losing record in recent decades and its declining home-game attendance. ""I'm looking at it from a taxpayer perspective,"" Petersen said. ""If we, in any way, subsidize — even in a small way — a huge economic development and then the anchor tenant is not a stable entity, and either leaves or does something else, that's a problem."" He added, ""What happens if Dan Snyder builds a stadium or the team builds a stadium, and we build all the infrastructure around it, and five years later they're getting 20,000 people, [and] they're like 'we're out of here?' And then we're sitting there with an empty building on I-95.""   Petersen, in an interview with us, acknowledged that the team’s sagging popularity and changing brand have been issues for several years and didn’t stop him from voting for the bill twice in February. ""That’s a fair criticism,"" he said. What about his season tickets? Petersen said he dropped them in 2020 when the team dropped its former name. Despite reservations, Petersen voted twice in February to subsidize building a stadium for the Washington Commanders in Virginia. He announced in May that he opposes the project, questioning whether the troubled team is ""viable as an NFL franchise."" He acknowledged that his concerns about the team’s dwindling fanbase go back several years. That’s a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2022/jun/09/chap-petersen/chap-petersen-does-full-flop-commanders-stadium/

Rumors of race-based threats to Walmart stores in San Bernardino not credible, police say
","An Instagram post gave a stark warning to stay away from Walmart stores in California’s San Bernardino County, alleging that police there were warned that white supremacists were planning mass shootings. The post comes soon after two horrific mass shootings, one at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school, where 21 people, including 19 children, were killed, and another at the Tops Friendly Markets store in Buffalo, New York, where 10 Black people died in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack. But the threats are not credible, police in San Bernardino said, and there have been a number of similar threats nationwide in the past week. ""DO NOT GO TO WALMART,"" an Instagram post on June 4 began in all caps. It went on to say that San Bernardino County police received a tip that white supremacists have ""made it clear they are shooting up all Walmarts and will kill Blacks and Mexicans."" The post has garnered more than 6,600 likes as of June 8. Multiple posts making similar claims can be found on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post urged followers to share the news, then added ""don’t know if it’s true or not, but just a heads up."" There are no credible threats to Walmart stores in San Bernardino, police there told PolitiFact on June 6. Sgt. Equino Thomas, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino Police Department, said the department's intelligence unit had been monitoring reports of similar threats nationwide since last week, and found ""there was no legitimacy to it.""  ""This was not specific to San Bernardino or San Bernardino County,"" Thomas said. Mara Rodriguez, a spokesperson with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office, said the department’s intelligence team looked into this posting and found no credible threat. ""We continue to monitor any possible threats and work closely with other agencies to maintain the safety of the public,"" Rodriguez said. There have been several reported threats about possible shootings at Walmart around the country in recent weeks that were false, and at least one that led to an arrest, according to news reports. It’s not clear if the threats are widespread or connected in any way. The FBI, the Department of Justice and Walmart did not return our requests for comment. On May 26, fact-checkers at the Associated Press reported there were false claims on social media about two armed men who threatened to kill Black people at a Walmart in Bowie, Maryland, before they were stopped by undercover agents. The Bowie Police Department debunked the claims in a Twitter thread, and a Walmart spokesperson also told the AP they were false. Police in Springfield Township in northeast Ohio said in a Facebook post on June 2 that they were investigating a threat made about a random shooting at a Walmart there, but said ""we do not feel that the threat is credible."" In Wooster, Ohio, police said on June 2 they arrested a man they say made a threat on social media with ""what appeared to be a firearm."" They did not specify what the threat was, but said rumors that spread online of an active shooter at a Walmart store were false. Police in Lancaster, South Carolina, said on June 3 that someone called in a threat to a Walmart store there. Officers responded, but there was no incident. There is no suspect, and the case is under investigation, they said. Police in nearby Rock Hill also responded to a Walmart store there after reports that the suspect may be in that area, but there was also no incident. In Durant, Oklahoma, police said they arrested a man on June 2 after receiving a tip that he threatened to shoot up a Walmart there, according to KXII-12. In Amherst, New York, a Walmart store temporarily closed on May 16 — two days after the Buffalo attack — when an online threat was made to kill Black shoppers, according to the Buffalo News. A Sam’s Club and two Tops stores in the area were also threatened. No arrests have been announced by police in that case, though one man was arrested in separate shooting threats at a pizzeria and brewery. It’s not the first time Walmart stores have been the subject of threats after a mass shooting. In the days after an attack on Aug. 3, 2019, at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 23 people dead, CNN reported several threats were made at Walmart stores around the country. Copycat threats are not uncommon after such events. In Uvalde, more than a dozen school districts across Texas reported receiving threats after the Robb Elementary School attack, Axios reported. After a mass shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, there were more than 700 copycat threats at schools nationwide within a few weeks, according to the Educator’s School Safety Network.  ""In the aftermath of a school shooting tragedy, school shootings are front of mind for everyone, and people may be more inclined to report suspected threats of violence, thus increasing the number of threats,"" said James Densley, a professor and department chair in the School of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota. Densely said that Michigan’s online threat reporting system received more than 3,000 tips after a school shooting in Oxford left four students dead and seven others injured in 2021. Hundreds of school districts across the country also received threats. Many were not credible, Densely said, but schools were often closed as a precaution. Even if threats are eventually deemed not credible, law enforcement agencies must take them seriously. The Department of Homeland Security on June 7 issued a new terrorism threat bulletin, mentioning the racially motivated attack in Buffalo as an example of ""the dynamic and complex nature of the threat environment."" The department urged Americans to report threats of violence, including online threats, to local police. Social media posts warned shoppers to stay away from Walmart stores in San Bernardino because police there were warned of threats by white supremacists to kill Black and Mexican shoppers. But police officials in the city and county said there were no credible threats, and a spokesperson for the San Bernardino Police Department said they were monitoring reports of threats nationwide, not specific to the city or county.  Nationally, there have been a few cases of threats being made to Walmart stores, but most were not deemed credible.

U.S. Department of Agriculture did not predict the retail price of eggs this fall
","Social media users have yolk on their faces after making false claims about egg price predictions.  ""BREAKING NEWS: ‘USDA is predicting egg prices will be $12 a dozen by Fall 2022,’"" says one June 6 post on Facebook.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the U.S. Department of Agriculture did not make that prediction, according to Jennifer Smits, director of communications for the agency’s Economic Research Service.  The Economic Research Service — tasked with anticipating trends and emerging issues in agriculture and food in the U.S. — does not publish retail egg prices, Smits said. We also did not find any predicted retail egg prices in a review of recent USDA publications.  The USDA publishes forecasts of wholesale egg prices, as well as forecasts of changes to the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index for foods, Smits said. The May report about price indexes indicated that retail egg prices are expected to rise between 19.5% and 20.5% in 2022. Egg prices have also been increasing because of an ongoing outbreak of avian influenza, which has reduced the number of chickens laying eggs in the U.S., the price index report notes.  In April, the price of a dozen large Grade A eggs was $2.52, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from $1.93 in January. A 19.5% to 20.5% increase in the April retail price translates to $0.49 to $0.52, or between $3.01 and $3.04 for a carton — far below the claim of $12 per dozen eggs. A Facebook post says, ""BREAKING NEWS: ""USDA is predicting egg prices will be $12 a dozen by Fall 2022.""  USDA did not make that prediction, according to a spokeswoman. The agency does not publish retail egg prices. As of last month, egg prices were $2.52 per dozen, and the price is expected to increase between 19.5 and 20.5% in 2022. That is well below $12 per dozen eggs. We rate whether the USDA made such a prediction False.

Are public schools as segregated today as in 1960s?
","The United States is backtracking on integrating public schools, according to Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.).  ""Yesterday marks the 68th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s historic Brown v. Board of Education decision, which struck down the unlawful school segregation,"" Scott said during a May 18 meeting of the House Education & Labor Committee. ""Yet we know public schools are now as segregated by race and class as they were as they were in the 1960s."" Scott represents Virginia’s 3rd Congressional District, which spans from Norfolk north through Newport News and west through Isle of Wight County. He’s chairman of the education committee and made the claim about segregation in comments supporting a bill he proposed that would authorize $130 billion in federal grants and loans to high-poverty areas to improve school facilities. Have public schools resegregated to 1960 levels? A fact-check shows Scott is mostly right. It’s important to note that modern school segregation is not the same as the government-ordered social system that the Supreme Court struck down in 1954. Segregation today refers to the level of isolation of nonwhite students or, conversely, the level of exposure students of different races have to one another in school.  A problem with Scott’s claim is that it doesn’t hold true for the better part of the 1960s. Despite the Brown decision, Jim Crow laws remained in the South until the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1960, 0.1% of Black students in the South — 1 in 1,000 — attended a majority-white school, according to a study by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles. That increased to 14% in 1967.   Scott’s statement is on strong legs, however, if the measurement begins in 1968, when the U.S. Supreme Court — in a case involving New Kent County, Virginia — ruled that school district integration plans must meaningfully reduce segregation. ""School segregation is now more severe than in the late 1960s,"" says a 2020 UCLA report, the latest research we found.   In 1968, 77% of Black students across the nation attended majority non-white schools, the UCLA report said. That sank to 63% in the 1980s but rose to 81% in 2018, the latest year available.  A pair of 2020 studies found Central Virginia schools are becoming more segregated, too.  A key reason for the backslide is a 1991 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ended court-ordered desegregation, which often took the form of busing. The court ruled that school desegregation was a temporary remedy, not a permanent obligation. Another reason, according to UCLA researchers: ""The White birthrate has fallen below the reproduction levels of about a half century ago; consequently, the share of the White population and their school enrollment has sharply declined."" In 1970, 79% of public school students were white. That fell to 47% in 2018. ""This is not because of transfer to private schools, which have a declining share of total enrollment and have themselves become somewhat more diverse,"" the report stated. ""The white decline reflects historically low birth rates and immigration patterns that are overwhelmingly nonwhite."" Black students have comprised about 15% of public school students since 1970. But they are no longer the second largest population of students, as they were until the turn of the century. Latinos grew from 5% of the public school population in 1970 to 27% in 2018. Asian Americans have increased from 0.5% to 6% in that same span. School segregation is intrinsically tied to the racial gaps in housing and income. The end of court-ordered integration in 1991 led to the reemergence of color lines in school districts.  ""Whereas Black and Hispanic students are more likely to be concentrated in high-poverty schools, Asian students, like their white counterparts, are most frequently found in middle-class schools,"" researchers from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth wrote in a 2019 report. Another team of UCLA researchers found that in 2010, half of the public schools that were 90% or more Black and Hispanic also had a student population that was 90% or more from low-income households. At the time, a low-income student was defined as one who qualified for a free or reduced-price school lunch. Since then, changes to the federal lunch program have made it impossible to know how many students are impoverished. Scott said, ""Public schools are now as segregated by race and class as they were in the 1960s."" Scott’s claim doesn’t hold up for most of the 1960s, when Jim Crow still breathed and Southern states circumvented the Supreme Court’s 1954 order to integrate public schools. But he has a point, if we start in 1968, when 77% of Black students in the nation attended majority non-white schools. That dropped to 63% in the 1980s and then rose to 81% in 2019, the last year data is available. The ups and downs followed Supreme Court decisions that first toughened, then ended, integration mandates. The Civil Rights Project at UCLA, which has extensively studied school integration, wrote in 2020, ""School segregation is now more severe than in the late 1960s.""  So, we rate Scott’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2022/jun/08/bobby-scott/are-american-schools-more-segregated-today-1960s/

Recent U.S. smallpox vaccine order unrelated to monkeypox outbreaks, according to the government

That’s kind of crazy to me.""  Some commenters agreed, sharing unfounded claims that the recent outbreaks in countries where the virus isn’t typically found, including the United States, were orchestrated by the government.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In broad strokes, it’s generally accurate but misleading without some important context that could give readers a different impression.  The first monkeypox cases in the current outbreak were reported to the World Health Organization on May 13. Five days later, Bavarian Nordic, a vaccine company based in Denmark, announced that the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, better known as BARDA, had exercised options under an existing contract with the company to order $119 million worth of a freeze-dried version of a smallpox vaccine called Jynneos. (Freeze-dried doses have a longer shelf life, Forbes reported.) Bavarian Nordic has worked with the U.S. government since 2003 to develop, manufacture and supply smallpox vaccines, and to date, the company has supplied nearly 30 million doses of a liquid-frozen version of the vaccine to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to a press release. In 2017, BARDA awarded Bavarian Nordic a 10-year contract for a supply of freeze-dried vaccines. HHS didn’t respond to our questions about when the current contract was signed.   The two-dose vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2019 for adults at a high risk for smallpox and monkeypox. Both are poxvirus diseases. The vaccine is not available to the general public, but is available to people who are at high-risk for smallpox or monkeypox. BARDA is part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS. We asked HHS about the timing of the purchase, and a spokesperson for the agency told PolitiFact that it ""was part of standard and ongoing preparedness efforts and unrelated to specific events.""  ""For many years,"" the spokesperson said, ""BARDA has worked with industry to develop and purchase vaccines and treatments for a potential smallpox emergency, some of which may also be used to respond to monkeypox.""  The order, which converts existing vaccines the U.S. already purchased into freeze-dried doses, will be manufactured in 2023 and 2024, according to Bavarian Nordic.   BARDA also has the option to buy $180 million more worth of freeze-dried doses under the contract. If it exercises that option, Bavarian Nordic would ultimately convert up to a total of approximately 13 million freeze-dried doses that the company expects would be manufactured in 2024 and 2025. HHS did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s question about how many of those 13 million doses would be freeze-dried under this first purchase.   Our ruling The Facebook post says the United States ordered millions of smallpox vaccines amid a global monkeypox outbreak. That’s missing some important context.  The federal government moved to convert smallpox vaccines that it had already purchased under an existing contract into freeze-dried doses of the vaccine, which are more shelf-stable.  The contract predated recent monkeypox outbreaks, and the government says that it was part of standard emergency preparedness measures and was unrelated to the recent monkeypox cases. The Department of Health and Human Services has said some of the smallpox vaccines it purchased for a potential smallpox emergency could be used to respond to monkeypox.  We rate this post Half True. ",/factchecks/2022/jun/08/facebook-posts/recent-us-smallpox-vaccine-order-unrelated-monkeyp/

Russian has not been banned in Ukraine, despite repeated claims
","Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently doubled down on an inaccurate statement he’s made before: that Ukraine banned the Russian language.  During a press conference on June 6, Lavrov said Ukraine adopted ""laws banning the Russian language,"" claiming the Russian language was prohibited in ""education, the media, everyday contacts, etc."" Lavrov mentioned that if English had been banned in Ireland or French in Belgium, Europe would have responded differently.  But Lavrov is mischaracterizing a Ukrainian language law. It does not ban Russian from the country.  In April 2019, Ukraine’s parliament approved a language law making Ukrainian the mandatory language for public sector workers. The adoption of this law required citizens to know Ukrainian and obliged civil servants, soldiers, doctors and teachers to communicate in Ukrainian. Some exceptions were made under the law for some minority languages like English and other European Union languages. The Russian language does not fall under this category. In January 2022, a new provision of the law was introduced, under which print media outlets registered in Ukraine were required to publish in Ukrainian. This did not ban publications in other languages. Instead, the law required that all content also be published in Ukrainian.  Again, exceptions under the provision were made for certain languages like English and other official European Union languages, but not Russian. There have been concerns over whether the protections for minority languages under the law are sufficient. An advisory body of the Council of Europe, focusing on constitutional law, published a report in 2019 on the Ukrainian language law. It is the fourth Ukrainian language policy the commission has assessed over the years. In the report, the commission notes the need for Ukraine ""to adopt measures to promote the use of Ukrainian as the State language,"" because of its history. However, it also explains that the policy does not balance strengthening Ukrainian with implementing enough protections for minority languages in the country, like Russian. According to the Washington Post, about 50% of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian at home, and around 30% speak Russian primarily. Ukraine’s language law, which has been implemented in phases, establishes Ukrainian as the country’s sole state language. The law requires Ukrainian to be primarily used in business, school and media settings. However, it does not ban the use of Russian or other languages.

Biden wrong on claim about gun manufacturers and liability protections
","In the wake of the deadly elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, President Joe Biden repeated an inaccurate talking point in his push for gun control legislation, saying that gun manufacturers represent the ""only industry"" with liability immunity.  ""We should repeal the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons,"" Biden wrote in a June 2 tweet. ""They’re the only industry in the country that has this kind of immunity. It’s outrageous. It must end."" He said the same thing in a speech about gun violence (around the 18:28-minute mark).  This isn’t the first time Biden has made this claim. He’s made it repeatedly, including April 2021 remarks about gun violence after a man went on a shooting rampage at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight, and another gunman killed 10 people at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. He said it again in his 2022 State of the Union address. But the claim is inaccurate. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses. We reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back.  The legislation at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law in 2005 by President George W. Bush. The law says gun dealers and manufacturers cannot be sued when their products are misused.  But the law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It doesn’t protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued for certain injuries due to gun design defects. Supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive proceedings, while opponents argue that the broadness of the law and its narrow exceptions stops some victims from having their day in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is immune to all lawsuits. For example, in 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit brought by nine Sandy Hook victims’ families against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Company to continue. Remington Arms manufactured the gun used in the mass shooting and the plaintiffs sought to hold the company partly responsible by targeting its marketing practices. The families settled with the gunmaker in February for $73 million. Other industries have exemptions in liability. For example, a 1980s-era law states that vaccine manufacturers cannot be held liable in civil suits brought by victims of injuries that they saw were caused by defective vaccines. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. This money comes from the government, not the companies. It’s also important to note that, until 2024, pharmaceutical companies that make the COVID-19 vaccines will have liability immunity under a 2005 public health law. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law, previously told PolitiFact. For example, the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said that small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. ""It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack,"" Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law. Biden said that gun manufacturers represent the only industry in America that is exempt from being sued.  This isn’t accurate. The gun industry is not entirely exempt from being sued and is susceptible to some lawsuits. Further, there are federal laws that restrict liability for a variety of other business sectors.  We rate it False. ",/factchecks/2022/jun/08/joe-biden/biden-wrong-claim-about-gun-manufacturers-and-liab/

GOP gubernatorial candidate Michels changes course on Wisconsin Elections Commission
","An endorsement from former President Donald Trump has been a game-changer in some Republican primary contests – and multiple candidates for governor in Wisconsin angled for Trump’s blessing. In the end, it went to business owner Tim Michels, who was endorsed by Trump on June 2, 2022. Michels was a latecomer to the race, not joining until late April, and his nomination papers are being challenged by a Madison voter who, with support from state Democrats, took the matter to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.  There’s some irony to that. When he entered the race, Michels supported reforming the commission. Now he wants to abolish it. Republican lawmakers voted to create the commission in 2015 because they believed its predecessor, the Government Accountability Board, was biased against them. Now Republicans have largely turned against the commission because of policies approved during the 2020 presidential election – which, of course, Trump falsely claims he won in Wisconsin and elsewhere. Has Michels flip-flopped on whether to disband the elections commission? Let’s turn to our Flip-O-Meter.  A reminder here: We use our Flip-O-Meter to evaluate whether a politician has been consistent over time. The Flip-O-Meter does not examine if it is good policy or politics to make any change. A note here: The Wisconsin Elections Commission on June 10, 2022, rejected the bid by Democrats to keep Michels off the ballot.  In a May 12, 2022 news release titled  ""Michels First Blueprint: Restore Election Integrity On Day One,"" Michels outlined his plan to reform the WEC. ""In my business, we want to take a look at a problem and see what’s going on,"" Michels said in the news release. ""My plan is a fresh start, and allows us to bring in or bring back people who are ready to get to work to fix our elections, not make the problem worse.""  Among the provisions of Michels’ blueprint was a plan to ""dramatically reform WEC,"" including: Require all current commissioners and senior staff be terminated, and new appointments be made within 30 days.  Require all staff to then reapply to work for the newly constituted Board. Repeal of all previous election guidance and freezing the issuance of new guidance pending full reorganization.  Require the executive director to face confirmation from the State Senate.  Prohibit re-hiring of any staff members that participated in the issuance of any formal guidance that failed to comply with existing law, as has been determined by the Legislative Audit Bureau. Clearly, at that time, Michels was calling for keeping the commission and implementing reform measures, not calling for its elimination.  Two weeks later, Michels reversed his stance and joined other Republicans in calling for the abolition of the WEC. Michels’ position shift came days after he and other candidates for governor addressed delegates at a state Republican convention who called for discarding the agency.  ""While this evolution may be uncommon in politics, I'm not a politician,"" he said in a statement reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""I've come to the conclusion the WEC is not salvageable. To have non-elected officials overseeing the administration of elections has proven to be fundamentally flawed."" The Trump endorsement came just days after that. On May 12, 2022, Michels released a blueprint calling for a plan to ""dramatically reform"" the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Two weeks later, after the state GOP convention and days before a Trump endorsement, he reversed course and joined other Republicans in calling for its abolition.  We consider this a complete change in position and rate it a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2022/jun/08/tim-michels/gop-gubernatorial-candidate-michels-changes-course/

""In Zimbabwe, people have started selling their toes for thousands of dollars due to (the) high cost of living,"" reads a May 31 Facebook post. The toes can bring in $20,000 to $40,000 ""depending on size,"" it said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

According to news reports from the BBC and Agence France-Presse, as well as multiple fact-checks, the claims that have gone viral apparently started as a joke, and a Zimbabwe government official denounced them as an attempt to harm the country’s image.  It’s not clear where the claims began, but AFP fact-checkers tied it to a May 30 tweet that said big toes were going for $40,000. A BBC report said the ""apparent ruse"" began with a ""tongue-in-cheek"" blog post saying the sales were going down at the Ximex Mall in Harare, the country’s capital city. Claims spread widely across Africa on social media, including a video showing a man supposedly getting his big toe cut off in exchange for a Range Rover. The video cuts away before the man’s toe is cut.  In Zimbabwe,people have started to sell their toes for thousands of dollars due to high cost of living.

BP oil executive mentioned in viral Facebook posts doesn’t exist
","Frustrated by high gas prices, Facebook users are sharing a lengthy message purportedly written by Brice Cromwell, a BP oil executive who claims to have 10 years of experience in the industry.  ""What everyone needs to understand is that the high gas prices are not because of some conflict overseas — prices were high well before that,"" the post reads. ""The prices are not high because our American supply simply vanished. The prices are high because the people who run our country have decided to import oil from another country instead of using our very own American made product.""   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A couple of things about this post show there’s something afoot. Usually, a message from a top company executive can be traced to a credible source and not just found in a message copied and pasted on Facebook. But even more striking is this: There is no executive named Brice Cromwell at BP.  PolitiFact searched the list of executives found on BP’s website and did not find anyone named Brice Cromwell. A Google search also did not turn up that name in connection with the company. ""We can confirm we do not currently have an employee with that name, and this text did not come from BP,"" said Megan Baldino, head of corporate communications for BP America.  In an initial search, we found that the message was shared more than 50 times on Facebook within the last week. By conducting a search on CrowdTangle, a social media search tool from Meta, the earliest version of this post we could find was shared in a Facebook group on March 8, 2022. It doesn’t include the name Brice Cromwell.  Beyond the attribution, there is an issue with the substance of the post. While it claims the Biden administration is responsible for high gas prices by allowing oil imports, the truth is that gas prices have little to do with the president, no matter who is in office.  We’ve reported previously that gas prices are largely caused by the global supply and demand of oil, in addition to international events and inflation. Also, prices are heavily influenced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls most of the world’s oil supply.  And while the Facebook post claims that low gas prices were the work of former President Donald Trump, the truth is that it was due largely to the COVID-19 pandemic, when people traveled far less and pushed down demand. At that time, the ​​U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the price of oil hit a record low of $9.12 per barrel. That translated to around $1.80 per gallon at American gas pumps. ""The price of oil has gone from below $10 a barrel, during depths of a pandemic, to about $120 a barrel right now,""  said Alan Gin, associate professor of economics at the University of San Diego. ""And so, you get the price of oil going up. That’s going to cause the price of gas then to be higher as well.""  Prices had started to increase as pandemic recovery slowly began. But the sharp uptick came when Russia invaded Ukraine, and in response, global nations cut back on importing Russian oil. Prices had spiked to a national average of $4.92 as of June 7, according to the American Automobile Association. Gin also highlighted another portion of the claim stating that the amount of oil in the U.S. hasn’t changed between 2016 and 2020. The post said using these reserves can supply the country’s needs and lower the price of gas. That’s not true, said Gin. He stated that in 2019-2020, the U.S. supply of oil shale, which is used to produce oil and gas, plummeted after producers first borrowed to increase production and then slashed their output due to decreased demand.  ""The price of oil was driven downwards as a result of the pandemic and the declining demand,"" he said. ""Basically, a lot of companies just went under.""    Facebook posts claimed to share a written message from a BP oil executive named Brice Cromwell. The text blames the Biden administration for high gas prices, stating that they’re due to America choosing to import oil from other countries. The text is phony — BP oil confirmed that no one named Brice Cromwell works for the company. In addition, the Facebook post has appeared as early as March without naming Cromwell.  Fluctuations in oil and gas prices are not caused by the president, no matter who is in office. Experts and data show that the rise and fall of gas prices is due to the global supply and demand, inflation and worldwide events.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!  ",/factchecks/2022/jun/07/facebook-posts/bp-oil-executive-mentioned-viral-facebook-posts-do/

Pro-Democrat group says 9 of the 10 poorest states are Republican
","Editor's note: On Jan. 12, 2014, we rated this statement as True. We decided to re-rate our item after considering an additional poverty ranking that incorporates factors such as housing costs from state to state. The original item can be found here.  The partisan blogosphere is filled with arguments over whether liberal or conservative policies are better for states. No matter what is proposed -- cutting the sales tax, raising the minimum wage, etc. -- someone can always come up with a state to cite as an example of why it's a good (or bad) idea. But we were struck by this claim posted by the pro-Democrat group Occupy Democrats on Facebook: ""If Republican economic policies are so great for America, how come 9 out of the 10 poorest states are Red states?"" We're not going to rule on the cause-and-effect question posed by the posting. Yet because Red states have a reputation for being more business-friendly, and because many argue that pro-business policies lead to better lives for everyone, we wondered whether the Occupy Democrats' claim was correct. When we emailed Occupy Democrats, founder Omar Rivero sent us links to several sources including a sortable Wikipedia table based on the 2010 U.S. Census, along with more recent data from the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. We also did our own search of the U.S. Census database. We’ll start with the standard definition of a Red state. At PolitiFact Rhode Island, we recognize that whether a state is Red or Blue can be a matter for debate. Our state is considered to be among the bluest of the Blue, yet it has had Democratic governors in only 20 of the last 50 years. Nonetheless, the color is typically defined by how a state votes in the presidential elections, so we're going to classify states by how they voted in the 2012 Obama-Romney race. It should be noted that there are different ways to measure poverty. Occupy Democrats says its claim is based on per-person income. We looked at that, along with median household income and median family income. By all three measures, 9 out of the 10 poorest states voted Republican in the last presidential election. (In fact, they voted Red in the last four elections.) According to the latest Census data, 9 of the 10 states with the lowest per-person income levels were Red: Mississippi, Arkansas, Idaho, West Virginia, Kentucky, Utah, Alabama, South Carolina and Oklahoma.   The Census data also show that 9 of the 10 states with the lowest median household income were Red: Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma. And 9 of the 10 states with the lowest median family income were Red: Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana and South Carolina. The only Blue state on each list: New Mexico. By the way, 9 of the 10 states with the highest per-person income voted Blue in the 2012 presidential race: Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia and Washington. The only Red state on the list: Alaska. It could also be argued that state-by-state costs of living should be taken into account when considering which states are poorest. Unfortunately, the federal government doesn't do its cost of living calculations by state. However, the Census Bureau's ""supplemental poverty measure"" tries to adjust for some of the geographical cost differences. So while, under the bureau's standard poverty measure nine of the 10 poorest states are Red, the latest Supplemental Poverty Measure changes that ranking significantly. Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee fall from the list, replaced by California (the poorest), Nevada, Florida, New York, and Hawaii, which were all Blue states in the 2012 race. (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas -- all Red states -- make the list either way.) The supplemental measurement adjusts for local variations in the cost of housing, which is not considered by the standard poverty measure, said Kathleen Short, an economist with the Census Bureau. But there's a twist. It also counts a family's government assistance -- such as food stamps, housing assistance and tax credits for the poor -- as income, further complicating the matter. Housing costs are the biggest factor that move states in the ranking, she said. In addition, states where a lot of poor people are getting government assistance may look less poor in the supplemental ranking. Ultimately, each measure of the poorest states has its drawbacks. But the supplemental poverty measure offers a reason to temper the evidence from traditional measures that demonstrate the statement to be True. For that reason, we rule the ""9 in 10"" claim Mostly True.

Ed Schultz: Obamacare is driving costs down
","As the country heads into the 2014 election, Republicans are ratcheting up -- to the extent it’s possible -- their attacks on Obamacare. But MSNBC host Ed Schultz is urging Democrats to stand tall. ""Democrats need to embrace Obamacare. Don't be afraid to run on it in the midterms,"" Schultz exhorted. ""Don't pay attention to the predictions, pay attention to the results, pay attention to the numbers, explain that in a town hall meeting, and they will be cheering Democrats."" Schultz said the facts are clear. Four years after the program began, it is working. ""Health insurance costs and medical care costs fell sharply in January, ding, ding, ding,"" Schultz crowed. ""For the first time in decades, we finally have this: Health care costs are going down because of Obamacare."" The claim that the Affordable Care Act is reducing health costs been made before. It’s been a year since PolitiFact looked into it so it seemed time for an update. And since Schultz mentioned health insurance and medical costs, we can pull back the curtain a bit on how the government tracks these changes. As Schultz spoke, a large chart behind him showed the declines he was talking about. It showed that by a measure called the price index, insurance prices fell 0.4 percent in January and health services dropped 0.1 percent. Technically, the full name of this yardstick is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, and the first thing to note is that a price index is not the same as the cost. We'll get into that in just a bit. Schultz got those numbers correct (they came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), but the analysts we reached told us you have to be careful focusing on any single month. A broader picture of the insurance price index shows a much bigger decline about a year ago followed by a steep rise. In short, the index fluctuates -- sometimes wildly, said Jim Dolmas, a senior research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who has written articles about price index measurement. ""Because these series do jump around, it’s a good idea to never put undue weight on any one month’s observation,"" Dolmas said. Here’s a look at what Dolmas is talking about. 
 Source: Goldman Sachs and Commerce Department, via Washington Post   As you can see, isolating any one month is problematic. But so is using the index to measure health care costs at all, we found. The health services index measures how much providers are paid, which includes what they get from patients and insurance companies. ""There are lots of pieces that go into the construction of these, and they don’t always match neatly with what consumers may see out-of-pocket,"" Dolmas told PunditFact. What other numbers show The fact is, determining the impact of Obamacare on health care costs is difficult, if not impossible, because enough data isn’t available. Some numbers, like the index, suggest a decrease. But others do not. Tim Dall, a health economist at the financial consulting firm IHS, pointed to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that adjusts for seasonal variations. The BLS figures show that overall medical inflation remained at a constant 0.2 percent for December, January and February. ""It’s a stretch to say that a blip in January shows that the Affordable Care Act is holding down costs,"" Dall said. ""It should drive down costs in the long term, (but) it will be years before we know the impact on health care use and cost."" Jack Rodgers, managing director of the Health Policy Economics Group at PricewaterhouseCoopers, a large accounting and financial consulting firm, confirmed that the price declines are real, but he said that doesn’t mean health costs have also gone down. ""Even if the price index reflects the appropriate average price, costs are probably growing,"" Rodgers said. ""Because more people are using services, and those who are using services are using more on average."" In fact, total monthly health care spending rose by 1.6 percent in January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Does this mean that the Affordable Care Act has had no effect? No, but teasing out those impacts today has proven difficult. Analysts need to separate Obamacare from the other factors that have been working on the health care industry. The view among most researchers is that the sluggish economy has played the largest role. ""About three-quarters of the recent decline in health spending growth can be explained by changes in the broader economy,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent Washington-based research group, concluded last year. One of the problems in the debate over the effect of the Affordable Care Act is that it takes a while for the data to appear. The latest report on health spending from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services describes what happened through 2012. It found that health care spending rose by 3.7 percent. On the plus side, that was the fourth year in a row that the growth rate stayed low and health care’s share of the economy dropped a hair to 17.2 percent. We should note that health care analysts think the new health care system could reduce costs in the long run. They credit Obamacare with moving hospitals and doctors away from frequent use of expensive specialists and toward a system that rewards improved outcomes at reduced costs. Smaller increases in Medicare payments to providers that are part of the law could be holding prices in check. But the consensus is that more durable proof of the law’s impact is yet to come. Our ruling Schultz said health care costs are going down due to Obamacare. Government data show decreases in January for the price of health insurance and health services. However, those measures can bounce around and if Schultz had looked a few months further back, he would have seen even steeper declines, followed by later increases. Plus, a drop in a price index doesn’t always translate into a lower price for the customer. Most analysts judge health care costs not by prices but overall spending. By that measure, costs continue to rise, albeit slowly. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on containing the cost of health care remains largely unproven. Schultz had some accurate numbers on prices but he was too quick to treat those as changes in costs and the role of the Affordable Care Act is sketchy for the time being. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/28/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-obamacare-driving-costs-down/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Janet Adkins']","
Florida has been teaching Common Core since 2010, says Janet Adkins
","For months leading up to Florida’s state legislative session, parents and educators criticized the state’s school grading formula as being too complex. State Education Commissioner Pam Stewart recommended some changes to school grading in February. Her recommendations led to House Bill 7117, which makes multiple changes to school grades. The bill simplifies the calculation of grades for schools by eliminating extraneous categories and focusing on student performance, including graduation and eligibility for college credit. The bill also ensures that alternative schools focus on learning gains and allows districts to adopt their own assessments for certain subjects such as band or art. The bill would allow for a one-year transition to new grades, which means schools still get grades but would not be penalized for poor performance. Some educators have called for a longer transition period, and that debate was reflected in the House Education Appropriations Subcommittee’s March 24 meeting. The subcommittee approved the bill 11-2. During the hearing, a couple of legislators questioned why the transition would only be one year. Bill sponsor state Rep. Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, responded: ""These standards have been taught in Florida schools since 2010, so the only thing that is changing is the assessment,"" Adkins said. Later in the hearing she continued: ""Again, remember that these standards have been taught in our schools since 2010. If we had just started on these standards last year, then I might be able to agree with you. But the fact that we have been teaching these standards in Florida schools since 2010 tells me that our students should be prepared for this assessment."" During the hearing, Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association, pushed back against Adkins’ comments and said that the state hadn’t yet fully implemented the standards. Has Florida been teaching Common Core standards since 2010? Phasing in Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, including Florida. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. As states moved toward implementation, Common Core has become a focus of attacks by opponents.   Back in June 2010, Florida adopted the standards but didn’t start requiring schools to phase in Common Core until 2011-12. During that first year, the standards were fully implemented only for kindergarten. Certain standards were implemented in other grades, including standards that related to understanding texts in all grades and literacy standards in History/Social Studies, Science, and technical subjects in grades 6-12. This year, Florida is fully implementing Common Core in grades K-2 while other students are learning a blend of the existing Next Generation Sunshine State Standards and Common Core standards. The Common Core standards will be fully implemented and assessed in 2014-15. We should note that the state Board of Education tweaked the benchmarks earlier this year and renamed them the Florida Standards. But they are substantially similar to the Common Core. School districts had the option to implement standards earlier than the state’s timeline, which means they could have started as early as 2010, said Tiffany Cowie, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education. However, the department didn’t have data on how many districts implemented standards ahead of schedule. In response to Adkins’ comments at the hearing, the Florida Education Association distributed a letter to House members about the implementation timeline of Common Core. The letter states that the standards were approved by then Education Commissioner Eric Smith in June 2010 and the state Board of Education adopted standards in language arts and math in July 2010. An implementation plan wasn’t published by the state Department of Education until the spring of 2011. ""Full implementation of the Florida standards from K-12 has not yet occurred,"" Ford wrote. We sent the state’s timeline to a spokesman for Adkins and asked if the representative had any evidence that Florida has been teaching the standards since 2010. In an email through a spokeswoman, Adkins admitted she was wrong about the year that implementation started and reiterated her support for a transition year for the schools. Our ruling While defending a bill that sets new rules about school grades, Adkins said, ""We have been teaching these (Common Core) standards in Florida schools since 2010."" The state adopted the standards in 2010 but didn’t start phasing them in until the 2011-12 school year. In the first year, Common Core was only fully implemented in kindergarten and partially implemented in other grades. Though the state Education Department said districts could have started teaching the standards as early as 2010, the state had no data to show that any did.

","Kesha Rogers of Houston, whom we’ve described as a Lyndon LaRouche Democrat, isn’t even a Democrat, according to the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. Gilberto Hinojosa said in a Feb. 25, 2014, email blast, ""Kesha Rogers is one of the candidates on the ballot for U.S. senator in the Democratic primary -- but do not be fooled. Kesha Rogers is not a Democrat."" In the email, Hinojosa pointed out that Rogers favors the impeachment of President Barack Obama. He also said she has ""paraded around Texas with a poster of the president with a Hitler mustache. Rogers believes that the U.S. economy is secretly controlled by London financial institutions,"" Hinojosa wrote, ""and she has advocated for colonizing Mars,"" charges the party told us came from Rogers’ campaign website and a Dec. 6, 2013, news blog post by the Dallas Morning News. ""That’s not what real Democrats stand for,"" Hinojosa wrote. Rogers subsequently placed second to Dallas investor David Alameel in the party’s March 4 primary. She garnered 110,160 votes, or 22 percent of the vote, behind Alameel’s 238,618 votes, or 47 percent. The winner of their May 27, 2014, runoff stands to face Republican Sen. John Cornyn in November. A Rogers adviser, Harley Schlanger, the Western States spokesman for the Lyndon LaRouche PAC, urged us to check Hinojosa’s not-a-Democrat declaration, pointing out that thrice before Rogers has run as a Democrat for a Texas post. The state party has been emphatic about LaRouche Democrats not being mainstream. An example of that: In a March 19, 2014, commentary, LaRouche--a longstanding conspiracy theorist and former presidential candidate--called Obama a lackey for the queen of England intent on global thermonuclear warfare. LaRouche also speculated about Obama’s imprisonment or suicide. Party resolved not to help her Asked for Hinojosa’s back-up evidence, party spokesman Emmanuel Garcia shared a web link to a party-written ""fact check"" stressing reasons not to consider Rogers a valid Democrat, led by her desire to see Obama impeached. The document includes a resolution approved in December 2013 by its governing body, the State Democratic Executive Committee, stating that party members, officers and candidates are neither required nor encouraged to support the candidacy of any person self-identifying in alignment with the LaRouche movement or LaRouche himself, though they are free to ""relate to, describe and interact with any such candidates or campaigns as they individually deem."" The resolution closes by stating the party ""will have no relationship with the campaign of any person identifying him or herself as aligned with the LaRouche Movement or Lyndon LaRouche; no such campaigns will have access to party materials or data, no listing on the party website and no position of privilege, recognition, or credentialing at party meetings or conventions."" Rogers' past candidacies Texas Democrats twice nominated Rogers as the party's candidate to represent the Houston-area 22nd Congressional District and Rogers previously ran for state party chair. In 2010, Rogers carried 53 percent of the primary vote to capture the Democratic nomination for the House seat representing CD 22, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office, and she won the party’s 2012 nod to represent the district by carrying 51 percent of the primary vote, defeating the other hopeful. At the 2006 Democratic state convention, Rogers finished last among candidates for party chair, attracting 98 delegate votes, or 1.5 percent, according to a June 11, 2006, blog post by the pro-Democratic Burnt Orange Report. So, Rogers is making her fourth run for a post as a Democrat. We turned next to Texas laws touching on party identification. 'Affiliating' with a Texas party Unlike in many states, Texans do not commit to a partisan or independent affiliation when they register to vote. But state law includes language about affiliating with a party. According to chapter 162 of the Texas Election Code, a ""person becomes affiliated with a political party when the person: (1)  is accepted to vote in the party's primary election; or (2) applies for and is provided an early voting or limited primary ballot to be voted by mail."" Also, according to the law, a person affiliates by taking an oath at a precinct convention or a person may affiliate by taking an oath at any time, the law says, while an affiliation expires after the end of an election year or at the start of a subsequent election year, whichever comes first. Rogers' voting history This leads us to a traditional though crude way of gauging a Texan’s lean: their history of voting (or not) in party primaries. Any registered voter can vote in any primary (though they can't switch to the other party's runoffs). Still, as we wrote in a 2010 fact check, voting in a primary doesn't always mean a person sees himself as belonging to that party. Most voters abstain from primaries. To our query, Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin, citing data he jointly owns with the party, said Rogers voted in Harris County in the 2002 through 2008 Democratic primaries and November general elections. He said Rogers voted in the county’s 2014 Democratic primary after voting in Fort Bend County in the 2010 and 2012 Democratic primaries and general elections. He said the records show no instances of Rogers voting in a Republican primary. For her part, Rogers told us she's been a life-long Democrat. ""I’m a Democrat because I represent the true traditions of the Democratic Party,"" Rogers said by phone. ""I don’t represent the Wall Street leg of the Democratic Party, which has now taken control."" Expert observers Finally, we asked close observers of Texas politics including Mark Jones, an oft-quoted Rice University political scientist, to weigh in. By email, Jones said that it’s inaccurate to say Rogers isn’t a Democrat. ""While Kesha Rogers without question holds positions on many issues that are sharply at odds with those of most Democrats,"" Jones wrote, ""she has the right to profess to be a Democrat and run for public office as a Democrat... In the United States in general, and in Texas in particular, anyone can claim to be a Democrat or Republican and compete in that party's primary,"" Jones said, ""even if they hold positions that are anathema to an overwhelming majority of people that identify with and support the party. ""Thus, just as Louisiana Republicans two dozen years ago could not prevent former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke from publicly identifying himself as a Republican and running for office as a Republican,"" Jones said, ""Texas Democrats cannot prevent Kesha Rogers from publicly identifying as a Democrat and running in the Democratic primary."" Jones added: ""While she is clearly in a fringe faction within the Democratic Party, a faction with longstanding roots in the party whose views on many (though not all) major issues are clearly far outside of the Democratic mainstream, her self-identification and political participation are consistently Democratic."" Austin lawyer Buck Wood, an expert on election law, said by phone that Hinojosa must have meant Rogers isn’t a genuine Democrat, which the party has often said. (Separately, party spokesman Garcia said Hinojosa wasn't backing off his reference to Rogers as not a Democrat.) Rogers’ filing as a candidate and voting in the 2014 party primary makes her a Democrat, legally speaking, Wood said. Ed Sills, spokesman for the Alameel-backing Texas AFL-CIO, suggested Hinojosa has a case. By email, Sills said the ""totality of one’s beliefs, platform and behavior need to be considered in evaluating whether someone is really part of a political party or not."" He likened Rogers to the late Gene Kelly, a San Antonio-area resident who repeatedly sought party nominations (sometimes successfully) without showing signs of wanting to help the Democratic ticket. On her campaign website, Sills said, Rogers doesn’t refer to herself solely as a Democrat, instead saying ""LaRouche Democrat."" But we noticed her site also includes positive references to John F. Kennedy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and other Democratic heroes. Rogers says on the site: ""Texas already has a tradition of FDR-JFK Democrats fighting for the forgotten man, against Wall Street, including: Barbara Jordan, Wright Patman, Henry B. Gonzalez, Jim Wright, and Ralph Yarborough,"" referring to influential U.S. House members through history and the late liberal senator. Our ruling Hinojosa said Rogers isn’t a Democrat. We don’t see how to factually reconcile this statement, tied to disagreement with Rogers’ anti-Obama views, with Rogers twice winning primaries to become the party’s nominee for a House seat. Under state law, too, a voter affiliates with a party by voting in its primary, which Rogers has done repeatedly. We rate this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Georgia', 'Medicaid', 'Edward Lindsey']","
Lawmaker's claim on Medicaid fraud recovery correct
","The state has been going after people who commit Medicaid fraud, and it has been paying off, according to Edward Lindsey, an Atlanta state lawmaker, lawyer and 11th District congressional candidate. ""Since the implementation of the original Medicaid False Claims Act, which I sponsored in 2007, Georgia has recovered more than $60 million in the last three years alone,"" Lindsey, a Republican, said in a press release issued March 20.   Reports of fraud in government contracts have been widely circulated, well documented and long concerning. The first False Claims Act, also dubbed the ""Lincoln law,"" was enacted during the Civil War to combat fraud by companies selling supplies to the Union Army. Today, Georgia and other states have their own False Claims acts, targeting Medicaid fraud. These laws allow states to take civil action against people who swindle money from Medicaid, the state-federal program that covers health care costs for millions of low-income families, the disabled, children and the elderly. But has the state recouped more than $60 million in three years as Lindsey claims? We decided a truth test was in order. Medicaid fraud can take many forms, but commonly involves billing for services or medications that aren’t provided or aren’t needed. Overbilling and double billing are other common tactics. Big money is at stake. Georgia’s Medicaid program doled out about $9.4 billion in the 2013 state fiscal year. At the state Department of Community Health, which runs the Georgia Medicaid program, officials estimate that $52.2 million was reclaimed through civil proceedings between July 1, 2010, and Feb. 17, 2014. That’s shy of Lindsey’s forecasts, but it’s also not the full picture. Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens’ office has gone after Medicaid fraud, both civilly and criminally. In three years, his office has recouped $159.4 million for both the state and federal government, according to data submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General. Most of that money -- including the $52.2 million counted by DCH -- was reclaimed using the Medicaid False Claims Act, according to Olens’ office. Lindsey said he opted for a conservative estimate, based largely on the DCH data. ""It appears I understated our success,"" he said. Lindsey brought the topic of Medicaid fraud before lawmakers during the recent General Assembly because of a looming deadline. The state’s Medicaid False Claims Act, which Lindsey sponsored in 2007, had to be amended to comply with new federal regulations. Those amendments, which were approved by lawmakers in Lindsey’s House Bill 973, have to be signed into law by April 15. Otherwise, Georgia could lose what’s effectively a 10 percent bonus for recovering fraudulently lost federal funds. In the last three years, that 10 percent brought $11.6 million to the state, according to DCH data. How much fraud is being perpetrated here and across the nation is a topic for debate. What’s generally considered the most credible look at the issue came from the respected Institute of Medicine in 2012. The institute’s analysis of 2009 data found that the nation spends $2.6 trillion each year on health care -- including Medicaid and Medicare -- and likely loses $75 billion a year to fraud. Our conclusion: Georgia has submitted documentation to the feds that it has recovered $159.4 million lost to Medicaid fraud in three years in both federal and state money. Lindsey was very conservative in saying the amount recouped was ""more than $60 million."" We rate Lindsey’s statement True.

Does Mitch McConnell receive more money from lobbyists than any other member of Congress?
","Republicans are hopeful they can win enough Senate seats in November to take control of the chamber, which puts Sen. Mitch McConnell in the driver’s seat to become majority leader next year. But first, the Kentucky Republican needs to get through a tough re-election campaign. Both Republican primary challenger Matt Bevin and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have sought to paint McConnell as a Washington insider after three decades in the Senate. Along those lines, in an email to her supporters on March 17, 2014, Lundergan Grimes claimed that McConnell is ""the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle."" There’s going to be a lot of mudslinging in this race and a lot of claims about who is raising money from whom and where. We thought we would start by checking whether McConnell is getting more contributions from lobbyists than anyone in Congress. Campaigns and candidates use ""lobbyists"" like a dirty word, but you may be asking, ""what exactly is a lobbyist?"" Glad you asked. Lobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue. They are brought in by many different industries, from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil, to associations representing local governments, to nonprofits focused on hot-button legislation. Some organizations have in-house lobbyists, and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics. We first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers. They linked us to a report by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics. The report, titled ""Sincere or Strategic, Lobbyists Give Big,"" looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists. If a company or organization spends a certain amount of money lobbying Congress, they’re required to register with the federal government. Open Secrets checks this database against the campaign finance disclosure reports that candidates file. Open Secrets found that the 25 lobbyists who have contributed the most money to campaigns this cycle have already donated $1.9 million. Contributions are not party exclusive; five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans, 11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both. Open Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle (since the start of 2013). With $281,301 in contributions from lobbyists, McConnell topped the list, followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at $278,380. McConnell has also received another $50,000 from family members of lobbyists. Here’s the top 10: Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) $281,301 Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) $278,380 Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) $221,450 Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) $204,400 Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) $194,300 Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) $160,300 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) $129,433 Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) $123,733 Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) $121,750 Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) $121,486   As you can see, it’s a hodgepodge of Democrats and Republicans rounding out the list, but the two most powerful Republicans in Congress lead the way, by quite a bit. This list doesn’t count the Massachusetts special election race in 2013 to replace Secretary of State John Kerry, won by Democrat Ed Markey. Markey raised about $306,000 from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re-election race, so he technically leads the cycle. A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement, the organization had not yet updated their website with Markey’s contributions. Markey's situation, though, is a quirky anomaly, because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle. McConnell isn’t just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists. According to his Open Secrets profile, he has also received more money than any other lawmaker since 2013 from a number of industries. He’s No. 1 in campaign donations from people who work in the fields of — deep breath here — agriculture services, air transportation, auto dealers and manufacturers, building materials, business associations, coal mining, commercial banks, commercial TV and radio stations, electric utilities, food and beverage, food stores, general contractors, health services, home builders, insurance, medical devices and supplies, mining, mortgage bankers and brokers, pharmaceutical and health products, railroads, retirees, steel production and trucking. When he last ran for re-election in 2008, McConnell, who was minority leader at the time, topped the list in two industries, coal mining and tobacco. He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists. It’s worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re-election, he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well. With $947,000 in donations from lobbyists, Reid received nearly $300,000 more from lobbyists than the next closest lawmaker. So it’s not uncommon for party leaders to receive significant financial backing during their re-election fights. For her part, Lundergan Grimes has received $54,699 from lobbyists, 51st among candidates running in 2014. Our ruling Lundergan Grimes said McConnell is ""the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle."" Based on the analysis from Open Secrets, McConnell tops the chart for 2014. That’s probably a perk of his party position more than anything. As noted, Speaker Boehner is right behind him and Reid was the No. 1 recipient during his 2010 campaign. But that doesn’t change the accuracy of the claim. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/27/alison-lundergan-grimes/does-mitch-mcconnell-receive-more-money-lobbyists-/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist says 'Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion'
","Both Charlie Crist and Rick Scott will have gubernatorial records to fuel the campaign fire this year. The attacks have already started, with Crist firing a shot about Scott’s budget actions over the years. On a page titled ""Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free,"" Crist brings up education spending as No. 1. ""Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion,"" the site says. ""To put that into perspective, $3.3 billion could pay the yearly salaries of more than 70,000 teachers in Florida."" Considering Scott came into office during the Great Recession, his budget cutting is well known. We thought we’d dive into the numbers to see whether he proposed that the state’s schools take a $3.3 billion hit. Slash and learn Scott entered office in 2011, facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the state’s $70.5 billion budget. His solution in February 2011 was to propose cutting $4.6 billion in spending and $2.4 billion in state revenue by reducing taxes, regulations and fees. His budget came in at $65.9 billion. His proposal, encompassing two fiscal years, recommended cutting per-pupil spending by about $700, a 10 percent reduction from the state’s current $6,899 spending per student at the time. Part of the cuts included a 10 percent cut in the required local effort portion of property taxes and a loss of more than $870 million in federal stimulus money. In all, that added up to a projected $4.8 billion in cuts to education over the two years. The Scott plan attempted to offset some of those cuts with other federal aid and by requiring teachers to contribute 5 percent to their pension plans, adding back about $400 per student. We’ve broken down some of those dollar figures before. In all, funding would have been cut some $3.3 billion the first year. Legislators did not respond well to such a drastic proposed budget reduction for schools. ""Are we looking at the cuts the governor is making? The answer is no, a resounding no,"" PreK-12 Education Appropriations subcommittee chairman Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, told the Gainesville Sun. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed and Scott signed a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education, from $18.2 billion to $16.5 billion. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, a 7.9 percent cut in funding. The following year, Scott requested a $1 billion increase in education dollars, which was included in the 2012-2013 state budget. The increase was needed to make up for more than 30,000 new students and a decline in property taxes from a 3 percent drop in property values. He then requested $1.2 billion more in 2013; the Legislature agreed to $1 billion. This year he has asked Tallahassee for $542 million more for next year, bringing the totals to $10.6 billion in state cash and $18.8 billion overall. This would be a record amount of spending in terms of dollars, but still less than the amount being spent per student when he took office. The ruling Crist said ""Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion,"" pointing to a budget proposal from 2011, Scott’s first year in office. Scott did propose cutting $3.3 billion from the education budget, alienating members of his own party in the Legislature in the process. He even had suggested cutting $4.8 billion over two years. Part of the cuts were from the loss of federal stimulus dollars, but the state had the power to restore them had it chosen to.  In the end, Tallahassee approved $1.3 billion in cuts. Scott has asked for increases in the three years since. Crist’s statement was specifically phrased, saying Scott ""tried"" to reduce school funding. That is accurate, but it’s important to note that Scott's initial proposal died in the Legislature, and funding has increased since that attempt. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/27/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-tried-slash-school-f/
"['New Hampshire', 'Bipartisanship', 'Voting Record', 'Scott Brown']","
Scott Brown says he was the most bipartisan senator
","Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown began his fledgling campaign the same way he ended his last one: touting his bipartisan credentials. Brown, who served three years in the Senate before being ousted by Massachusetts voters in 2012, formed an exploratory committee in March 2014 to consider a run against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. Brown embarked on a listening tour soon after, and during a visit to Portsmouth, a familiar claim of bipartisanship resurfaced. ""I was the most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate,"" Brown said, according to a report published in The Portsmouth Herald. ""I voted 50-50. So I worked with everybody. And here's the problem, I was the most bipartisan senator."" Brown made the exact same claim during a visit to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Nashua on April 4, 2013, where he added, ""That’s, I think, what people want."" But does Brown really have the strongest record of bipartisanship? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to look into the question. Bipartisanship can be measured a number of ways, according to political analysts and researchers alike. Endorsements, group memberships and bill sponsorships can be telling about a lawmakers’ willingness to reach across the aisle. But measurements of party unity or opposition votes – that is, the rate at which a lawmaker sides with or against members of his or her own party – is the gold standard measure of bipartisanship, experts said. So, for the purposes of this check, we’ll stick to that. Brown pointed to four sources, including a ""Best and Worst"" list from Washington Magazine labelling him as the ""Least Partisan"" senator of 2012. Brown also cited research from Congressional Quarterly Roll Call, which he said deemed him the country’s second most bipartisan senator in 2011. Each year, Congressional Quarterly prints a report detailing senators’ party unity and opposition votes, defined as votes cast either with or against a majority from their party. According to the data, Brown, who took office in February 2010, sided with a Democratic majority on 22 percent of votes in his first year, ranking him seventh among all senators. The next year, he voted with Democrats 46 percent of the time, trailing only Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. In 2012, he rose to the top of the list, siding with a Democratic majority close to 62 percent of the time, according to the annual report, which was printed in the January 21, 2013 issue of CQ Weekly. In recent years, Congressional Quarterly has been joined by other media vote-counters. As part of their Congress Votes Database, Washington Post researchers track votes using a similar methodology, looking at votes in which a majority of senators took a side on an issue. The numbers differed slightly, but the Post researchers came to a similar conclusion after analyzing Brown’s voting records. Over his final two years in the Senate, Brown’s cooperation with Democrats increased. He and Collins were in a virtual dead-heat, differing with the Republican party more frequently than other Senators in 2011 and 2012, according to the Washington Post list. Meanwhile, Bloomberg Government, a subsidiary of the media service that focuses on government information, studied unity votes as well, excluding some types of votes such as nominations and treaty votes. This research, covering Brown’s final two years in office, showed he voted with a Democratic majority 53 percent of the time. Several media outlets reported this figure as being second highest in the country, trailing only Collins. Collins and Olympia Snowe, another Maine Republican who retired in 2012, are widely considered two of the nation’s most bipartisan senators. Ryan Kelly, a senior researcher at Congressional Quarterly, cautioned that in certain cases, party unity votes don’t necessarily reflect true bipartisan cooperation. But he said that for Brown, Collins and Snowe, the votes do signal bipartisan cooperation. ""Sens. Collins, Brown and Snowe -- they’re not extremists or anything. They probably broke to the side of their Democratic colleagues more often than people in the House, like the tea partiers,"" he said. Brown ""was more bipartisan than most of his colleagues,"" agreed Patrick Griffin, a professor of government at American University in Washington, D.C. ""It may have been a function of the state he represented and probably anticipating what kind of race he might have (for re-election in Massachusetts in 2012). But there’s no doubt he showed a willingness to reach across the aisle."" Our ruling Judging by votes alone, Brown was not always the most bipartisan senator during his time in office, but he was No. 1 for a time, and was close for the rest of the time. We rate Brown’s claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2014/mar/27/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-he-was-most-bipartisan-senator/

Did Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran spurn Katrina bridge-repair project to back 'Bridge to Nowhere'?
","Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran was first elected to Congress in 1972, and was elected to the Senate six years later. But at age 76, Cochran is facing stiff competition for another term from a primary opponent -- Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel. Cochran has long wielded influence as a senior appropriator, helping distribute federal dollars for projects back home. But McDaniel, a tea party favorite, is trying to turn that longtime asset against Cochran. In this quest, McDaniel is getting some support from low-tax, low-spending groups such as the Club for Growth. The club’s president, former Rep. Chris Chocola, R-Ind., recently penned an editorial in the Mississippi Conservative Daily supportive of McDaniel. One of Chocola’s claims caught our eye: ""Sen. Cochran loves the power of pork so much that he once voted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on probably the most famous pork project of all — the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska — instead of shifting the money to repair a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. That’s a fact."" Did a Gulf Coast lawmaker really spurn an urgent bridge-rebuilding effort in his own region for a widely reviled project in Alaska? We were suspicious, so we decided to take a look. The ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a derisive nickname for a nearly $233 million bridge that would have connected the tiny Alaska city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project became a national symbol of wasteful earmark spending back in 2003, until lawmakers ultimately killed it. Our friends at FactCheck.org put together a nice timeline of the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" saga when it became an issue in the 2008 presidential race. One of the episodes they included was a Senate debate in October 2005 -- shortly after Katrina hit, but a few years before the project was decisively shuttered. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment to a transportation appropriations bill to strip funds earmarked for the Gravina bridge (and another Alaska bridge known as Knik Arm) and send them instead to Louisiana to rebuild the I-10 Twin Span bridge, which had sustained major damage from Katrina. Republican Sen. Ted Stevens -- who was both an Alaskan and a top Senate appropriator -- threatened to quit if the amendment passed, vowing, ""I will be taken out of here on a stretcher."" ""I will put the Senate on notice — and I don't kid people — if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state, to take money only from our state, I'll resign from this body,"" Stevens said. ""This is not the Senate I came to. This is not the Senate I've devoted 37 years to, if one senator can decide he'll take all the money from one state to solve a problem of another."" Ultimately, Stevens prevailed, as the amendment failed by an overwhelming 15-82 margin, with Cochran voting against the amendment. Instead, the Senate soon voted to strip the bridge funding and give it instead to the Alaska Department of Transportation to be used as the department saw fit, either to build the two controversial bridges or for some other transportation purpose. That bill passed 93-1, with Cochran voting for the bill. The vote was widely seen as a way of upholding the traditional way of handling appropriations and lawmaker-backed projects. ""Certainly all the appropriators banded together, along with most other members,"" said Steve Ellis, a vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that supported Coburn’s amendment. ""I don’t think Cochran was afraid of Stevens. But philosophically, he agreed."" Still, we’ll offer a bit of additional context. The effort to rebuild the I-10 Twin Span didn’t simply die after Coburn’s amendment was voted down. If anything, it was fast-tracked, and Cochran played a role in that. In December 2005, Congress passed the final version of the defense appropriations bill that included $629 million for the Louisiana bridge. ""He fought that fight for months before the bill was finally signed into law,"" said Chris Gallegos, a spokesman for Cochran. A few months later, in April 2006, Time magazine ran a story crediting Cochran’s efforts at securing Katrina-related funding. ""When the Louisiana congressional delegation publicly demanded a staggering $250 billion from the government to rebuild the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, the move completely backfired,"" the magazine wrote. ""It angered GOP conservatives, who then spent the next two months pushing for cuts in the budget and ignoring Louisiana and Mississippi. But then Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran got tough on behalf of his state. In a closed-door meeting last December, several Republican senators were talking about how to pass quickly a key bill that would provide money for the Defense Department so lawmakers could head home for the holidays. Cochran simply announced that ‘this bill won't pass’ unless it includes money for the Gulf Coast. ... ""On Katrina, Cochran, along with other Gulf Coast lawmakers, created a detailed list of the region's essential needs that totaled about $35 billion. He then had dozens of meetings with other lawmakers, emphasizing how badly the region needed the money but never publicly blasting Congress for moving too slowly. In the end, he got $29 billion out of his colleagues, almost double the money (President George W.) Bush and congressional leaders had initially pledged."" Construction on the new, 5.5-mile bridge, paid for in large part with Federal Highway Administration money, began on June 1, 2006. Building proceeded in several stages to allow traffic on the vital artery to continue flowing. The first structure was completed by April 7, 2010, and the second was finished by Sept. 8, 2011. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal inaugurated it by cutting a ribbon, allowing a 1940 Ford Tudor Deluxe, a 1971 Buick Regal, antique Chevrolets, a vintage fire truck and a Textron Marine & Land Systems armored car to cross from Slidell to New Orleans. Total price tag: $803 million, the most expensive single public works project in Louisiana history. Our ruling Chocola said Cochran ""voted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on ... the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska instead of shifting the money to repair a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina."" Cochran did vote that way on a specific amendment. But just a few weeks later, Cochran played a key role in securing funding for the I-10 Twin Span bridge. It's misleading to suggest that Cochran supported the Bridge to Nowhere but not the project that was in his own neighborhood.

Barbara Boxer says more than half of women use birth control to treat other conditions
","As the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Hobby Lobby case regarding the Affordable Care Act’s free birth control provision, there’s no shortage of discourse on abortions, emergency contraception and yes, even penis pumps. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., addressed her argument on the case by working Viagra into the conversation. She expressed frustration on MSNBC’s Jansing & Co. at what she sees as a hypocritical view of men’s and women’s health issues. ""I have never heard them put any type of moral objection, remember, this is a moral objection, to men getting Viagra, but they have a moral objection to women getting certain types of birth control,"" Boxer said. Hobby Lobby argued that requiring employers to offer health coverage that includes emergency contraception violates religious freedom. They oppose contraception they believe is equivalent to inducing abortion, such as morning-after pills and IUDs. Boxer continued pushing back against that position. ""I view this as very much an anti-woman position to take,"" Boxer said. ""And it’s important to note that women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions, so it is an attack on women."" PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at the different reasons women use birth control. Boxer’s folks pointed us to a November 2011 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights. They focused specifically on the birth control pill, not all contraception. Here’s what they found: Out of the more than 7,354 women surveyed, 58 percent of pill users cited at least one noncontraceptive reason for taking it. That includes managing menstrual pain, period regulation and acne. That’s where Boxer’s ""more than half"" claim comes from. Many of the women in this category also take the pill to prevent pregnancy. But just 14 percent of pill users said they only took the pill for noncontraceptive reasons. Guttmacher senior associate Rachel Jones, the author of that report, said the use of birth control pills among adolescents is even more pronounced. Out of 15- to 19-year-olds, 33 percent took the pill only for noncontraceptive reasons, more than double the percentage of the general population. Adolescent women are especially prone to irregular and painful menstruation cycles, Jones said. Our ruling Boxer said more than half of women use birth control  ""as a medication for other conditions."" She was referring specifically to the pill. Guttmacher says 58 percent of women on the pill take it for noncontraceptive reasons. But that number drops to 14 percent if you look at women who take the pill only for noncontraceptive reasons. Her claim is based in fact, but requires additional clarification about the type of birth control and the survey results.

Are most Obamacare sign-ups people who had insurance before?
","If Obamacare was about anything, it was about getting more people insured. The law never promised to eliminate the uninsured altogether, but the Obama White House did say 32 million people would gain coverage, out of about 48 million who didn’t have it. With the sign-up window for 2014 about to close, Rich Lowry, editor in chief of the conservative news magazine National Review, gave a somber assessment of how the program is doing. ""The law is not going to collapse on its own weight, which seemed a real possibility when the launch was so botched, but I think it’s still pretty grim,"" Lowry said on Meet the Press. ""If you believe the surveys of people who have signed up through these exchanges, most of them already had insurance, which suggests what you have basically done is a churn where you’ve knocked people off their old insurance and then gotten them on the exchanges. There’s not much upside to that."" When Lowry mentioned ""exchanges"" he was talking about the federal and state systems, from websites to hotlines, aimed at getting people covered. If most of those folks were just changing plans, that would raise a pretty fundamental problem. We are checking whether surveys show that most of the people signing up through the Obamacare exchanges, now called marketplaces, already had insurance. Lowry pointed us to a report from McKinsey and Company, a large private consulting group. In early March, McKinsey released the results of a survey that found that of all the people who bought a new insurance policy, about a quarter of them said they hadn’t been insured for at least most of last year. That sounds like Lowry had it right. Three-quarters of the sign-ups were people who already had coverage. That would qualify as ""most people"" in anyone’s book. But there’s more to the survey. McKinsey analysts make it clear that their study was about the individual insurance market as a whole, not specifically Obamacare marketplaces. People are free to buy directly from insurance companies or through government marketplaces. Emily Hackel, a spokesperson for McKinsey, said analysts did not break down their results for people who specifically purchased insurance through Obamacare. ""If you’re looking to zero in on that, we don’t have that detail,"" Hackel said. It’s not like the report buries this distinction. In fact, it makes the point three times. In the first paragraph, it states that the survey ""included consumers who enrolled in health care coverage for 2014 (either on or off exchange)."" There is no way to know how many respondents fell into each group. So, the report Lowry cites doesn’t speak directly to his point. When we raised this problem to Lowry, he said the McKinsey numbers would hold up if relatively few people signed-up directly through insurers. Lowry referred us to a piece in Forbes that suggested that this group accounted for about 20 percent of enrollments. That wouldn’t be enough to significantly change the McKinsey findings, Lowry said. He also cited an item on the website of the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that has been critical of the Affordable Care Act. That article focused on an estimate of uninsured sign-ups from Goldman Sachs. However, that estimate was itself based on the McKinsey findings. One person Lowry referred to us to is Robert Laszewski, a health care policy consultant who has highlighted many of the failings of Obamacare. But when we spoke to Laszewski, he had a cautious take on interpreting the McKinsey data. ""The McKinsey survey suggests a high percentage had insurance before,"" Laszewski told PunditFact. ""But it is limited, and we don’t know."" So what’s the real number? That’s tough to say. Laszewski has spoken to some of the largest insurance carriers who are selling through the marketplaces. From that, he guesses that about half of the people buying there were previously insured. ""That’s what these carriers are telling me,"" Laszewski said. ""But that’s just anecdotal information."" That’s only an estimate, but ""about half"" is not ""most"". The federal agency charged with tracking what’s going on, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told us they don’t have this information yet. Individual states have released numbers but these also fall short. New York just reported that ""more than 70 percent of those who have enrolled to date were uninsured at the time of application."" But that mixes together those who signed up for Medicaid and those who bought private insurance. Kentucky’s Cabinet for Health and Family Services told PunditFact that 80 percent of the people who bought private insurance through their marketplace reported that they didn't have insurance. But spokesperson Jill Midkiff said the intake form does not ask how long they have been without coverage. It could have been as short as one day or as long as a year or more. Stephen Zuckerman is a health economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington academic center. He’s very interested in knowing if Obamacare has made a dent in the uninsured population. ""This is one of the big questions where there will need to be more stats available before we can say what the law has done,"" Zuckerman said. For what it’s worth, a March Gallup poll found the percentage of uninsured Americans has fallen by more than 2 percentage points since October 2013. This figure, too, is limited, because it does not prove that Obamacare is responsible. That said, the decline coincides with the launch of the marketplaces, and the greatest progress took place among households making less than $38,000 a year. Lowry’s framework on Obamacare had its own limitation. When asked how it was doing, he spoke only about the fraction of uninsured buying coverage through the exchanges. That leaves out the gains made through Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that in the short-run, about half of the progress toward getting people insured comes through opening Medicaid to the working poor by raising that program’s income limit. Christine Eibner, an economist at the Rand Corporation, said Medicaid needs to be part of any assessment. ""The main goal of the law was to expand insurance coverage, not necessarily to enroll people on the exchanges,"" Eibner said. ""Medicaid and (exchange) sign-ups are both important in assessing the ACA, since the law expanded coverage using both programs."" Beware of fuzzy language When you hear pundits and politicians talk about the success or failures of Obamacare, there are two factors that tend to cloud the debate. First, the expansion of Medicaid has a big impact on reducing the ranks of the uninsured. But it has proven to be very tough to tease out the people who gained Medicaid coverage thanks to the higher income limit by itself. Plenty of people who are signing up were eligible before. Second, some states that run their own exchanges, such as New York, California and Kentucky, have a ""no wrong door"" approach. That means, everyone enters through the same portal. As they fill in their personal information, those who are Medicaid eligible get sent down one path; people who make more money get directed toward private insurance. Those states tend to say everyone got covered through the exchange, but in terms of the Affordable Care Act, very different pieces of the law are in play. Our ruling Lowry said reports show that most of the people signing up through the Obamacare exchanges already had insurance. The McKinsey report he cited did not address his specific point. It examined the individual insurance market as a whole, regardless of how people found their insurance plans. While Lowry couched his claim with the caveat, ""if you believe the surveys,"" it doesn’t matter if you believe the McKinsey survey. The survey did not describe the performance of Obamacare. An analyst cited by Lowry confirmed this point. There are other data from other states that Lowry could have cited that would suggest a greater impact on the number of uninsured people. But that is also flawed. The fact is, we have no clear data and to say most of the people already had insurance sidesteps an information gap.

Barack Obama says high schoolers are graduating at an all-time high
","During his 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama warned Congress that the American education system was putting millions of students at a disadvantage in the 21st century job market. ""Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school."" But recently, a politician gave a speech in Orlando claiming the school system was on a roll. ""Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. Absolutely,"" the politician said. ""More young people are earning college degrees than ever before."" So who had the nerve to test the president’s assessment of the U.S.education system? The correct answer: Barack Obama. Yup, just three years after Obama used the high school graduation rate as a call to action, he’s now using it to proclaim the achievements of his administration. We gave Obama a Mostly True in 2011 when he claimed up to 25 percent of Americans drop out of high school. So how does his current statement, that the graduation rate is at a record high, stack up? Counting diplomas Tracking the number of Americans earning a high school diploma seems like a simple task, but it has proven to be a tough stat to track. The U.S. Education Department utilizes a stat called the Average Freshman Graduation Rate. It’s an estimate of the number of high school students who graduate on time in four years, and it’s used by looking at enrollment data from year to year. States and local school districts for years used various methods to determine the percentage of students who graduate high school. Maine in 2007 and 2008, for example, counted students who graduated from private schools with publicly funded tuition in their state tallies. The statistic mostly measures public school students, another major hole in the national data. As a result, national figures had flaws and year-to-year comparisons were difficult because so many schools count degrees differently. ""It does seem like dropout rates should be easily and unambiguously measured, but for a million reasons they’re not,"" said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. ""Until recently many schools have been pretty casual about record keeping,"" he said. ""At what point is a kid a dropout? When he doesn’t show up for a month? A semester? What if he moves to a different city and enrolls there and nobody tells the original school? Or a kid drops out at 15 and gets a GED at 19? All of these little things can turn out to be pretty significant."" More recently, the federal government has worked with states to get everyone on the same page with a new more vigorous statistic, the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate, that will create a uniform method for tracking high school graduation rates in public school students moving forward. ""Basically the feds have thrown their hands up in the air and said, ‘Let’s get it right from here on, and not worry about stuff in the past that we can’t fix,’ "" Bills said. What the numbers say Nevertheless, when we talked to experts, they still thought graduation rates were improving and they pointed to a number of markers. The White House sent us toward numbers from the National Center for Education Statistics at the Education Department, which put the graduation rate at 81 percent in 2011-12. The previous high was in 1969-70, when the graduation rate was 78.7 percent. Again, comparing stats collected in 2012 versus 1970 isn’t apples to apples, but it does show trend lines, said Jim Hull, senior policy analyst at the Center for Public Education. ""These are really just estimates, but you can get an accurate description of what’s going on,"" Hull said. ""It might not be 80 percent are graduating, but we know the trend is definitely going up, and it’s a lot more than in the 1990s."" Other methods for calculating graduation rates exist, and not all of them say recent years are the highest on record. Editorial Projects in Education, publishers of Education Week, put the graduation rate at 74.7 percent in 2009-10. ""That’s pretty good, by historical benchmarks and the rate has been moving up in recent years,"" said Christopher Swanson, vice president of research and development. But at 77.1 percent, 1969 remains the watermark in their calculations, he said. Despite differences in methodology and problems collecting consistent data, there is general agreement that high school diplomas are on the rise. ""All of (the measurements) show the same general trend toward a higher proportion of kids finishing high school,"" Bills said. Our ruling Obama said, ""Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record."" On paper, it’s an accurate claim using the federal government's metric, but that only accounts for public school students and states and local school districts collect the data differently, creating inconsistencies. We also found another trusted model that puts the high point at 1969. Still, the general sense in the education industry is that rates are on the rise and considerably higher than 20 or even 10 years ago. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. Correction, April 9, 2014: The initial version of this story incorrectly stated that the Education Department had changed how it calculated the Average Freshman Graduation Rate, citing a March 2013 press release. However, that release was referencing a different statistic, the Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate, which Obama was not referencing in his speech. The story has been adjusted to reflect this correction. This does not change our rating of Half True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-high-schoolers-are-graduating-al/

Talking about Keystone XL Pipeline, Jeb Bush: we have over 100 pipelines between U.S. and Canada
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush says the Keystone XL Pipeline is a ""no-brainer."" Bush took a question on the pipeline after a speech to the business and civic group Broward Workshop. AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson asked him this: ""Just as a symbol -- as a symbol -- would you have approved something like the Keystone Pipeline or would you have studied it for eight years?"" Bush responded: ""I read something that was quite interesting. There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now. Give me a break. What are we arguing about here?"" We’re not going to weigh in on the pros and cons of expanding the pipeline but we can fact-check whether there are already 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada. Keystone Pipeline Keystone XL is a proposed pipeline that would carry 830,000 barrels per day of diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Earlier in March, the U.S. State Department concluded the public comment period about the project. After six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters, the decision now lies with President Barack Obama. We sent Bush’s claim to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which referred us to an October 2013 Congressional Research Service report. The report stated that CRS ""has identified over 100 operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission facilities crossing the U.S.-Mexico or U.S.-Canada border."" A Bush spokesperson later referred us to this report as well. Bush had said there were over ""100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now,"" but the CRS report refers to operating and proposed facilities crossing the border with Canada or Mexico. With help from FERC and the Pipeline Safety Trust, a safety watchdog group, we counted the pipelines in the tables of the report and found 29 natural gas pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border and about 17 oil pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Philippe Reicher, a spokesman for the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, told PolitiFact that the National Energy Board, which regulates pipelines crossing the border between Canada and the United States, has indicated that they have approximately 80 pipelines crossing the border. ""That would include oil, gas, water, etc.,"" he wrote in an email. ""In terms of large transmission pipeline systems similar to the proposed Keystone XL, we are probably looking between 18 and 22."" Lorne Stockman, research director at Oil Change International, a group that opposes Keystone, pointed to a map from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which shows all the existing and proposed liquids pipelines crossing the border.   ""Some of these carry products rather than crude, and only a handful currently carry tar sands crude,"" Stockman told PolitiFact. ""Looks quite busy on this map, but I think we can all agree that  100 is a little overstated."" Our ruling Bush said, ""There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now."" Bush has a point that there are a number of major oil and gas pipelines that already cross the U.S.-Canada border. But his number is significantly off. A 2013 Congressional Research Service report referred to 100 pipelines, but that included operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission lines, and it counted pipelines crossing both the U.S.-Mexico border and the U.S.-Canada border. If we only count operating pipelines that cross the Canadian border, we count 29 natural gas pipelines and 17 oil pipelines, for a total of 46.

Florida's revenue 'is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country,' Jeb Bush says
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush waved off any talk of a 2016 presidential run at a meeting of Broward County business leaders on March 21, 2014. Instead, he spent a lot of time talking up Florida’s rebound from the Great Recession. Bush said Tallahassee had been hit hard in the last few years, but was making a comeback. ""The revenue of the state is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country, because our state has been fiscally well managed and we grew our way out of the hole,"" he told attendees at the Broward Workshop business breakfast in Davie. It’s probably fair to say the state has bounced back from the worst of the economic downturn, but is the revenue rate outpacing the rest of the country? We wanted to hold Bush accountable. Revenue reporting State revenues can include any number of sources -- property taxes, sales taxes, corporate income taxes, agency fees and even the Lottery. Florida doesn’t have a personal income tax, relying heavily on sales tax dollars. We asked Bush’s camp to elaborate on what the former governor meant when he made the claim, but they didn’t specify how he arrived at his conclusion. Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, suggested looking at general revenue numbers since 2008, when the effects of the recession really began to take hold nationwide. General revenue from a state’s own sources is a better way to account for budgeting, because unlike total revenue accounting, it’s not subject to federal aid or trust fund cash. The Institute used Census data to calculate total taxes and miscellaneous general revenue to determine how much each state brought in for fiscal year 2012, the last year with complete Census data. (Dadayan said the Census Bureau’s annual numbers are more reliable than quarterly data.) The institute found the state’s collections for taxes and other revenue were still 7 percent lower in 2012 (almost $48 billion) compared with 2008 (almost $51.6 billion), making Florida 15th out of 19 states that had not yet rebounded to pre-recession levels. ""The numbers don’t support the statement, if we look at the bigger picture, rather than the nominal growth in the most recent quarters,"" Dadayan said. If we were to look at total revenue in the same time period, Florida has risen dramatically from 2008 ($68.9 billion) to 2012 ($82.8 billion), about 20 percent. That increase is impressive until you compare it to a year earlier, when the state’s total revenue was $98.2 billion. That means Florida is down 15.7 percent since 2007. Many reports look at revenue in terms of total taxes, including income and sales taxes, by quarters, which gives us another option for examining the data. So what is the most recent quarterly growth rate, and how does it compare to the rest of the country? Between the first and second quarters of 2013, Florida had a 4.5 percent increase in total tax revenues, the Rockefeller Institute reported. That makes Florida 33rd in the nation for revenue growth. If we do that calculation as a year-over-year change from 2012 to 2013, the Institute said Florida had a 4 percent rate increase during the fourth quarter. In that measure, Florida is 17th among all states. The National Conference of State Legislatures focused on state general fund revenues in its report on State Budget Actions for the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years. That measure excluded intergovernmental funds and revenues dedicated to programs outside of the general fund, policy analyst Todd Haggerty said. The report found Florida’s revenue increased 5.9 percent from fiscal year 2012 to 2013. That made Florida 20th on the list. For fiscal year 2014, the NCSL estimated the state’s general fund growth rate at 4.5 percent, putting Florida in a tie for seventh place with Massachusetts. That’s a specific measure based on an estimate for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. So while there are other ways to parse numbers, there’s not much to support the claim, according to Nick Johnson, the vice president for state fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He said the 2014 estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, because every state reports its own estimates, and those estimates have different criteria. States also account for general funds differently. ""On the whole, I'd say Florida's revenue growth lately has been mediocre, certainly nothing to brag about,"" Johnson said. The ruling Bush said that ""the revenue of the state is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country."" A few reports compiled with data encompassing different kinds of revenue can be confusing, but all paint the same picture: Florida revenues are still down from pre-recession levels, and don’t generally reflect a growth rate consistent with what Bush is claiming, either annually or in recent quarters. There is one report that says 2014 general revenue is expected to grow at a rate in the top 10 of all states. That data is self-reported from the state, however, and is only an estimate. According to experts we talked to, the Sunshine State is lagging behind the rest of the nation when it comes to getting its revenues back to pre-recession levels.

Candidate worries about growing federal debt
","A congressional candidate recently offered some news that might make a child never want to grow up. ""A child born in America today will inherit $1.5 million in (federal) debt the moment they're placed in their mother's arms,"" John McCallum, a St. Simons Island resident who is running as a Republican for Congress, said in one campaign ad. ""For children like mine, it’s not the American Dream. It’s the American nightmare."" A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to dive deep into this costly claim and see whether McCallum’s numbers are on target. McCallum is running for the congressional seat currently held by Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah. Kingston is running for the U.S. Senate. McCallum once worked as a congressional aide for Newt Gingrich. McCallum was the GOP’s nominee for secretary of state in 1998 but lost that campaign to Cathy Cox. At first glance, McCallum’s figures seem way off. The U.S. Debt Clock, for example, says the debt per citizen is currently around $55,000. The current debt per taxpayer is slightly more than $150,000. So how did McCallum come up with this extremely higher estimate? A campaign official pointed us to the U.S. Senate Republican Committee on the Budget as the source of his claim. The committee’s website allows you to enter your birth date and it immediately computes your lifetime share of the national debt. For someone born on St. Patrick’s Day this year, the answer doesn’t seem lucky: $1,532,026. An official in the committee’s office sent us some information explaining how the estimate is calculated. A child born in 2014 is projected to have a life expectancy of 80. The committee used a population estimate of 598,933,000 for the United States in 80 years. Some estimates we’ve seen show estimates as high as 625 million by 2095. The total gross debt 80 years from now is assumed to be $917.58 trillion, for a lifetime share of debt at $1.532 million, if you use the committee’s population estimate. We checked how much the average debt would be if the U.S. population rose to 625 million by 2095. Our calculation was $1.47 million. McCallum’s estimate is based on a few assumptions. First, a child born today will live to 80. Second, the U.S. debt projection may change in 80 years, for better or worse. Third, the U.S. population may change in 80 years. It also assumes that Washington will not enact any legislation to meaningfully reduce the debt. Right now, there seems to be no viable legislative solution in sight. To sum up, McCallum said a child born today will inherit $1.5 million in federal debt. That’s about 10 times what the current debt is per taxpayer. McCallum’s claim is based on educated estimates of future projections that may change. With that caveat, we rate McCallum’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/26/john-mccallum/candidate-worries-about-growing-federal-debt/

Facebook meme claims Rand Paul and Marco Rubio have anti-science views on dinosaurs, earth's age
","A new Facebook meme paints two leading Republicans as anti-science because of their alleged views of the age of the Earth. The Facebook group Being Liberal posted a picture March 10, 2014, featuring side-by-side images of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., looking somewhat sheepish. Bolded text under the images describes the senators’ views on the age of the Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs. According to the meme, Rubio ""believes Earth (is) 9,000 years old,"" and ""humans hunted dinosaurs to extinction."" Paul, the image proclaims, says the Earth is 10,000 years old and believes ""God made dinosaurs disappear to make space for humans."" The post received about 5,500 likes and was shared more than 4,000 times. Upon seeing this, we couldn’t resist digging in and finding out just what these two senators believe about the age of the Earth and the demise of the dinosaurs. Rubio It seems the backing for the claim about Rubio comes from a November 2012 interview with GQ magazine, when Michael Hainey asked, ""How old do you think the Earth is?"" Rubio didn’t directly answer the question, instead saying, ""I'm not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians, and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States."" He later called the planet’s age ""one of the great mysteries."" The comment drew criticism around the Internet, sparking a string of opinion pieces from blogs and mainstream news organizations alike. Commentators specifically wondered about Rubio’s answer because of his position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Rubio clarified his answer in another interview, this time with Politico on Dec. 5, 2012. ""First of all, let me tell you about the answer I gave. The answer I gave was actually trying to make the same point the president made a few years ago, and that is there is no scientific debate on the age of the Earth. I mean, it’s established, pretty definitively. It’s 4 and a half… at least four and half billion years old. I was referring to a theological debate, which is a pretty healthy debate,"" Rubio said. So, Rubio didn’t actually peg the age of the Earth at 9,000 years in the GQ interview, and even gave the widely accepted scientific answer in the later interview with Politico. Paul We had to go all the way back to 2010 to find a statement from Paul about the age of the Earth. It turned out to be even more vague than Rubio’s answer to GQ.   In June 2010, Paul gave a speech at a Christian Homeschool Educators of Kentucky meeting, after which he took questions from the audience. One audience member asked the then-candidate for Senate, ""Was there a point in life that you became Christian that you recognized? And also, how old is the world?"" Paul joked at first, saying he was only taking ""easy questions,"" and then described the origins of his faith. He then said he would ""pass"" on the question concerning the age of the Earth. Other than that, Paul hasn’t made public comments on his opinions about when the Earth came to be. Our ruling  Being Liberal’s Facebook post claimed Rubio and Paul believe the Earth is 9,000 and 10,000 years old, respectively. While both men have made vague statements concerning their beliefs about the age of the Earth, neither has publicly cited the figures claimed in the post, and Rubio has even given the widely held scientific answer to the question. As for the senators’ views on the fate of the dinosaurs, we’ll take a page from Rubio’s playbook and call it one of the world’s great mysteries, because it doesn’t appear either has said anything in public regarding the issue. So there are no public statements to back up the Facebook post’s claim, and Rubio has even said the direct opposite. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/mar/25/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-claims-rand-paul-and-marco-rubio-hav/

Marco Rubio said Americans increasingly want health law repealed
","Many Republican legislators commemorated the fourth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act on March 23 by calling for its repeal. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke out against the law in a video message to his supporters. ""We cannot give up,"" he said. ""Obamacare is not something that’s set in stone. It can be repealed —and Americans increasingly want it to be repealed — and that’s what we’ll continue to do."" PolitiFact wanted to know if Rubio’s assessment of polling on the law is accurate. Do more and more people want the law repealed? We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s folks. Many major pollsters include a question about repeal in their periodic surveys. Reports from the nonpartisan RealClearPolitics and the conservative American Enterprise Institute, both institutions that cover politics, don’t match up with Rubio’s claim. These averages across polling platforms are useful, but they also draw from a small number of polls and combine results from a question each group asked in a slightly different way. RealClearPolitics shows that in December 2013, about 52.3 percent of the public favored repealing the law. Since 2011, that number hasn’t wavered much. RealClearPolitics arrived at these figures by averaging reports from Quinnipiac, Rasmussen, Fox and CNN surveys. American Enterprise Institute included a broader swath of polls in their analysis, which ended up making for a much lower aggregate. Senior fellow Karlyn Bowman said she’d peg the repeal rate at anywhere between 35 to 45 percent, depending on the poll. Although the numbers vary based on question wording and possible responses, the trends themselves don’t, experts said. The percentage of the country that wants to repeal Obamacare is sizable, but not growing. ""If you look poll to poll, it’s not clear that they’re rising dramatically, but it’s still a big number and something people should pay attention to,"" Bowman said. ""Repeal sounds radical, and we’re just not a very radical kind of people. We like to take the middle ground if possible."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""Americans increasingly want (Obamacare) to be repealed."" Depending on which polls you consult, anywhere from about 35 to 50 percent of the nation does want the law repealed. That’s not insignificant. But we take issue with his claim that as time goes on, more voters are calling for repeal. Experts say the percentage of voters who want Obamacare repealed is staying consistent within each poll. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-americans-increasingly-want-healt/
